            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHen a Roman Gentleman had, to please himself, written a book in Greek, and presented it to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>; he desir'd him to pardon the faults of his Expressions, since he wrote in Greek, which was a Tongue in which he was not perfect Master. <hi>Cato</hi> told him he had better then to have let it alone and written in Latin, by how much it is better not to commit a fault, than to make apologies. For if the thing be good, it needs not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd; if it be not good, a crude apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie will do nothing but confess the
<pb facs="tcp:100300:3"/>
fault, but never makes amends. I therefore make this Address to all who will concern themselves in reading this book, not to ask their pardon for my fault in doing of it; I know of none; for if I had known them I would have mended them before the Publication; and yet though I know not any, I do not question but much fault will be found by too many; I wish I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them no cause for their so doing. But I do not onely mean it in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Periods, (where every man that is not a Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> will at least do as <hi>Apollonius</hi> did to the Apparition that affrighted his company on the mountain <hi>Caucasus,</hi> he will revile and persecute me with evil words) but I mean it in the whole Design, and men will reasonably or capritiously
<pb facs="tcp:100300:3"/>
ask, Why any more Controversies? Why this over again? Why against the Papists, against whom so very many are already exasperated, that they cry out fiercely of Persecution? And why can they not be suffered to enjoy their share of peace, which hath returned in the hands of His Sacred Majesty at his blessed Restauration? For as much of this as concerns my self I make no excuse, but give my reasons, and hope to justifie this procedure with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty which <hi>David</hi> us'd to his angry brother, saying, <hi>What have I now done? is there not a cause?</hi> The cause is this:</p>
            <p>The Reverend Fathers my Lords the Bishops of <hi>Ireland</hi> in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection and watchfulness over their Flocks having espied grievous
<pb facs="tcp:100300:4"/>
Wolves to have entered in, some with Sheeps-clothing, and some without, some secret enemies, and some open, at first endeavour'd to give check to those enemies which had put fire into the bed-straw; and though God hath very much prosper'd their labours, yet they have work enough to do, and will have, till God shall call them home to the land of peace and unity. But <hi>it was soon remembred,</hi> that when King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memory had discerned the spirits of the English Non-conformists, and found them pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish and factious, unreasonable and imperious, not onely unable to govern, but as inconsistent with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as greedy to snatch at it for themselves; resolved to take off their disguise, and put a difference between <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> and to
<pb facs="tcp:100300:4"/>
bring them to the measures and rules of Laws; and to this the Council and all wise men were consenting, because by the Kings great wisdom, and the conduct of the whole Conference and Inquiry, men saw there was reason on the Kings side, and necessity on all sides. But the Gun-powder Treason breaking out, a new Zele was enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against the Papists, and it shin'd so greatly, that the Non-conformists escap'd by the light of it, and quickly grew warm by the heat of that flame, to which they added no small increase by their Declamations and other acts of insinuation: insomuch that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected, multiply'd untill they got power enough to do all those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which we have seen and felt. This <hi>being remembred and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of,</hi> it <hi>was soon observ'd</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:100300:5"/>
the Tables onely were now turn'd, and that now the publick zele and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness against those men and those persuasions, which so lately have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted us, might give to the Emissaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> leisure and opportunity to grow into numbers and strength to debauch many Souls, and to unhinge the safety and peace of the Kingdom. In <hi>Ireland</hi> we saw too much of it done, and found the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief growing too fast, and the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable inconveniencies, but too justly apprehended, as near and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent. We had reason at least to cry Fire when it flamed through our very Roofs, and to interpose with all care and diligence when Religion and the eternal Interest of Souls was at stake, as knowing we should be greatly unfit to appear and account to the <hi>great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb facs="tcp:100300:5"/>
and Shepherd of Souls</hi> if we had suffer'd the enemies to sow tares in our fields, we standing and looking on. It was therefore consider'd how we might best serve God, and rescue our charges from their danger, and it was concluded presently to run to arms, I mean to the weapons of our warfare, to the armour of the Spirit, to the works of our calling, and to tell the people of their peril, to warn them of the enemy, and to lead them in the ways of truth and peace and holiness: that if they would be admonished, they might be safe, if they would not, they should be without excuse, because they could not say but the Prophets have been amongst them.</p>
            <p>But then it was next enquired who should minister in this affair, and put in order all those things which
<pb facs="tcp:100300:6"/>
they had to give in charge: It was easie to chuse many, but hard to chuse one; there were many fit to succeed in the vacant Apostleship, and though <hi>Barsabas the Just</hi> was by all the Church nam'd as a fit and worthy man, yet the lot fell upon <hi>Matthias</hi>; and that was my case, it fell to me to be their <hi>Amanuensis,</hi> when persons most worthy were more readily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd; and in this my Lords the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had reason,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1. Cor. 6.4.</hi>
               </note> that (according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule) <hi>If there be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or controversies amongst us, they should be imploy'd who are least esteem'd in the Church</hi>; and upon this account I had nothing left me but Obedience; though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that I found regret in the nature of the imployment, for I love not to be (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it) one of
<pb facs="tcp:100300:6"/>
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Disputers of this world.</hi> For I suppose skill in Controversies (as they are now us'd) to be the worst part of Learning, and time is the worst spent in them, and men the least benefited by them; that is, when the Questions are curious and impertinent, intricate and inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, not to make men better, but to make a Sect. But when the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions disputed are of the foundation of Faith, or lead to good life, or naturally do good to single persons or publick so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, then they are part of the <hi>depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm</hi> of Christianity, of the <hi>Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of faith</hi>; and for this we are by the Apostle commanded <hi>to contend earnestly,</hi> and therefore Controversies may become necessary; but because they are not often so, but oftentimes useless and always troublesom; and as
<pb facs="tcp:100300:7"/>
an ill diet makes an ill habit of body, so does the frequent use of controversies baffle the understanding, and makes it crafty to deceive others, it self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining instructed in nothing but use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less notions and words of contingent signification and distinctions without difference, which minister to pride and contention and teach men to be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious, troublesome and uncharitable, therefore I love them not.</p>
            <p>But because by the Apostolical Rule I am tyed <hi>to do all things without murmurings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil. 2.14.</hi>
               </note> as well as without <hi>disputings,</hi> I consider'd it over again, and found my self reliev'd by the subject matter, and the grand consequent of the present Questions. For in the present affair, the case is not so as in the others; here the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions are such that the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:100300:7"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> declares them to reach as far as eternity, and damn all that are not of their opinions; and the Protestants have much more reason to fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Papists, such who are not excus'd by ignorance, that their condition is very sad and deplorable, and that it is charity to snatch them as a brand from the fire; and indeed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintains Propositions, which, if the Ancient Doctors of the Church may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, are apt to separate from God. I instance in their superaddition of Articles and Propositions, derived onely from a pretended tradition, and not contain'd in Scripture. Now the doing of this is a great sin, and a great danger. <hi>Adoro Scripturae pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem; Si non est scriptum timeat vae illud adjicientibus &amp;

            <p>But we have observed amongst the generality of the <hi>Irish,</hi> such a declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christianity, so great credulity to believe every superstitious story, such confidence in vanity, such groundless pertinacy, such vicious
<pb facs="tcp:100300:11"/>
lives, so little sense of true Religion and the fear of God, so much care to obey the Priests, and so little to obey God; such intolerable ignorance, such fond Oaths and manners of swearing, thinking themselves more oblig'd by swearing on the Mass-book, than the four Gospels, and S. <hi>Patricks</hi> Mass-book more than any new one; swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their Fathers soul, by their Godsips hand, by other things which are the product of those many Tales are told them; their not knowing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what account they refuse to come to Church, but onely that now they are old and never did, or their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do not, or their Fathers or Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers never did, or that their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours were Priests, and they will not alter from their Religion; and after all, can give no account of their
<pb facs="tcp:100300:11"/>
Religion what it is: onely they believe as their Priest bids them, and go to Mass which they understand not, and reckon their Beads to tell the number and the tale of their prayers, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from Eggs and flesh in Lent, and visit S. <hi>Patricks</hi> Well, and leave Pins and Ribbons, Yarn or Thred in their holy Wells, and pray to God, S. <hi>Mary</hi> and S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> S. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbanus</hi> and S. <hi>Bridget,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be buried with S. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Cord about them, and to fast on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days in honour of our Lady. These and so many other things of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we see daily, that we being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of the infinite distance which these things have from the spirit of Christianity, know that no charity can be greater than to persuade the people to come to our Churches, where
<pb facs="tcp:100300:12"/>
they shall be taught all the ways of godly wisdom, of peace and safety to their souls: whereas now there are many of them that know not how to say their prayers, but mutter like Pies and Parrots words which they are taught, but they do not pretend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. But I shall give one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular instance of their miserable su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and blindness.</p>
            <p>I was lately within a few moneths very much troubled with Petitions and earnest Requests for the restoring a Bell, which a Person of Quality had in his hands in the time of, and ever since, the late Rebellion. I could not guess at the reasons of their so great and violent importunity, but told the Petitioners, If they could prove that Bell to be theirs, the Gentleman was willing to pay the full value of it;
<pb facs="tcp:100300:12"/>
though he had no obligation to do so (that I know of) but charity: but this was so far from satisfying them, that still the importunity increased, which made me diligently to inquire into the secret of it. The first cause I found was, that a dying person in the Parish desired to have it rung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to Church, and pretended he could not die in peace if it were deny'd him; and that the keeping of that Bell did anciently belong to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from father to son: but because this seem'd nothing but a fond and an unreasonable superstition, I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red further, and at last found that they believ'd this Bell came from Heaven, and that it used to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from place to place, and to end Controversies by Oath, which the worst men durst not violate if they
<pb facs="tcp:100300:13"/>
swore upon that Bell, and the best men amongst them durst not but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; that if this Bell was rung before the Corps to the grave, it would help him out of Purgatory; and that therefore when any one died, the friends of the deceased did, whilest the Bell was in their possession, hire it for the behoof of their dead, and that by this means that Family was in part maintain'd. I was troubled to see under what spirit of delusion those poor souls do lie, how infinitely their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity is abused, how certainly they believe in trifles, and perfectly rely on vanity, and how little they regard the truths of God, and how not at all they drink of the waters of Salvation. For the numerous companies of Priests and Friars amongst them take care they shall know nothing of Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:100300:13"/>
but what they design for them, they use all means to keep them to the use of the <hi>Irish</hi> Tongue, lest if they learn <hi>English</hi> they might be supplied with persons fitter to instruct them; the people are taught to make that also their excuse for not coming to our Churches, to hear our advices, or converse with us in religious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, because they understand us not, and they will not understand us, neither will they learn that they may understand and live. And this and many other evils are made greater and more irremediable by the affrightment which their Priests put upon them by the issues of Ecclesiastical Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which (they now exercising it too publickly) they give them Laws, not onely for Religion, but even for Temporal things, and turn their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
<pb facs="tcp:100300:14"/>
from the Mass, if they become Farmers of the Tithes from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or Proprietary without their leave. I speak that which I know to be true by their own confession and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd and uninvited Narratives; so that as it is certain that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion, as it stands in distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and separation from us, is a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of strange Propositions, having but little relish of true primitive and pure Christianity, (as will be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, if the importunity of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries extort it) so it is here amongst us a Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion and a State-party and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to recover their old Laws and barbarous manner of living, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to enable them to dwell alone, and to be <hi>Populus unius labii,</hi> a people of one language and unmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with others. And if this be
<pb facs="tcp:100300:14"/>
Religion, it is such a one as ought to be reproved by all the severities of Reason and Religion, lest the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perish, and their souls be cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given away to them that make merchandize of souls, who were the purchace and price of Christs bloud.</p>

               </gap>impossible to produce any new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or if we could, it will not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that what can be newly alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged can prevail more than all that which already hath been so often ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in these Questions. But we are not deterr'd from doing our duty by any such considerations: as knowing, that the <hi>same</hi> medicaments are with successe applyed to a <hi>returning</hi> or an <hi>abiding</hi> Ulcer; and the Preachers of Gods word must for ever be ready to put the People in mind of such things, which they already have heard, and by the same Scriptures and the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons endeavour to destroy their sin, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A little warm Sun, and some indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent showers of a softer rain, have made many weeds of erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to take root greatly, and to spread themselves widely: and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots of the Roman Church by their late importune boldness and indiscreet frowardness in making Proselytes have but too manifestly declar'd to all the World, that if they were <hi>rerum potiti</hi>

evils to which they are tempted by the Roman Emissaries, that while the King and the Parliament take care to secure all the publick interests <hi>by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of their own, we</hi> also may <hi>by the word of our proper Ministery</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to stop the progression of such errors, which we know to be destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of Christian Religion, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dangerous to the interest of souls.</p>
            <p>In this procedure, although we shall say some things which have not been alwayes plac'd before their eyes, and others we shall represent with a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingness to their present necessities, and all with Charity too, and zeal for their souls; yet if we were to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what hath been often said already; we are still doing the work of God, and repeating his voice, and by the same remedies curing the same diseases, and we only wait for the blessing of God prospering that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which is our duty: according to the avice of <hi>Solomon,</hi>

               <p>And this method of procedure we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100300:20"/>
now choose, not only because to them that know well how to use it, to the Sober and the Moderate, the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and the Wise, it is the best, the most certain, visible and tangible, most humble and satisfactory, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does with greatest noises pretend her Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Antiquity. Indeed the present Roman Doctrines, which are in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, were invisible and unheard-of in the <hi>first and best antiquity,</hi> and with how ill success their quotations are out of the Fathers of the first three Ages, every inquiring Man may easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. But the noises therefore which they make are from the Writings of the succeeding Ages; where secular interest did more prevail, and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers were vast and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous, full of controversie, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous senses, fitted to their own times and questions, full of proper opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and such variety of sayings, that both sides eternally and inconfutably shall bring sayings for themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively. Now although things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100300:21"/>
thus, it will be impossible for them to conclude from the sayings of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Fathers, that their doctrine, which they would prove thence, was the Catholick Doctrine of the Church; because any number that is less than all, does not prove a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick consent; yet the clear sayings of one or two of these Fathers truly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged by us to the contrary, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prove that what many of them (suppose it) do affirm, and which but two or three as good Catholicks as the other do deny, was not then matter of faith or a Doctrine of the Church; for if it had, these had been Hereticks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, and not have remain'd in the Communion of the Church. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the reasonableness of the thing we have thought fit to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it; yet we shall have no need to make use of it; since not onely in the prime and purest Antiquity we are indubitably more than Conquerors; but even in the succeeding Ages, we have the advantage both <hi>numero, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere &amp; men surâ,</hi> in number, weight and measure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100300:21"/>We do easily acknowledge that to dispute these questions from the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Fathers is not the readiest way to make an end of them; but therefore we do wholly rely upon Scriptures as the foundation and final resort of all our perswasions, and from thence can never be confuted; but we also admit the Fathers as admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble helps for the understanding of the Scriptures, and as good testimony of the Doctrine deliver'd from their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers down to them of what the Church esteem'd the way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore if we find any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine now taught, which was not plac'd in their way of Salvation, we reject it as being no part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, and which ought not to be impos'd upon consciences. They were <hi>wise unto salvation,</hi> and <hi>fully instructed to every good work</hi>; and therefore the faith which they profess'd and deriv'd from Scripture, we profess also; and in the same faith, <hi>we hope to be sav'd even as they.</hi> But for the new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; we understand them not, we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100300:22"/>
know them not: Our faith is the same from the beginning, and cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new.</p>
               <p>But because we shall make it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that <hi>they do greatly innovate in al their points of controversie with us,</hi> and shew nothing but shadows instead of substances, and little images o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The first thing therefore we are to advertise is, that the Emissaries of the Roman Church endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the good People of our Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses from a Religion that is truly Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and Apostolick, and divert them to Propositions of their own, new and unheard-of in the first ages o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

because it teaches us to believe the whole Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and nothing else as matter of faith; and therefore <hi>unless there can be new Scriptures, we can have no new matters of belief, no new arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith.</hi> Whatsoever we cannot prove from thence, we disclaim it, as not deriving from the Fountains of our Saviour.

               <p>But as to the thing it self: it is <hi>so wholly new,</hi> so merely devis'd and forged by themselves, so newly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of nothing, from great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of Scripture, and dreams of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows from antiquity; that we are to admonish our charges, that <hi>they cannot reasonably expect many sayings of the Primitive Doctors against them,</hi> any more than against the new fancies of the Quakers, which were born but ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday. <hi>That which is not cannot be numbred,</hi> and <hi>that which was not could not be confuted.</hi> But the perfect <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of antiquity</hi> in this whole matter, is an abundant demonstration that this <hi>new nothing</hi> was made in the later labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories of <hi>Rome.</hi> For as <hi>Durandus</hi> said,<note place="margin">Ubi supra.</note> the Holy Fathers, <hi>Ambrose, Hilary, Hierom, Augustine</hi> speak <hi>nothing</hi> of <hi>Indulgences.</hi> And whereas it is said that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> DC. years after Christ,

gave indulgences at <hi>Rome</hi> in the stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>Magister Angularis</hi> who lived about 200. years since, says, <hi>he never read of any such any where</hi>; and it is certain there is no such thing in the writings of S. <hi>Gregory, nor in any histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And it were strange that if this power of giving indulgences to <hi>take off the punishment,</hi> reserv'd by God <hi>after the sin is pardoned,</hi> were given by Christ to his Church, that <hi>no one of the ancient Doctors</hi> should tell any thing of it: insomuch that there is no one writer of authority and credit, not the more ancient Doctors we have named, nor those who were much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Rupertus Tuitiensis, Anselm</hi> or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100300:33"/>
S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ever took notice of it; but it was a Doctrine wholly unknown to the Church for about MCC years after Christ: &amp; Card. <hi>Cajetane</hi> told P. <hi>Adrian</hi> VI. that to him that readeth the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals it plainly appears, that <hi>an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is nothing else but an absolution from that penance which the Confessor hath imposed</hi>; &amp; therfore can be nothing of that which is now a-days pretended.</p>
               <p>True it is, that the <hi>Canonical penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> were about the time of <hi>Burchard</hi> lessen'd and alter'd by <hi>commutations</hi>; and the ancient Discipline of the Church in imposing penances was made so loose, that the Indulgence was more than the Imposition, &amp; began not to be an act of mercy but <hi>remisness,</hi> an <hi>absolution without amends:</hi> It became a trumpet, &amp; a leavy for the Holy War; in Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the Seconds time; for he gave a plenary Indulgence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all sins to them that should go and fight against the Saracens: and yet no man could tell how much they were the better for these Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences: for concerning the <hi>value of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100300:34"/>
indulgences,</hi> the complaint is both old and doubtful, said Pope <hi>Adrian</hi>; and he cites a famous gloss,<note place="margin">In lib. 4. sent.</note> which tells of four Opinions all Catholick, and yet vastly differing in this particular:<note place="margin">Verb. <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia.</hi>

respectively, <hi>prayer for the dead.</hi> Now because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does so too, and more than so, relates her prayers to the Doctrine of Purgatory, and for the souls there detain'd, her Doctors vainly suppose, that when ever the Holy Fathers speak of prayer for the dead, that they conclude for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; which vain conjecture is as false as it is unreasonable: For it is true, the Fathers did pray for the dead, but how? <hi>That God would shew them mercy, and hasten the resurrection, and give a blessed sentence in the great day.</hi> But then it is also to be remembred, that they made prayers, and offered <hi>for those, who by the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and consequently all prayers for the dead <hi>relating to it:</hi> And how vainly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from prayer for the dead, infers the belief of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, every man may satisfie himself, by seeing the Writings of the Fathers, where they cannot meet with one Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or Clause for praying for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of souls out of that <hi>imaginary</hi> place. Which thing is so certain, that in the <hi>very Roman Offices,</hi> we mean, <hi>the Vigils</hi> said for the dead, which are Psalms and Lessons taken from the Scripture, speaking of the miseries of this World, Repentance, and Reconciliation with God, the bliss after this life of them that die in Christ, and the Resurrection of the Dead; and in the <hi>Anthemes, Versicles</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponses,</hi> there are prayers made recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to God the Soul of the newly defunct, praying, <hi>he may be freed from Hell, and eternal death, that in the day of Iudgment he be not judged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned according to his sins, but that he may appear among the Elect in the glory of the Resurrection</hi>; but not

one word of Purgatory, or its pains.</p>
               <p>The other cause of their mistake is, That the Fathers often speak of a <hi>fire of Purgation</hi> after this life; but such a one that is <hi>not to be kindled until the day of Iudgment,</hi> and it is such a fire that destroys the Doctrine of the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Purgatory.

is explicated.

               <p>Now from these premises we are not desirous to infer any odious consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in reproof of the Roman Church, but we think it our duty to give our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100300:54"/>
own people caution and admonition; 1. That they be not abus'd by the rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical words and high expressions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged out of the Fathers, calling the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>The body or the flesh of Christ.</hi> For we <hi>all believe it is so,</hi> and rejoyce in it. But the question is, <hi>after what manner it is so</hi>; whether after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the flesh, or after the manner of spiritual grace, and sacramental conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? We <hi>with</hi> the H. Scriptures and the primitive Fathers, affirm the later. The Church of <hi>Rome against</hi> the words of Scripture, and the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Christ <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.63.</note>, and the doctrine of the primitive Church, affirm the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. 2. That they be careful not to admit such Doctrines under a pretence of being Ancient; since, although <hi>the Roman errour hath been too long admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and is ancient in respect of our days, yet it is an innovation in Christianity,</hi> and brought in by ignorance, power and superstition, very many ages after Christ. 3. We exhort them, that they remember the words of Christ, when he explicates the doctrine of <hi>giving us
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100300:55"/>
his flesh for meat, and his bloud for drink,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vbi supra.</hi>
                  </note> that he tells us, <hi>The flesh profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, but the words which he speaks are spirit, and they are life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That if those ancient and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Doctors above cited, say true, and that the symbols still remain the same in their natural substance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, even after they are blessed, and when they are receiv'd, and that Christs body and bloud are onely present to faith and to the spirit, that then who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tempts them to give Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to these symbols or elements (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does) tempts them to give to a creature the due and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable propriety of God; and that then, this evil passes further than an errour in the understanding; for it carries them to a <hi>dangerous practice,</hi> which cannot reasonably be excus'd from the crime of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</p>
               <p>This matter of it self is an error so prodigiously great and dangerous, that we need nor tell of the horrid and <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous questions</hi> which are sometimes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100300:55"/>
handled by them concerning this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mystery. As, if a Priest going by a Bakers shop, and saying with intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> whether all the Bakers bread be turned into the body of Christ? Whether a Church mouse does eat her Maker? Whether a man by eating the consecrated sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols does break his fast? For if it be not bread and wine, he does not: and if it be Christs body and bloud naturally and properly, it is not bread and wine. Whether it may be said, the Priest is in some sense the Creator of God himself? Whether his power be greater than the power of Angels and Archangels? For that it is so, is expresly affirmed by <hi>Cassenaeus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gloria mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi> 4. <hi>num.</hi> 6.</note> Whether (as a Bohemian Priest said) that a Priest before he say his first Mass, be the Son of God, but afterward he is the Father of God and the Creator of his body? But against this blasphemy a book was written by <hi>Iohn Huss,</hi> about the time of the Council of <hi>Constance.</hi> But these things are too bad, and therefore we love not to rake in so filthy chanels,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100300:56"/>
but give onely a general warning to all our Charges, to take heed of <hi>such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> who from the proper consequences of their Articles, grow too bold and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant; and, of <hi>such doctrines,</hi> from whence these and many other evil Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, frequently do is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue. As the tree is, such must be the fruit. But we hope it may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">1.</note> to say, <hi>That what the Church of Rome teaches of Transubstantiation, is absolutely impossible, and implies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions very many, to the belief of which no faith can oblige us, and no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can endure.</hi> For Christs body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heaven, glorious, spiritual and impassible, cannot be broken. And since by the Roman doctrine nothing is broken, but that which cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that is, the colour, the taste, and other accidents of the elements; yet if they could be broken, since the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of bread and wine are not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christs body and bloud, it is certain that on the Altar, Christs body naturally and properly cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">2.</note> And since they say that every
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100300:56"/>
consecrated Wafer is Christs whole body, and yet this Wafer is not that Wafer, therefore either this or that is not Christs body, or else Christ hath two bodies, for there are two Wafers. <note place="margin">3.</note> But when Christ instituted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and said, <hi>This is my body which is broken:</hi> because at that time Christs body was not broken naturally and properly, the very words of Institution do force us to understand the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a sense <hi>not natural,</hi> but <hi>spiritual,</hi> that is, <hi>truly sacramental.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> And all this is besides the plain demonstrations of sense, which tells us it is bread and it is wine naturally as much after as before consecration. <note place="margin">5.</note> And after all, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense is such as our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our reprov'd in the men of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and called them to a spiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; the natural sense being not onely unreasonable and impossible; but also to no purpose of the spirit, or any ways perfective of the soul; as hath been clearly demonstrated by many learned men against the fond <hi>hypothesis</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Article.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100300:62"/>
he that speaks aloud to them that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand him not, does no more. Now since there is no use of vocal prayer in publick, but that all together may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their desires, and stir up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and joyn in the expression of them to God; by this device, a man who understands not what is said, can onely pray with his lips; for the heart cannot pray but by desiring, and it cannot desire what it understands not. So that in this case, prayer cannot be an act of the soul: There is neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection nor understanding, notice or desire: The heart says nothing, and asks for nothing, and therefore receives nothing. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls that <hi>the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of fools,</hi> when men consider not; and they who understand not what is said, cannot take it into consideration.

               <p>THe Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath to very bad purposes introduc'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon Christendom the worship and veneration of Images, kissing them, pulling off their hats, kneeling, falling down and praying before them, which they call, <hi>giving them due honor and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> What <hi>external honor and veneration</hi> that is, which they call <hi>due,</hi> is express'd by the instances now rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd, which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in their Decree enumerate and establish. What <hi>the inward honor and worship</hi> is, which they intend to them, is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the same Decree. By the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they worship Christ and his Saints; and therefore by these Images they pass that honor to Christ and his Saints which is their due: that is, as their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors explain it, <hi>Latria</hi> or Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to God and Christ. <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> or more than service to the Blessed Virgin Mary; and service or <hi>doulia</hi> to other canoniz'd persons. So that upon the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100300:65"/>
whole, the case is this: What ever worship they give to God, and Christ and his Saints, they give it first to the image, and from the image they pass it unto Christ and Christs servants. And therefore we need not to enquire what actions they suppose to be fit or due. For whatsoever is due to God, to Christ or his Saints, that worship they give to their respective Images: all the same in external semblance and ministery; as appears in all their great Churches, and publick actions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, and Temples and Festivals, and endowments, and censings, and pilgrimages, and prayers, and vows made to them.</p>
               <p>Now besides that these things are so like Idolatry, that they can no way be reasonably excused (of which we shall in the next Chapter give some account) besides that they are too like the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Heathens,<note place="margin">Chap. 2. Sect. 12.</note> and so plainly and frequently forbidden in the Old Testament, and are so infinitely unlike the simple and wise, the natural and holy, the pure and the spiritual religion
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100300:65"/>
of the Gospel; besides that they are so infinite a scandal to the Jews and Turks, and reproach Christianity it self amongst all strangers that live in their communion, and observe their rites: besides that they cannot pretend to be lawfull, but with the laborious artifices of many Metaphysical notions and distinctions, which the people who most need them, do least under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; and that therefore the people worship them without these distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and directly put confidence in them; and that it is impossible that ignorant persons, who in all Christian countreys make up the biggest number, should do otherwise, when otherwise they cannot understand it; and besides that, the thing it self with or without distinctions, is a superstitious and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, an unlawful and unnatural wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, who will not be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by an Image: we say that besides all this, This whole Doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is an innovation in the Christian Church, not practis'd, not endured in the primitive ages; but expresly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100300:66"/>
condemned by them, and this is our present undertaking to evince.</p>
               <p>The first notice we find of Images brought into Christian Religion, was by <hi>Simon Magus</hi>: indeed that was very Ancient, but very heretical and abominable: but that he brought some in to be worshipped, we find in <note n="*" place="margin">

not onely the infinite fraud of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Doctors is discover'd, but the worship of Images is declar'd against and condemned.</p>
               <p>A while after this, <hi>Ludovicus</hi> the son of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> sent <hi>Claudius</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preacher to <hi>Taurinum</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where he preach'd against the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, and wrote an excellent book to that purpose. Against this book <hi>Ionas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> after the death of <hi>Ludovicus</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> did write: In which he yet durst not assert the worship of them, but confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it out of <hi>Origen</hi>; whose words he thus cites, [<hi>Images are neither to be esteemed by inward affection, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with outward shew</hi>;] and out of <hi>Lactantius</hi> these, [<hi>Nothing is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped that is seen with mortal eyes: Let us adore, let us worship nothing, but the name alone of our onely Parent, who is to be sought for in the Regions above, not here below:</hi>] And to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he also alleges excellent words out of <hi>Fulgentius</hi> and S. <hi>Hierom</hi>; and though he would have Images retain'd,

and therefore was angry at <hi>Claudius</hi> who caus'd them to be taken down, yet he himself expresly affirms, that they ought not to be worshipped; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adds, that though they kept the Images in their Churches for history and ornament, yet that in <hi>France</hi> the worshipping of them was had in great detestation. And though it is not to be denied, but that in the sequel of <hi>Ionas</hi> his book, he does something prevaricate in this question; yet it is evident, that in <hi>France</hi> this Doctrine was not accounted Catholick for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most nine hundred years after Christ;<note place="margin">

               <p>But they have taught every Priest that can scarse understand his Breviary, (of which in <hi>Ireland</hi> there are but too many) and very many of the people, to ask where our Religion was before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> Whereas it appears by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that it is much more easie for us to shew our Religion before <hi>Luther,</hi>

               <p>But this, though it be infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, yet it is but the beginning of sorrows. For the guides of Souls in the Roman Church have prevaricated in all the parts of Repentance, most sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dangerously.</p>
               <p>The next things therefore that we shall remark are their Doctrines concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>contrition:</hi> which when it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine

and true, that is, a true cordial sorrow for having sinn'd against God; a sorrow proceeding from the love of God, and conversion to him, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a dereliction of all our sins, and a walking in all righteousness, both the Psalms and the Prophets, the Old Testament and the New, the Greek Fathers and the Latin have allowed as sufficient for the pardon of our sins through faith in Jesus Christ (as our Writers have often prov'd in their Sermons and books of Conscience) yet first, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not allow it to be of any value, unless it be joyn'd with a desire to confess their sins to a Priest; saying, that a man by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is not reconcil'd to God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Sacramental or Ritual pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, actual or votive; and this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which thing besides that it is against Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">

               <p>But the malignity of this Doctrine and its influence it hath on an evil life appears in the other corresponding part of this Doctrine. For as contrition without their ritual and sacramental confession will not reconcile us to God: so <hi>attrition</hi> (as they call it) or <hi>contrition imperfect,</hi> proceeding from fear of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, together with their Sacrament will reconcile the sinner. <hi>Contrition</hi> without it <hi>will not: attrition</hi> with it, <hi>will</hi> reconcile us; and therefore by this doctrine, which is expresly decreed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now let this be added to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the sequel is this, That if a man live a wicked life for threescore or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Priest with two fingers and a thumb can do his work for him; onely he must be greatly dispos'd and prepar'd to receive it: Greatly, we say, according to the sense of the Roman Church; for he must be attrite, or it were better if he were contrite; one act of grief, a little one, and that not for one sin more than another, and this at the end of a long wicked life, at the time of our death, will make all sure.</p>

               <p n="1">1. For Confession: It is true, to them who are not us'd to it, as it is at the first time, and for that once it is as troublesom as for a bashful man to speak Orations in publick: But where it is so perpetual and universal, and done by companies and crouds, at a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn set time, and when it may be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100300:87"/>
done to any one besides the Parish-Priest, to a Friar that begs, or to a Monk in his Dorter, done in the ear, it may be, to a person that hath done worse, and therefore hath no awe upon me, but what his Order imprints, and his Viciousness takes off; when we see Women and Boys, Princes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates do the same every day: And as oftentimes they are never the better, so they are not at all asham'd; but men look upon it as a certain cure, like pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off a mans clothes to go and wash in a river, and make it by use and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, by confidence and custom, to be no certain pain, and the women blush or smile, weep or are unmov'd, as it happens under their veil, and the men under the boldness of their Sex: When we see that men and women confess to day, and sin to morrow, and are not affrighted from their sin the more for it; because they know the worst of it, and have felt it often, and believe to be eas'd by it, certain it is that a little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and a little observation will suffice to conclude, that this practise of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100300:87"/>
hath in it no affrightment, not so much as the horrour of the sin it self hath to the Conscience. For they who commit sins confidently, will with less regret (it may be) confess it in this manner, where it is the fashion for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to do it. And when all the world observes how loosly the Italians, Spaniards and French do live in their Carnivals, giving to themselves all liberty and license to do the vilest things at that time, not onely because they are for a while<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to take their leave of them, but because they are (as they suppose) to be so soon eas'd of their crimes by Confession, and the circular and never-failing hand of the Priest; they will have no reason to admire the severity of Confession, which as it was most certainly intended as a deletory of sin, and might do its first intention, if it were equally manag'd; so now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it gives confidence to many men to sin, and to most men to neglect the greater and more effective parts of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential repentance.</p>
               <p>We shall not need to observe how
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100300:88"/>
Confession is made a Minister of State, a Pick-lock of secrets, a Spy upon fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, a Searcher of inclinations, a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying to temptations; for this is wholly by the fault of the Men, and not of the Doctrine; but even the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it self, as it is handled in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is so far from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace to the troubled Consciences, that it intromits more scruples and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But the use we make of it is this; That since they have declar'd, that when sins are pardon'd so easily, yet the punishment remains so very great, and that so much must be suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here or in Purgatory; it is strange that they should not onely in effect pretend to shew more mercy than God does, or the primitive Church did; but that they should directly lay aside the primitive Discipline, and while they declaim against their Adversaries for saying they are not necessary, yet at the same time they should devise tricks to take them quite away, so that neither Penances shall much smart here, nor Purgatory (which is a device to make men be <hi>Mulata's,</hi> as the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard calls, half Christians, a device to make a man go to Heaven and to Hell too) shall not torment them hereafter.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100300:94"/>
we have thought fit to adde one Consideration more, and that is, That it is not fit that they should trust to this, or any thing of this, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no foundation of truth in these new devices, but because even the Roman Doctors themselves, when they are pinch'd with an Objection, let their hold go, and to escape do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable measures destroy their own new building.</p>
               <p>The case is this: To them who say, that if there were truth in these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, then all these, and the many millions of Indulgences more, and the many other ways of releasing souls out of Purgatory, the innumerable Masses said every day, the power of the Keys so largely imploy'd, would in a short time have emptied Purgatory of all her sad inhabitants, or it may be very few would go thither, and they that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately do, cannot stay long; and consequently, besides that this great softness and easiness of procedure would give confidence to the greatest sinners, and the hopes of Purgatory
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100300:94"/>
would destroy the fears of Hell, and the certainty of doing well enough in an imperfect life, would make men careless of the more excellent: besides these things, there will need no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of Pensions to pray for persons dead many years ago: To them, I say, who talk to them at this rate, they have enough to answer.</p>
               <p>Deceive not your selves, there are more things to be reckon'd for than so.

               <p>For 1. it is according as your Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is. Suppose it for forty years, or it may be an hundred, or a thousand, (and that is a great matter) yet perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture according to the old peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial rate you have deserved the Penance of forty thousand years; or at least you may have done so by the more severe account of God: If the Penance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years be taken off by your Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100300:95"/>
it does as much of the work as was promised or intended; but you can feel little ease, if still there remains due the Penance of threescore thousand years. No man can tell the difference when what remains shall be so great as to surmount all the evils of this life; and the abatement may be accounted by pen and ink, but will signifie little in the perception: it is like the casting out of a Devil out of a miserable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, when there still remains fifty more as bad as he that went away; the man will hardly find how much he is advanced in his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But 2. you have with much labour and some charge purchased to your self so many <hi>Quadragenes</hi> or Lents of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; that is, you have bought off the Penances of so many times forty days. It is well; but were you well advis'd? it may be your <hi>Quadragenes</hi> are not <hi>Carenes,</hi> that is, are not a quitting the severest Penances of fasting so long in bread and water: for there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the manner of keeping a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Lent, and it may be you have
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100300:95"/>
purchased but some lighter thing; and then if your demerit arise to so many <hi>Carenes,</hi> and you purchased but mere <hi>Quadragenes,</hi> without a minute and table of particulars, you may stay longer in Purgatory than you expected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But therefore your best way is to get a <hi>plenary Indulgence</hi>; and that may be had on reasonable terms: but take heed you do not think your self secure, for a plenary Indulgence does not do all that it may be you require; for there is an Indulgence <hi>more full,</hi> and another <hi>most full,</hi>

                  </note> and it is not agreed upon among the Doctors whether a plenary Indulgence is to be extended beyond the taking off those Penances which were actually enjoyned by the Confessor, or how far they go further. And they that read <hi>Turrecremata, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var, Cordubensis, Fabius Incarnatus, Petrus de Soto, Armilla aurea, Aquinas, Tolet, Cajetan,</hi> in their several accounts of Indulgences, will soon perceive that all this is but a handful of Smoke, when you hold it, you hold it not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But further yet; all Indulgences
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100300:96"/>
are granted upon some inducement, and are not <hi>ex mero motu,</hi> or acts of mere grace without cause; and if the cause be not reasonable, they are inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid: and whether the cause be sufficient will be very hard to judge. And if there be for the Indulgence, yet if there be not a reasonable cause for the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Indulgence, you cannot tell how much you get: and the Preachers of Indulgences ought not to declare how valid they are <hi>assertivè,</hi> that is, by any confidence; but <hi>opinativè</hi> or <hi>recitativè,</hi> they can onely tell what is said, or what is their own opinion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When this difficuly is passed over, yet it may be the person is not capable of them; for if he be not in the state of Grace all is nothing; and if he be, yet if he does not perform the condition of the Indulgence actually; his mere endeavour or good desire is nothing. And when the conditions are actually done, it must be enquired whether in the time of doing them you were in charity; whether you be so at least in the last day of finishing them:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100300:96"/>
it is good to be certain in this, lest all evaporate and come to nothing. But yet suppose this too, though the work you are to do as the condition of the Indulgence, be done so well that you lose not all the Indulgence, yet for every degree of Imperfection in that work you will lose a part of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and then it will be hard to tell whether you get half so much as you propounded to your self.

               <p n="6">6. But there is yet a greater heap of dangers and uncertainties; for you must be sure of the Authority of him that gives the Indulgence, and in this there are many doubtful Questions; but when they are over, yet it is worth inquiry, (for some Doctors are fearful in this point) whether the intromission

And though it be thus insufficiently suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet it is not necessary: For At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is also sufficient, if a Priest can be had, and then any little grief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding out of the fear of Hell will do it, if the Priest do but absolve.</p>

For by this Doctrine, it is not to be said of Christ alone, that <hi>he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our transgressions,</hi> that he onely satisfied for our sins; for in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is done frequently, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended daily, that by another mans <hi>stripes we are healed.</hi>

                     <item>2. They teach, That a habit of sin, is not a sin, distinct from those former actions by which the habit was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. The secret intention of which Proposition, and the malignity of it, consists in this, that it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for a man to repent speedily; and a man is not bound by repentance
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100300:105"/>
to interrupt the procedure of his impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, or to repent of his habit, but of the single acts that went before it. For as for those that come after, they are excus'd, if they be produc'd by a strong habit; and the greater the habit the less is the sin: But then as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance need not for that reason, be hasty and presently; so because it is onely to be of single acts, the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it self need not be habitual, but it may be done in an instant; whereas to mortifie a habit of sin (which is the true and proper repentance) there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a longer time, and a procedure in the methods of a holy life. By this, and such like Propositions, and careless Sentences, they have brought it to that pass, that they reckon a single act of Contrition, at any time to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to take away the wickedness of a long life.<note place="margin">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100300:105"/>
disputed against us, and will not be denied. And that this Doctrine is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely destructive of the necessity of a good life, cannot be doubted of, when themselves do own the proper conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it, even the unnecessariness of present repentance, or before the danger of death; of which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given accounts. But the reason why we remark it here, is that which we now mention'd, because that by the Doctrine of vitious habits, having in them no malignity or sin but what is in the single preceding acts, there is an excuse made for millions of sins: For if by an evil habit the sinner is not made worse, and more hated by God, and his sinful acts made not onely more, but more criminal; it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the sins are very much les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened: For they being not so volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in their exercise and distinct ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, are not in present so malicious; and therefore he that hath gotten a habit of drunkenness or swearing, sins less in every act of drunkenness, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane oath, than he that acts them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100300:106"/>
because by his habit he is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd, and his sins are almost natural, &amp; less considered, less chosen, and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted against; but pass by inadve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tency, and an untroubled consent, easily and promptly, and almost naturally from that principle: So that by this means, and in such cases when things are come to this pass, they have gotten an imperfect warrant to sin a great deal, and a great while, without any new great inconvenience: Which evil state of things ought to be infinitely avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all Christians that would be sav'd by all means; and therefore all such Teachers, and all such Doctrines, are carefully to be declin'd, who give so much easiness, not onely to the remedies, but to the sins themselves, But of this, we hope it may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have given this short warning.</item>
                     <item>3. The distinction of Mortal and Venial sins, as it is taught in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a great cause of wickedness, and careless conversation. For although we do with all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctors admit of the distinction
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100300:106"/>
of sins Mortal and Venial; yet we also teach, That in their own nature, and in the rigor of the Divine Justice, every sin is damnable, and deserves Gods anger, and that in the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate they are so accounted, and that in Hell the damned suffer for small and great in a common mass of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet by the Divine mercy and compassion, the smaller sins which come by surprize, or by invincible ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or inadvertency, or unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able infirmity, shall not be imputed to those who love God, and delight not in the smallest sin, but use caution and prayers, watchfulness and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies against them. But if any man delights in small sins, and heaps them into numbers, and by deliberation or licentiousness they grow numerous, or are in any sense chosen, or taken in by contempt of the Divine Law, they do put us from the favour of God, and will pass into severe accounts. And though sins are greater or less by comparison to each other, yet the smallest is a burthen too great for us,

                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:100300:107"/>But now we appeal to the reason and Consciences of all men, Whether this Doctrine of sins Venial in their own nature, be not greatly destructive to a holy life? When it is plain, that they give rest to mens Consciences for one whole kind of sins; for such, which because they occur every day, in a very short time (if they be not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the grace of Repentance) will swell to a prodigious heap. But concerning these we are bidden to be quiet; for we are told, that all the heaps of these in the world cannot put us out of Gods favour. Add to this, that it being in thousands of cases, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to tell which are, and which are not Venial in their own nature, and in their appendent circumstances, either the people are cozen'd by this Doctrine into an useless confidence; and for all this talking in their Schools, they must nevertheless do to Venial sins, as they do to Mortal, that is, mortifie them, fight against them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent speedily of them, and keep them from running into mischief; and then
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100300:108"/>
all their kind Doctrines in this Article, signifie no comfort or ease, but all danger and difficulty, and useless dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; or else, if really they mean, that this easiness of opinion be made use of, then the danger is imminent, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness is introduc'd, and licentiousness in all little things is easily indulg'd; and mens souls are daily lessen'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repair, and kept from growing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Christian perfection, and from <hi>destroying the whole body of sin</hi>; and in short, <hi>despising little things, they perish by little and little.</hi>

                  </gap>his Doctrine also is worse yet in the handling. For it hath infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to the disparagement of holy life, not only by the uncertain, but as it must frequently happen, by the false determination of innumerable cases of conscience. For it is a great matter both in the doing and the thing done, both in the caution and the repentance, whether such an action be a venial or a mortal sin. If it chance to be mortal, and your Confessor says it is venial, your soul is betrayed. And it is but
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100300:108"/>
a chance what they say in most cases; for they call what they please venial, and they have no certain rule to answer by; which appears too sadly in their innumerable differences which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all their Casuists in saying what is, and what is not mortal; and of this there needs no greater proof than the reading the little Summaries made by their most leading guides of Consciences, <hi>Navar, Cajetane, Tolet, Emanuel Sà,</hi> and others; where one says such a thing is mortal, and two say it is venial.</p>
               <p>And lest any man should say or think, this is no great matter, we desire that it be considered that in venial sins there may be very much phantastick pleasure, and they that retain them do believe so, for they suppose the pleasure is great enough to outweigh the intolerable pains of Purgatory; and that it is more eligible to be in Hell a while, than to cross their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites in such small things. And however it happen in this particular, yet because the Doctors differ so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100300:109"/>
and irreconcileably, in saying what is, and what is not Venial, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall trust to their Doctrine, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that such a sin is Venial; and to their Doctrine, that says it does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from Gods favour, may by these two Propositions be damned before he is aware.</p>

                  </note> The opinion of any one grave Doctor is sufficient to make a matter probable; nay, the example and practise of good men, that is, men who are so reputed; if they have done it, you may do so too, and be safe. This is the great Rule of their Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>And now we ought not to be press'd with any ones saying, that such an opinion is but the private opinion of one or more of their Doctors. For although in matters of Faith this be not sufficient, to impute a Doctrine to a whole Church, which is but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion of one or more; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are now speaking of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite danger of souls in that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the horrid Propositions by which their Disciples are conducted, to the disparagement of good life, it is sufficient to allege the publike and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed sayings of their Doctors; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100300:110"/>
these sayings are their Rule of living: and because the particular Rules of Conscience, use not to be decreed in Councils, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive them from the places where they grow, and where they are to be found.</p>
               <p>But besides, you will say, That this is but the private opinion of some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; and what then? Therefore it is not to be called the Doctrine of the Roman Church. True, we do not say, <hi>It is an Article of their Faith,</hi> but, <hi>a rule of manners:</hi> This is not indeed in any publike Decree; but we say, that although it be not, yet neither is the contrary. And if it be but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion, yet, is it safe to follow it, or is it not safe? For that's the question, and therein is the danger. If it be safe, then this is their rule, <hi>A private opinion of any one grave Doctor may be safely followed in the questions of Vertue and Vice.</hi> But if it be not safe to follow it, and that this does not make an opinion probable, or the practise safe; Who says so? Does the Church? No;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100300:111"/>
Does Dr. <hi>Cajus</hi>? or Dr. <hi>Sempronius</hi> say so? Yes: But these are not safe to follow; for they are but private Doctors: Or if it be safe to follow them, though they be no more, and the opinion no more but probable, then I may take the other side, and choose which I will, and do what I list in most cases, and yet be safe by the Doctrine of the Roman Casuists; which is the great line, and general measure of most mens lives; and that is it which we complain of. And we have reason; for they suffer their Casuists to determine all cases, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely and gently, strictly and loosly; that so they may entertain all spirits, and please all dispositions, and govern them by their own inclinations, and as they list to be governed; by what may please them, not by that which profits them; that none may go away scandaliz'd or griev'd from their penitential chairs.</p>
               <p>But upon this account, it is a sad reckoning which can be made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning souls in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Suppose one great Doctor amongst
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100300:111"/>
them (as many of them do) shall say, it is lawful to kill a King whom the Pope declares Heretick. By the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of probability here is his warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And though the Church do not declare that Doctrine; that is, the Church doth not make it certain in Speculation, yet it may be safely done in practise: Here is enough to give peace of conscience to him that does it. Nay, if the contrary be more safe, yet if the other be but probable by reason or Authority, you may do the less safe, and refuse what is more.

               <p>These Opinions are indeed very strange to us of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but no strangers in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and, because they are taught by great Doctors, by Popes themselves, by Cardinals, and the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100300:114"/>
Canon Law respectively, do at least become very probable, and therefore they may be believ'd and practis'd without danger; according to the Doctrine of <hi>Probability.</hi> And thus the most desperate things that ever were said by any, though before the Declaration of the Church they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not become Articles of Faith, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that they are Doctrines publickly allowed, they can also become Rules of practice, and securities to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of their disciples.</p>
               <p>To this we add, that which is usual in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Praxis Ecclesiae,</hi> the Practice of the Church. Thus if an Indulgence be granted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition to visit such an Altar in a distant Church; the Nuns that are shut up, and Prisoners that cannot go abroad, if they address themselves to an Altar of their own with that inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they shall obtain the Indulgence. <hi>Id enim confirmat Ecclesiae praxis,</hi> says <hi>Fabius</hi>;<note place="margin">

               <p>AS these Evil Doctrines have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral influence into Evil Life; so there are some others, which if they be pursued to their proper and natural issues; that is, if they be believ'd and practis'd, are enemies to the particular and specifick parts of Piety and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

But</hi> 2. <hi>there is an attention which is by understanding the sense, and that is not necessary: For if it were, very extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly few would do their duty, when so very few do at all understand what they say.</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:100300:117"/>
3. <hi>There is an attention relating to the end of prayer, that is, that he that prays, considers that he is present before God, and speaks to him; and this indeed is very profitable, but it is not necessary:</hi> No, not <hi>so much.</hi> So that by this Doctrine no attention is necessary, but to attend that the words be all said, and said right. But even this <hi>attention is not necessary that it should be actual, but it suffices to be virtual, that is, that he who says his office, intend to do so, and do not change his mind, although he does not attend: And he who does not change his mind, that is, unless observing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not to attend, he still turn his mind to other things, he attends:</hi> meaning, he attends sufficiently, and as much as is necessary; though indeed speaking na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and truly, he does not attend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now although upon this account
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100300:117"/>
                  <hi>Devotion</hi> is (it may be) good; and it is good to attend to the words of our prayer, and the sense of them; yet that it is not necessary, is evidently consequent to this. But it is also expresly affirm'd by the same hand;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. n.</hi> 7.</note> There ought to be devotion, that our mind be inflam'd with the love of God, though if this be wanting, without contempt, it is no deadly sin. <hi>Ecclesiae satisfit per opus externum, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> saith <hi>Reginaldus:</hi> If ye do the outward work, the Church is satisfied, neither does she command any thing else. Good Doctrine this! And it is an excellent Church, that commands nothing to him that prays, but to say so many words.</p>
               <p>Well! but after all this, if Devotion be necessary or not, if it be present or not, if the mind wander, or wander not, if you mind what you pray, or mind it not, there is an easie cure for all this: For Pope <hi>Leo</hi> granted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all negligences in their saying their offices and prayers to them, who

               </p>
               <p>This is the sum of the Doctrine, concerning the manner of saying the Divine offices in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which greater care is taken to obey the Precept of the Church, than the Commandments of God: [<hi>For the Precept of hearing Mass is not, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the words, but to be present at the Sacrifice, though the words be not so much as heard, and they that think the contrary, think so without any probable

reason,</hi>] saith <hi>Tolet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. n.</hi> 6.</note> It seems there was not so much as the Authority of one grave Doctor to the contrary; for if there had, the contrary opinion might have been probable; but all agree upon this Doctrine, all that are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
               <p>So that between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Chnrch of <hi>Rome,</hi> the difference in this Article is plainly this. They pray with their lips, we with the heart; we pay with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, they with the voyce; <hi>we pray, and they say prayers.</hi> We sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that we do not please God, if our hearts be absent; they say, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if their bodies be present at their greatest solemnity of prayer, though they hear nothing that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and understand as little. And which of these be the better way of serving God, may soon be determin'd, if we remember the complaint which God made of the Jews, <hi>This people draweth neer me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me:</hi> But we know, that we are commanded to <hi>ask in faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:100300:119"/>
which is seated in the understanding, and requires the concurrence of the will, and holy desires; which cannot be at all, but in the same degree in which we have a knowledge of what we ask. <hi>The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man prevails:</hi> But what our prayers want of this, they must needs want of blessing and prosperity. And if we lose the benefit of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we lose that great instrumentality by which Christians are receptive of pardon, and strengthened in faith, and confirm'd in hope, and increase in charity, and are protected by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and are comforted in their sorrows, and derive help from God: <hi>Ye ask, and have not, because ye ask amiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi>; that is Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his rule. They that pray not as they ought, shall never obtain what they fain would.</p>
               <p>Hither is to be reduc'd, their fond manner of prayer, consisting in vain repetitions of Names, and little forms of words. The Psalter of our Lady, is an hundred and fifty <hi>Ave Maries,</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:100300:119"/>
and at the end of every tenth, they drop in the Lords Prayer, and this with the Creed at the end of the fifty, makes a perfect Rosary. This indeed is the main entertainment of the peoples Devotion; for which cause <hi>Mantuan</hi> call'd their Religion,

These onely are the instances which amongst many others presently occurr. Two things onely we shall adde, instead of many more that might be represented.</p>
               <p>The first is, That in a Hymn which they (from what reason or Etymology

               </p>
               <p>The other thing we tell of, is, That there is a Psalter of our Lady, of great and ancient account in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; it hath been seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times printed, at <hi>Venice,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Leipsich</hi>; and the title is, [The Psalter of the Blessed Virgin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd by the Seraphical Doctor St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alba,</hi> and

Presbyter Cardinal of the Holy Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>] But of the Book it self, the account is soon made; for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty in number are set down; alter'd indeed, to make as much of it as could be sense so reduc'd: In which the name of <hi>Lord</hi> is left out, and that of <hi>Lady</hi> put in; so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>David</hi> said of God and Christ, the same prayers, and the same prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they say of the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; and whether all that can be said without intolerable blasphemy, we suppose needs not much disputation.</p>
               <p>The same things, but in a less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and frequency, they say to other Saints.<note place="margin">

               <p>Next to this, the Exorcist may ask the Devil some questions; What is his name? How many of them there are? For what cause, and at what time he entered? and, for his own learning, by what persons he can be cast out? and by what Saint adjur'd? who are his particular enemies in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? and who in Hell? by what words he can be most afflicted? (for the Devils are such fools that they cannot keep their own counsel, nor choose but tell, and when they do, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100300:133"/>
tell true:) He may also ask him by what Covenant, or what Charm he came there, and by what he is to be released? Then he may call <hi>Lucifer</hi> to help him, and to torment that Spirit (for so <hi>they cast out Devils, by Belzebub the Prince of the Devils</hi>;) and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Lucifer</hi> dares not but obey him. Next to this, the Exorcist is cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to get out of the Devil, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of some Article of Faith, for the edification of the standers by (whom he may by this means convince of the truth of Transubstantiation, the reality of Purgatory, or the value of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences) and command him to knock his head three times against the ground, in adoration of the Holy Trinity. But let him take heed what Reliques he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Deuil; for if the Reliques be counterfeit, the Devil will be too hard for him. However, let the Exorci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Priest be sure to bless his pottage, his meat, his ointment, his herbs; and then also he may use some Schedules, or little rolls of paper, containing in them holy words; but he must be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100300:133"/>
sure to be exercis'd and skilful in all things that belong to the conjuring of the Devil: These are the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory documents, which when he hath observ'd, then let him fall to his prayers.</p>
               <p>Now for the prayers, they also are publickly describ'd in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices before cited; and are as followeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Priest ties his stole about the neck of the possessed with three knots, and says, O ye abominable Rebels against God, I conjure you Spirits, and adjure you, I call, I constrain, I call out, I contend and contest, where ever you are in this Man, by the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost [then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he makes two and thirty crosses more, and calls over one and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty names of God in false Hebrew, and base Greek, and some Latine, signifying the same names; and the two and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth is by the sign of the Cross, praying God to deliver them from their enemies. Then follow more prayers, and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations, and more conjurations (for they are greatly different you must know) and aspersions of holy water, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Cross, and signings with it.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100300:139"/>
and that God hath made no express Covenant concerning them, yet by the devotion of them that use them, and the prayers of the Church, they do prevail.</p>
               <p>Now though it be easie to say, and it is notoriously true in Theology, that the prayers of the Church can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevail, but according to the grace which God hath promis'd; and either can onely procure a blessing upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, in order to their natural effects, or else an extraordinary super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural effect, by vertue of a Divine promise; and that these things are pretended to work beyond their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral force, and yet God hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to them a supernatural blessing (as themselves confess;) yet besides the falseness of the Doctrine, on which these superstitions do rely, it is lso as evident, that these instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalities produce an affiance and confidence in the Creature, and estrange mens hearts from the true Religion and trust in God, while they think themselves blessed in their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,

and in digging to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Cisterns of their own, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fountain of Blessing and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</p>
               <p>To this porpose the Roman Priests abuse the people with Romantick stories out of the Dialogues of S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> and venerable <hi>Bede</hi>; making them believe, that S. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> cur'd a mans broken thigh with Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that S. <hi>Malachias</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Conor,</hi> cur'd a mad-man with the same medicine; and that Saint <hi>Hilarion</hi> cur'd many sick persons with Holy Bread and Oyl (which indeed is the most likely of them all, as being good food, and good medicine;) and although not so much as a Chicken is now a days cur'd of the Pip by Holy Water, yet upon all occasions they use it, and the common people throw it upon Childrens Cradles, and sick Cows Horns, and upon them that are blasted; and if they recover by any means, it is imputed to the Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And so the Simplicity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, the Glory of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100300:140"/>
on God, the Wise Order and Oeconomy of Blessings in the Gospel, the Sacredness and Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Sacraments and Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, are disorder'd and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd: The Bishops and Priests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting both the Word and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, institute a kind of Sacrament, in great derogation to the Supreme Prerogative of Christ; and men are taught to go in ways which Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath invented, and Interest does support.</p>
               <p>But there is yet one great instance more of this irreligion. Upon the Sacraments themselves they are taught to rely, with so little of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Vertuous Dispositions, that the efficacy of one is made to lessen the necessity of the other; and the Sacraments are taught to be so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual by an inherent vertue, that they are not so much made <hi>the instruments</hi> of Vertue, as the <hi>Suppletory</hi>; not so much <hi>to increase,</hi> as <hi>to make amends</hi> for the want of Grace: On which we shall not now insist, because it is sufficiently

               <p>AFter all this, if their Doctrines as they are explicated by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and the Commentaries of their greatest Doctors, do make their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> there is not any thing greater to deter men from them, than that danger to their Souls which is imminent over them, upon that account.</p>
               <p>Their worshipping of Images we have already reprov'd upon the account of its novelty and innovation in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. But that it is against good life, a direct breach of the second Commandment, an Act of Idolatry, as much as the Heathens themselves were guilty of, in relation to the second Commandment, is but too evident by the Doctrines of their own Leaders.</p>
               <p>For if to give Divine honour to a Creature be Idolatry, then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teach

their people to commit Idolatry: For they affirm, That the same worship which is given to the Prototyp or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, the same is to be given to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of it. As we worship the Holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Neither can this be eluded by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that though the same worship be given to the Image of Christ, as to Christ himself, yet it is not done in the same way; for it is <hi>terminatively</hi> to Christ or God, but <hi>relatively</hi> to the image, that is, to the image for God's
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100300:142"/>
or Christs sake. For this is that we complain of, that they give the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame worship to an image, which is due to God; for what cause soever it be done, it matters not, save onely that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse makes it in some sense, the worse for the Apology. For to do a thing which God hath forbidden, and to say it is done for God's sake, is to say, that for his sake we displease him; for his sake we give that to a Creature, which is God's own propriety. But besides this, we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>firm, and it is of it self evident, that whoever, Christian or Heathen, worships the image of any thing, cannot possibly worship that image <hi>terminatively,</hi> for the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an image is <hi>relative</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the man understands but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, he must suppose and intend that worship to be relative, and a Heathen could not worship an image with any other worship; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, forbidding to worship the <hi>likeness of any thing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth,</hi> does onely forbid that thing which is in Heaven to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100300:142"/>
by an image, that is, it forbids onely a relative worship: For it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to say, this is the image of God, and yet this is God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be also a contradiction, to worship an image with Divine worship <hi>terminatively,</hi> for then it must be that the image of a thing, is that thing whose image it is. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Doctors teach the same thing which they condemn in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p>But they go yet a little further: <hi>The Image of the Cross</hi> they worship with Divine honour; and therefore although this Divine worship is but relative, yet cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the Image of the Cross hath it relatively, and for the Crosses sake, therefore the Cross it self is the proper and full object of the Divine adoration. Now that they do and teach this, we charge upon them by undeniable Records: For in the very Pontifical published by the Authority of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100300:143"/>
these words are found, <hi>The Legats Cross must be on the right hand,</hi>

                  <hi>because</hi> Latria, <hi>or Divine honour is due to it.</hi> And if <hi>Divine honour relative</hi> be due to the Legates Cross, which is but the Image of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hrist Cross, then this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship is terminated on Christs Cross, which is certainly but a meer Creature. To this purpose are the words of <hi>Almain, The Images of the Trinity, and of the Cross, are to be ador'd with the worship of</hi> Latria; that is, Divine. Now if the Image of the Cross be the intermedial, then the Cross it self, whose Image that is, must be the last object of this Divine worship; and if this be not Idolatry, it can never be told, what is the notion of the Word. But this passes also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other real effects: And well may the Cross it self be worshipped by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, when the Church places her hopes of salvation on the Cross; for so she does, says <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and makes one the argument of the other, and proves that the Church places her hopes of salvation on the Cross, that

is, on the instrument of Christs Passion, by a hymn which she uses in her offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but this thing we have remark'd above, upon another occasion. Now although things are brought to a very ill state, when Christians are so proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and apparently charg'd with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and that the excuses are too fine to be understood by them that need them; yet no excuse can acquit these things, when the most that is, or can be said is this, that although that which is Gods due, is given to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it is given with some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of intention, and metaphysical abstraction, and separation; especially, since, if there can be Idolatry in the worshipping of an Image, it is certain, that a relative Divine worship is this Idolatry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for no man that worships an Image (in that consideration or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality) can make the Image the last object: Either therefore the Heathens were not Idolaters in the worshipping of an Image, or else these men are. The Heathens did indeed infinitely more violate the first Commandment; but
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100300:144"/>
against the second, precisely and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from the first, the transgression is alike.</p>
               <p>The same also is the case in their worshipping the consecrated Bread and Wine: Of which how far they will be excused before God by their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant pretensions and suppositions, we know not; but they hope to save themselves harmless by saying, that they believe the Bread to be their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and that if they did not believe so, they would not do so. We believe that they say true; but we are afraid that this will no more excuse them, that it will excuse those who worship the Sun and Moon, and the Queen of Heaven, whom they would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, if they did not believe to have Divinity in them: And it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, That they are very fond of that persuasion, by which they are led into this worship. The error might be some excuse, if it were probable, or if there were much temptation to it: But when they choose this persuasion, and have nothing for it but a tropical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression

of Scripture, which rather than not believe in the natural, useless, and impossible sense, they will defie all their own reason, and four of the five operations of their soul, Seeing, Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Tasting and Feeling, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the plain Doctrine of the Ancient Church, before they can consent to believe this error, that Bread is chang'd into God, and the Priest can make his Maker: We have too much cause to fear, that the error is too gross to admit an excuse; and it is hard to suppose it invincible and involuntary, because it is so hard, and so untempting, and so unnatural to admit the error. We do desire that God may find an excuse for it, and that they would not. But this we are most sure of, that they might, if they pleas'd, find many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, or rather just causes for not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Divine honour to the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elements; because there are so many contingencies in the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this affair, and we are so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Priests intention, and we

can never be made certain, that there is not in the whole order of causes any invalidity in the Consecration; and it is so impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any man should be sure that <hi>Here,</hi> and <hi>Now,</hi> and <hi>This</hi> Bread is Transubstantiated, and is really the Natural body of Christ;<note place="margin">

For first, it is affirmed. and was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by a whole Council of Bishops at <hi>Constance,</hi> that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks; and <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>Savanarola,</hi> felt the mischief of violarion of publick faith; and the same thing was dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fiercely at <hi>Worms,</hi> in the case of <hi>Luther,</hi> to whom <hi>Caesar</hi> had given a safe conduct, and very many would have had it to be broken; but <hi>Caesar</hi> was a better Christian than the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks and their party, and more a Gentleman. But that no scrupulous Princes may keep their words any more in such cases, or think themselves tied to perform their safe conducts given to Hereticks, there is a way found out by a new Catholick Doctrine; <hi>Becanus</hi> shall speak this point instead of the rest,<note place="margin">

               <p>As the Pope by his Dispensations undertakes to dissolve the Ordinances of God; so also the most solemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of men: Of which a very great instance was given by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VII. who dispensed with the Oath which <hi>Francis</hi> the I. of <hi>France</hi> solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swore to <hi>Charls</hi> the V. Emperor, after the Battel of <hi>Pavy,</hi> and gave him leave to be perjur'd.

               </p>
               <p>And now if it be considered, what influence these Doctrines have upon Societies and Communities of men, they will need no further reproof than a meer enumeration of the mischiefs they produce. They by this means legitimate adulterous and incestuous marriages, and disanul lawful Contracts: They give leave to a Spouse to break his or her Vow and Promise; and to Children to disobey their Parents, and perhaps to break their Mothers heart, or to undo a Family. No words can bind your faith, because you can be dispens'd with; and if you swear you will not procure a
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100300:153"/>
Dispensation, you can as well be dispens'd with for that perjury as the other; and you cannot be tied so fast, but the Pope can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loose you. So that there is no certainty in your promise to God, or faith to men, in Judicatories to Magistrates, or in Contracts with Merchants; in the duty of Children to their Parents, of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to their Wives, or Wives to their contracted Husbands, of a Catholick to a Heretick; and last of all a Subject to his Prince cannot be bound so strictly, but if the Prince be not of the Popes persuasion, or be by him judg'd a Tyrant, his Subjects shall owe him no obedience. But this is of particular consideration, and reserv'd for the III. Sect.</p>

               <p>THere is yet another instance, by which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable prejudice to Governments and Societies: In which although the Impiety is not so apparent; yet the evil is more own'd, and notorious, and defended; and that is, the Exemption of their Clergy from the Jurisdiction of Secular Princes and Magistrates, both in their Estates and Persons: Not onely in the matters of Simony, Heresie, and Apostasie, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Theft, Perjury, Murther, Adultery, Blasphemy and Treason: In which cases they suffer not a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy man to be judged by the Secular power, untill the Church hath quit him, and turn'd him over, and given them leave to proceed.

               <p>And here we observe, That not onely the whole Order of Jesuits is a great enemy to Monarchy, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Dignity of Princes to the Pope, by making the Pope the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Monarch of Christians; but they also teach, That it is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine, the Doctrine of the Church.</p>

               <p>Now we are sure it will be said, That this is but the private opinion of some Doctors, not the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To this we reply: 1. It is not the private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a few, but their publick Doctrine own'd, and offer'd to be justified to all the World, as appears in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding testimonies. 2.

it is a Heresie in the judgement of all Catholicks. Now in such things which are not in their Creeds, and publick Confessions, from whence should we know the Doctrines of their Church, but from their chiefest and most leading Doctors; who it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, would fain have all the World believe it to be the Doctrine of their Church? And therefore as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that any Roman Catholick may with allowance be of this opinion; so he will be esteemed the better and more zealous Catholick if he be; and if it were not for fear of Princes, who will not lose their Crowns for their foolish Doctrines, there is no perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture but it would be declared to be <hi>de fide,</hi> a matter of faith, as divers of them of late, do not stick to say. And of this the Pope gives but too much evidence, since he will not take away the scandal, which is so greatly given to all Christian Kings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, by a publick and a just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of it.

               <p>It is true, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does recriminate in this point, and charges some <hi>Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> with Doctrines which indeed they borrowed from <hi>Rome,</hi> using their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, making use of their Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pursuing their Principles.
