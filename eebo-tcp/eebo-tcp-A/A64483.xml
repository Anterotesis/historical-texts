            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

preſide over every little room, yet the whole houſe was dedicated to ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Guardian: This Diſtinction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded either from a real inequality of Power in the Protectors, or from the difference of thoſe benefits which They were ſuppoſ'd to have actually bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As to the former conſideration, every one that knows my Friends will eaſily allow that each ſingly is ſufficient for the whole, tho, by reaſon of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, a great task: But the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Sir,</hi> gives You the preference, and Gratitude forceth me to believe his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to be greateſt, who hath moſt often, and most ſignally expreſt it: Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable private Favours I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame way they were beſtow'd, and ſpare your Modeſty and my own: for otherwiſe it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

thought there was ſome thing in my felf worth your notice; or elſe I muſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly proclaim, that You (which tho 'tis really your Caſe, yet very few can boaſt) are kind and generous without any proſpect of return: But thoſe which properly relate to the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion I muſt beg leave to mention, ſince <hi>Pliny,</hi> and all agree, hath ſeverely noted as the greatest Ingratitude not to acknowledge to whom we owe what we have attain'd; and it would argue stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity to run wilfully on that Cenſure, which hath been ſo justly pass'd, and ſo much applauded.</p>
            <p>You may remember <hi>Sir</hi> how often, when the publick Cares of your well-managed Office would permit you to retreat, we have retir'd to a Grove, where Quiet ſpreads all around, and a

ſpringing verdure, and chequer'd va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to raiſe the Thoughts and recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Fancy; whilſt ſoft breezes mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd thro the Trees, which, like our Affections, ſerv'd only to intermix, but never to ſhatter or diſturb: There I have enjoy'd whatever the Poets could imagine, a free innocent, and inſtructive diſcourſe, ſuch as reform'd my Errors, and incourag'd thoſe Eſſays which you was pleas'd to think endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors after vertue; till then I envied the happineſs of the deſcribed Swains, and lookt on <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Theocritus</hi> as diſturbers of Man kind, who elaborately deſcrib'd the most perfect and ſurprizing Beautys, but gave us no Hopes either to ſee or to enjoy. The Golden age was their ſcene, and 'twas neceſſary to look beyond <hi>Jupiter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:45071:4"/>
to find any thing innocent or pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and how tedious ſuch a ſearch muſt be; every one may imagine, who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that 'tis very hard to take ſo large a proſpect, eſpecially when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a bare Contemplation to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, and reward his Diligence. The time Sir, I found brought back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by your converſation, and all thoſe difficulties (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) which were ſo even to a Proverb, practically explain'd: ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in this performance is drawn ſoft, innocent, and pleaſing; is but a Copy from You the Original: This is the happineſs that attends polite Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſmooths all the natural Aſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Humor and Paſſion, and ſpreads an obligeing tenderneſs thro the whole Man, And where the Cauſe

               <p>TO be as ſhort as poſſible in my diſcourſe upon the preſent Subject, I ſhall not touch upon the Excellency of <hi>Poetry</hi> in general; nor repeat thoſe high <hi>Encomiums,</hi> (as that tis the moſt divine of all human Arts, and the like) which <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Jone, Ariſtotele</hi> in his <hi>Poetica,</hi> and other Learned men have copiouſly inſiſted on: And this I do that I might more cloſely and briefly purſue my preſent deſign, which, no doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will not pleaſe every man; for ſince I treat of that part of <hi>Poetry,</hi> which (to uſe <hi>Quintilian's</hi> words) by reaſon of its Clowniſhneſs, is affraid of the Court and City; ſome may imagine that I follow <hi>Nichocaris</hi> his humor, who would paint only the moſt ugly and deform'd, and thoſe too in the meaneſt and moſt frightful dreſs, that real, or fancy'd Poverty could put them in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45071:6"/>For ſome think that to be a Sheapard is in it ſelf mean, baſe, and ſordid; And this I think is the firſt thing that the graver and ſoberer ſort will be ready to object.</p>
               <p>But if we conſider how honorable that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is, our Objectors from that Topick will be eaſily anſwer'd: for as <hi>Heroick</hi> Poems owe their dignity to the Quality of <hi>Heroes,</hi> ſo <hi>Paſtorals</hi> to that of <hi>Sheapards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to manifeſt this, I ſhall not rely on the authority of the <hi>Fabulous,</hi> and <hi>Heroick</hi> Ages, tho, in the former, a God fed Sheep in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and in the latter, <hi>Hercules</hi> the Prince of <hi>Heroes,</hi> (as <hi>Paterculus</hi> ſtiles him) graz'd on mount <hi>Aventine:</hi> Theſe Examples, tis true, are not convinceing, yet they ſufficiently ſhew that the employment of a Sheapard was ſometime look'd upon to be ſuch, as in thoſe Fabulous times was not alltogether unbecomeing the <hi>Dignity</hi> of a <hi>Heroe,</hi> or the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of a <hi>God:</hi> which conſideration if it cannot be of force enough to procure excellence, yet certainly it may ſecure it from the imputation of baſeneſs, ſince it was ſometime lookt upon as fit for the greateſt in Earth or Heaven.</p>
               <p>But not to inſiſt on the authority of <hi>Poets, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writt</hi> tells us that <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> two great men, were Sheapards; And <hi>Amos,</hi> one of the Royal Family, aſſerts the ſame of himſelf, for <hi>He was</hi> among <hi>the Sheapards of Tecua,</hi> following that employment: The like by Gods own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45071:6"/>
prepared <hi>Moſes</hi> for a Scepter, as <hi>Philo</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates in his life, when He tells us, <hi>that a Sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards Art is a ſuitable preparation to a Kingdome</hi>; the ſame He mentions in the Life of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the care a Sheapard hath over his Cattle, very much reſembles that which a King hath over his Subjects: The ſame <hi>Baſil</hi> in his Homily de <hi>S. Mamm. Martyre</hi> hath concerning <hi>David,</hi> who was taken from following the Ews great with young ones to feed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for He ſays that the Art of feeding and governing are very near akin, and even Siſters: And upon this account I ſuppoſe twas, that Kings amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> reckoned the name of Sheapard one of their greateſt titles, for, if we believe <hi>Varro,</hi> amongſt the Antients, the beſt and braveſt was ſtill a Sheapard: Every body knows that the <hi>Romans</hi> the worthieſt and greateſt Nation in the World ſprang from <hi>Sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards:</hi> The Augury of the Twelve Vulturs plac't a Scepter in <hi>Romulus</hi>'s hand which held a Crook before; and at that time, as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſays,
<q>His own ſmall Flock each Senator did keep.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucretius</hi> mentions an extraordinary happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and as it were Divinity in a <hi>Sheaperd</hi>'s life,
<q>Thro Sheapards eaſe, and their Divine retreats.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the reaſon, I ſuppoſe, why the ſolitude of the Country, the ſhady Groves, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of that happy Quiet was ſo grateful to the Muſes, for thus <hi>Horace</hi> repreſents them,

               <p>And to ſpeak from the very bottome of my heart, (not to mention the integrity and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Sheapards upon which ſo many have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and ſo copiouſly declaimed) methinks he is much more happy in a Wood, that at eaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates this univerſe, as his own, and in it, the Sun and Stars, the pleaſing Meadows, ſhady Groves, green Banks, ſtately Trees, flowing Springs, and the wanton windings of a River, fit objects for quiet innocence, than he that with Fire and Sword diſturbs the World, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures his poſſeſſions by the waſt that lys about him: <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in the remoteſt Eaſt fights for peace, but how tedious were his Voyages? how troubleſome his Marches? how great his diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets? what fears and hopes diſtracted his deſigns? whilſt <hi>Tityrus</hi> contented with a little, happy in the enjoyment of his Love, and at eaſe under his ſpreading Beech.</p>

<q>Whilſt under <hi>Helicon</hi> he fed his Lambs.</q>
for either the leiſure, or fancy of Shepherds ſeems to have a natural aptitude to Verſe.</p>
               <p>And indeed I cannot but agree with <hi>Lucretius</hi> that accurate Searcher into Nature, who delivers that from that ſtate of Innocence the Golden Age, Paſtorals continued down to his time, for after he had in his fifth book deſcrib'd that moſt happy age, he adds,

               <p>NOw let us inquire into the nature of <hi>Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> in what its excellencies conſiſt, and how it muſt be made to be exact: And this muſt needs be a hard Task, ſince I have no guide, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> nor <hi>Horace</hi> to direct me, for both they, whatever was the matter, ſpeak not one word of this ſort of Verſe. And I am of opinion that none can treat well and clearly of any kind of <hi>Poetry</hi> if he hath no helps from theſe two: But ſince they lay down ſome general Notions of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry</hi> which may be uſeful in the preſent caſe, I ſhall follow their ſteps as cloſe as poſſible I can.</p>
               <p>Not only <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> but <hi>Horace</hi> too hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd that <hi>Poetry</hi> in general is Imitation; I mention only theſe two, for tho <hi>Plato</hi> in his Second Book <hi>de Rep.</hi> and in his <hi>Timoeus</hi> delivers the ſame thing, I ſhall not make uſe of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at all: Now as <hi>Comedy</hi> according to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> is the <hi>Image and Repreſentation of a gentiel and City Life,</hi> ſo is <hi>Paſtoral Poetry</hi> of a County and <hi>Sheapards</hi> Life; for ſince <hi>Poetry</hi> in general is Imitation; its ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> muſt likewiſe Imitate, take <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> own words <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45071:13"/>
differenc't either by the ſubject matter, when the things to be imitated are quite different, or when the manner in which you imitate, or the mode of imitation is ſo: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Thus tho of <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry and <hi>Tragedy</hi> the Subject is the ſame, and ſome great illuſtrious Action is to be <hi>imitated</hi> by both, yet ſince one by repreſentation, and the other by plain narration imitates, each makes a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Species</hi> of imitation. And <hi>Comedy</hi> and <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> tho they agree in this, that both repreſent, yet becauſe the Matter is different, and <hi>Tragedy</hi> muſt repreſent ſome brave action, and <hi>Comedy</hi> a humor; theſe Two ſorts of imitation are <hi>Specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally different.</hi> And upon the ſame account, ſince <hi>Paſtoral</hi> chooſes the mannes of Sheapards for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>But here <hi>Benius</hi> in his comments upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath ſtarted a conſiderable query: which is this; Whether <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when be reckons up the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Species</hi> of Poetry <hi>Cap</hi> 1. doth include <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> or no? And about this I find learn'd men cannot at all agree: which certainly <hi>Benius</hi> ſhould have determin'd, or not rais'd: ſome refer it to that ſort which <hi>was ſung to Pipes,</hi> for that <hi>Paſtorals</hi> were ſo <hi>Apuleius</hi> intimates, when at the marriage Feaſt of <hi>Phyche</hi> He brings in <hi>Paniſcus</hi> ſinging <hi>Bucolicks</hi> to his Pipe: But ſince they did not ſeriouſly enough conſider, what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45071:14"/>
meant by that which he calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now there may be more kinds of Subjects than <hi>Servius</hi> or <hi>Donatus</hi> allow, for they confine us to that Number which <hi>Virgil</hi> hath made uſe of, tho <hi>Minturnus</hi> in his ſecond Book <hi>de Poetâ</hi> declares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this opinion: But as a glorious <hi>Heroick</hi> action muſt be the Subject of an <hi>Heroick</hi> Poem, ſo a <hi>Paſtoral</hi> action of a <hi>Paſtoral</hi>; at leaſt it muſt be ſo turn'd and wrought, that it might appear to be the action of a <hi>Shepherd;</hi> which caution is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary to be obſerv'd, to clear a great many difficulties in this matter: for tho as the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters aſſure us; moſt of <hi>Virgils</hi> Eclogues are about the Civil war, planting Colonys, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Emperor, and the like, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are too great and too lofty for humble <hi>Paſtoral</hi> to reach, yet becauſe they are accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the Genius of Shepherds, may be the Subject of an <hi>Eclogue,</hi> for that ſometimes will admit of Gods and Heroes ſo they appear like, and are ſhrouded under the Perſons of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds: But as for theſe matters which neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are, nor are ſo wrought as to ſeem the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Shepherds, ſuch are in <hi>Moſchus</hi>'s <hi>Europa, Theocritus</hi>'s <hi>Epithalamium of Helen,</hi> and <hi>Virgil's Pollio,</hi> to declare my opinion freely, I cannot think them to be fit Subjects for <hi>Bucolicks:</hi> And upon this account I ſuppoſe 'tis that <hi>Servius</hi> in his

               <p>I ſhall not here enquire, tho it may ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per whether we can decently bring into an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue Reapers, Vine-dreſſers, Gardners, Fowlers, Hunters, Fiſhers, or the like, whoſe lives for the moſt part are taken up with too much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and employment to have any vacant time for Songs, and idle Chat, which are more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the leiſure of a Sheapards Life: for in a great many Ruſtick affairs, either the hardſhip and painful Labor will not admit a ſong, as in Plowing, or the ſolitude as in hunting, Fiſhing, Fowling, and the like; but of this I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more largely in another place.</p>

               <p>Now I ſhall explain what ſort of <hi>Fable; Manners, Thought, Expreſſion,</hi> which four are neceſſary to conſſtitute every kind of Poetry, are proper to this ſort.</p>

               <p>I have but one thing to ſay: this, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher hints, as of all other ſorts of Poetry, ſo of Paſtoral is the very Soul: and therfore <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, that in thoſe Verſes which he had made there was nothing wanting but the <hi>Fable</hi>: therefore Paſtorals as other kinds of Poetry muſt have their Fable, if they will be Poetry: Thus in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Silenus</hi> which contains the Stories of all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole Fabulous Age, two Shepherds whom <hi>Silenus</hi> had often promis'd a Song, and as often deceiv'd, ſeize upon him being drunk and aſleep, and bind him with wreath'd Flowers; <hi>Aegle</hi> comes in and incourages the timorous youths, and ſtains his jolly red F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
               <p>Thus every Eclogue or Idyllium muſt have its Fable, which muſt be the groundwork of the whole deſign, but it muſt not be perplext with ſudden and unlookt for changes, as in <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s <hi>Adonis</hi>: for that, tho the <hi>Fable</hi> be of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, yet by reaſon of the ſtrange Bombaſt under Plots, and wonderful occurences, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Paſtoral;</hi> for that it might be agreeable to the Perſon it treats of, it muſt be plain and ſimple, ſuch as <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s <hi>Ajax,</hi> in which there ls not ſo much as one change of Fortune.</p>
               <p>As for the Manners, let that precept, which <hi>Horace</hi> lays down in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Piſones,</hi> be principally obſerved.</p>
               <q>Let each be grac't with that which ſuits him beſt.</q>

ſay what he will in their excuſe, it cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: For 'tis againſt <hi>Minturnus</hi>'s Opinion, who in his ſecond Book <hi>de Poetâ</hi> ſays thus: <hi>Mean Perſons are brought in, thoſe in Comedy indeed more polite, thoſe in Paſtorals more unelegant, as ſuppos'd to lead a rude life in Solitude</hi>; and <hi>Jaſon Denor</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Padua</hi> takes notice of the ſame as a very abſurd Error: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> heretofore for a like fault reprehended the <hi>Megarenſians,</hi> who obſerv'd no <hi>Decorum</hi> in their <hi>Theater,</hi> but brought in mean perſons with a Train fit for a <hi>King,</hi> and cloath'd a Cobler or Tinker in a Purple Robe: Invain doth <hi>Veratus</hi> in his Diſpute againſt <hi>Jaſon Denor,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thoſe elaborately exquiſite diſcourſes, and notable ſublime ſentences of his <hi>Paſtor Fido,</hi> bring ſome lofty <hi>Idylliums</hi> of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> for thoſe are not acknowledged to be Paſtoral; <hi>Theocritus</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> muſt be conſulted in this matter, the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigndly makes his Shepherds diſcourſe in the <hi>Dorick</hi> i. e. the Ruſtick Dialect, ſometimes ſcarce true Grammar; &amp; the other ſtudiouſly affects ignorance in the perſons of his Shepherds, as <hi>Servius</hi> hath obſerv'd, and is evident in <hi>Meliboeus,</hi> who makes <hi>Oaxes</hi> to be a River in <hi>Crete</hi> when 'tis in <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia</hi>: and both of them take this way that the Manners may the more exactly ſuit with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they repreſent, who of themſelves are rude and unpoliſht: And this proves that they ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly err, who make their Shepherds appear polite and elegant, nor can I imagine what <hi>Veratus</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45071:21"/>
who makes ſo much ado about the polite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Shepherds, would ſay to <hi>Polybius</hi> who tells us that the <hi>Arcadians</hi> by reaſon of the Mountainouſneſs of the Country and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the weather, are very unſociable and auſtere.</p>
               <p>Now as too much neatneſs in <hi>Paſtoral</hi> is not to be allow'd, ſo ruſticity (I do not mean that which <hi>Plato,</hi> in his Third Book of a Common-wealth, mentions which is but a part of a down right honeſty) but Clowniſh ſtupidity, ſuch as <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> in his Character of a <hi>Ruſtick,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes; or that diſagreeable unfaſhionable rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which <hi>Horace</hi> mentions in his Epiſtle to <hi>Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> muſt not in my opinion be endur'd: On this ſide <hi>Mantuan</hi> errs extreamly, and is intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably abſur'd, who makes Shepherds blockiſhly ſottiſh, and inſufferably rude: And a certain Interpreter blames <hi>Theocritus</hi> for the ſame thing, who in ſome mens opinion ſometimes keeps too cloſe to the <hi>Clown,</hi> and is ruſtick and uncouth; But this may be very well excus'd becauſe the Age in which he ſang was not as polite as now.</p>
               <p>But that every Part may be ſuitable to a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, we muſt conſult unſtain'd, uncorrupted Nature; ſo that the manners might not be too Clowniſh nor too Caurtly: And this mean may be eaſily obſerved if the manners of our Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds be repreſented according to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>golden Age,</hi> in which, if <hi>Guarinus</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,

every man follow'd that employment: And <hi>Nannius</hi> in the Preface to his Comments on <hi>Virgils Bucolicks</hi> is of the ſame opinion, for he requires that the manners might repreſent the Golden Age: and this was the reaſon that <hi>

               <p>Let the Expreſſion be plain and eaſy, but ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and neat, and the pureſt which the language will afford; <hi>Pontanus</hi> upon <hi>Virgils</hi> Buco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks gives the very ſame rule, <hi>In Bucolicks the Expreſſion muſt be humble, nearer common diſcourſe than otherwiſe, not very Spirituous and vivid, yet ſuch as ſhows life and ſtrength:</hi> Tis certain that <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> in his <hi>Bucolicks</hi> uſeth the ſame words which <hi>Tully</hi> did in the <hi>Forum</hi> or the <hi>Senate:</hi> and <hi>Tityrus</hi> beneath his ſhady Beech ſpeaks as pure and good <hi>Latin</hi> as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in his Palace, as <hi>Modicius</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>Virgil</hi> hath excellently obſerv'd:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45071:23"/>
This rule, 'tis true; <hi>Theocritus</hi> hath not ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow'd, whoſe Ruſtick and Paſtoral Muſe, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> phraſeth it, <hi>not only is affraid to appear in the</hi> Forum, <hi>but the City</hi>: and for the very ſame thing an <hi>Alexandrian</hi> flouts the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſian Weomen</hi> in the Fifteenth <hi>Idyllium</hi> of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi> for when they, being then in the City, ſpoke the <hi>Dorick</hi> Dialect, the delicate Citizen could not endure it, and found fault with their diſtaſtful, as he thought, pronunciation: and his reflection was very ſmart.</p>

               <p>So intolerable did that broad way of pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, tho exactly fit for a Clowns diſcourſe, ſeem to a Citizen: and hence <hi>Probus</hi> obſerves that 'twas much harder for the <hi>Latines</hi> to write <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> than for the <hi>Greeks;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Latines</hi> had not ſome <hi>Dialects</hi> peculiar to the Country, and others to the City, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> had; Beſides the <hi>Latine</hi> Language, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> hath obſerv'd, is not capable of the neatneſs which is neceſſary to Bucolicks, no, that is the peculiar priviledge of the <hi>Greeks: We cannot,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be ſo low, they exceed us in ſubtlety, and in propriety they are at more certainty than We</hi>: and again, <hi>in pat and cloſe Expreſſions we cannot reach the Greeks.</hi> And, if we believe <hi>Tully, Greek is much more fit for Ornament than Latin,</hi> for it hath much more of that neatneſs, end

and raviſhing delightfulneſs, which <hi>Bucolicks</hi> neceſſarily require.</p>
               <p>Yet of Paſtoral, with whoſe Nature we are not very well acquainted, what that <hi>Form</hi> is which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call the <hi>Character,</hi> is not very eaſy to determine; yet that we may come to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, we muſt ſtick to our former obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Paſtoral</hi> belongs properly to the <hi>Golden Age:</hi> For as <hi>Tully</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de Oratore</hi> ſays, <hi>in all our diſputes the ſubject is to be meaſur'd by the moſt perfect of that kind,</hi> and <hi>Syncſius</hi> in his <hi>Encomium</hi> on <hi>Baldneſs</hi> hints the very ſame, when he tells us that Poetry faſhions its ſubject as Men imagine it ſhould be, and not as really it is: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: Now the Life of a Shepherd, that it might be rais'd to the higheſt perfection, is to be referr'd to the manners and age of the world whilſt yet innocent, and ſuch as the Fables have deſcrib'd it: And as Simplicity was the principal vertue of that Age, ſo it ought to be the peculiar Grace, and as it were <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Bucolicks:</hi> in which the Fable, Manners, Thought, and Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be full of the moſt innocent ſimplicity imaginable: for as Innocence in Life, ſo purity and ſimplicity in diſcourſe was the Glory of that Age: So as gravity to <hi>Epicks,</hi> Sweetneſs to <hi>Lyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks,</hi> Humor to <hi>Comedy,</hi> ſoftneſs to <hi>Elegies,</hi> and ſmartneſs to <hi>Epigrams,</hi> ſo ſimplicity to <hi>Paſtorals</hi> is proper; and one upon <hi>Theocritus</hi> ſays, <hi>that the Idea of his Bucolicks is in every part pure, and in all

Than which in my opinion nothing can be more ſimply; nothing more ruſtically ſaid; and this is the reaſon I ſuppoſe why <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſays that this kind of Poetry is creeping and upon mean ſubjects: and why too <hi>Virgils Tityrus</hi> lying under his ſhady Beech diſpleaſeth ſome; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Criticks indeed, whom I wiſh a little more ſenſe, that they might not really be, what they would not ſeem to be, <hi>Ridiculous: Theocritus</hi> excells <hi>Virgil</hi> in this, of whom <hi>Modicius</hi> ſays, <hi>Theocritus deſerves tht greateſt commendation for his happy imitation of the ſimplicity of his Shepherds,</hi> Virgil <hi>hath mixt Allegories, and ſome other things which contain too much learning, and deepneſs of Thought for Perſons of ſo mean a Quality</hi>: Yet here I muſt obviate their miſtake who fancy that this ſort of <hi>Poetry,</hi> becauſe in it ſelf low and ſimple, is the proper work of <hi>mean</hi> Wits, and not the moſt <hi>ſublime</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> perfections: For as I think there be can nothing more elegant than eaſy naked ſimplicity, ſo likewiſe nothing can require more ſtrength of Wit, and greater pains; and he muſt be of a great and clear judgment, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> and comes of with Honor: For there is no part of <hi>Poetry</hi> that requires more ſpirit, for if any part is not cloſe and well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted the whole Fabrick will be ruin'd, and the

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45071:25"/>
and breakings off in the ſeries of a <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> it can neither be pleaſing nor artificial: And in my Opinion <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil</hi> excells <hi>Theocritus</hi> in this, for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> is neither ſo continued, nor ſo long as <hi>Theocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>; who indulges too much the garrulity of his <hi>Greek</hi>; nay even in thoſe things which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth he is more cloſe, and more cautiouſly conceals that part which ought to be diſſembled: And this I am ſure is a moſt admirable part of Eloquence; as <hi>Tully</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Atticus</hi> ſays, <hi>Tis rare to ſpeak Eloquently, but more rare to be elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſilent:</hi> And this unskillful <hi>Criticks</hi> are not acquainted with, and therefore are wont oftner to find fault with that which is not fitly expreſt, than commend that which is prudently conceal'd: I could heap up a great many more things to this purpoſe, but I ſee no need of ſuch a trouble, ſince no man can rationally doubt of the goodneſs of my Obſervation: Therefore, in ſhort, let him that writes Paſtorals think brevity, if it doth not obſcure his ſenſe, to be the greateſt grace which he can attain.</p>
               <p>Now why <hi>Bucolicks</hi> ſhould require ſuch Brevity, and be ſo eſſentially ſparing in <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> I ſee no other reaſon but this; It loves <hi>Simplicity</hi> ſo much that it muſt be averſe to that Pomp and Oſtentation which <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry muſt ſhow, for that muſt be copious and flowing, in every part ſmooth, and equal to it ſelf: But <hi>Paſtoral</hi> muſt diſſemble, and hide even that which it would
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45071:26"/>
ſhow, like <hi>Damon's Galatea,</hi> who flies then when ſhe moſt deſires to be diſcovered.</p>
               <q>And to the Buſhes flys, yet would be ſeen.</q>
               <p>And this doth not proceed from any malitious ill-natur'd Coyneſs, as ſome imagine, but from an ingenuous modeſty and baſhfulneſs, which uſually accompanies, and is a proof of <hi>Simplicity: Tis very rare,</hi> ſays <hi>Pliny, to find a man ſo exquiſitely skillful, as to be able to ſhow thoſe Features in a Picture which he hides</hi>; and I think it to be ſo difficult a task, that none but the moſt excellent Wits can attempt it with ſucceſs: For ſmall Wits uſually abound with a multitude of words.</p>
               <p>The third Grace of <hi>Bucolicks</hi> is <hi>Neatneſs,</hi> which contains all the taking prettineſs and ſweetneſs of Expreſſion, and whatſoever is call'd the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies of the more delightful and pleaſing <hi>Muſes:</hi> This the Rural <hi>Muſes</hi> beſtow'd on <hi>Virgil,</hi> as <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace</hi> in the tenth <hi>Satyr</hi> of his firſt Book ſays,
<q>
                     <l>And <hi>Virgils</hi> happy Muſe in Eclogues plays,</l>
                     <l>Soft and facetious;</l>
                  </q>
Which <hi>Fabius</hi> takes to ſignify the moſt taking neatneſs and moſt exquiſite Elegance imaginable: For thus he explains this place, in which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with <hi>Tully,</hi> who in his <hi>Third Book de Oratore,</hi> ſays, the <hi>Atticks</hi> are Facetious <hi>i. e.</hi> elegant: Tho the common Interpreters of theſe words are not of the ſame mind: But if by <hi>Facetious Horace</hi> had meant <hi>jeſting,</hi> and ſuch as is deſign'd to make men laugh, and apply'd that to <hi>Virgil,</hi> nothing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45071:26"/>
could have been more ridiculous; 'tis the deſign of <hi>Comedy</hi> to raiſe laughter, but <hi>Eclogue</hi> ſhould only delight, and charm by its takeing <hi>prettineſs</hi>: All raviſhing <hi>Delicacies</hi> of Thought, all ſweetneſs of Expreſſion, all that Salt from which <hi>Venus,</hi> as the Poets Fable, roſe; are ſo eſſential to this kind of <hi>Poetry,</hi> that it cannot endure any thing that is ſcurillous, malitiouſly biteing, or ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: There muſt be nothing in it but <hi>Hony, Milk, Roſes, Violets,</hi> and the like ſweetneſs, ſo that when you read you might think that you are in <hi>Adonis</hi>'s Gardens, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the moſt pleaſant place imaginable: For ſince the ſubject of <hi>Eclogue</hi> muſt be mean and unſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, unleſs it maintains purity and neatneſs of Expreſſion, it cannot pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore it muſt do as <hi>Tully</hi> ſays his friend <hi>Atticus</hi> did, who entertaining his acquaintance with Leeks and Onions, pleas'd them all very well, becauſe he had them ſerv'd up in wicker Chargers, and clean Baskets; So let an <hi>Eclogue</hi> ſerve up its fruits and flowers with ſome, tho no coſtly imbelliſhment, ſuch as may anſwer to the wicker Chargers, and Baskets; which may be provided at a cheap rate, and are agreeable to the Country: yet, (and this rule if you aim at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſimplicity, can never be too nicely obſerv'd,) you muſt moſt carefully avoid all paint and gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of Expreſſion, and, (which of all ſorts of Elegancies is the moſt difficult to be avoided)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45071:27"/>
you muſt take the greateſt care that no ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous trimneſs; or artificial fineſſeſs appear: For, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> teaches, <hi>in ſome caſes diligence and care are moſt troubleſomly perverſe</hi>; and when things are moſt ſweet they are next to loathſome and many times degenerate: Therefore as in Weomen a careleſs dreſs becomes ſome extreamly. Thus <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> that it might not be uncomely, ought ſometimes to be negligent, or the fineſs of its orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought not to appear and lye open to every bodies view: ſo that it ought to affect a ſtudied careleſsneſs, and deſign'd negligence: And that this may be, all gawdineſs of Dreſs, ſuch as Paint and Curls, all artificial ſhining is to be deſpis'd, but in the mean time care muſt be taken that the Expreſſion be bright and ſimply clean, not filthy and diſguſtful, but ſuch as is varniſht with Wit and Fancy: Now to perfect this, <hi>Nature</hi> is chiefly to be lookt upon, (for nothing that is diſagreeable to Nature can pleaſe) yet that will hardly prevail naked, by it ſelf, and without the poliſhing of Art.</p>
               <p>Then there are three things in which, as in its parts, the whole <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Paſtoral</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd: <hi>Simplicity</hi> of Thought and expreſſion: <hi>Shortneſs</hi> of Periods full of ſenſe and ſpirit: and the <hi>Delicacy</hi> of a moſt elegant raviſhing unaffected neatneſs.</p>
               <p>Next I will enquire into the <hi>Efficient,</hi> and then into the <hi>Final</hi> Cauſe of <hi>Paſtorals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45071:27"/>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſigns two efficient Cauſes of <hi>Poetry,</hi> The natural deſire of Imitation in Man whom he calls the moſt imitative Creature; and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conſequent to that Imitation: Which indeed are the <hi>Remote</hi> Cauſes, but the <hi>Immediate</hi> are <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi>; Now according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of <hi>Genius</hi>'s ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> of Poetry have been introduc'd: For as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Thus thoſe that were lofty imitated great and Illuſtrious; thoſe that were low ſpirited and groveling mean Actions: And every one, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inclination of his <hi>Nature,</hi> follow'd this or that ſort of <hi>Poetry:</hi> This the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> expreſly affirms, And <hi>Dio Chryſoſtomus</hi> ſays of <hi>Homer</hi> that he received from the Gods a Nature fit for all ſorts of Verſe: but this is an happineſs which none partake but, as he in the ſame place inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, Godlike minds.</p>
               <p>Not to mention other kinds of <hi>Poetry,</hi> what particular Genius is requir'd to <hi>Paſtoral</hi> I think, is evident from the foregoing Diſcourſe, for as every part of it ought to be full of ſimple and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial neatneſs, ſo it requires a Wit naturally neat and pleaſant, born to delight and raviſh, which are the qualifications certainly of a great and moſt excellent Nature: For whatſoever in any kind is delicate and elegant, that is uſually moſt excellent: And ſuch a <hi>Genius</hi> that hath a ſprightfulneſs of Nature, and is well inſtructed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45071:28"/>
by the rules of Art, is fit to attempt <hi>Paſtorals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the end of Paſtorals tis not ſo eaſy to give an account: For as to the end of Poetry in Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral: The Enemies of Poets run out into a large common place, and loudly tell us that Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is frivolous and unprofitable. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men! that love <hi>profit</hi> perchance, but have no regard for <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> who do not know that all excellent <hi>Arts</hi> ſprang from <hi>Poetry</hi> at firſt.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Which what is honeſt, baſe, or juſt, or good,</l>
                  <l>Better than <hi>Crantor,</hi> or <hi>Chryſippus</hi> ſhow'd.</l>
               </q>
               <p>For tis <hi>Poetry</hi> that like a chaſt unſpotted Virgin, ſhews men the way, and the means to live happily, who afterward are deprav'd by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt precepts of vitiated and impudent <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</hi> For every body knows, that the <hi>Epick</hi> ſets before us the higheſt example of the Braveſt man; the <hi>Tragedian</hi> regulates the Affections of the Mind; the <hi>Lyrick</hi> reforms Manners, or ſings the Praiſes of Gods, and Heroes; ſo that there's no part of <hi>Poetry</hi> but hath its proper end, and profits.</p>
               <p>But grant all this true, <hi>Paſtoral</hi> can make no ſuch pretence: if you ſing a <hi>Hero,</hi> you excite mens minds to imitate his Actions, and notable Exploits; but how can <hi>Bucolicks</hi> apply theſe or the like advantages to its ſelf? <hi>He that reads
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45071:28"/>
Heroick Poems, learns what is the vertue of a Hero<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wiſhes to be like him; but he that reads Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, neither learns how to feed ſheep, nor wiſhes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Shepherd:</hi> And a great deal more to this purpoſe you may ſee in <hi>Modicius,</hi> as <hi>Pontanus</hi> cites him in his Notes on <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Eclogues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when tis the end of <hi>Comedy,</hi> as <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Furia</hi> ſays, to know the Humors of Men, and to deſcribe them; and <hi>Demea</hi> in <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> intimates the ſame thing,

ſo that our Humors and Converſations may be better'd, and improv'd; why may not <hi>Paſtoral</hi> be allow'd the ſame Priviledge, and be admitted to regulate and improve a <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s life by its <hi>Bucolicks?</hi> For ſince tis a product of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Age, it will ſhew the moſt innocent manners of the moſt ancient Simplicity, how plain and honeſt, and how free from all varniſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to Government, that as there is one kind of <hi>Poetry</hi> to inſtruct the <hi>Citizens,</hi> there ſhould be another to faſhion the manners of the <hi>Ruſticks:</hi> which if <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> as it does, did not do, yet would it not be altogether frivolous, and idle, ſince by its taking prettineſſes it can delight, and pleaſe. It can ſcarce be imagin'd, how much the moſt flouriſhing times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, in which <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote, grew better and brisker by the uſe of <hi>Paſtoral:</hi> with it were <hi>Auguſtus, Mecaenas, Aſinius Pollio, Alphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Varus, Cornelius Gallus,</hi> the moſt admired Wits of that happy Age, wonderfully pleas'd; for whatever is ſweet, and raviſhing, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this ſweeteſt kind of Poetry. But if we muſt ſlight every thing, from which no <hi>profit</hi> is to be hop'd, all pleaſures of the Eye and Ear are preſently to be laid aſide; and thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Arts, <hi>Muſick,</hi> and <hi>Painting,</hi> with which the beſt men uſe to be delighted, are preſently to be left off. Nor is it indeed credible, that ſo many excellent Wits, as have devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Poetry, would ever have medled with it, if it had been ſo empty, idle, and frivolous, as ſome ridiculouſly moroſe imagine; who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth are better pleas'd with the ſeverity of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> and her harſh, deform'd impropriety of Expreſſions. But the judgments of ſuch men are the moſt contemptible in the world; for when by <hi>Poetry</hi> mens minds are faſhioned to generous

Humors, Kindneſs, and the like: thoſe muſt needs be ſtrangers to all thoſe good qualites, who hate, or proclaim <hi>Poetry</hi> to be frivolous, and uſeleſs.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN delivering Rules for writing <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> I ſhall not point to the <hi>ſtreams,</hi> which to look after argues a ſmall creeping <hi>Genius,</hi> but lead you to the <hi>fountains.</hi> But firſt I muſt tell you, how difficult it is to write <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeem not ſufficiently to underſtand: For ſince its matter is low, and humble, it ſeems to have nothing that is troubleſome, and difficult. But this is a great miſtake, for, as <hi>Horace</hi> ſays of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi>
                  <q>It is by ſo much the more difficult, by how much the leſs pardonable are the miſtakes committed in its compoſure:</q> and the ſame is to be thought of every thing, whoſe end is to pleaſe, and delight.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45071:30"/>
luſcious, and, as <hi>Lucretius</hi> phraſeth it,
<q>
                     <l>E'en in the midſt and fury of the Joys,</l>
                     <l>Some thing that's better riſeth, and deſtroys.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide, ſince <hi>Paſtoral</hi> is of that nature, that it cannot endure too much negligence, nor too ſcrupulous diligence, it muſt be very difficult to to be compos'd, eſpecially ſince the expreſſion muſt be neat, but not too exquiſite, and fine: It muſt have a ſimple native beauty, but not too mean: it muſt have all ſorts of delicacies, and ſurprizing fancies, yet not be flowing, and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant. And certainly, to hit all theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies is difficult enough, ſince Wit, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is to pour it ſelf forth, muſt rather be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd than indulg'd; and that force of the Mind, which of it ſelf is ſo ready to run on, muſt be checkt, and bridled: Which cannot be eaſily perform'd by any, but thoſe who have a very good Judgment, and practically skill'd in Arts, and Sciences: And laſtly, a neat, and as it were a happy Wit; not that curious ſort, I mean, which <hi>Petronius</hi> allows <hi>Horace,</hi> leſt too much <hi>Art</hi> ſhould take off the Beauty of the <hi>Simplicity.</hi> And therefore I would not have any one undertake this task, that is not very polite by <hi>Nature,</hi> and very much at leiſure. For what is more hard than to be always in the <hi>Country,</hi> and yet never to be <hi>Clowniſh</hi>? to ſing of <hi>mean,</hi> and <hi>trivial</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45071:31"/>
yet not <hi>trivially,</hi> and <hi>meanly?</hi> to pipe on a <hi>ſlender</hi> Reed, and yet keep the ſound from being <hi>harſh,</hi> and <hi>ſqueaking?</hi> to make every thing <hi>ſweet,</hi> yet never <hi>ſatiate?.</hi> And this I thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to premiſe, in order to the better laying down of ſuch Rules as I deſign. For the naked <hi>ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> both of the Matter and Expreſſion of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral,</hi> upon bare Contemplation, might ſeem ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be hit, but upon trial 'twill be found a very hard task: Nor was the difficulty to be diſſembled, leſt <hi>Ignorance</hi> ſhould betray ſome into a raſh attempt. Now I muſt come to the very Rules; for as nothing excellent can be brought to perfection without <hi>Nature,</hi> (for Art unaſſiſted by that, is vain, and ineffectual,) ſo there is no <hi>Nature</hi> ſo excellent, and happy, which by its own ſtrength, and without <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> can make any thing excellent, and great.</p>
               <p>But tis hard to give <hi>Rules</hi> for that, for which there have been none already given; for where there are no footſteps nor path to direct, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how any one can be certain of his way. Yet in this difficulty I will follow <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who being to lay down Rules concerning <hi>Epicks,</hi> propos'd <hi>Homer</hi> as a Pattern, from whom he deduc'd the whole Art: So I will gather from <hi>Theocritus</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> thoſe Fathers of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtoral,</hi> what I ſhall deliver on this account. For all the Rules that are to be given of any Art, are to be given of it as excellent, and perfect, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45071:31"/>
therefore ought to be taken from them in whom it is ſo.</p>
               <p>The firſt Rule ſhall be about the <hi>Matter,</hi> which is either the <hi>Action</hi> of a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd and fitted to the <hi>Genius</hi> of a Shepherd; for tho <hi>Paſtoral</hi> is ſimple, and baſhful, yet it will entertain lofty ſubjects, if it can be permitted to turn and faſhion them to its own proper Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and Humor: which tho <hi>Theocritus</hi> hath never done, but kept cloſe to <hi>paſtoral</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, yet <hi>Virgil</hi> hath happily attempted; of whom almoſt the ſame <hi>Character</hi> might be given, which <hi>Quintilian</hi> beſtow'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n <hi>Steſichorus,</hi> who <hi>with his Harp bore up the moſt weighty ſubjects of</hi> Epick <hi>Poetry;</hi> for <hi>Virgil</hi> ſang great and lofty things to his Oaten Reed, but yet ſuited to the Humor of a Shepherd, for every thing that is nor agreeable to that, cannot belong to <hi>Paſtoral</hi>: of its own nature it cannot treat of lofty and great matters.</p>
               <p>Therefore let <hi>Paſtaral</hi> be ſmooth and ſoft, not noiſy and bombaſt; leſt whilſt it raiſeth its voice, and opens its mouth, it meet with the ſame fate that, they ſay, an <hi>Italian</hi> Shepherd did, who having a very large mouth, and a very ſtrong breath, brake his Pipe as often as he blow'd it. This is a great fault in one that writes <hi>Paſtorals:</hi> for if his words are too ſounding, or his ſenſe too ſtrong, he muſt be abſurd, becauſe indecently loud. And this is not the rule of an unskilful
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45071:32"/>
impertinent Adviſer, but rather of a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maſter in this Art; for <hi>Phoebus</hi> twitcht <hi>Virgil</hi> by the Ear, and warn'd him to forbear great Subjects: but if it ventures upon ſuch, it may be allow'd to uſe ſome ſhort <hi>Invocations,</hi> and, as <hi>Epicks</hi> do, modeſtly implore the aſſiſtance of a Muſe. This <hi>Virgil</hi> doth in his <hi>Pollio,</hi> which is a Compoſure of an unuſual loftineſs:
<q>
                     <hi>Sicilian</hi> Muſe begin a loftier ſtrain.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So he invocates <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> when <hi>Cornelius Gallus Proconſul of Aegypt</hi> and his <hi>Amours,</hi> matters above the common reach of <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> are his Subject.</p>
               <q>One Labor more O <hi>Arethuſa</hi> yield.</q>
               <p>Why he makes his application to <hi>Aretheuſa</hi> is eaſy to conjecture, for ſhe was a <hi>Nymph</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſo he might hope that ſhe could inſpire him with a <hi>Genius</hi> fit for <hi>Paſtorals</hi> which firſt began in that <hi>Iſland,</hi> Thus in the ſeventh and eighth <hi>Eclogue,</hi> as the matter would bear, he invocates the Nymphs and Muſes: And <hi>Theocritus</hi> does the ſame,
<q>Tell Goddeſs, you can tell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence 'tis evident that in <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> tho it never pretends to any greatneſs, <hi>Invocations</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:45071:32"/>
may be allow'd: But whatever Subject it chooſeth, it muſt take care to accommodate it to the Genius and Circumſtances of a Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Form, or mode of <hi>Imitation,</hi> I ſhall not repeat what I have already ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> that this is in it ſelf <hi>mixt;</hi> for <hi>Paſtoral</hi> is either <hi>Alternate,</hi> or hath but <hi>one Perſon,</hi> or is <hi>mixt</hi> of both: yet 'tis properly and chiefly <hi>Alternate,</hi> as is evident from that of <hi>Theocritus.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Sing <hi>Rural</hi> ſtrains, for as we march along</l>
                  <l>We may delight each other with a Song.</l>
               </q>
               <p>In which the <hi>Poet</hi> ſhows that <hi>alternate</hi> ſinging is proper to a <hi>Paſtoral</hi>: But as for the <hi>Fable,</hi> 'tis requiſite that it ſhould be ſimple, leſt in ſtead of <hi>Paſtoral</hi> it put on the form of a <hi>Comedy,</hi> or <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi> if the <hi>Fable</hi> be great, or intricate: It muſt be <hi>One;</hi> this <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thinks neceſſary in every <hi>Poem,</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> lays down this general Rule,
<q>Be every <hi>Fable</hi> ſimple, and but one:</q>
For every Poem, that is not <hi>One,</hi> is imperfect, and this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is to be taken from the <hi>Action:</hi> for if that is <hi>One,</hi> the Poem will be ſo too. Such is the Paſſion of <hi>Corydon</hi> in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s ſecond Eclogue, <hi>Meliboeus</hi>'s Expoſtulation with <hi>Tityrus</hi> about his Fortune; <hi>Theocritus</hi>'s <hi>Thyrſis, Cyclops,</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryllis,</hi> of which perhaps in its proper place I may treat more largely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:45071:33"/>Let the third Rule be concerning the <hi>Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which cannot be in this kind excellent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs borrow'd from <hi>Theocritus</hi>'s <hi>Idylliums,</hi> or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s <hi>Eclogues;</hi> let it be chiefly ſimple, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous: ſuch is that of <hi>Theocritus,</hi>
                  <q>A Kid belongs to thee, and Kids are good,</q>
Or that in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s ſeventh Eclogue,

                     <l>This Pail of Milk, theſe Cakes <hi>(Priapus)</hi> every year</l>
                     <l>Expect; a little Garden is thy care:</l>

                     <l>If my Flock thrive, thou ſhalt be made of Gold,</l>
                  </q>
than which I cannot imagine more ſimple, and more ingenuous expreſſions. To which may be added that out of his <hi>Palemon,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>And I love <hi>Phyllis,</hi> for her Charms excell;</l>

                     <l>She ſigh'd, Farewell Dear Youth, a long Farewell.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, That I call an ingenuous Expreſſion which is clear and ſmooth, that ſwells with no inſolent words, or bold metaphors, but hath ſomething familiar, and as it were obvious in its Compoſure, and not diſguis'd by any ſtudy'd and affected, dreſs: All its Ornament muſt be like the Corn and fruits in the Country, eaſy to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45071:33"/>
be gotten, and ready at hand, not ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Care, Labor, and Coſt to be obtain'd: as <hi>Hermogenes</hi> on <hi>Theocritus</hi> obſerves; <hi>See how eaſie and unaffected this ſounds,</hi>
                  <q>Pines murmurings, Goatherd, are a pleaſing ſound,</q>
                  <hi>and moſt of his expreſſions, not to ſay all, are of the ſame nature:</hi> for the ingenuous ſimplicity both of Thought and Expreſſion is the natural <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick</hi> of <hi>Paſtoral.</hi> In this <hi>Theocritus</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are admirable, and excellent, the others deſpicable, and to be pittied: for they being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled by the meaneſs of their ſubject, either creep, or fall flat. <hi>Virgil</hi> keeps himſelf up by his choice and curious words, and tho his matter for the moſt part (and <hi>Paſtoral</hi> requires it) is mean, yet his expreſſions never flag, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from theſe lines in his <hi>Alexis:</hi>

The words of ſuch a <hi>Stile</hi> we are uſually taught in our Nurſes armes, but 'tis to be perfected and poliſhed by length of time, frequent uſe, ſtudy, and diligent reading of the moſt approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: for Paſtoral is apt to be ſlighted for the meaneſs of its Matter, unleſs it hath ſome additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Beauty, be pure, poliſht, and ſo made plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and attractive. Therefore never let any one, that deſigns to write <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> corrupt himſelf with foreign manners; for if he hath once vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the healthful habit, as I may ſay, of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which <hi>Bucolicks</hi> neceſſarily require, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould be fit for that task. Yet let him not affect pompous or dazling Expreſſions, for ſuch belong to <hi>Epicks,</hi> or <hi>Tragedians</hi> Let his words ſometimes taſt of the Country, not that I mean, of which <hi>Voluſius</hi>'s Annals, upon which <hi>Catullus</hi> hath made that biting <hi>Epigram,</hi> are full; for though the Thought ought to be ruſtick, and ſuch as is ſuitable to a Shepherd, yet it ought not to be Clowniſh, as is evident in <hi>Corydon,</hi> when he makes mention of his Goats.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Young ſportive Creatures, and of ſpotted hue,</l>

               <p>For what can be more Ruſtical, than to deſign thoſe <hi>Goats</hi> for <hi>Alexis,</hi> at that very time when
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45071:34"/>
he believes <hi>Theſtylis</hi>'s winning importunity will be able to prevail? yet there is nothing Clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in the words.

                  <q>He that loves <hi>Bavius</hi> Verſes, hates not Thine:</q>
And in the ſame <hi>Eclogue,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—It is not ſafe to drive too nigh,</l>
                     <l>The Bank may fail, the Ram is hardly dry:</l>
                  </q>
And in <hi>Corydon,</hi>
                  <q>To learn this Art what won't <hi>Amyntas</hi> do?</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>Theocritus</hi> much of the ſame nature may be ſeen; as in his other <hi>Paſtoral Idylliums,</hi> ſo chiefly in his fifth. Thus <hi>Battus</hi> in the fourth <hi>Idyllium,</hi> complaining for the loſs of <hi>Amaryllis,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:45071:35"/>Dear Nymph, dear as my Goats, you dy'd.</q>
And how ſoft and tender is that in the third <hi>Idyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>And ſhe may look on me, ſhe may be won,</l>
                     <l>She may be kind, She is not perfect Stone,</l>
                  </q>
And in this <hi>conciſe,</hi> cloſe way of Expreſſion lies the chiefeſt Grace of <hi>Paſtorals</hi>: for in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion there's nothing in the whole Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can delight more than thoſe frequent ſtops, and breakings off. Yet leſt in theſe too it become dull and ſluggiſh, it muſt be quickned by frequent lively touches of Concernment: ſuch as that of the Goatherd in the third Idyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,
<q>—I ſee that I muſt die:</q>
Or <hi>Daphnis</hi>'s deſpair, which <hi>Thyrſis</hi> ſings in the firſt <hi>Idyllium,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Ye Wolves, and Pards, and Mountain Bores adieu,</l>
                     <l>The Herdſmen now muſt walk no more with You.</l>
                  </q>
How tender are the lines, and yet what paſſion they contain! And moſt of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s are of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but there are likewiſe in him ſome touches of deſpairing Love, ſuch as is this of <hi>Alpheſiboeus,</hi>
                  <q>Nor have I any mind to be reliev'd:</q>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:45071:35"/>
Or that of <hi>Damon,</hi>
                  <q>I'le dy, yet tell my Love e'en whilſt I dy:</q>
Or that of <hi>Corydon,</hi>
                  <q>He lov'd, but could not hope for Love again.</q>
For tho <hi>Paſtoral</hi> doth not admit any violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſuch as proceed from the greateſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and uſually accompany deſpair; yet becauſe Deſpairing Love is not attended with thoſe frightful and horrible conſequences, but looks more like <hi>grief to be pittied,</hi> and a <hi>pleaſing madneſs,</hi> than <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>fury, Eclogue</hi> is ſo far from refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that it rather loves, and paſſionately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them. Therefore an unfortunate <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi> may be brought in, complaining of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſleſs Love to the <hi>Moon, Stars,</hi> or <hi>Rocks,</hi> or to the Woods, and purling Streams, mourning the unſupportable anger, the frowns and coyneſs of his proud <hi>Phyllis</hi>; ſinging at his <hi>Nymphs</hi> door, (which <hi>Plutarch</hi> reckons among the ſigns of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) or doing any of thoſe fooleries, which are familiar to Lovers. Yet the Paſſion muſt not riſe too high, as <hi>Polyphemus</hi>'s, <hi>Galateas</hi>'s mad Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of whom <hi>Theocritus</hi> divinely thus, as almoſt of every thing elſe:
<q>
                     <l>His was no common flame, nor could he move</l>
                     <l>In the old Arts, and beaten paths of Love,</l>
                     <l>No Flowers nor Fruits ſent to oblige the Fair,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:45071:36"/>His was all Rage, and Madneſs:</l>
                  </q>
For all violent Perturbations are to be diligently avoided by <hi>Bucolicks,</hi> whoſe nature it is to be <hi>ſoft,</hi> and <hi>eaſie</hi>: For in ſmall matters, and ſuch muſt all the ſtrifes and contentions of Shepherds be, to make a great deal of adoe, is as unſeemly, as to put <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Vizard and Buskins on an Infant, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> hath excellently obſerv'd. For ſince <hi>Eclogue</hi> is but weak, it ſeems not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of thoſe Commotions which belong to the <hi>Theater,</hi> and <hi>Pulpit</hi>; they muſt be ſoft, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and all its Paſſion muſt ſeem to flow only, and not break out: as in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Gallus,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Ah, far from home and me You wander o're</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Alpine</hi> ſnows, the fartheſt Weſtern ſhore,</l>
                     <l>And frozen <hi>Rhine.</hi> When are we like to meet?</l>
                     <l>Ah gently, gently, leſt thy tender feet</l>
                     <l>Sharp Ice may wound.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe he may ſometimes joyn ſome ſhort Interrogations made to <hi>inanimate Beings,</hi> for thoſe ſpread a ſtrange life and vigor thro the whole Compoſure. Thus in <hi>Daphnis,</hi>
                  <q>Did not You Streams, and Hazels, hear the Nymphs?</q>
Or give the very Trees, and Fountains ſenſe, as in <hi>Tityrus,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Thee <hi>(Tityrus)</hi> the Pines, and every Vale,</l>
                     <l>The Fountains, Hills, and every Shrub did call:</l>
                  </q>
for by this the Concernment is expreſs'd; and of the like nature is that of <hi>Thyrſis,</hi> in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeus,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:45071:36"/>When <hi>Phyllis</hi> eomes, my wood will all be green.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And this ſort of Expreſſions is frequent in <hi>Theocritus,</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and in theſe the delicacy of <hi>Paſtoral</hi> is principally contain'd, as one of the old <hi>Interpreters</hi> of <hi>Theocritus</hi> hath obſerv'd on this line, in the eighth <hi>Idyllium,</hi>
                  <q>Ye Vales, and Streams, a race Divine:</q>
But let them be ſo, and ſo ſeldom us'd, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appear vehement, and bold, for Boldneſs and Vehemence deſtroy the ſweetneſs which peculiarly commends <hi>Bucolicks,</hi> and in thoſe Compoſures a conſtant care to be ſoft and eaſie ſhould be chief: For <hi>Paſtoral</hi> bears ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to <hi>Terence,</hi> of whom <hi>Tully,</hi> in that Poem which he writes to <hi>Libo,</hi> gives this Character,
<q>His words are ſoft, and each expreſſion ſweet.</q>
In mixing <hi>Paſſion</hi> in <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> that rule of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus,</hi> in his golden Treatiſe <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>Numbers,</hi> in which <hi>Paſtoral</hi> ſhould be written, this is my opinion; the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick</hi> Meaſure, but not ſo ſtrong and ſounding as in <hi>Epicks,</hi> is to be choſen. <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Theocritus</hi> have given us examples; for tho <hi>Theocritus</hi> hath in one Idyllium mixt other Numbers, yet that can be of no force againſt all the reſt; and <hi>Virgil</hi> uſeth no Numbers but <hi>Heroick,</hi> from whence it may be inferr'd, that thoſe are the fitteſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:45071:37"/>
                  <hi>Paſtoral</hi> may ſometimes admit plain, but not long <hi>Narrations,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> requires in a Poet; for he chiefly approves thoſe who uſe a plain <hi>Narration,</hi> and commends that above all other which is ſhort, and fitly expreſſeth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing. Some are of opinion that <hi>Bucolicks</hi> cannot endure Narrations, eſpecially if they are very long, and imagine there are none in <hi>Virgil:</hi> but they have not been nice enough in their obſervations, for there are ſome, as that in <hi>Silenus</hi>:
<q>
                     <l>Young <hi>Chromis</hi> and <hi>Mnaſylus</hi> chanct to ſtray,</l>
                     <l>Where (ſleeping in a Cave) <hi>Silenus</hi> lay,</l>
                     <l>Whoſe conſtant Cups fly fuming to his brain,</l>
                     <l>And always boyl in each extended vein:</l>
                     <l>His truſty Flaggon, full of potent Juice,</l>
                     <l>Was hanging by, worn out with Age, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Narrations</hi> are ſo ſeldom to be found in <hi>Theocritus,</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> I think they ought not to be often us'd; yet if the matter will bear it, I believe ſuch as <hi>Socrates</hi> would have, may very fitly be made uſe of.</p>
               <p>The Compoſure will be more ſuitable to the Genius of a Shepherd, if now and then there are ſome ſhort turns and digreſſions from the purpoſe: Such is that concerning <hi>Paſiphae</hi> in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus,</hi> although tis almoſt too long; but we may give <hi>Viogil</hi> a little leave, who takes ſo little liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty himſelf.</p>

That <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> hath prudently made choice of, is in my opinion much better; for a Shepherd, who is naturally incurious, and unobſerving, cannot think that tis his duty to be exact in particulars, and deſcribe every thing with an accurate nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: yet <hi>Roncardus</hi> hath done it, a man of moſt correct judgment, and, in imitation of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> hath, conſidering the then poverty of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, admirably and largely deſcrib'd <hi>his</hi> Cup; and <hi>Marinus</hi> in his Idylliums hath follow'd the ſame example. He never keeps within compaſs in his Deſcriptions, for which he is deſervedly blam'd; let thoſe who would be thought accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and men of judgment, follow <hi>Virgil</hi>'s pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent moderation.

deſcriptions of ſuch trivial things, if not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely accurate, may, if ſeldom us'd, be decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow'd a place in the diſcourſes of <hi>Shepherds.</hi>

               <p>But tho you muſt be ſparing in your <hi>Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> yet your <hi>Compariſons</hi> muſt be frequent, and the more often you uſe them, the better and more graceful will be the Compoſure; eſpecially if taken from ſuch things, as the Shepherds muſt be familiarly acquainted with: They are frequent in <hi>Theocritus,</hi> but ſo proper to the Country, that none but a <hi>Shepherd</hi> dare uſe them. Thus <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalcas</hi> in the eighth Idyllium:
<q>
                     <l>Rough Storms to Trees, to Birds the treacherous Snare,</l>

And ſuch <hi>Compariſons</hi> are very frequent in him, and very ſuitable to the Genius of a Shepherd: as likewiſe often <hi>repetitions,</hi> and doublings of ſome words: which, if they are luckily plac'd, have an unexpreſſible quaintneſs, and make the Numbers extream ſweet, and the turns raviſhing and delightful.

               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Manners</hi> of your <hi>Shepherds,</hi> they muſt be ſuch as theirs who liv'd in the Iſlands of the Happy or Golden Age: They muſt be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, ſimple, and ingenuous; lovers of Goodneſs, and Juſtice, affable, and kind; ſtrangers to all fraud, contrivance, and deceit; in their Love modeſt, and chaſt, not one ſuſpitious word, no looſe expreſſion to be allowed: and in this part <hi>Theocritus</hi> is faulty, <hi>Virgil</hi> never; and this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence perhaps is to be aſcrib'd to their Ages, the times in which the latter liv'd being more polite, civil, and gentile. And therefore thoſe who make wanton Love-ſtories the ſubject of Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, are in my opinion very unadvis'd; for all ſort of lewdneſs or debauchery are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Innocence</hi> of the <hi>golden</hi> Age. There is another thing in which <hi>Theocritus</hi> is faulty, and that is making his Shepherds too ſharp, and abuſive to one another; <hi>Comatas</hi> and <hi>Lacon</hi> are ready to fight, and the railing between thoſe two is as bitter as <hi>Billingsgate:</hi> Now certainly ſuch Raillery cannot be ſuitable to thoſe ſedate times of the Happy Age.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Sentences,</hi> if weighty, and Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, common Senſe tells us they are not fit for a <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s mouth. Here <hi>Theocritus</hi> cannot be altogether excus'd, but <hi>Virgil</hi> deſerves no repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion But <hi>Proverbs</hi> juſtly challenge admiſſion into <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> nothing being more common in

               <l>His <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> made him half divine;</l>

                  <hi>Alcides</hi> blam'd as fearful to engage,</l>
               <l>It argu'd not his Love, but prov'd his fear</l>
               <l>To leave the Ship, and ſo decline the War;</l>
               <l>But he on foot to barbarous <hi>Phaſis</hi> came,</l>
