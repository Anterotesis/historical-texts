            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>AMES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Jreland, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas Wee haue been informed by the complaint of diuers of Our poore Subiects, the ancient Makers of Tobacco-Pipes within this Our Realme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That for want of power and priuiledge to retaine their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentises and Seruants during their Apprentiship (who commonly depart from them before they haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their tearmes, or attained to the knowledge of their Art) they are much preiudiced both in their Trades and meanes of liuing, by their excessiue making and vttering of ill Ware, And Our Subiects who haue vse of that Manufacture, are thereby greatly abused and deceiued: And not only so, but to their Masters farther impouerishment, these loose and idle persons doe instruct and teach others of as bad qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie as themselues, to make and sell like ill &amp; deceitful Ware. Besides, for that the said Art of making Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Pipes is easily learned, sundry of our Subiects trained vp in other Trades more vsefull for the Realme, doe forsake the same and take vp this of making Tobacco-Pipes: And others who haue other good Trades to liue vpon, intrude themselues into this also, and vse both, to the hinderance and ouerthrow of those who anciently practised the same. And whereas for the better reforming of all those disorders, to cut off the superfluous straglers and late intruders, to reduce them to a competent number, and to settle good gouernment amongst them (this Trade being a new Trade, neuer yet ordered by any Law or Policie, and which concerneth not any Commoditie of necessitie for our Common-weale, but a superfluous pleasure, necessarie to be regulated by Our Royall power &amp; authoritie) We haue therefore thought fit by Letters Patents vnder Our Great Seale, to Incorporate a certaine number of choice and selected persons, who haue either serued as Apprentises, or haue otherwise practised that Art by the space of seuen yeers, to whom and whose Seruants, Apprentices, and such others as shall be by them admitted into that Societie for their skill and honest conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, Wee intend to appropriat the said Art, and to restraine all others from taking that benefit which in no right belongeth vnto them.</p>
            <p>And to the end that all our louing Subiects may take knowledge of Our pleasure expressed in our Charter, that it may be duly obserued without pretext of ignorance, Wee doe heereby declare Our expresse will and pleasure to be, and doe straightly charge and command, That no person or persons whatsoeuer, other then such as are members of the said Societie of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-pipe makers of <hi>Westminster,</hi> or which haue by the space of seuen yeares at the least beene bound to (or exercised) that Art, or such others as shall be chosen into the Societie by the said Societie, shall not presume (from the date of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents) directly nor indirectly to make any manner of Tobacco-pipes within this Our Realme of <hi>England</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wa<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

And further, for the better disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering and suppressing of all secret and vnder-hand making or vttering of the said Manufacture by such as are not members of this Societie or otherwise enabled as aforesaid, Wee doe require, charge, and straightly command all Our louing Subiects (especially such Retaylers as shall buy Tobacco-pipes to sell againe) that they, nor any of them directly, nor indirectly, shall buy, acquire, get or obtaine any Tobacco-pipes whatsoeuer of or from the hands of any person or persons, not being knowne members of the said Societie, And to that end it is prouided, that all Tobacco-pipes made by the said Company, shall be brought to the Common Hall of the said Societie there to be proued whether the same be good and marchantable ware, before they shall be vttered or put to sale; (where they may be bought of all Our louing Subiects) Upon paine of vndergoing of Our displeasure, and such paines and penalties as shall or may ensue thereupon for such contempt against Our will and Our prerogatiue Royall. And for the full effectuating of Our pleasure heerein, These are to command and straightly charge, That all the said Tobacco-pipe Makers aforesaid, shall forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with take knowledge of our Charter by these presents, and by resorting to the said Societie in <hi>London,</hi> where they shall receiue such Orders and Ordinances as shall be constituted and made by the Master, Wardens, and Assistances of the said Societie for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the said Societie.
