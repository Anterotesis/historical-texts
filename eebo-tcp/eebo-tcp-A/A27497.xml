         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Some few things he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, hee then diſpoſed of, as tokens of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to his friends; his gloves, ſtaffe, girdle, books, about ſeven or eight of ſome pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, he gave and ſent to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with his name inſcribed: and his laſt act after he was pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, was the giving me his ſeale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring off his finger, with ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate expreſſions, as it draws tears from me in the now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring it. More I might adde, but thus much may ſuffice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Repentance, and the fruit of it in the Caſtle before his Execution.</p>
                  <p>Now the Sheriffe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty [a Papiſt] was come to receive him, the two Sheriffs of the City with a great company of Halberts to aſſiſt him. At Chriſt-church [according to his deſire] told his paſſing-bell, the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53687:29"/>
whole Town and Caſtle ſo thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as was never the like ſeen, that if there had not bin a Coach allowed him, it would have bin impoſſible to have gone through. And here I muſt not forget the hard uſage of the ſaid <hi>Sheriffe of the County</hi> in ſome croſſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which after all this his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, might have prooved a diſtraction to him, though it did not; his intentions I will not judge, yet whoſe inſtrument he was I may conceive. The night before he had deſired the favour he might not be pinioned till he came to the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, for which I went my ſelf betimes that morning to the <hi>Lord chiefe Iuſtice of the Kings Bench, and Iuſtice Creſſey,</hi> both of them upon my relation of the change found in him readily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and ſent that command by me to the Sheriffe, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and notwithſtanding would have him pinioned in his lodging. Again, I ſent one to the Innes,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53687:30"/>
who preſently brought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to him under the Lord Chiefe Juſtice his hand, with the conſent of all the Judges, then being at Dinner, this alſo he diſobeyed; for his pretence in the ſecurity of his perſon, one of the Sheriffes of the City offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red body for body, and aſſured him that with ſuch a guard, and by fitting himſelfe in the Coach with him, there could be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of an eſcape. For himſelfe (howſoever his friends thus ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him) he was contented, and long before the Sheriffe came, told me he was very ſorry he had mooved me in any ſuch buſineſſe, uſing this ſpeech, <hi>Our Saviour carried his Croſſe in the way, and why ſhould I deſire to be freed?</hi> When he had pulled of his mourning gown, he preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſtrong black Ribband, which he had provided of purpoſe for the more decency, and in caſe it ſhould not be thought ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, a black girdle was offered

or any other, <hi>the Sheriffe refuſed all, and had him bound with a three penny cord, as a common Rogue, and would have had the hang-man, or ſome other baſe fellow come in and done it.</hi> Nay he would have had one to ſit in the Coach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, to have held him by the cord alſo, but that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of the Caſtle would not ſuffer him. Theſe things being very ſuſpitious, if not apparent, out of malice [either in regard of his Religion, Profeſſion, or ſome private cauſe] I feared might have diſturbed his charity (as it enraged moſt of the ſtanders by) but as ſoon as I put him in mind of ſome <note n="*" place="margin">See pa. 19.</note>

he left the Chamber. The Sheriff with-drawing, he deſired us that were there to joyn with him once more in prayer to God, for his ſpeciall aſſiſtance againſt all ſorts of enemies, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected now would beſet him at once. We all kneeled down, but ſuch a powerfull, excellent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did I ſcarce ever heare, <hi>ſo that all both wept and ſobb'd with him.</hi> And ſo after ſome comfortable ſpeeches to us, and hope that once more before he dyed, he ſhould have a return of the ſame meaſure of comfort, he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the laſt night. The She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe came in again, and received him.</p>
                  <p>In the Coach rode with him one of the Sheriffs of the City, the ſub-Sheriffe of the County, his own man, and my ſelf. At his entrance he ſaid, <hi>This puts me in mind of Eliahs</hi>

When he came upon the bridge, and through the curtains of the Coach [for it was cloſed] he diſcerned the Gallows with the people gathered, he ſaid unto me, <hi>There is my Mount Calvary, from which I hope to aſ:cend to Heaven.</hi> When he came to the place of Execution, there were two things, which might have diſturbed him,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53687:32"/>
the one was a fellow got upon one end of the gallows, deriding him and interrupting him when he began to ſpeak, whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not, but patiently bore it, and proceeded. The other, the breaking of his foot-mans head [whom he loved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had run by the Coach ſide, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed nigh to attend] by one of the Sheriffs of the City, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, by laying about him to make room, who when he ſaw him with the bloud running down his face, <hi>He bemoaned him onely, and deſired me that he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved out of his ſight.</hi> To which I might adde a third, happening in the concluſion of all, as he was ready to go up, <hi>viz.</hi> one calling to him about ſome papers or leaſes, whom the very ſtanders by cryed down, as very unſeaſonable. All which I could eaſily think the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy might have a hand in to diſtract him. When there was a ſilence made, he ſtood up, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53687:32"/>
made a large and an elegant Speech, ſubſtantiall and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and I know, it was not fram'd before, for the matter he had indeed reſolved upon, but the forme he put to his preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions there; I had indeed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to pen it, leaſt the ſight of death might then diſtract him, but his anſwer was, <hi>He would put his truſt in God, who, he hoped, would not faile him in that laſt act, and was confident, death would not disturbe him.</hi>

                  <p>He confeſſed he had been guilty of much over-reaching of men, and that if his eſtate might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to his wife, he had given charge for ſatisfaction to be made to a penny: tooke notice of the Juſtice of God upon him, who had formerly ſo thirſted after a <hi>Name and Fame</hi>; it was now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, but a Name of Infamie, which he deſired might reſt onely upon himſelfe, and not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Profeſſion.

forgiving ſo great a ſinner.

in his undauntednes of ſpirit, now entring into the jawes of death; when the Pſalm was done, he roſe up and ſaid, I think I ſaw the Town-clark of <hi>Waterford</hi> here, if he be, or any other of that Town, I ſhall deſire them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to my Neighbours there, that I have taken notice that none of the Romiſh Church, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from me in points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, had a hand in this complaint againſt me, though they had as much cauſe as others, for which I conceive I owe them thanks.</p>

prayers with my ſelf, wherin I ſhall deſire you in your thoughts to joyn with me, in praying God to aſſiſt me at this inſtant, and ſo kneeled down for a little ſpace, as did the company neare him alſo; when he aroſe, he ſayd chearfully, <hi>Now I am ready,</hi> and took leave of them all that were neare him [whom he knew] man by man, taking them all by the hands, with ſuch ſpeeches as theſe, <hi>I dread not death, God ſend us a happy meeting in Heaven, I am but going before you,</hi> the whole company wept aboundantly, and my ſelf had moſt cauſe at his laſt moſt affectionate expreſſions. Then he put off his mourning gown, hat and black cap, and called to his man for his other cap and Handker-chief. When he was ſetting foot on the Ladder, he turned with a ſmiling countenance towards the Sheriff of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty [who all this time of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſinging of Pſalms had ſat by on horſ-back with his hat on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53687:38"/>
his head, giving no reverence at all] and ſaid, Maſt. Sheriff, <hi>Will you not take leave of your friends, when you ſhall never ſee them again? What? not one word from you all this while, God forgive you, and J doe from my heart, that uſage of yours, which might have diſtracted me, but did not, I have prayed for you even now</hi>; and ſo went up the Ladder, who when he ſaw ſo many weeping, ſaid again to them, <hi>I thanke God I dread not death,</hi> and that it proceeded not from a preſumption, but from a preſent ſenſible apprehenſion of Gods-mercy, and an inward peace of Conſcience, and ſo with a chearfull countenance, looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and ſeeing ſome he knew, whom he had not ſeen before, <hi>bowed to them and bade them farewell, deſired them ſtill to pray for him as long as he had life.</hi> I had him laſt by the hand, when he was upon the Ladder, and to my admiration, his hand ſhook no more then mine. When he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53687:39"/>
was gone as high, as was thought fitting, and the rope put about his neck, he pinned the handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief about his face with his own hands (the cords with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his hands being again loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) and ſaid to the Hang-man, honeſt friend, when thou art rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, tell me, and I will tell thee, when I am ready (to whom he than gave ſome little mony he had about him) prayed the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff he might not be turned off till he ſpake again, and when he had pulled the cap over his face, he ſaid, <hi>Lord now let thy ſervant depart in peace according to thy word, for mine eyes have ſeene thy ſalvation, which thou haſt prepared for me; commended his ſoule to God,</hi> with divers the like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and not long after ſayd, <hi>Now I am ready,</hi> and from that continued crying, <hi>Have mercy, have mercy,</hi> &amp;c. till he was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off. When he felt the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtirring he put down his hands and laid hold on the ſides of his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53687:39"/>
Caſſock, and ſo ſtirred them not to the laſt, though ſome of his friends catched him by the hands, leaſt he ſhould have lifted them up, but I believe it was needles. By this his penitentiall, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an carriage, the hearts of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were mooved, ſuch as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in his life, now loved him at his death, and I believe theſe many years there hath not bin any that left the world with ſo many tears and cryes of the beholders. When he had hung ſome 3. quarters of an hour, he was cut down and put into the ſame Coach he came in, into which I went my ſelf, and rode with him to the houſe, where he was received; which I did both to feed my thoughts with mortality, in viewing the ſame body lying dead in the ſame place, where ſome two or three hours before I had ſeen it with a ſoul, in health, and full ſtrength. As alſo leaſt ſome lyes ſhould have bin raiſed of him, by ſuch as have us;ed to do the like.</p>

                  <p>About ſeven or eight of the clock, the Verger of Chriſts-Church came to my lodging and told me there was <hi>a rumour</hi> of a Sermon, and an expectation of my ſaying ſomwhat of him, ſo much that the Church was filled already to the doors, with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Papiſts alſo, upon this ſuddain warning I was earneſtly intreated to ſome ſhort declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which according to the time given me (howſoever I never liked funerall commendations, as uſually doing more hurt than good) I did obſerve.
