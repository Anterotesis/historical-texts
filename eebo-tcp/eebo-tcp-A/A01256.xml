            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was much against my minde, to entitle your
worthy Lordship to these worthlesse toyes, or
make such a slight and Artlesse fabricke carry
so faire and glorious a frontispice, as your Honorable
name prefixed; yet finding it (as it is) in these daies a
matter so frequent with the worst Poets (as they haue
most need) to seeke out the best Patrons: collecting from
their presumption a fearefull boldnesse I haue out of a
reuerent zeale, and obseruance, presented to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
these my poore and naked labours: Poore, as being
vnpolisht, and naked as they came from their mother
<hi>Truth:</hi> Yet for that, (and onely but for that) besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a better Writer. Vouchsafe them I beseech you,
your Honours wonted benigne and gracious aspect, and
reade them with your accustomed candor; but for your
deepe-searching iudgement, pardon me my Lord, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
from that, and appeale to your partiall, and
more pleasing fauour. The most part of them haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
past your Lordships priuate liking: they <hi>All</hi> tointly
craue your publick protection. It is no diminution to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
nor disparagement to Greatnesse, to Countenance
the meanest well-meaning Authour: You haue it, <hi>Cum
tantis commune viris; Scipio</hi> gracing rude <hi>Ennius,</hi>
and the mightiest of earths Monarks, vnskilfull <hi>Chae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilus.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5959:3"/>
Nor is it derogatory to iudgement, to accept an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Poems of slight subiect; as <hi>Augustus</hi> of <hi>Virgils</hi>
Gnatt: nor of bad composure; as that of the fore-named
<hi>Chaerilus</hi> to <hi>Alexander:</hi> And I shall surely beare a
part of reproofe, in this ages generall Apostacy to Poesy,
the rather for trading (as the world interprets it) in
the coursest and commonest of it. So hardly heares the
Epigram from all, the very name sticks to him like an
<hi>Inustum stigma.</hi> But how the Comonest? in it selfe; why,
there, being good (as it is no lesse) it shold be <hi>Melius quo
communius.</hi> Is it in the Professor? yea there is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
it is gone, <hi>ab Equis ad Asinos, Notum Lippis &amp;
Tonsoribus,</hi> &amp; Plaid the <hi>Pithagorean</hi> pittifully, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
most brutish transmigration, and traueld in as
durty wits as the way between <hi>Hogsdon</hi> and <hi>Houns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch,
Turpe &amp; miserabile:</hi> Yet that this shold impeach
the ingenuous is meere iniustice. But indeed the true
cause for which the Epigram suffers, is his liberty and
sincere honesty in the search and vnmasking vice, hence
comes it men marke him with <hi>Fenum in cornu,</hi> and
fire off; or take the wind of him, as of one infected, Hence
the world feares and consequently hates it: I could go on
in iust indignation, but time is precious with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and this is an Epistle, and not a Treatise. I therefore
returne to your Houour; crauing, once more, acceptance
and Protection, to these (howsoeuer they sound, for so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
course-spun Epigrams. Howsoeuer my pen faile, my
prayers shall not, but euer solicite the Calestiall <hi>TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VNITY,</hi>
to blesse your Honour, and send you heere all,
and the compleatst ioyes on earth, <hi>fore-runners</hi> of your
future true happinesse in heauen.</p>
