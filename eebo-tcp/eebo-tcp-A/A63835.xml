            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>WHen a Roman Gentleman had, to please himself, written a Book in Greek, and presented it to <hi>Cato;</hi> he desir'd him to pardon the faults of his Expressions, since he wrote in Greek, which was a Tongue in which he was not perfect Master. <hi>Cato</hi> told him he had better then to have let it alone and written in Latin, by how much it is better not to commit a fault, than to make apologies. For if the thing be good, it needs not to be excus'd; if it be not good, a crude apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie will do nothing but confess the fault, but never makes amends. I therefore make this Address to all who will concern themselves in reading this Book, not to ask their pardon for my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in doing of it; I know of none; for if I had known them I would have mended them before the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication;
<pb facs="tcp:100736:3"/>
and yet though I know not any, I do not question but much fault will be found by too many; I wish I have given them no cause for their so doing. But I do not only mean it in the particular Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, (where every man that is not a Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will at least do as <hi>Apollonius</hi> did to the Apparition that affrighted his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany on the Mountain <hi>Caucasus,</hi> he will revile and persecute me with evil words) but I mean it in the whole Design, and men will reasonably or capriciously ask, Why any more Controversies? Why this over again? Why against the Papists, against whom so very many are already exasperated, that they cry out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Persecution? And why can they not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to enjoy their share of peace, which hath returned in the hands of His Sacred Majesty at his blessed Restauration? For as much of this as concerns my self I make no excuse, but give my reasons, and hope to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> this procedure with that modesty which <hi>David</hi> us'd to his angry brother, saying, <hi>What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</hi> The cause is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Reverend Fathers my Lords the</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:100736:3"/>
Bishops of <hi>Ireland</hi> in their circumspection and watchfulness over their Flocks having espied grievous Wolves to have entered in, some with Sheeps-clothing, and some without, some secret enemies, and some open, at first endeavour'd to give check to those enemies which had put fire into the bed-straw; and though God hath very much prosper'd their labours, yet they have work enough to do, and will have, till God shall call them home to the land of peace and unity. But <hi>it was soon remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,</hi> that when King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memory had discerned the spirits of the <hi>English</hi> Non-conformists, and found them peevish and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, unreasonable and imperious; not only unable to govern, but as inconsistent with the Government, as greedy to snatch at it for themselves; resolved to take off their disguise, and put a difference between <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> and to bring them to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and rules of Laws; and to this the Council and all wise men were consenting, because by the King's great wisdom, and the conduct of the whole Conference and Inquiry, men saw there was reason on the King's side, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> on all sides.
<pb facs="tcp:100736:4"/>
But the Gun-powder Treason breaking out, a new Zeal was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and it shin'd so greatly, that the Non-conformists escap'd by the light of it, and quickly grew warm by the heat of that flame, to which they added no small increase by their Declamations and other acts of insinuation: insomuch that they being neglected, multiply'd until they got power enough to do all those mischiefs which we have seen and felt. This <hi>being remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and spoken of,</hi> it <hi>was soon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd</hi> that the Tables only were now turn'd, and that now the publick zeal and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness against those men and those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions, which so lately have afflicted us, might give to the Emissaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> leisure and opportunity to grow into numbers and strength to debauch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the safety and peace of the Kingdom. In <hi>Ireland</hi> we saw too much of it done, and found the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief growing too fast, and the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable inconveniencies, but too justly apprehended, as near and imminent. We had reason at least to cry Fire when it fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med through our very Roofs, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with all care and diligence when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:100736:4"/>
and the eternal Interest of Souls was at stake, as knowing we should be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unfit to appear and account to the <hi>great Bishop and Shepherd of Souls</hi> if we had suffer'd the enemies to sow tares in our fields, we standing and looking on. It was therefore consider'd how we might best serve God, and rescue our charges from their danger, and it was concluded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to run to arms, I mean to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our warfare, to the armour of the Spirit, to the works of our calling, and to tell the people of their peril, to warn them of the enemy, and to lead them in the ways of truth and peace and holiness: that if they would be admonished, they might be safe; if they would not, they should be without excuse, because they could not say but the Prophets have been amongst them.</p>
                  <p>But then it was next enquired who should minister in this affair, and put in order all those things which they had to give in charge: It was easie to chuse many, but hard to chuse one; there were many fit to succeed in the vacant Apostleship, and though <hi>Barsabas the Just</hi> was by all the Church nam'd as a fit and worthy man,
<pb facs="tcp:100736:5"/>
yet the lot fell upon <hi>Matthias;</hi> and that was my case, it fell to me to be their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuensis,</hi> when persons most worthy were more readily excus'd; and in this my Lords the Bishops had reason, that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S. <hi>Paul'</hi>s rule) <hi>If there be</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>judgments or controversies amongst us, they should be imploy'd who are least esteem'd in the Church;</hi> and upon this account I had nothing left me but Obedience; though I confess that I found regret in the nature of the imployment, for I love not to be (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it) one of the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputers of this world.</hi> For I suppose skill in Controversies (as they are now us'd) to be the worst part of Learning, and time is the worst spent in them, and men the least benefited by them; that is, when the Questions are curious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, intricate and inexplicable, not to make men better, but to make a Sect. But when the Propositions disputed are of the foundation of Faith, or lead to good life, or naturally do good to single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or publick societies, then they are part of the <hi>Depositum</hi> of Christianity, of the <hi>Analogy of faith;</hi> and for this we are by
<pb facs="tcp:100736:5"/>
the Apostle commanded <hi>to contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,</hi> and therefore Controversies may become necessary; but because they are not often so, but oftentimes useless and always troublesom; and as an ill diet makes an ill habit of body, so does the frequent use of controversies baffle the understanding, and makes it crafty to deceive others, it self remaining instructed in nothing but use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less notions and words of contingent signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and distinctions without difference, which minister to pride and contention and teach men to be pertinacious, troublesome and uncharitable, therefore I love them not.</p>
                  <p>But because by the Apostolical Rule I am tyed <hi>to do all things without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 14.</note> as well as without <hi>disputings,</hi> I consider'd it over again, and found my self reliev'd by the subject matter, and the grand consequent of the present Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For in the present affair, the case is not so as in the others; here the Questions are such that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> declares them to reach as far as eternity, and damn all that are not of their opinions; and the Protestants have much more reason to fear concerning the Papists, such who are not

excus'd by ignorance, that their condition is very sad and deplorable, and that it is charity to snatch them as a brand from the fire; and indeed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintains Propositions, which, if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Doctors of the Church may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, are apt to separate from God. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in their super addition of Articles and Propositions, derived only from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended tradition, and not contain'd in Scripture.

                  <p>But we have observed amongst the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the <hi>Irish,</hi> such a declension of Christianity, so great credulity to believe every superstitious story, such confidence in vanity, such groundless pertinacy, such vicious lives, so little sense of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the fear of God, so much care to obey the Priests, and so little to obey God; such intolerable ignorance, such fond Oaths and manners of swearing, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more oblig'd by swearing on the Mass-book, than the four Gospels, and <hi>S.

their Ancestors were Priests, and they will not alter from their Religion; and after all, can give no account of their Religion what it is: only they believe as their Priest bids them, and go to Mass which they understand not, and reckon their Beads to tell the number and the tale of their prayers, and abstain from Eggs and Flesh in Lent, and visit Saint <hi>Patrick'</hi>s Well, and leave Pins and Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons, Yarn or Thred in their holy Wells, and pray to God, S. <hi>Mary</hi> and S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> S. <hi>Columbanus</hi> and S. <hi>Bridget,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be buried with S. <hi>Francis'</hi>s Cord about them, and to fast on Saturdays in honour of our Lady.

                     <hi>But I shall give one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar instance of their miserable superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and blindness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I was lately within a few months very much troubled with Petitions and earnest Requests for the restoring a Bell, which a Person of Quality had in his hands in the time of, and ever since, the late Rebellion. I could not guess at the reasons of their so great and violent importunity, but told the Petitioners, If they could prove that Bell to be theirs, the Gentleman was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pay the full value of it; though he had no obligation to do so (that I know of) but charity: but this was so far from satisfying them, that still the importunity increased, which made me diligently to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the secret of it. The first cause I found was, that a dying person in the Parish desired to have it rung before him to Church, and pretended he could not die in peace if it were deny'd him; and that the keeping of that Bell did anciently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to that family from father to son: but because this seem'd nothing but a fond and an unreasonable superstition, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired further, and at last found that they believ'd this Bell came from Heaven,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:100736:9"/>
and that it used to be carried from place to place, and to end Controversies by Oath, which the worst men durst not violate if they swore upon that Bell, and the best men amongst them durst not but believe him; that if this Bell was rung before the Corps to the grave, it would help him out of Purgatory; and that therefore when any one died, the friends of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased did, whilest the Bell was in their possession, hire it for the behoof of their dead, and that by this means that Family was in part maintain'd. I was troubled to see under what spirit of delusion those poor souls do lie, how infinitely their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity is abused, how certainly they believe in trifles, and perfectly rely on vanity, and how little they regard the truths of God, and how not at all they drink of the waters of Salvation. For the numerous companies of Priests and Friars amongst them take care they shall know nothing of Religion, but what they design for them, they use all means to keep them to the use of the <hi>Irish</hi> Tongue, lest if they learn <hi>English</hi> they might be supplied with persons fitter to instruct them; the people are taught to make that also their
<pb facs="tcp:100736:10"/>
excuse for not coming to our Churches, to bear our advices, or converse with us in religious intercourses, because they understand us not, and they will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand us, neither will they learn that they may understand and live. And this and many other evils are made greater and more irremediable by the affrightment which their Priests put upon them by the issues of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, by which (they now exercising it too publickly) they give them Laws, not only for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but even for Temporal things, and turn their Proselytes from the Mass, if they become Farmers of the Tithes from the Minister or Proprietary without their leave. I speak that which I know to be true by their own confession and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd and uninvited Narratives; so that as it is certain that the <hi>Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it stands in distinction and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from us, is a body of strange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, having but little relish of true primitive and pure Christianity, (as will he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

barbarous mannèr of living, a device to enable them to dwell alone, and to be <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus unius labii,</hi> a people of one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and unmingled with others. And if this be Religion, it is such a one as ought to be reproved by all the severities of Reason and Religion, lest the people perish, and their souls be cheaply given away to them that make merchandize of souls, who were the purchace and price of Christ's bloud.</p>
                  <p>Having given this sad account, why it was necessary that my Lords the Bishops should take care to do what they have done in this affair, and why I did consent to be engaged in this Controversie, otherwise than I love to be, and since it is not a love of trouble and contention, but charity to the souls of the poor deluded <hi>Irish,</hi> there is nothing remaining but that we humbly desire of God to accept and to bless this well-meant <hi>Labour of Love,</hi> and that by some admirable ways of his Providence, he will be pleas'd to convey to them the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of their danger, and their sin, and to de-obstruct the passages of necessary truth to them, for we know the arts of their Guides, and that it will be very
<pb facs="tcp:100736:11"/>
hard that the notice of these things shall ever be suffer'd to arrive to the common people, but <hi>that which hinders will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der until it be taken away:</hi> however we believe and hope in God for remedy.</p>
                  <p>For although <hi>Edom</hi> would not let his brother <hi>Israel</hi> pass into his Countrey, and the Philistims would stop the Patriarchs Wells, and the wicked Shepherds of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> would drive their Neighbours Flocks from the watering troughs, and the Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of <hi>Rome</hi> use all arts to keep the people from the use of Scriptures, the Wells of salvation, and from entertaining the notices of such things which from the Scriptures we teach; yet as God found out a remedy for those of old, so he will also for the poor misled people of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and will take away the evil minds, or the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of the Adversaries hindering the people from Instruction, and make way that the Truths we have here taught may approach to their ears, and sink into their hearts, and make them wise unto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>THE Questions of difference between <hi>Our Churches</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have been so often disputed, and the evidences on both sides so often produc'd, that to those who are strangers to the present constitution of affairs, it may seem very unnecessary to say them over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and yet it will seem almost impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to produce any new matter; or if we could, it will not be probable, that what can be newly alleged can prevail more than
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100736:14"/>
all that which already hath been so often ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in these Questions. But we are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd from doing our duty by any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations: as knowing, that the <hi>same</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments are with success applied to a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning</hi> or an <hi>abiding</hi> Ulcer; and the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of God's word must for ever be ready to put the People in mind of such things, which they already have heard, and by the same Scriptures and the same reasons endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to destroy their sin, or prevent their danger; and by the same word of God to extirpate those errors, which have had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in the time of our late disorders to spring up and grow stronger, not when the Keepers of the field <hi>slept,</hi> but when they were <hi>wounded,</hi> and their hands cut off, and their mouths stopp'd lest they should continue, or proceed to do the work of God thoroughly.</p>
                     <p>A little warm Sun, and some indulgent showers of a softer rain, have made many weeds of erroneous Doctrine to take root greatly, and to spread themselves widely: and the Bigots of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church by their late importune boldness and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet frowardness in making Proselytes have but too manifestly declar'd to all the World, that if they were <hi>rerum potiti,</hi> Masters of our affairs, they would suffer nothing to grow but their own Colocynths and Gourds. And although the <hi>Natural remedy</hi> for this were to take away <hi>that impunity,</hi> upon the

Moderate, the Peaceable and the Wise, it is the best, the most certain, visible and tangible, most humble and satisfactory, but also because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does with greatest noises pretend her Conformity to Antiquity. Indeed the present <hi>Roman</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which are in difference, were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and unheard of in the <hi>first and best an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> and with how ill success their quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are out of the Fathers of the first three Ages, every enquiring Man may easily discern. But the noises therefore which they make are from the Writings of the succeeding Ages; where secular interest did more prevail, and the writings of the Fathers were vast and voluminous, full of controversie, and ambiguous senses, sitted to their own times and questions, full of proper opinions, and such variety of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that both sides eternally and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futably shall bring sayings for themselves respectively. Now although things being thus, it will be impossible for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the sayings of a number of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that their doctrine, which they would prove thence, was the Catholick Doctrine of the Church; because any number that is less than all, does not prove a Catholick consent; yet the clear sayings of one or two of these Fathers truly alleged by us to the contrary, will certainly prove that what many of them (suppose it) do affirm, and which but two or three as good Catholicks
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100736:16"/>
as the other do deny, was not then matter of faith or a Doctrine of the Church; for if it had, these had been Hereticks accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not have remain'd in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church. But although for the reasonableness of the thing we have thought fit to take notice of it; yet we shall have no need to make use of it; since not only in the prime and purest Antiquity we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably more than Conquerors; but even in the succeeding Ages, we have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage both <hi>numero, pondere &amp; mensurâ,</hi> in number, weight and measure.</p>
                        <p>WE do easily acknowledge that to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute these questions from the sayings of the Fathers is not the readiest way to make an end of them; but therefore we do wholly rely upon Scriptures as the foundation and final resort of all our perswasions, and from thence can never be confuted; but we also admit the Fathers as admirable helps for the understanding of the Scriptures, and as good testimony of the Doctrine deliver'd from their fore-fathers down to them of what the Church esteem'd the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and therefore if we sind any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine now taught, which was not plac'd in their way of Salvation, we reject it as being no part of the Christian faith, and which ought not to be impos'd upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. They were <hi>wise unto salvation,</hi> and <hi>fully instructed to every good work;</hi> and therefore the faith which they profess'd and

So that by their confession, all the Doctrine, which <hi>we teach</hi> the People, as matter of Faith, must be confessed to be Ancient, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and Apostolick, or else <hi>theirs</hi> is not so: for <hi>ours is the same,</hi> and <hi>we both</hi> have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100736:18"/>
received this faith from the fountains of Scripture and Universal Tradition; <hi>not they from us, or we from them, but both of us from Christ and his Apostles.</hi> And therefore there can be no question whether the Faith of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be Apostolick or Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; it is so, confessedly: But the Question is concerning many other particulars which were unknown to the Holy Doctors of the first ages, which were <hi>no part of their faith,</hi> which were never put into their Creeds, which were <hi>not determin'd in any of the four first General Councils,</hi> rever'd in all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and entertain'd every where with great Religion and veneration, even next to the <hi>four Gospels</hi> and the Apostolical writings.</p>
                        <p>OF this sort, because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath introduc'd <hi>many,</hi> and hath adopted them into their late Creed, and imposes them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People, not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the Scriptures and the Catholick Doctrine of the Church of God; laying heavy burdens on Mens consciences, and making the narrow way to Heaven yet narrower by their own inventions; arrogating to themselves a <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over our faith,</hi> and prescribing a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Salvation which Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles never taught; corrupting the faith of the Church of God, and <hi>teaching for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the Commandments of Men;</hi> and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, having derogated from the Prerogative of Christ, <hi>who alone</hi> is the Author and Finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our faith, and hath perfected it in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100736:19"/>
revelations consign'd in the Holy Scriptures; therefore it is, that we esteem our selves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to warn the People of their danger, and to depart from it, and call upon them to stand upon the ways, and ask after the <hi>old paths,</hi> and <hi>walk in them;</hi> lest they partake of that curse which is threatned by <hi>God</hi> to them, <hi>who remove the Ancient Land-marks which our Fathers</hi> in Christ <hi>have set</hi> for us.</p>
                        <p>NOW that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot pretend that <hi>all</hi> which she imposes is Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Apostolick, appears in this; That <hi>in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>there is pretence made to a power, not only of declaring new articles of faith, but of making new Symbols or Creeds, and imposing them as of necessity to Salvation.</hi> Which thing is evident in the Bull of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth against <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> in which, amongst other things, he is condemn'd for saying, [<hi>It is certain that it is not in the power of the Church or Pope to constitute Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith.</hi>] We need not add that this power is attributed to the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Turrecremata</hi>

Fathers, <hi>Ambrose Hilary, Hierom, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> speak <hi>nothing</hi> of <hi>Indulgences.</hi> And whereas it is said that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> DC. years after Christ, gave Indulgences at <hi>Rome</hi> in the stations; <hi>Magister Angularis</hi> who lived about 200. years since, says, <hi>he never read of any such any where;</hi> and it is certain there is no such thing in the writings of S. <hi>Gregory, nor in any history</hi> of that age or any other that is Authentick: and we could never see any History pretended for it by the <hi>Roman</hi> writers, but a <hi>Legend</hi> of <hi>Ledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> brought to us the other day by <hi>Surius:</hi> which is so ridiculous and weak, that even their own parties dare not avow it as true story; and therefore they are fain to make use of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> upon the Sentences, and <hi>Altisiodorensis</hi> for story and record.

But indulge thy brother, and it shall be indulg'd to thee: you have need to inquire for no other indulgence to thy sins; if thou wilt retire into the closet of thy heart, there thou shalt find it.</hi> That is, <hi>All our hopes of Indulgence is from GOD through JESUS CHRIST,</hi> and is wholly to be obtain'd by faith in Christ, and perseverance in good works, and intire mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of all our sins.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this particular: Though the gains which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes of Indulgences, be a heap almost as great as the abuses themselves, yet the greatest Patrons of this new Doctrine could never give any <hi>certainty,</hi> or <hi>reasonable comfort</hi> to the Conscience of any person that could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into it. They never durst determine, whether they were <hi>Absolutions,</hi> or <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations;</hi>
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100736:28"/>
whether they only take off the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances <hi>actually</hi> impos'd by the Confessor, or <hi>potentially,</hi> and all that which might have been impos'd; whether all that may be paid in the <hi>Court of men;</hi> or all that can or will be required by the Laws and <hi>severity of God.</hi> Neither can they speak rationally to the <hi>Great Question,</hi> Whether the Treasure of the Church consists of the Satisfactions of Christ only, or of the Saints? For if of Saints, it will by all men be acknowledged to be a defeisible estate, and being finite and limited, will be spent sooner than the needs of the Church can be served; and if therefore it be necessary to add the <hi>merits and satisfaction of Christ,</hi> since they are an Ocean of infinity, and can <hi>supply more than all our needs, to what purpose is it to add the little minutes and droppings of the Saints?</hi> They cannot tell whether they may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if the Receiver do nothing, or give nothing for them: And though this last particular could better be resolv'd by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> than by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet all the Doctrines which built up the <hi>new Fabrick of Indulgences,</hi> were so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to determine, so improbable, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, or at best so uncertain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious, that according to the advice of the Bishop of <hi>Modena,</hi> the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> left <hi>all the Doctrines,</hi> and all the cases of Conscience quite alone, and slubber'd the whole matter both in the question of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences

and Purgatory in <hi>general</hi> and <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory</hi> terms; affirming, that the power of giving Indulgence is in the Church, and that the use is wholsome: And that all hard and subtil questions (<hi>viz.</hi>) concerning Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, (which although (if it be at all) it is a fire, yet is the fuel of Indulgences, and maintains them wholly;) all that is suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be false, and all that is uncertain; and whatsoever is curious and superstitious, scandalous, or for filthy lucre, be laid aside. And in the mean time, <hi>they tell us not what is, and what is not Superstitions;</hi> nor what is <hi>Scandalous,</hi> nor what they mean by the general term of <hi>Indulgence;</hi> and they esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish no Doctrine, neither curious, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious, nor <hi>durst they decree the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of this whole matter, <hi>The Churches Treasure:</hi> Neither durst they meddle with it, but left it as they found it, and <hi>continued</hi> in the abuses, and <hi>proceed</hi> in the <hi>practice,</hi> and set their Doctors, as well as they can, to defend all the new, and curious and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous questions, and to uphold the gainful trade.

                        <p>NOW from these premises we are not desirous to infer any odious consequences in reproof of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but we think it our duty to give our own people caution and admonition; 1. That they be not abus'd by the rhetorical words and high expressions alleged out of the Fathers, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Sacrament, <hi>The body or the slesh of Christ.</hi> For we <hi>all believe it is so,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it. But the question is, <hi>after what manner it is so;</hi> whether after the manner of the slesh, or after the manner of spiritual grace, and sacramental consequence? We <hi>with</hi> the Holy Scriptures and the primitive Fathers, affirm the latter. The Church of <hi>Rome against</hi> the words of Scripture, and the explication of Christ<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 6. 63.</note>, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the primitive Church, affirm the former. 2. That they be careful not to admit such Doctrines under a pretence of being Ancient; since, although <hi>the Roman errour hath been too long admitted, and is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in respect of our days, yet it is an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Christianity,</hi> and brought in by ignorance, power and superstition, very many Ages after Christ. 3. We exhort them, that they remember the words of Christ, when he explicates the doctrine of <hi>giving us his flesh for meat, and his bloud for</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Vbi suprae.</note>
                           <pb n="59" facs="tcp:100736:42"/>
                           <hi>drink,</hi> that he tells us, <hi>The flesh profiteth nothing, but the words which be speaks are spirit, and they are life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. THAT if those ancient and primitive Doctors above cited, say true, and that the symbols still remain the same in their natural substance and properties, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are blessed, and when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and that Christ's body and bloud are only present to faith and to the spirit, that then whoever tempts them to give Divine honour to these symbols or elements (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does) tempts them to give to a creature the due and incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable propriety of God; and that then, this evil passes further than an errour in the understanding; for it carries them to a <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practice,</hi> which cannot reasonably be excus'd from the crime of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> To conclude,</p>
                        <p>THIS matter of it self is an error so prodigiously great and dangerous, that we need not tell of the horrid and <hi>blasphemous questions</hi> which are sometimes handled by them concerning this Divine Mystery. As, if a Priest going by a Baker's shop, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with intention, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> whether all the Bakers bread be turned into the body of Christ? Whether a Church mouse does eat her Maker? Whether a man by eating the consecrated symbols does break his fast? For if it be not bread and wine, he does not: and if it be Christ's
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100736:43"/>
body and bloud naturally and properly, it is not bread and wine. Whether it may be said, the Priest is in some sense the Creator of God himself? Whether his power be greater than the power of Angels and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels? For that it is so, is expresly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Gloria mundi 4. num. 6.</note> by <hi>Cassenaeus.</hi> Whether (as a <hi>Bohemian</hi> Priest said) that a Priest before he say his first Mass, be the Son of God, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he is the Father of God and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of his body? But against this blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a book was written by <hi>John Huss,</hi> about the time of the Council of <hi>Constance.</hi> But these things are too bad, and therefore we love not to rake in so filthy chanels, but give only a general warning to all our Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to take heed of <hi>such persons,</hi> who from the proper consequences of their Articles, grow too bold and extravagant; and, of <hi>such doctrines,</hi> from whence these and many other evil Propositions <gap reason="foreign">

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                           <hi>of Transubstantiation, is absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, and implies contradictions very many, to the belief of which no faith can oblige us, and no reason can endure.</hi> For Christ's body being in heaven, glorious, spiritual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible, cannot be broken. And since by the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine nothing is broken, but that which cannot be broken, that is, the colour, the taste, and other accidents of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100736:43"/>
yet if they could be broken, since the accidents of bread and wine are not the substance of Christ's body and bloud, it is certain that on the Altar, Christ's body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and properly cannot be broken. * And since they say that every consecrated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Wafer is Christ's whole body, and yet this Wafer is not that Wafer, therefore either this or that is not Christ's body, or else Christ hath two bodies, for there are two Wafers. * But when Christ instituted the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Sacrament, and said, <hi>This is my body which is broken:</hi> because at that time Christ's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was not broken naturally and properly, the very words of Institution do force us to understand the Sacrament in a sense <hi>not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> but <hi>spiritual,</hi> that is, <hi>truly sacramental.</hi> * And all this is besides the plain. demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of sense, which tells us it is bread and it is wine naturally as much after as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consecration. * And after all, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> sense is such as our blessed Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in the men of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and called them to a spiritual understanding; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense being not only unreasonable and impossible; but also to no purpose of the spirit, or any ways perfective of the soul; as hath been clearly demonstrated by many learned men against the fond <hi>hypothesis</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Article.</p>

                           <p>Worship of Images. What they call giving them due honour. This worship first brought in by Hereticks. Opposed by the first Fathers. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his zeal against it. Forbidden by the Council of <hi>Eliberis.</hi> First decreed by the second Council of Nice. Condemned by the Synod of <hi>Frankford,</hi> convened by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, under whose name a Book was published against that Nicene Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and the worship of Images. Against which the Primitive Christians were so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd, that they would not allow Images to be made.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath to very bad purposes introduc'd and impos'd upon Christendom the worship and veneration of Images, kissing them, pulling off their hats, kneeling, falling down and praying before them, which they call, <hi>giving them due honour and veneration.</hi> What <hi>external honour and veneration</hi> that is, which they call <hi>due,</hi> is express'd by the instances now reckon'd, which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in their Decree enumerate and establish. What <hi>the inward honour and worship</hi> is, which they intend to them, is intimated in the same Decree. By the Images they worship Christ and his Saints; and therefore by these Images they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100736:50"/>
pass that honour to Christ and his Saints which is their due: that is, as their Doctors explain it, <hi>Latria</hi> or Divine worship to God and Christ. <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> or more than ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or <hi>doulia</hi> to other canoniz'd persons. So that upon the whole, the case is this: Whatever worship they give to God, and Christ and his Saints, they give it first to the image, and from the image they pass it unto Christ and Christ's servants. And therefore we need not to enquire what acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they suppose to be fit or due. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is due to God, to Christ or his Saints, that worship they give to their respective Images: all the same in external semblance and ministery; as appears in all their great Churches, and publick actions, and proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and Temples and Festivals, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, and censings, and pilgrimages, and prayers, and vows made to them.</p>
                        <p>NOW besides that these things are so like Idolatry, that they can no way be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably excused (of which we shall in the next Chapter give some account) besides<note place="margin">Chap. 2. Sect. 12.</note> that they are too like the religion of the Heathens, and so plainly and frequently forbidden in the Old Testament, and are so infinitely unlike the simple and wise, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and holy, the pure and the spiritual religion of the Gospel; besides that they are so infinite a scandal to the Jews and Turks, and reproach Christianity it self
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100736:51"/>
amongst all strangers that live in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and observe their rites: besides that they cannot pretend to be lawful, but with the laborious artifices of many Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical notions and distinctions, which the people who most need them, do least under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; and that therefore the people wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them without these distinctions, and directly put confidence in them; and that it is impossible that ignorant persons, who in all Christian countreys make up the biggest number, should do otherwise, when otherwise they cannot understand it; and besides that, the thing it self with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinctions, is a superstitious and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, an unlawful and unnatural worship of God, who will not be worshipped by an Image: we say that besides all this, This whole Doctrine and practice is an innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Christian Church, not practis'd, not endured in the primitive ages; but expresly condemned by them, and this is our present undertaking to evince.</p>

                           <p>Setting up the Pope as universal Bishop, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation. Among the Apostles (the first Church-Governours) no Prerogative of one over the rest, a remarkable testimony of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to prove it. Bishops succeeded the Apostles without Superiority of one over another by Christs Law. The Pope has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded their rights; and diminished their power many ways. Primitivs Fathers make every Bishop to have a share of power not from another Bishop but from Christ; and are against one Bishops judging and forcing another Bishop to obedience. Popes opposed when they interposed their authority in the affairs of other Churches.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE last Instance of Innovations intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in Doctrine and Practice by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we shall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, is that of the Popes Universal Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. That is, not only that he is Bishop of Bishops, superiour to all and every one; but that his Bishoprick is a Plenitude of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100736:55"/>
Power; and as for other Bishops, <hi>of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they all receive,</hi> a part of the Ministery and sollicitude; and not only so, but that he only is a Bishop by immediate Divine Dispensation, and others receive from him whatsoever they have. For to this height many of them are come at last. Which Doctrine, although as it is in sins, where the carnal are most full of reproach, but the spiritual are of greatest malignity; so it happens in this Article. For though it be not so scandalous as their Idolatry, so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous as their Superstitions, so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable as their Doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, so easily reprov'd as their Half Communion, and Service in an unknown Tongue; yet it is of as dangerous and evil effect, and as false, and as certainly an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, as any thing in their whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation of Errours.</p>
                        <p>WHEN Christ founded his Church, he left it in the hands of his Apostles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prerogative given to one, or emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency above the rest, save only of priority and orderly precedency, which of it self was natural, necessary and incident. The Apostles govern'd all; their Authority was the sanction, and their Decrees and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were the Laws of the Church. They exercis'd a common jurisdiction, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it according to the needs and emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and circumstances of the Church. In the Council of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> gave not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100736:56"/>
the decisive sentence, but S. <hi>James,</hi> who was the Bishop of that See. Christ sent all his Apostles as his Father sent him; and therefore he gave to every one of them the whole power which he left behind; and to the Bishops congregated at <hi>Miletum,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>

Contrition with them not avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without confession to a Priest; but At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition with it is.

                        <p>OUR First instance is in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Repentance.</hi> For the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors teach, that unless it be by accident, or in respect of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligation, a sinner is not bound pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to repent of his sin as soon as he hath
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100736:64"/>
committed it. Some time or other he must do it, and if he take care so to order his affairs that it be not wholly omitted, but so that it be done one time or other, he is not by the precept or grace of Repentance bound to do more. <hi>Scotus</hi> and his Scholars say that a sinner is bound, <hi>viz.</hi> by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Church, to repent on Holy days, especially the great ones. But this is thought too severe by <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> who teach that a sinner is bound to repent but once a year, that is, against Easter. These Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors indeed do differ concerning the Churches sense; which according to the best of them is bad enough; full as bad as it is stated in the charge: but they agree in the worst part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that though the Church calls upon sinners to repent on Holy days, or at Easter; yet that by the Law of God they are not tied to so much, but only to repent in the danger or article of death. This is the express Doctrine taught in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous<note place="margin">Enchir. c l. n. 31.</note>

There is no negative precept forbidding such a perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> These are the words of this man, but the proper and necessary consequent of that which they all teach, and to which they must consent. For since it is certain that he who hath sinn'd against God and his Conscience, is in a state of enmity, we say he therefore ought to repent presently, because until he hath repented he is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God. This they confess, but they suppose it concludes nothing; for though they consider and confess this, yet they still saying, a man is not bound by God's Law to repent till the article of death, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently say the same thing that <hi>Reginal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> does, and that a man is not bound to come out of that state of enmity till he be in those circumstances that it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable if he does not then come out, he must stay in it for ever.

                        <p>IF it be answered, that this is not the doctrine of their Church, but of some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Doctors; we must tell you, that, if by the Doctrine of their Church they mean such things only as are decreed in their Councils; it is to be considered, that but few things are determined in their Councils; nothing but articles of belief, and the practice of Sacraments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to publick order: and if they will not be reproved for any thing but what we prove to be false in the articles of their simple belief, they take a liberty to say and to do what they list, and to corrupt all the World by their rules of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. But, that this is also the Doctrie of their Church their own men tell us. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis omnium.</hi> It is the Doctrine of all their men; so they affirm, as we have cited their own words above: who also undertake to tell us in what sense their Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to tye sinners to actual repentance; not as soon as the sin is committed, but at certain seasons, and then also to no more of it, than the external and ritual part. So that if their Church be injuriously charg'd, themselves have done it, not we. And besides all this: it is hard to suppose or expect that the innumerable cases of

conscience which a whole Trade of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Divines amongst them have made, can be entred into the records of Councils and publick decrees. In these cases we are to consider, who teaches them? Their Gravest Doctors, in the face of the Sun, under the intuition of Authority in the publick conduct of souls, in their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Sermons, in their books licens'd by a curious and inquisitive authority, not pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from them but by warranty from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hands intrusted to examine them, <hi>ne fides Ecclesioe aliquid detrimenti patioetur;</hi> that nothing be publish'd but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the Catholick faith.

But we shall have occasion again to speak to it, upon new particulars.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:100736:66"/>BUT this, though it be infinitely into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, yet it is but the beginning of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. For the guides of Souls in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church have prevaricated in all the parts of Repentance, most sadly and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously.</p>
                        <p>THE next things therefore that we shall remark are their Doctrines concerning <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition:</hi> which when it is genuine and true, that is, a true cordial sorrow for having sin'd against God; a sorrow proceeding from the love of God, and conversion to him, and ending in a dereliction of all our sins, and a walking in all righteousness, both the Psalms and the Prophets, the Old Testament and the New, the Greek Fathers and the Latin have allowed as sufficient for the pardon of our sins through faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ (as our Writers have often prov'd in their Sermons and books of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) yet first, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not allow it to be of any value, unless it be joyn'd with a desire to confess their sins to a Priest; saying, that a man by contrition is not reconcil'd to God, without their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental or Ritual penance, actual or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and this is decreed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which thing besides that it is against<note place="margin">Sessio. 4. c. 4.</note> Scripture, and the promises of the Gospel, and not only <hi>teaches for Doctrine the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men,</hi> but evacuates the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God by their Traditions, and weakens and discourages the best repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100736:67"/>
and prefers repentance towards men, before that which the Scripture calls <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT the malignity of this Doctrine and its influence it hath on an evil life appears in the other corresponding part of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crine. For as Contrition without their ritual and sacramental confession will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to God: so <hi>Attrition</hi> (as they call it) or <hi>contrition imperfect,</hi> proceeding from fear of damnation, together with their Sacrament will reconcile the sinner. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi> without it <hi>will not: attrition</hi> with it, <hi>will</hi> reconcile us; and therefore by this doctrine, which is expresly decreed at <hi>Trent,</hi> there is no necessity of <hi>Contrition</hi> at all; and <hi>attrition</hi> is as good to all intents and purposes of pardon: and a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will prevail as well as the greatest, the imperfect as well as the perfect. So <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lielmus<note place="margin">In 4. sent. dist. 18. q. 1.</note> de Rubeo</hi> explains this doctrine. <hi>He that confesses his sins, grieving but a little, obtains remission of his sins by the Sacrament of Penance ministred to him by the Priest ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving him.</hi> So that although God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Contrition in a penitent, hath not done his work for him without the Priests abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, in desire at least; yet if the Priest do his part, he hath done the work for the penitent, though God had not wrought that excellent grace of contrition in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</p>

                        <p>NOW let this be added to the former, and the sequel is this, That if a man live a wicked life for threescore or fourscore years together, yet if in the article of his death, sooner than which God hath not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to repent, he be a little sorrowful for his sins, then resolving for the present that he will do so no more; and though this sorrow hath in it no love of God, but only a fear of Hell, and a hope that God will pardon him, this, if the Priest ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves him, does instantly pass him into a

state of salvation.

                        <p>UPON these terms, it is a wonder that all wicked men in the world are not Papists; where they may live so merrily, and die so securely, and are out of all danger, unless peradventure they die very suddenly, which because so very few do, the venture is esteem'd nothing, and it is a thousand to one on the sinners side.</p>

                        <p>IN the Church of <hi>Sancta Maria de Popolo</hi> there are for every day in the year two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and eight hundred years of pardon, besides fourteen thousand and fourteen Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentanes; which in one year amount to more than a Million: all which are confirm'd by the Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> I. <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> IX. In the Church of S. <hi>Vitus</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destus</hi> there are for every day in the year seven thousand years and seven thousand Carentanes of pardon, and a pardon of a third part of all our sins besides; and the price of all this is but praying before an Altar in that Church. At the Sepulchre of Christ in <hi>Venice</hi> there is hung up a prayer of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> with an Indulgence of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and two thousand years, granted by <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIII.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100736:71"/>
communicated should pray there in the Franciscan Church of <hi>Sancta Maria de gli Angeli,</hi> and this pardon is <hi>ab omni poena &amp; culpa.</hi> The English of that we easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, but the meaning of it we do not, because they will not own that these Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences do profit any one whose guilt is not taken away by the Sacrament of Penance. But this is not the only snare in which they have inextricably entangled themselves: but be it as they please for this; whatever it was, it was since inlarged by <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. to all that shall wear S. <hi>Francis's</hi> Cord. The saying a few <hi>Pater nosters</hi> and <hi>Ave's</hi> before a privileg'd Altar can in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable places procure vast portions of this Treasure; and to deliver a soul out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, whom they list, is promised to many upon easie terms, even to the saying of their Beads over with an appendent Medal of the Pope's benediction. Every Priest at his third or fourth Mass is as sure (as may be) to deliver the souls of his Parents: And a thousand more such stories as these are to be seen every where and every day.</p>
                        <p>ONCE for all: There was a book printed at <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Francis Regnault, A. D.</hi> 1536. <hi>May</hi> 25. called <hi>The hours of the most blessed Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>according to the use of</hi> Sarum; in which for the saying three short prayers written in <hi>Rome</hi> in a place called <hi>The Chapel of the holy Cross of seven Romans,</hi> are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100736:72"/>
fourscore and ten thousand years of pardon of deadly sin. Now the meaning of these things is very plain. By these devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they serve themselves, and they do not<note place="margin">Tolct instr. sacerd. lib. 3. cap. 11. n. 6.</note> serve God. They serve themselves by this Doctrine: For they teach that what Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is ordinarily imposed, does not take away all the punishment that is due; for they do not impose what was anciently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd by the Penitential Canons, but some little thing instead of it: and it may be, that what was anciently enjoyned by the Penitential Canons, is not so much as God will exact, (for they suppose that he will forgive nothing but the guilt and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; but he will exact all that can be demanded on this side Hell, even to the last farthing he must be paid some way or other, even when the guilt is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) but therefore to prevent any failing that way, they have given Indulgences e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to take off what was due by the old Canons, and what may be due by the severity of God; and if these fail, they may have recourse to the Priests, and they by their Masses can make supply: so that their Disciples are well, and the want of ancient Discipline shall do them no hurt.</p>
                        <p>BUT then how little they serve God's end by treating the sinner so gently, will be very evident. For by this means they have found out a way, that though it may be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100736:72"/>
God will be more severe than the old Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Canons; and although these Canons were much more severe than men are now willing to suffer, yet neither for the one or the other shall they need to be troubled: they have found out an easier way to go to Heaven than so. An Indulgence will be no great charge, but that will take off all the supernumerary Penances which ought to have been imposed by the ancient Discipline of the Church, and may be required by God. A little alms to a Priest, a small oblation to a Church, a pilgrimage to the image or reliques of a Saint, wearing St. <hi>Francis's</hi> Cord, saying over the Beads with an hallowed Appendent, entering into a Fraternity, praying at a priviledg'd Altar, leaving a Legacy for a Soul-Mass, visiting a priviledg'd Cemetery, and twenty other devices will secure the sinner from suffering punishment here or hereafter, more than his friendly Priest is pleased gently to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

and done innumerable other sins, for every one of which he deserves to suffer forty years penance, and how much more in the account of God he deserves, he knows not; if he be attrite, and confess'd so that the guilt is taken away, yet as much temporal punishment remains due as is not paid here: but the Indulgences of the Church will take off so much as it comes to, even of all that would be suffer'd in Purgatory. Now it is true, that Purgatory (at least as is believ'd) cannot last a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand years; but yet God may by the acerbity of the flames in twenty years equal the Canonical Penances of twenty thousand years: to prevent which, these Indulgences of so many thousand years are devised. A wise and thrifty Invention sure, and well contriv'd, and rightly applotted according to every mans need, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they suspect his Bill shall amount to.</p>
                        <p>THIS strange Invention, as strange as it is, will be own'd, for this is the account of it which we find in <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though<note place="margin">De Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen l. 1. c. 9 sect.

But the use we make of it is this;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100736:73"/>
That since they have declar'd, that when sins are pardon'd so easily, yet the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remains so very great, and that so much must be suffered here or in Purgatory; it is strange that they should not only in effect pretend to shew more mercy than God does, or the primitive Church did; but that they should directly lay aside the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Discipline, and while they declaim against their Adversaries for saying they are not necessary, yet at the same time they should devise tricks to take them quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, so that neither Penances shall much smart here, nor Purgatory (which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to make men be <hi>Mulata's,</hi> as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> calls, half Christians, a device to make a man go to Heaven and to Hell too) shall not torment them hereafter. However it be, yet things are so ordered, that the noise of Penances need not trouble the greatest Criminal, unless he be so unfortunate as to live in no Countrey and near no Church, and without Priest, or friend, or money, or notice of any thing that is so loudly talk'd of in Christendom. <hi>If he be,</hi> he hath no help but one; he must live a holy and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere life, which is the only great calamity which they are commanded to suffer in the Church of <hi>England: but if he be not,</hi> the case is plain, he may by these Doctrines take his ease.</p>

                           <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors themselves know how to spoil the hopes from these large grants of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, if any should fancy that Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory would quickly be emptied, and no need to continue Pensions for those that died many Years since. Though a plenary or full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence (one would think) should make all sure, yet no such matter; for there is a <hi>more full</hi> and a <hi>most full indulgence.</hi> Other things that, they say, may evacuate Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, so that they lose their force: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they advise to imploy the Priest, and to multiply Masses.

                        </argument>
                        <p>WE doubt not but they who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the proper sequel of these things, will not wonder that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should have a numerous company of Proselytes, made up of such as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>David'</hi>s Army were. But that we may undeceive them also, for to their souls we intend charity and relief by this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, we have thought fit to add one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration more, and that is, That it is not fit that they should trust to this, or any thing of this, not only because there is no foundation of truth in these new devices,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100736:74"/>
but because even the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they are pinch'd with an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, let their hold go, and to escape, do in remarkable measures destroy their own new building.</p>
                        <p>THE case is this: To them who say, that if there were truth in these pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then all these, and the many millions of Indulgences more, and the many other ways of releasing souls out of Purgatory, the innumerable Masses said every day, the power of the Keys so largely imploy'd, would in a short time have emptied Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of all her sad inhabitants, or it may be very few would go thither, and they that unfortunately do, cannot stay long; and consequently, besides that this great soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and easiness of procedure would give confidence to the greatest sinners, and the hopes of Purgatory would destroy the fears of Hell, and the certainty of doing well enough in an imperfect life, would make men careless of the more excellent: besides these things, there will need no continuation of Pensions to pray for persons dead many years ago: To them, I say, who talk to them at this rate, they have enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                        <p>DECEIVE not your selves, there are more things to be reckon'd for than so. For when you have deserved great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for great sins, and the Guilt is taken off by Absolution, and (you suppose) the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100736:75"/>
Punishment by Indulgences or the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of others; it may be so, and it may be not so.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>FOR 1. it is according as your Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is. Suppose it for forty years, or it may be an hundred, or a thousand, (and that is a great matter) yet peradventure according to the old penitential rate you have deserved the Penance of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years; or at least you may have done so by the more severe account of God: If the Penance of forty years be taken off by your Indulgence, it does as much of the work as was promised or intended; but you can feel little ease, if still there remains due the Penance of threescore thousand years. No man can tell the difference when what remains shall be so great as to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all the evils of this life; and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement may be accounted by pen and ink, but will signifie little in the perception: it is like the casting out of a Devil out of a miserable Demoniack, when there still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains fifty more as bad as he that went away; the man will hardly find how much he is advanced in his cure.</item>
                           <item>BUT 2. you have with much labour and some charge purchased to your self so many <hi>Quadragenes</hi> or Lents of pardon; that is, you have bought off the Penances of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times forty days. It is well; but were you well advis'd? it may be your <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> are not <hi>Carenes,</hi> that is, are not a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100736:75"/>
quitting the severest Penances of fasting so long in bread and water: for there is great difference in the manner of keeping a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Lent, and it may be you have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased but some lighter thing; and then if your demerit arise to so many <hi>Carenes,</hi> and you purchased but mere <hi>Quadragenes,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a minute and table of particulars, you may stay longer in Purgatory than you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</item>
                           <item>3. BUT therefore your best way is to get a <hi>plenary Indulgence;</hi> and that may be had on reasonable terms: but take heed you do not think your self secure, for a plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence does not do all that it may be you require; for there is an Indulgence <hi>more full,</hi> and another <hi>most full,</hi> and it is not<note place="margin">Vide Joan. de Turre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremata in comment. dist. 1. de paenitent.</note> agreed upon among the Doctors whether a plenary Indulgence is to be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the taking off those Penances which were actually enjoyned by the Confessor, or how far they go further. And they that read <hi>Turrecremata, Navar, Cordubensis, Fabius Incarnatus, Petrus de Soto, Armilla aurea, Aquinas, Tolet, Cajetan,</hi> in their several accounts of Indulgences, will soon perceive that all this is but a handful of Smoke, when you hold it, you hold it not.</item>
                           <item>4. BUT further yet; all Indulgences are granted upon some inducement, and are not <hi>ex mero motu,</hi> or acts of mere grace without cause; and if the cause be not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, they are invalid: and whether the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100736:76"/>
cause be sufficient will be very hard to judge. And if there be for the Indulgence, yet if there be not a reasonable cause for the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Indulgence, you cannot tell how much you get: and the Preachers of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences ought not to declare how valid they are <hi>assertivè,</hi> that is, by any confidence; but <hi>opinativè</hi> or <hi>recitativè,</hi> they can only tell what is said, or what is their own opinion.</item>
                           <item>5. WHEN this difficulty is passed over, yet it may be the person is not capable of them; for if he be not in the state of Grace all is nothing; and if he be, yet if he does not perform the condition of the Indulgence actually, his mere endeavour or good desire is nothing. And when the conditions are actually done, it must be enquired whether in the time of doing them you were in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; whether you be so at least in the last day of finishing them: it is good to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in this, lest all evaporate and come to nothing. But yet suppose this too, though the work you are to do as the condition of the Indulgence, be done so well that you lose not all the Indulgence, yet for every degree of Imperfection in that work you will lose a part of the Indulgence, and then it will be hard to tell whether you get half so much as you propounded to your self.<note place="margin">

                        <p>WE desire that it be considered, how dangerously good life is undermined, by the Propositions collaterally taught by their Great Doctors, in this matter of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; besides the main and direct danger and deception.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Venial sins preceeding or following the work enjoyned for getting Indulgences, hinder not their fruit: but if they intervene in the time of doing them, than they hinder.</hi> By<note place="margin">Fab.

And if he be not, he hath paid his price for that which profits not, and he is made to relie upon that which will not support him. But though this being taught, doth evacuate the Indulgence, yet it is not taught to prevent the sin; for before and after, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit venial sins, there is no great matter in it: The inconvenience is not great, and the remedy is easie; you are told of your secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as to this point before-hand.</p>

God first is intreated for our selves, and when we are more excellent persons, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to intercede, and we shall prevail for others; but that a wicked person who is under actual guilt, and oblig'd himself to suffer all punishment, can ease and take off the punishment due to others by any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally good work done <hi>ungratiously,</hi> is a piece of new Divinity without colour of reason or religion. Others in this are something less scandalous; and affirm, that though it be not necessary that when the Indulgence is granted, the man should be in the state of grace, yet it is necessary that at some time or other he should be; at any time (it seems) it will serve. For thus they turn Divinity and the care of souls into Mathematicks and Clock-work, and dispute minutes and periods with God, and are careful to tell their people how much liberty they may take, and how far they may venture, lest they should lose any thing of their sins pleasure, which they can possibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Contrition</hi> is sufficient if it be but one little act, and that in the very Article of Death; and before that time it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary by the Law of God, nay it is indeed sufficient; but it is also insufficient, for without Confession in act or desire it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not. And though it be thus insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently sufficient, yet it is not necessary: For Attrition is also sufficient, if a Priest can be had, and then any little grief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding out of the fear of Hell will do it, if the Priest do but absolve.</p>

the labours of a holy and a regular life; and yet is so intangled with innumerable and inextricable cases of conscience, orders, humane prescripts, and great and little ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, that scruples are more increased than sins are lessened.</p>

The secret intention of which Proposition, and the malignity of it, consists in this, that it is not necessary for a man to repent spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily; and a man is not bound by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to interrupt the procedure of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, or to repent of his habit, but of the single acts that went before it. For as for those that come after, they are excus'd, if they be produc'd by a strong habit; and the greater the habit the less is the sin: But then as the repentance need not for that reason, be hasty and presently; so because it is only to be of single acts, the repentance it self need not be habitual, but it may be done in an instant; whereas to mortifie a habit of sin (which is the true and proper repentance) there is requir'd a longer time, and a procedure in the methods of a holy life. By this, and such like Propositions, and careless Sentences, they have brought it to that pass, that they reckon a single act of Contrition, at any time to be sufficient to take away the wickedness of a long life.</p>

and professedly disputed against us, and will not be denied. And that this Doctrine is infinitely destructive of the necessity of a good life, cannot be doubted of, when themselves do own the proper consequents of it, even the unnecessariness of present repentance, or before the danger of death; of which we have already given accounts. But the reason why we remark it here, is that which we now mentioned, because that by the Doctrine of vitious habits, having in them no malignity or sin but what is in the single preceding acts, there is an excuse made for millions of sins: For if by an evil habit the sinner is not made worse, and more hated by God, and his sinful acts made not only more, but more criminal; it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the sins are very much lessened: For they being not so voluntary in their exercise and distinct emanation, are not in present so malicious; and therefore he that hath gotten a habit of drunkenness or swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sins less in every act of drunkenness, or profane oath, than hethat acts them seldom, because by his habit he is more inclin'd, and his sins are almost natural, and less consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, less chosen, and not disputed against; but pass by inadvertency, and an untroubled consent, easily and promptly, and almost naturally from that principle: So that by this means, and in such cases when things are come to this pass, they have gotten an imperfect warrant to sin a great deal, and a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100736:84"/>
great while, without any new great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience: Which evil state of things ought to be infinitely avoided by all Christians that would be sav'd by all means; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all such Teachers, and all such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are carefully to be declin'd, who give so much easiness, not only to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, but to the sins themselves. But of this, we hope it may be sufficient to have given this short warning.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. THE distinction of Mortal and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial sins, as it is taught in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a great cause of wickedness, and careless conversation. For although we do with all the antient Doctors admit of the distinction of sins Mortal and Venial; yet we also teach, That in their own nature, and in the rigor of the Divine Justice, every sin is damnable, and deserves God's anger, and that in the unregenerate they are so accounted, and that in Hell the damned suffer for small and great in a common mass of torment; yet by the Divine mercy and compassion, the smaller sins which come by surprize, or by invincible ignorance, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency, or unavoidable infirmity, shall not be imputed to those who love God, and delight not in the smallest sin, but use caution and prayers, watchfulness and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies against them. But if any man delights in small sins, and heaps them into numbers, and by deliberation or licentiousness they grow numerous, or are in any sense chosen,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100736:84"/>
or taken in by contempt of the Divine Law, they do put us from the favour of God, and will pass into severe accounts. And though sins are greater or less by comparison to each other, yet the smallest is a burthen too great for us, without the allowances of the Divine mercy.</p>
                        <p>BUT the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, that there is a whole kind of sins, which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial in their own nature; such, which <hi>if they were all together,</hi> all in the world <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, could not equal one mortal sin<note n="*" place="margin">Bellar. l. 1. de amiss. gratiae, c. 13. sect. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum est.

                           <hi>etiamsi nullum pactum esset de remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi> though God's merciful Covenant of Pardon did not intervene. And whereas Christ said, <hi>Of every idle word a man shall speak, he shall give account at the day of judgment;</hi> and, <hi>By your words ye shall be justified;</hi> and, <hi>By your words ye shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: Bellarmine</hi> expresly affirms, <hi>It is not intelligible, how an idle word should in its own nature be worthy of the Eternal wrath of God and Eternal flames.</hi> Many other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate words are spoken by the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors in this Question, which we love not to aggravate, because the main thing is acknowledged by them all.</p>
                        <p>BUT now we appeal to the reason and Consciences of all men, Whether this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of sins Venial in their own nature, be not greatly destructive to a holy life?
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100736:85"/>
When it is plain, that they give rest to mens Consciences for one whole kind of sins; for such, which because they occur every day, in a very short time (if they be not interrupted by the grace of Repentance) will swell to a prodigious heap. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these we are bidden to be quiet; for we are told, that all the heaps of these in the world cannot put us out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Add to this, that it being in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of cases, impossible to tell which are, and which are not Venial in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in their appendent circumstances, either the people are cozen'd by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine into an useless confidence; and for all this talking in their Schools, they must nevertheless do to Venial sins, as they do to Mortal, that is, mortifie them, fight against them, repent speedily of them, &amp; keep them from running into mischief; and then all their kind Doctrines in this Article, signifie no comfort or ease, but all danger and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and useless dispute; or else, if really they mean, that this easiness of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be made use of, then the danger is imminent, and carelessness is introduc'd, and licentiousness in all little things is easily indulg'd; and mens souls are daily lessen'd without repair, and kept from growing towards Christian perfection, and from <hi>destroying the whole body of sin;</hi> and in short, <hi>despising little things, they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish by little and little.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="145" facs="tcp:100736:85"/>THIS Doctrine also is worse yet in the handling. For it hath infinite influence to the disparagement of holy life, not only by the uncertain, but as it must frequently happen, by the false determination of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable cases of conscience. For it is a great matter both in the doing and the thing done, both in the caution and the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whether such an action be a venial or a mortal sin. If it chance to be mortal, and your Confessor says it is venial, your soul is betrayed. And it is but a chance what they say in most cases; for they call what they please venial, and they have no certain rule to answer by; which appears too sadly in their innumerable differences which is amongst all their Casuists in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is, and what is not mortal; and of this there needs no greater proof than the reading the little Summaries made by their most leading guides of Consciences, <hi>Navar, Cajetane, Tolet, Emanuel Sà,</hi> and others; where one says such a thing is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and two say it is venial.</p>
                        <p>AND lest any man should say or think, this is no great matter, we desire that it be considered that in venial sins there may be very much phantastick pleasure, and they that retain them do believe so; for they suppose the pleasure is great enough to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the intolerable pains of Purgatory; and that it is more eligible to be in Hell a while, than to cross their appetites in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100736:86"/>
such small things. And however it happen in this particular, yet because the Doctors differ so infinitely and irreconcileably, in saying what is, and what is not Venial, whoever shall trust to their Doctrine, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that such a sin is Venial; and to their Doctrine, that says it does not exclude from God's favour, may be these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions be damned before he is aware.</p>
                        <p>WE omit to insist upon their express contradicting the words of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who taught his Church expresly, <hi>That we must work in the day time; for the night cometh, and no man worketh:</hi> Let this be as true as it can in the matter of Repentance and Mortification, and working out our pardon for mortal sins; yet it is not true in Venial sins, if we may believe their great<note n="*" place="margin">in 4 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100736:87"/>
decision of all cases in which there is a doubt or question made by themselves; and that is, <hi>That if an Opinion or Speculation be probable, it may in practice be safely followed:</hi> And if it be enquir'd, What is sufficient to make an opinion probable; the Answer is<note place="margin">Emanuel Sà aphor. verb.

                        <p>AND now we ought not to be press'd with any ones saying, that such an opinion is but the private opinion of one or more of their Doctors. For although in matters of Faith this be not sufficient, to impute a Doctrine to a whole Church, which is but the private opinion of one or more; yet because we are now speaking of the infinite danger of souls in that communion, and the horrid Propositions by which their Disciples are conducted, to the disparagement of good life, it is sufficient to allege the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and allowed sayings of their Doctors; because these sayings are their Rule of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and because the particular Rules of Conscience, use not to be decreed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, we must derive them from the places where they grow, and where they are to be found.</p>

                           <pb n="149" facs="tcp:100736:87"/>BUT besides, you will say, That this is but the private opinion of some Doctors; and what then? Therefore it is not to be called the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. True, we do not say, <hi>It is an Article of their Faith,</hi> but, <hi>a rule of manners:</hi> This is not indeed in any publick Decree; but we say, that although it be not, yet neither is the contrary. And if it be but a private opinion, yet, is it safe to follow it, or is it not safe? For that's the question, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the danger. If it be safe, then this is their rule, <hi>A private opinion of any one grave Doctor may be safely followed in the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Vertue and Vice.</hi> But if it be not safe to follow it, and that this does not make an opinion probable, or the practice safe; Who says so?

Yes: But these are not safe to follow; for they are but private Doctors: Or if it be safe to follow them, though they be no more, and the opinion no more but probable, then I may take the other side, and choose which I will, and do what I list in most cases, and yet be safe by the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Casuists; which is the great line, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral measure of most mens lives; and that is it which we complain of.

By the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of probability here is his warranty. And though the Church do not declare that Doctrine; that is, the Church doth not make it certain in Speculation, yet it may be safely done in practice: Here is enough to give peace of conscience to him that does it.

                        <p>THESE Opinions are indeed very strange to us of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but no strangers in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and, because they are taught by great Doctors, by Popes themselves, by Cardinals, and the Canon Law respectively, do at least become very probable, and therefore they may be believ'd and practis'd without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; according to the Doctrine of <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> And thus the most desperate things that ever were said by any, though before the Declaration of the Church they cannot become Articles of Faith, yet besides that they are Doctrines publickly allowed, they can also become Rules of practice, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities to the consciences of their disciples.</p>

                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:100736:90"/>To this we add, that which is usual in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Praxis Ecclesiae,</hi> the Practice of the Church. Thus if an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence be granted upon condition to visit such an Altar in a distant Church; the Nuns that are shut up, and Prisoners that cannot go abroad, if they address themselves to an Altar of their own with that intention, they shall obtain the Indulgence. <hi>Id enim confirmat Ecclesiae praxis,</hi> says <hi>Fabius;</hi> The<note place="margin">Scrutin Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerd. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg.</note> practice of the Church in this case gives first a probability in speculation, and then a certainty in practice. This instance, though it be of no concern, yet we use it as a particular to shew the Principle upon which they go. But it is practicable in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of greatest danger and concern. If the question be, Whether it be lawful to worship the Image of the Cross, or of Christ, with Divine worship? First, there is a Doctrine of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> for it, and <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez,</hi> and many others; therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and therefore is safe in practice; <hi>&amp; sic est Ecclesiae praxis,</hi> the Church also pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises so, as appears in their own Offices:<note place="margin">Part. 3 q. 25. art. 4.

we put our hopes of salvation; but in the Cross we put our hopes of salvation; for so the Church sings, (it is the practice of the Church) <hi>Hail O Cross, our only hope in this time of suffering; increase righteousness to the godly, and give pardon to the guilty:</hi> therefore the Cross of Christ is to be ador'd with Divine Adoration.</p>
                        <p>BY this Principle you may embrace any Opinion of their Doctors safely, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the practice of the Church do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, and you need not trouble your self with any further inquiry: and if an evil custom get amongst men, that very custom shall legitimate the action, if any of their grave Doctors allow it, or Good men use it; and Christ is not your Rule, but the Examples of them that live with you, or are in your eye and observation, that's your Rule. We hope we shall not need to say any more in this affair; the pointing out this rock may be warning enough to them that would not suffer shipwrack, to decline the danger that looks so formidably.</p>

Comparison between Their Prayers and Ours in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Their absurd manner of number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayers by Beads; and repetitions of the same words some hundreds of times, not to be distinguish'd from that of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which our Saviour reproves.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS these Evil Doctrines have general influence into Evil Life; so there are some others, which if they be pursued to their proper and natural issues; that is, if they be believ'd and practis'd, are enemies to the particular and specisick parts of Piety and Religion. Thus the very Prayers of the Faithful are, or may be, spoil'd by Doctrines publickly allowed, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>FOR 1. they teach, <hi>That prayers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> ex opere operato, <hi>or by the natural work it self, do prevail: For it is not essential to prayer for a man to think particularly of what he says; it is not necessary to think of the things signisied by the words: So Suarez</hi>
                           <note place="margin">De Orat. l. 3. c. 4.</note> teaches. <hi>Nay, it is not necessary to the essence of Prayer, that he who prays should think</hi> de ipsa locutione, <hi>of the speaking it self.</hi> And indeed it is necessary that they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100736:92"/>
should all teach so, or they cannot tolerably pretend to justifie their prayers in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue. But this is indeed their publick Doctrine: For prayers in the mouth of the man that says them <hi>are like the words</hi>

                           <hi>of a Charmer, they prevail even when they are not understood,</hi> says <hi>Salmeron.</hi> Or as <hi>Antoninus, They are like a precious stone, of</hi>

                           <hi>as much value in the hand of an unskilful man, as of a Jeweller.</hi> And therefore Attention to, or Devotion in our prayers, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: For the understanding of which, saith Cardinal <hi>Tolet,</hi> when it is said that you must say your prayers or offices attently, reverently and devoutly, you must know that Attention or Advertency to your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is manifold: 1. <hi>That you attend to the words, so that you speak them not too fast, or to begin the next verse of a Psalm, before he that recites with you hath done the former verse; and this attention is necessary. But</hi> 2. <hi>there is an attention which is by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the sense, and that is not necessary. For if it were, very extremely few would do their duty, when so very few do at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what they say.</hi> 3. <hi>There is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention relating to the end of prayer, that is, that he that prays, considers that he is present before God, and speaks to him; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is very prositable, but it is not necessary:</hi> No, not <hi>so much.</hi> So that by this Doctrine no attention is necessary, but to attend that the words be all said, and said right. But
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100736:92"/>
even this <hi>attention is not necessary that it should be actual, but it suffices to be virtual, that is, that he who says his office, intend to do so, and do not change his mind, although he does not attend: And he who does not change his mind, that is, unless observing himself not to attend, he still turn his mind to other things, he attends:</hi> meaning, he attends sufficiently, and as much as is necessary; though indeed speaking naturally and truly, he does not attend. If any man in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> had published such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as this, he should quickly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly have felt the severity of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Rod; but in <hi>Rome</hi> it goes for good Catholick Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>NOW although upon this account <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> is (it may be) good; and it is good to attend to the words of our prayer, and the sense of them; yet that it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, is evidently consequent to this. But<note place="margin">Ibid. n. 7.</note> it is also expresly affirm'd by the same hand; There ought to be devotion, that our mind be inflam'd with the love of God, though if this be wanting, without contempt, it is no deadly sin. <hi>Ecclesiae satisfit per opus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Vbi supra.</note> 
                           <hi>nec aliud jubet,</hi> saith <hi>Reginaldus:</hi> If ye do the outward work, the Church is satisfied, neither does she command any thing else. Good Doctrine this! And it is an excellent Church, that commands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him that prays, but to say so many words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="160" facs="tcp:100736:93"/>WELL! but after all this, if Devotion be necessary or not, if it be present or not, if the mind wander, or wander not, if you mind what you pray, or mind it not, there is an easie cure for all this: For Pope Leo granted remission of all negligences in their saying their offices and prayers to them, who after they have done, shall say this prayer, [To the Holy and Vndivided Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, To the Humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ crucified; To the fruitfulness of the most Blessed, and most Glorious Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to the Vniversity of all Saints, be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal praise, honour, vertue and glory, from every Creature; and to us remission of sins for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> Blessed are the bowels of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which bore the Son of the Eternal God; and blessed are the paps which suckled Christ our Lord: <hi>Pater noster. Ave Maria.</hi>] This prayer to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,<note place="margin">Vbi supra cap. 13.</note> is set down by Navar, and Cardinal Tolet.</p>
                        <p>THIS is the summ of the Doctrine, concerning the manner of saying the Divine offices in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which greater care is taken to obey the Precept of the Church, than the Commandments of God: [<hi>For the Precept of hearing Mass is not, to intend the words, but to be present at the Sacrifice, though the words be not so much as heard, and they that think the contrary, think so without any probable reason</hi>] saith <hi>Tolet.</hi> It seems there was not so much as<note place="margin">Ibid. n. 6.</note>
                           <pb n="161" facs="tcp:100736:93"/>
the Authority of one grave Doctor to the contrary; for if there had, the contrary opinion might have been probable; but all agree upon this Doctrine, all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>
                        <p>So that between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the difference in this Article is plainly this, They pray with their lips, we with the heart; we pray with the understanding, they with the voice; <hi>we pray, and they say prayers.</hi> We sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that we do not please God, if our hearts be absent; they say, it is enough if their bodies be present at their greatest solemnity of prayer, though they hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is spoken, and understand as little. And which of these be the better way of serving God, may soon be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, if we remember the complaint which God made of the Jews, <hi>This people draweth near me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</hi> But we know, that we are commanded to <hi>ask in faith,</hi> which is seated in the understanding, and requires the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the will, and holy desires; which cannot be at all, but in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which we have a knowledge of what we ask. <hi>The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man prevails:</hi> But what our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers want of this, they must needs want of blessing and prosperity. And if we lose the benefit of our prayers, we lose that great instrumentality by which Christians are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100736:94"/>
of pardon, and strengthened in faith, and confirm'd in hope, and increase in charity, and are protected by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and are comforted in their sorrows, and derive help from God: <hi>Ye ask, and have not, because ye ask amiss;</hi> that is Saint <hi>James</hi> his rule. They that pray not as they ought, shall never obtain what they fain would.</p>

                        <p>WE do not pick out these only, as the most singular, or the worst forms; for such as these are very numerous, as is to be seen

                        <p>THE first is, That in a Hymn which they (from what reason or Etymology we know not, neither are we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </p>
                        <p>THE other thing we tell of, is, That there is a Psalter of our Lady, of great and antient account in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> it hath been several times printed at <hi>Venice,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Leipsich;</hi> and the title is, [The Psalter of the Blessed Virgin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd

by the Seraphical Doctor S. <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alba,</hi> and Presbyter Cardinal of the Holy Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>] But of the Book it self, the account is soon made; for it is nothing but the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> an hundred and fifty in number are set down; alter'd indeed, to make as much of it as could be sense so reduc'd; In which the name of <hi>Lord</hi> is left out, and that of <hi>Lady</hi> put in; so that whatever <hi>David</hi> said of God and Christ, the same prayers, and the same praises they say of the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and whether all that can be said without intolerable blasphemy, we suppose needs not much disputation.</p>
                        <p>THE same things, but in a less propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and frequency, they say to other Saints.

                        <p>THIS is the manner of their devotion, describ'd for the use of their Exorcists; in which is such a heap of folly, madness, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, blasphemy, and ridiculous guises and playings with the Devil, that if any man amongst us should use such things, he would be in danger of being tried at the next Assizes for a Witch, or a Conjurer; however, certain it is, what ever the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil loses by pretending to obey the Exot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cist, he gains more by this horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery of Christianity.

                        <p>ONLY this we say, as to the thing it self:</p>
                        <p>THE casting out of Devils is a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power, and given at first for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fimation of Christian Faith, as the gifts of Tongues and Healing were, and therefore

we have reason to believe, that because it is not an ordinary power, the ordinary Exorcisms cast out no more Devils, than Extreme Unction cures sicknesses.

                           <pb n="196" facs="tcp:100736:111"/>AFTER all this, if their Doctrines as they are explicated by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and the Commentaries of their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Doctors, do make their Disciples guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> there is not any thing greater to deter men from them, than that danger to their Souls which is imminent over them, upon that acoount.</p>
                        <p>THEIR worshipping of Images we have already reprov'd upon the account of its novelty and innovation in Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But that it is against good life, a direct breach of the second Commandment, an Act of Idolatry, as much as the Heathens themselves were guilty of, in relation to the second Commandment, is but too evident by the Doctrines of their own Leaders.</p>
                        <p>FOR if to give Divine honour to a Creature be Idolatry, then the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teach their People to commit Idolatry: For they affirm, That the same worship which is given to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype or Principal, the same is to be given to the Image of it. As we worship the Holy Trinity, and Christ, so we may worship the Images of the Trinity, and of Christ; that is, with <hi>Latria,</hi> or Divine honour. <hi>This is the constant sentence of the Divines, The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is to be worshipped with the same honour and worship, with which we worship those whose</hi>

                           <hi>image it is,</hi> said <hi>Azorius,</hi> their great Master of Casuistical Theology. And this is the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100736:111"/>
Doctrine of their great Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Ales, Bonaventure, Albertus, Richardus, Capreolus, Cajetan, Coster, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Vasquez,</hi> the Jesuits of <hi>Colein, Triers</hi> and <hi>Mentz,</hi> approving <hi>Coster'</hi>s opinion.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER can this be eluded by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that though the same worship be given to the Image of Christ, as to Christ himself, yet it is not done in the same way; for it is <hi>terminatively</hi> to Christ or God, but <hi>relatively</hi> to the image, that is, to the image for God's or Christ's sake. For this is that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, that they give the same worship to an image, which is due to God; for what cause soever it be done, it matters not, save only that the excuse makes it in some sense, the worse for the Apology. For to do a thing which God hath forbidden, and to say it is done for God's sake, is to say, that for his sake we displease him; for his sake we give that to a Creature, which is God's own propriety. But besides this, we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and it is of it self evident, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Christian or Heathen, worships the image of any thing, cannot possibly worship that image <hi>terminatively,</hi> for the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an image is <hi>relative;</hi> and therefore if the man understands but common sense, he must suppose and intend that worship to be relative, and a Heathen could not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship an image with any other worship; and the second Commandment, forbidding to worship the <hi>likeness of any thing in Heaven
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100736:112"/>
and Earth,</hi> does only forbid that thing which is in Heaven to be worshipped by an image, that is, it forbids only a relative worship: For it is a contradiction to say, this is the image of God, and yet this is God; and therefore it must be also a contradiction, to worship an image with Divine worship <hi>terminatively,</hi> for then it must be that the image of a thing, is that thing whose image it is. And therefore these Doctors teach the same thing which they condemn in the Heathens.</p>
                        <p>BUT they go yet a little further: <hi>The Image of the Cross</hi> they worship with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour; and therefore although this Divine worship is but relative, yet conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the <hi>Cross it self</hi> is worshipped <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively</hi> by Divine adoration. For the Image of the Cross hath it relatively, and for the Crosses sake, therefore the Cross it self is the proper and full object of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine adoration. Now that they do and teach this, we charge upon them by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Records: For in the very Pontisical published by the Authority of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. these words are found, <hi>The Legats</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Edit. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. p. 672.</note> 
                           <hi>Cross must be on the right hand, because</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, <hi>or Divine honour is due to it.</hi> And if <hi>Divine honour relative</hi> be due to the Legates Cross, which is but the Image of Christ's Cross, then this Divine worship is termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on Christ's Cross, which is certainly but a meer Creature. To this purpose are the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100736:112"/>
words of <hi>Almain, The Images of the Trinity, and of the Cross, are to be ador'd with the worship of</hi> Latria; that is, Divine. Now if the Image of the Cross be the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, then the Cross it self, whose Image that is, must be the last object of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship; and if this be not Idolatry, it can never be told, what is the notion of the Word. But this passes also into other real effects: And well may the Cross it self be worshipped by Divine worship, when the Church places her hopes of salvation on the Cross; for so she does, says <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and makes one the argument of the other, and proves that the Church places her hopes of salvation on the Cross, that is, on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Christ's Passion, by a hymn which she uses in her offices; but this thing we have remark'd above, upon another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. Now although things are brought to a very ill state, when Christians are so probably and apparently charg'd with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and that the excuses are too sine to be understood by them that need them; yet no excuse can acquit these things, when the most that is, or can be said is this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that which is God's due, is given to a Creature, yet it is given with some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of intention, and metaphysical ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, and separation; especially, since, if there can be Idolatry in the worshipping of an Image, it is certain, that a relative Divine worship is this Idolatry; for no man
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100736:113"/>
that worships an Image (in that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or formality) can make the Image the last Object: Either therefore the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were not Idolaters in the worshipping of an Image, or else these men are. The Heathens did indeed infinitely more violate the first Commandment; but against the second, precisely and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from the first, the transgression is alike.</p>
                        <p>THE same also is the case in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the consecrated Bread and Wine: Of which how far they will be excused be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore God by their ignorant pretensions and suppositions, we know not; but they hope to save themselves harmless by saying, that they believe the Bread to be their Saviour, and that if they did not believe so, they would not do so. We believe that they say true; but we are afraid that this will no more excuse them, than it will excuse those who worship the Sun and Moon, and the Queen of Heaven, whom they would not worship, if they did not believe to have Divinity in them: And it may be observed, That they are very fond of that persuasion, by which they are led into this worship. The error might be some excuse, if it were probable, or if there were much temptation to it: But when they chuse this persuasion, and have nothing for it but a tropical expression of Scripture, which rather than not believe in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100736:113"/>

So that if there are good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, yet they are not such, as they are Papists; it's by Gods grace they are so, not by their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which tend to diminish and destroy Goodness in them.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AND now we shall plainly represent to our Charges, how this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stands. The case is this, the Religion of a Christian consists in Faith, and Hope, Repentance and Charity, Divine Worship
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100736:114"/>
and Celebration of the Sacraments, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in keeping the Commandments of God. Now in all these, both in Doctrines and Practices, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does dangerously err, and teaches men so to do.</p>
                        <p>THEY do injury to Faith, by creating new Articles, and enjoyning them as of necessity to salvation. * They spoil their Hope, by placing it upon Creatures, and devices of their own. * They greatly sin against Charity, by damning all that are not of their opinion, in things false or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, right or wrong. * They break in pieces the salutary Doctrine of Repentance, making it to be consistent with a wicked life, and little or no amendment. * They worship they know not what, and pray to them that hear them not, and trust on that which helps them not. * And as for the Commandments, they leave one of them out of their Catechisms and Manuals, and while they contend earnestly against some Opponents for the <hi>possibility</hi> of keeping them all, they do not insist upon the <hi>Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of keeping any in the course of their lives, till the danger or article of their death. * And concerning the Sacraments, they have egregiously prevaricated in two points. For not to mention their reckoning of seven Sacraments, which we only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100736:115"/>
away from the Laity; and they insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute little Sacraments of their own, they invent Rites, and annex spiritual graces to them, what they please themselves, of their own heads, without a Divine Warrant or Institution: and, * At last persuade their people to that which can never be excus'd, at least, from Material Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>IF these things can consist with the duty of Christians, not only to eat what they worship, but to adore those things with Divine Worship, which are not God: To reconcile a wicked life with certain hopes and expectations of Heaven at last, and to place these hopes upon other things than God, and to damn all the World that are not Christians at this rate, then we have lost the true measures of Christianity; and the Doctrine and Discipline of Christ is not a Natural and Rational Religion; not a Religion that makes men holy, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy under the conduct of a Sect, and it must rest in Forms and Ceremonies, and Devices of Mans Invention. And although we do not doubt, but that the goodness of God does so prevail over all the follies and malice of mankind, that there are in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> communion many very good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet they are not such as they are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, but by some thing that is higher, and before that, something that is of an abstract and more sublime consideration. And
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100736:115"/>
though the good people amongst them are what they are by the grace and goodness of God, yet by all or any of these opinions they are not so: But the very best suffer diminution, and alloy by these things; and very many more are wholly subverted and destroyed.</p>

                     <p>I WAS desirous of an opportunity in <hi>London</hi> to have discoursed with you concerning something of nearest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to you, but the multitude of my little affairs hindred me, and have brought upon you this trouble to read a long Letter, which yet I hope you will be more willing to do, because it comes from one who hath a great respect to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and a very great charity to your soul: I must confess I was on your behalf troubled when I heard you were fallen from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and entred into a voluntary, unnecessary schism, and departure from the Laws of the King, and the Communion of those with whom you have always lived in charity, going
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100736:131"/>
against those Laws in the defence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of which your Husband died, going from the Religion in which you were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, in which for so many years, you lived piously and hoped for Heaven, and all this without any sufficient reason, without necessity or just scandal ministred to you; and to aggravate all this, you did it in a time when the Church of <hi>England</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, when she was marked with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterisms of her Lord, the marks of the Cross of <hi>Jesus,</hi> that is, when she suffered for a holy cause and a holy conscience, when the Church of <hi>England</hi> was more glorious than at any time before; Even when she could shew more Martyrs and Confessors than any Church this day in Christendom, even then when a King died in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Religion, and thousands of Priests, learned and pious men suffered the spoiling of their goods rather than they would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake one Article of so excellent a Religion; So that seriously it is not easily to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that any thing should move you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be that which troubled the perverse Jews, and the Heathen Greek, <hi>Scandalum crucis,</hi> the scandal of the Cross; You stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that Rock of offence; You left us because we were afflicted, lessened in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumstances, and wrapped in a cloud; but give me leave only to remind you of that sad saying of the Scripture, that you may avoid the consequent of it; <hi>They
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100736:131"/>
that fàll on this stone shall be broken in pieces, but they on whom it shall fall shall be grinded to powder.</hi> And if we should consider things but prudently, it is a great argument that the sons of our Church are very conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and just in their perswasions, when it is evident, that we have no temporal end to serve, nothing but the great end of our souls, all our hopes of preferment are gone, all secular regards, only we still have truth on our sides, and we are not willing with the loss of truth to change from a persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a prosperous Church, from a Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Church that will not be reformed; lest we give scandal to good people that suffer for a holy conscience, and weaken the hands of the afflicted; of which if you had been more careful, you would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained much more innocent.</p>
                     <p>BUT I pray, give me leave to consider for you, because you in your change con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered so little for your self, what fault, what false doctrine, what wicked and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous proposition, what defect, what amiss did you find in the Doctrine and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For its doctrine,</hi> It is certain it professes the belief of all that is written in the Old and New Testament, all that which is in the three Creeds, the Apostolical, the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene,</hi> and that of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was decreed in the four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100736:132"/>
or in any other truly such, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was condemned in these, our Church hath legally declared it to be Heresie. And upon these accounts above four whole ages of the Church went to Heaven; they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized all their Catechumens into this faith, their hopes of heaven was upon this and a good life, their Saints and Martyrs lived and died in this alone, they denied Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to none that professed this faith. This is the Catholick faith, so saith the Creed of <hi>Athanasius;</hi> and unless a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men have power to alter the faith of God, whosoever live and die in this faith, are intirely <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Christian.</hi> So that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath the same faith without dispute that the Church had for 400 or 500 years, and therefore there could be nothing wanting here to saving faith, if we live according to our belief.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>For the Liturgy</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I shall not need to say much, because the case will be very evident; First, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the disputers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have not been very forward to object any thing against it, they cannot charge it with any evil: 2. Because for all the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and till the eleventh year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> your people came to our Churches and prayed with us till the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> came out upon temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, and made a Schism by forbidding
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100736:132"/>
the Queens Subjects to pray as by Law was here appointed, though the prayers were good and holy, as themselves did believe. That Bull enjoyned Recusancy, and made that which was an act of Rebellion, and Disobedience, and Schism, to be the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of your <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. And after this, what can be supposed wanting in order to salvation? We have the Word of God, the Faith of the Apostles, the Creeds of the Primitive Church, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the four first general Councils, a holy Liturgy, excellent Prayers, perfect Sacraments, Faith and Repentance, the ten Commandments, and the Sermons of Christ, and all the precepts and counsels of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; We teach the necessity of good works, and require and strictly exact the severity of a holy life; We live in obedience to God, and are ready to die for him, and do so when he requires us so to do; We speak honourably of his most holy Name, we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him at the mention of his Name, we confess his Attributes, we love his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we pray for all men, we love all Christians, even our most erring Brethren, we confess our sins to God and to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren whom we have offended, and to Gods Ministers in cases of Scandal, or of a troubled Conscience; We communicate often, we are enjoyned to receive the holy Sacrament thrice every year at least; Our Priests ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the penitent, our Bishops ordain
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100736:133"/>
Priests, and confirm baptized persons, and bless their people and intercede for them; and what could here be wanting to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? what necessity forced you from us? I dare not suspect it was a temporal regard that drew you away, but I am sure it could be no spiritual.</p>
                     <p>BUT now that I have told you, and made you to consider from whence you went, give me leave to represent to you, and tell you whither you are gone, that you may understand the nature and conditions of your change: For do not think your self safe, because they tell you that you are come to the Church; You are indeed gone from one Church to another, from a better to a worse, as will appear in the induction, the particulars of which before I reckon, give me leave to give you this advice; if you mean in this affair to understand what you do; it were better you enquired what your Religion is, than what your Church is; for that which is a true Religion, to day, will be so to morrow and for ever; but that which is a holy Church to day, may be heretical at the next change, or may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray her trust, or obtrude new Articles in contradiction to the old, or by new inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations may clude antient truths, or may change your Creed, or may pretend to be the Spouse of Christ when she is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, that is, adulterous to God: Your Religion is that which you must, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100736:133"/>
may competently understand; You must live in it; and grow in it, and govern all the actions of your life by it; and in all questions concerning the Church, you are to chuse your Church by the Religion, and therefore this ought first and last to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after. Whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be the Catholick Church, must depend upon so many uncertain enquires, is offered to be proved by so long, so tedious a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, hath in it so many intrigues and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths of Question, and is (like a long line) so impossible to be perfectly strait, and to have no declination in it when it is held by such a hand as yours, that unless it be by material enquiries into the Articles of the Religion, you can never hope to have just grounds of confidence. In the mean time you can consider this; if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were the Catholick, that is, so as to exclude all that are not of her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, then the Greek Churches had as good turn Turks as remain damned Christians, and all that are in the communion of all the other Patriarchal Churches in Christendom, must also perish like Heathens, which thing before any man can believe, he must have put off all reason, and all modesty, and all charity; And who can with any probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty think that <hi>the Communion of Saints</hi> in the Creed is nothing but the <hi>Communion of Roman Subjects,</hi> and the Article of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church was made up to dispark the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100736:134"/>
inclosures of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but to turn them into the pale of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church is as limited as ever it was, save only that the Synagogue is translated to <hi>Rome,</hi> which I think you will easily believe was a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition the Apostles understood not. But though it be hard to trust to it, it is also so hard to prove it, that you shall never be able to understand the measures of that question, and therefore your salvation can never depend upon it. For no good or wise person can believe that God hath tied our Salvation to impossible measures, or bound us to an Article that is not by us cognoscible, or intends to have us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by that which we cannot understand, and when you shall know that Learned men, even of the <hi>Roman</hi> party are not agreed concerning the Catholick Church that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to guide you, some saying that it is the virtual Church, that is, the Pope; some, that it is the representative Church, that is, a Council; Some that it is the Pope and the Council, the virtual Church and the representative Church together; Some, that neither of these, nor both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are infallible; but only, the essential Church, or the diffusive Church is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, from whom we must at no hand dissent; you will quickly find your self in a wood, and uncertain whether you have more than a word in exchange for your soul, when you are told you are in the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100736:134"/>
Catholick Church. But I will tell you what you may understand, and see and feel, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that your self can tell whether I say true or no concerning it. You are now gone to a Church that protects it self by arts of subtilty and arms, by violence and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting all that are not of their minds, to a Church in which you are to be a Subject of the King so long as it pleases the Pope: In which you may be absolved from your Vows made to God, your Oaths to the King, your Promises to Men, your duty to your Parents in some cases: A Church in which men pray to God and to Saints in the same Form of words in which they pray to God, as you may see in the Offices of Saints, and particularly of our Lady: a Church in which men are taught by most of the principal Leaders to worship Images with the same worship with which they worship God and Christ, or him or her whose Image it is, and in which they usually picture God the Father, and the holy Trinity, to the great dishonour of that sacred mystery, against the doctrine and practice of the Primitive Church, against the express doctrine of Scripture, against the honour of a Divine Attribute; I mean, the immensity and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of the Divine Nature; You are gone to a Church that pretends to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and yet is infinitely deceived in many particulars, and yet endures no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and is impatient her children
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100736:135"/>
should enquire into any thing the Priests ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude. You are gone from receiving the whole Sacrament to receive it but half; from Christs Institution to a humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from Scripture to uncertain Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from antient Traditions to new pretences, from prayers which ye under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to prayers which ye understand not, from confidence in God to rely upon crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from intire dependence upon inward acts to a dangerous temptation of resting too much in outward ministeries, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal work of Sacraments and of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals: you are gone from a Church whose worshipping is simple, Christian and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical, to a Church where mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are loaden with a burden of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies greater than that in the days of the Jewish Religion (for the Ceremonial of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a great Book in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio) greater I say than all the Ceremonies of the Jews contained in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> &amp;c. You are gone from a Church where you were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to read the Word of God, the holy Scriptures from whence you found instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, institution, comfort, reproof, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all excellencies, to a Church that seals up that fountain from you, and gives you drink by drops out of such Cisterns as they first make, and then stain, and then reach out: and if it be told you that some men abuse Scripture, it is true, for if your Priests had not abused Scripture, they could
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100736:135"/>
not thus have abused you, but there is no necessity they should, and you need not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you list; any more than you need to abuse the Sacraments or Decrees of the Church, or the messages of your friend, or the Letters you receive, or the Laws of the Land, all which are liable to be abused by evil persons, but not by good people and modest understandings. It is now become a part of your Religion to be ignorant, to walk in blindness, to believe the man that hears your Confessions, to hear none but him, not to hear God speaking but by him, and so you are liable to be abused by him, as he please, without remedy. You are gone from us, where you were only taught to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God through Jesus Christ, and now you are taught to worship Saints and Angels with a worship at least dangerous, and in some things proper to God; for your Church worships the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with burning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense and candles to her, and you give her presents, which by the consent of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons used to be esteemed a worship peculiar to God, and it is the same thing which was condemned for Heresie in the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> who offered a Cake to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> A Candle and a Cake make no difference in the worship; and your joyning God and the Saints in your worship and devotions, is like the device of them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> first is, That all the points of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between us and your Church are such as do evidently serve the ends of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness and ambition, of power and riches, and so stand vehemently suspected of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and art, rather than truth of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle and designs upon Heaven. I instance in the <hi>Pope'</hi>s power over Princes and all the world; his power of dispensation, The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption of the Clergy from jurisdiction of Princes, The doctrine of Purgatory and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences which was once made means to raise a portion for a Lady, the Neece of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; The Priests power advanced beyond authority of any warrant from Scripture, a doctrine apt to bring ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute obedience to the Papacy; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is possibly too nice for you to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or consider, that which I am sure ought to move you is this:</p>
                     <p>THAT you are gone to a Religion in which though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> God's grace prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the follies of men, there are I hope, and charitably suppose, many pious men that love God, and live good lives, yet there are very many doctrines taught by your men, which are very ill Friends to a good life.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100736:136"/>
I instance in your Indulgences and pardons, in which vitious men put a great confidence, and rely greatly upon them. The doctrine of Purgatory which gives countenance to a sort of Christians who live half to God and half to the world, and for them this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hath found out a way that they may go to Hell and to Heaven too. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that the Priests absolution can turn a tristing repentance into a perfect and a good, and that suddenly too, and at any time, even on our Death bed, or the minute before your death, is a dangerous heap of false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, and gives licence to wicked people, and teaches men to reconcile a wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched life, with the hopes of Heaven. And then for penances and temporal satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which might seem to be as a plank after the shipwrack of the duty of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to keep men in awe, and to preserve them from sinking in an Ocean of Impiety, it comes to just nothing by your doctrine; for there are so many easie ways of Indulgences and getting Pardons, so many con-frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, stations, priviledged Altars, little Offices, <hi>Agnus Dei'</hi>s, amulets, hallowed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, swords, roses, hats, Church-yards, and the fountain of these annexed Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, and his power of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what, and when, and to whom he list, that he is a very unfortunate man that needs to smart with penances; and after all, he may choose to suffer any at all, for he may
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100736:137"/>
pay them in Purgatory if he please, and he may come out of Purgatory upon reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms, in case he should think it fit to go thither; So that all the whole duty of <hi>Repentance</hi> seems to be destroyed with devices of men that seek power and gain, and sind errour and folly; insomuch that if I had a mind to live an evil Life, and yet hope for Heaven at last, I would be of your religion above any in the world.</p>
                     <p>BUT I forget I am writing a Letter: I shall therefore desire you to consider upon the premises, which is the safer way. For surely it is lawful for a man to serve God without Images; but that to worship Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is lawful, is not so sure. It is lawful to pray to God alone, to confess him to be true, and every man a liar, to cal no man Master upon Earth, but to rely upon God teaching us; But it is at least hugely disputable and not at all certain that any man, or society of men can be infallible, that we may put our trust in Saints, in certain extraordinary Images, or burn Incense and offer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive oblations to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or make vows to persons, of whose state, or place, or capacities, or condition we have no certain revelation: we are sure we do well when in the holy Communion we worship God and Jesus Christ our Saviour, but they who also worship what seems to be bread, are put to strange shifts to make themselves believe it to be lawful. It is
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100736:137"/>
certainly lawful to believe what we see and feel; but it is an unnatural thing upon pretence of faith to disbelieve our eyes, when our sense and our faith can better be reconciled, as it is in the question of the Real presence, as it is taught by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>SO that unless you mean to prefer a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before safety, temptation to unholiness before a severe and a holy religion, unless you mean to lose the benefit of your prayers by praying what you perceive not, and the benefit of the Sacrament in great degrees by faling from Christ's institution, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king half instead of all; unless you desire to provoke God to jealousie by Images, and Man to jealousie in professing a Religion in which you may in many cases have leave to forfeit your faith and lawful trust, unless you will still continue to give scandal to those good people with whom you have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a common Religion, and weaken the hearts of God's afflicted ones, unless you will choose a Catechism without the second Commandment, and a Faith that grows bigger or less as men please, and a Hope that in many degrees relies on men and vain confidences, and a Charity that damns all the world but your selves, unless you will do all this, that is, suffer an abuse in your Prayers, in the Sacrament, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, in Faith, in Hope, in Charity, in the Communion of Saints, and your
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100736:138"/>
duty to your Supreme, you must return to the bosom of your Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi> from whence you have fallen, rather weakly than maliciously, and I doubt not but you will find the Comfort of it all your Life, and in the Day of your Death, and in the Day of Judgment. If you will not, yet I have freed mine own soul, and done an act of Duty and Charity, which at least you are bound to take kindly if you will not entertain it obediently.</p>
                     <p>NOW let me add this, that although most of these objections are such things which are the open and avowed doctrines or practices of your Church, and need not to be proved as being either notorious or confessed; yet if any of your Guides shall seem to question any thing of it, I will bind my self to verifie it to a tittle, and in that too which I intend them, that is, so as to be an objection obliging you to return, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pain of folly or heresie, or disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, according to the subject matter. And though I have propounded these things now to your consideration, yet if it be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I shall represent them to your eye, so that even your self shall be able to give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the behalf of truth. In the mean time give me leave to tell you of how much folly you are guilty in being moved by such mock-arguments as your men use when they meet with women and tender consciences and weaker understandings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:100736:138"/>THE first is; where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> Now if you had called upon them to speak something against your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Scripture, or right reason, or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Tradition, you had been secure as a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toise in her shell; a cart pressed with sheaves could not have oppressed your cause or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; though you had confessed you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood nothing of the mysteries of succession doctrinal or personal. For if we can make it appear that our religion was that which Christ and his Apostles taught, let the truth suffer what eclipses or prejudices can be supposed, let it be hid like the holy fire in the captivity, yet what Christ and his Apostles taught us is eternally true, and shall by some means or other be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us; even the enemies of truth have been conservators of that truth by which we can confute their errors. But if you still ask where it was before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> I answer it was there where it was after; even in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament; and I know no warrant for any other religion; and if you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I should shew any society of men who professed all the doctrines which are now expressed in the confession of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> I shall tell you it is unreasonable; because some of our truths are now brought into our publick confessions that they might be oppos'd against your errors; before the occasion of which there was no
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100736:139"/>
need of any such confessions, till you made many things necessary to be professed, which are not lawful to be believed. For if we believe your superinduced follies we shall do unreasonably, unconscionably, and wickedly; but the questions themselves are so useless abstracting from the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental necessity which your follies have brought upon us, that it had been happy if we had never heard of them more than the Saints and Martyrs did in the first Ages of the Church; but because your Clergy have invaded the liberty of the Church, and multiplied the dangers of damnation, and pretend new necessities, and have introduc'd new articles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright the simple upon new pretensions, and slight the very institution and the Commands of Christ and of the Apostles, and invent new Sacramentals, constituting Ceremonies of their own head, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise grace along with the use of them, as if they were not Ministers but Lords of the Spirit, and teach for doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, and make void the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God by their tradition, and have made a strange body of Divinity, therefore it is necessary that we should immure our Faith by the refusal of such vain and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious dreams: but our faith was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted at first, it is no other than that which was delivered to the Saints, and can be no more for ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:100736:139"/>So that it is a foolish demand to require that we should shew before <hi>Luther</hi> a systeme of Articles declaring our sense in these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions: It was long before they were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions at all: and when they were made questions, they remained so, a long time; and when by their several pieces they were determined, this part of the Church was oppressed with a violent power; and when God gave opportunity, then the yoke was broken; and this is the whole progress of this affair. But if you will still insist upon it, then let the matter be put into equal ballances, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> them shew any Church whose confession of Faith was such as was obtruded upon you at <hi>Trent:</hi> and if your Religion be <hi>Pius Quartus</hi> his Creed at <hi>Trent,</hi> then we also have a question to ask, and that is, <hi>Where was your Religion before Trent?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Council of <hi>Trent</hi> determined that the souls departed before the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enjoy the Beatisical Vision. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Article could not be shewn in the Confession of any of the antient Churches; for most of the Fathers were of another opinion. But that which is the greatest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Christendom is not only that these doctrines which we say are false were yet affirmed, but that those things which the Church of God did always reject, or held as uncertain, should be made Articles of Faith, and so become parts of your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100736:140"/>
and of these it is that I again ask the question which none of your side shall ever be able to answer for you: Where was your Religion before <hi>Trent?</hi> I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in many particulars? but I shall name one to you, which because the thing of it self is of no great consequence, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the more unreasonable and intolerable that your Church should adopt it into the things of necessary belief, especially since it was only a matter of fact, and they took the false part too. For in the 21. Sess. chap. 4. it is affirmed, That <hi>although the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did give the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist to Infants, yet they did it without any necessity of salvation;</hi> that is, they did not believe it necessary to their salvation, which is notoriously false, and the contrary is marked out with the black-lead of every man almost that reads their Works; and yet your Council says this is <hi>sine controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sià credendum;</hi> to be believed without all controversie: and all Christians forbidden to believe or teach otherwise. So that here it is made an Article of Faith amongst you, that a man shall neither believe his reason nor his eyes: and who can shew any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith in which all the <hi>Trent</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was professed and enjoyned under pain of damnation? and before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Constance,</hi> the doctrine touching the<note place="margin">De potest. Eccles. cons. 12.</note> Popes power was so new, so decried, that as <hi>Gerson</hi> says he hardly should have escaped
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100736:140"/>
the note of Heresie that would have said so much as was there defined: so that in that Article which now makes a great part of your belief, Where was your Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council of <hi>Constance?</hi> and it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious that your Council of <hi>Constance</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the doctrine of the half-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with a <hi>Non obstante</hi> to Christ's institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, with a defiance to it, or a noted, observed neglect of it, and with a profession it was otherwise in the Primitive Church. Where then was your Religion before <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague'</hi>s time, against whom that Council was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened? But by this instance it appears most certainly that your Church cannot shew her confessions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> after Christ, and therefore if we could not shew ours imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before <hi>Luther,</hi> it were not half so much; for since you receded from Christ's Doctrine, we might well recede from yours; and it matters not who or how many or how long they prosessed your doctrine, if neither Christ nor his Apostles did teach it: so that if these Articles constitute your Church, your Church was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> at the first, and if ours was invisible afterwards it matters not; <hi>For yours was invisible in the days of light, and ours was invisible in the days of darkness.</hi> For our Church was always vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Scripture, and he that had his eyes of Faith and reason might easily have seen these truths all the way
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100736:141"/>
which constitute our Church. But I add yet farther, that our Church before <hi>Luther</hi> was there where your Church was, in the same place and in the same persons; for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the errors which have been amongst us reformed, were not the constituent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of your Church before <hi>Luther'</hi>s time; for before the last Councils of your Church a man might have been of your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon easier terms; and Indulgences were indeed a practice, but no Article of Faith before your men made it so, and that very lately, and so were many other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. So that although your men cozen the credulous and the simple by calling yours <hi>The old Religion,</hi> yet the difference is vast between Truth and their affirmative, even as much as between old Errors and new Articles. For although Ignorance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition had prepared the ore, yet the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> especially, were the forges and the mint.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if your men had not by all the vile and violent arts of the world stopped the mouths of dissenters, the question would quickly have been answered, or our Articles would have been so confessed, so owned and so publick, that the question could never have been asked; but in despite of all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, there were great numbers of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors who did protest and profess and practise our doctrines contrary to your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; as it is demonstrated by the Divines
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100736:141"/>
of <hi>Germany</hi> in <hi>Illyricus</hi> his <hi>Catalogus testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um veritatis,</hi> and in Bishop <hi>Morton'</hi>s ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>
                     <p>BUT with your next objection you are better pleased, and your men make most noise with it. For you pretend that by our confession Salvation may be had in your Church; but your men deny it to us; and therefore by the confession of both sides you may be safe, and there is no question concerning you; but of us there is great question, for none but our selves say that we can be saved.</p>
                     <p n="1">I answer, 1. That Salvation may be had in your Church, is it ever the truer because we say it? If it be not, it can add no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence to you, for the proposition gets no strength by your affirmative. But if it be, then our authority is good or else our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and if either be, then we have more reason to be believed speaking of our selves; because we are concerned to see that our selves may be in a state of hope; and therefore we would not venture on this side if we had not greater reason to believe well of our selves than of you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believe us when it is more likely that we have greater reason, because we have greater concernments, and therefore greater considerations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As much charity as your men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us to speak of you, yet it is a clear case our hope of your Salvation is so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

IF we be more charitable to you than you are to us, acknowledge in us the beauty and essential form of Christian Religion; be sure you love as well as make use of our charity; but if you make our charity an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against us, remember that you ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us evil in exchange for good; and let it be no brag to you that you have not that charity to us; for therefore the <hi>Donatists</hi> were condemned for Hereticks and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks because they damn'd all the world, and afforded no charity to any that was not of their Communion.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. BUT that our charity may be such indeed, that is, that it may do you a real benefit, and not turn into Wormwood and Colliquintida, I pray take notice in what sense it is that we allow Salvation may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be had in your Church. We warrant it not to any, we only hope it for some, we allow it to them as to the <hi>Sadduces</hi> in the Law, and to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the Gospel who denyed the resurrection; that is, till they were sufficiently instructed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently convinced, and had time and powers to out wear their prejudices and the impresses of their education and long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion. But to them amongst you who can and do consider and yet determine for error and interest, we have a greater charity, even so much as to labour and pray for their conversion, but not so much fondness as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

BUT in all this affair, though your men are very bold with God and leap into his judgment-seat before him, and give wild sentences concerning the salvation of your own party and the damnation of all that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree, yet that which is our charity to you, is indeed the fear of God, and the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his judgments; we do not say that all Papists are certainly damn'd; we wish and desire vehemently that none of you may perish; but then this charity of judgment relates not to you, nor is derived from any probability which we see in your doctrines that differ from ours; but because we know not what rate and value God puts upon the article; It concerns neither you nor us to say, this or that man shall be damn'd for his opinion; for besides that this is a bold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion into that secret of God which shall not be opened till the day of judgment, and besides that we know not what allays and abatements are to be made by the good meaning and the ignorance of the man; all that can concern us is to tell you that you are in error, that you depart from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that you exercise tyranny over souls, that you leave the Divine institution, and prevaricate Gods Commandment, that you divide the Church without truth and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out necessity, that you tie men to believe things under pain of damnation which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

be made very probable, much less cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and therefore that you sin against God and are in danger of his eternal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure; but in giving the sinal sentence as we have no more to do than your men have, yet so we refuse to follow your evil example; and we follow the glorious prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of our Blessed Lord; who decreed and declared against the crime, but not against the Criminal before the day. He that does this, or that, is in danger of the Council, or in danger of judgment, or liable and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the danger of hell fire; so we say of your greatest errors; they put you in the danger of perishing; but that you shall or shall not perish, we leave it to your Judge; and if you call this charity, it is well, I am sure it is piety and the fear of God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. WHETHER you may be saved, or whether you shall be damned for your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, does neither depend upon our affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative nor your negative, but according to the rate and value which God sets upon things. Whatever we talk, things are as they are, not as we dispute, or grant, or hope; and therefore it were well if your men would leave abusing you and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with these little arts of indirect sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.

I wish you would consider, that if any of our men say salvation may be had in your Church, it is not for the goodness of your new propositions, but only because you do keep so much of that which is our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And we do not hope any thing at all that is good of you or your Religion as it distinguishes from us and ours: we hope that the good which you have common with us may obtain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don directly or indirectly, or may be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote of the venome, and an amulet against the danger of your very great errors, so that if you can derive any considence from our concession, you must remember where it takes root; not upon any thing of yours, but wholly upon the excellency of ours; you are not at all sase, or warranted for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papists, but we hope well of some of you, sor having so much of the Protestant: and if that will do you any good, proceed in it, and follow it whither soever it leads you.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. THE safety that you dream of which we say to be on your side, is nothing of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance or warranty, but a hope that is collateral, indirect and relative; we do not say any thing whereby you can conclude yours to be safer than ours, for it is not safe at all, but extremely dangerous; we affirm those errors in themselves to be damnable, some to contain in them Impiety,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100736:144"/>
some to have Sacriledge, some Idolatry, some Superstition, some practices to be conjuring and charming, and very like to Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, as in your hallowing of Water, and baptizing Bells, and exorcizing Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks; and what safety there can be in these, or what you can fancy we should allow to you, I suppose you need not boast of. Now because we hope some are saved amongst you, you must not conclude yours to be safe; for our hope relies upon this. There are many of your propositions in which we differ from you, that thousands amongst you understand and know nothing of, it is to them as if they were not, it is to them now as it was before the Council, they hear not of it. And though your Priests have taken a course that the most ignorant do practise some of your abominations most grosly, yet we hope this will not be laid upon them who (as S. <hi>Austin'</hi>s expression is) <hi>cautâ sollicitudine quaerunt veritatem, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigi parati cum invenerint:</hi> do according as they are able warily and diligently seek for truth, and are ready to follow it when they find it; men who live good lives, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of all their evils known and unknown. Now if we are not deceived in our hopes, these men shall rejoyce in the eternal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, which prevails over the malice of them that misguide you; but if we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in our hopes of you, your guides have abus'd you, and the blind leaders of the

                        </gap>, this it is. The hopes we have of any of you, (as it is known) principally relies upon the hopes of your repentance. Now we say that a man may repent of an error which he knows not of; as he that prays heartily for the pardon of all his sins and errors known and unknown; by his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral repentance may obtain many degrees and instances of mercy. Now thus much also your men allow to us; these who live well, and die in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Here then we are equal, and we are as safe by your consession as you are by ours. But because there are some Bigots of your faction fierce and siery who say that a general repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will not serve our turns, but it must be a particular renunciation of Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: these men deny not only to us but to themselves too, all that comsort which they derive from our Concession, and indeed which they can hope for from the mercies of God. For be you sure we think as ill of vour errors as you can suppose of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; and therefore if for errors (be they on which side it chances) a general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap>. But if it be sufficient for you, it is so for us, in case we be in error as your men suppose us; but if it will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> us sor remedy to those errors you charge us with, neither will it suffice you; for the case must needs be equal as to the value of repentance and malignity of the error: and therefore these men condemn themselves, and will not allow us to hope well of them; but if they will allow us to hope, it must be by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the value of a general repentance; and if they allow that, they must hope as well of ours as we of theirs: but if they deny it to us, they deny it to themselves, and then they can no more brag of any thing of our concession. This only I add to this consideration; that your men do not, cannot charge upon us any doctrine that is in its matter and effect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious; there is nothing positive in our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but is either true or innocent, but we are accused for denying your superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures: ours therefore (if we be deceived) is but like a sin of omission; yours are sins of commission in case you are in the wrong (as we believe you to be) and therefore you must needs be in the greater danger than we can be supposed, by how much sins of omission are less than sins of commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. YOUR very way of arguing from our charity is a very fallacy and a trick that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100736:146"/>
must needs deceive you if you rely upon it. For whereas your men argue thus: The Protestants say we Papists may be saved; and so say we too: but we Papists say that you Protestants cannot, therefore it is safest to be a Papist; consider that of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if it shall be accepted, any bold Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick can make use, against any modest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian of a true perswasion. For, if he can but out-face the modesty of the good man, and tell him he shall be damn'd; unless that modest man say as much of him, you see impudence shall get the better of the day. But it is thus in every error. Fifteen Bishops of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in immediate succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion were circumcised, believing it to be necessary so to be: with these, other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches who were of the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision did communicate: Suppose now that these Bishops had not only thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for themselves but for others too; this argument you see was ready: you of the uncircumcision who do communicate with us, think that we may be saved though we are circumcised, but we do not think that you who are not circumcised can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, therefore it is the safest way to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised: I suppose you would not have thought their argument good, neither would you have had your children circumcised. But this argument may serve the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as well as the Papists. We are indeed very kind to them in our sentences concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100736:146"/>
their salvation; and they are many of them as unkind to us; If they should argue so as you do, and say, you Episcopal men think we Presbyterians though in errors can be saved, and we say so too: but we think you Episcopal men are Enemies of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ; and therefore we think you in a damnable condition, therefore it is safer to be a Presbyterian: I know not what your men would think of the argument in their hands, I am sure we had reason to complain that we are used very ill on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> hands for no other cause but because we are charitable. But it is not our case alone; but the old Catholicks were used just so by the <hi>Donatists</hi> in this very argument, as we are used by your men. The <hi>Donatists</hi> were so sierce against the Catholicks, that they would re-baptize all them who came to their Churches from the other: But the Catholicks, as knowing the <hi>Donatists</hi> did give right Baptism, admitted their Converts to Repentance, but did not re-baptize them. Upon this score, the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists</hi> triumphed, saying, You Catholicks confess our Baptism to be good, and so say we: But we <hi>Donatists</hi> deny your Baptism to be good; therefore it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to be of our side than yours. Now what should the Catholicks say or do? Should they lie for God and for Religion, and to serve the ends of Truth say the <hi>Donatists</hi> Baptism was not good? That they ought not. Should they
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100736:147"/>
damn all the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and make the rent wider? It was too great already. What then? They were quiet, and knew that the <hi>Donatists</hi> sought advantages by their own sierceness, and trampled upon the others charity; but so they hardned themselves in error, and became evil, because the others were good.</p>

may not only be changed but converted. For the Church of <hi>England</hi> whither you are now come is not in condition to boast her self in the reputation of changing the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a single person, though never so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; She hath no temporal ends to serve which must stand upon fame and noises; all that she can design, is to serve God, to advance the honour of the Lord, and the good of souls, and to rejoyce in the Cross of Christ.</p>
                     <p>First, therefore I desire you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that as now you are taught to pray both publickly and privately, in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage understood, so it is intended your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the advantages which your prayer hath in the understanding part. For though you have been often told and have heard, that ignorance is the mother of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, you will sind that the proposition is unnatural and against common sense and experience; because it is impossible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that of which we know nothing, unless the desire it self be fantastical and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive: it is necessary that in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in which we understand any good thing, in the same we shall also desire it, and the more particular and minute your notices are, the more passionate and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial also your affections will be towards it; and if they be good things for which we are
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100736:148"/>
taught to pray, the more you know them, the more reason you have to love them; It is monstrous to think that devotion, that is, passionate desires of religious things, and the earnest prosecutions of them should be produced by any thing of ignorance or less perfect notices in any sense. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are taught to pray, so that your understanding is the praecentor or the Master of the Quire, and you know what you say; your desires are made humanc, religious, express, material (for these are the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Prayers and Liturgies well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood) be pleased also to remember, that now if you be not also passionate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout for the things you mention, you will want the Spirit of prayer, and be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable than before. In many of your prayers before (especially the publick) you heard a voice but saw and perceived nothing of the sense, and what you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of it was like the man in the Gospel that was half blind, he saw men walking like Trees, and so you possibly might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the meaning of it in general; You knew where they came to the Epistle, when to the Gospel, when the <hi>Introit,</hi> when the <hi>Pax,</hi> when any of the other more general periods were; but you could have nothing of the Spirit of prayer, that is, nothing of the devotion and the holy affections to the particular excellencies which could or ought there to have been represented, but now
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100736:149"/>
you are taught how you may be really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, it is made facil and easie, and there can want nothing but your consent and observation.</p>

the holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, or the Lords Supper, it does more good here than they do there; because if they consecrate rightly, yet they do not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate you fully; and if they offer the whole representative Sacrifice, yet they do not give you the whole Sacrament; only we enjoyn that you come with so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, that the grace of God in your heart may be the principal, and the Sacrament in our hands may be the ministring and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting part: we do not promise great effects to easie trifling dispositions, because we would not deceive, but really procure to you great effects; and therefore you are now to come to our offices with the same expectations as before, of pardon, of grace, of sanctification; but you must do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of the work your self, that we may not do less in effect than you have in your expectation; We will not to advance the reputation of our power deceive you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a less blessing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. BE careful that you do not flatter your self, that in our Communion you may have more ease and liberty of life; for though I know your pious soul desires pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately to please God and to live religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, yet I ought to be careful to prevent a temptation, lest it at any time should discompose your severity: Therefore as to confession to a Priest (which how it is
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100736:150"/>
usually practised among the <hi>Roman</hi> party, your self can very well account, and you have complained sadly, that it is made an ordinary act, easie and transient, sometime matter of temptation, oftentimes imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, but) suppose it free from such scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to which some mens folly did betray it, yet the same severity you'l find among us; for though we will not tell a lie to help a sinner, and say that is necessary which is only appointed to make men do themselves good, yet we advise and commend it, and do all the work of souls to all those people that will be saved by all means; to devout persons, that make Religion the business of their lives, and they that do not so in the Churches of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, as they find but little advantage by periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal confessions, so they feel but little aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and severity by the injunction; you must confess to God all your secret actions, you must advise with a holy man in all the affairs of your soul, you will be but an ill friend to your self if you conceal from him the state of your spiritual affairs: We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not to hear the circumstance of every sin, but when matter of justice is concerned, or the nature of the sin is changed, that is, when it ought to be made a Question; and you will find that though the Church of <hi>England</hi> gives you much liberty from the bondage of innumerable Ceremonies and humane devices, yet in the matter of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100736:150"/>
you will be tied to very great service, but such a service as is perfect freedom, that is, the service of God and the love of the holy Jesus, and a very strict religious life; for we do not promise heaven, but upon the same terms it is promised us, that is, <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jesus:</hi> and as in Faith we make no more to be necessary than what is made so in holy Scripture, so in the matter of Repentance we give you no easie devices, and suffer no lessening desinitions of it, but oblige you to that strictness which is the condition of being saved, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to be by the infallible Word of God; but such as in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they do not so much stand upon.</p>
                     <p>MADAM, I am weary of my Journey, and although I did purpose to have spoken many things more, yet I desire that my not doing it may be laid upon the account of my weariness, all that I shall add to the main business is this:</p>
                     <p n="4">4. READ the Scripture diligently, and with an humble spirit, and in it observe what is plain, and believe and live accordingly. Trouble not your self with what is difficult, for in that your duty is not described.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. PRAY frequently and effectually; I had rather your prayers should be often
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100736:151"/>
than long. It was well said of <hi>Petrarch, Magno verborum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I speak of what is decent in respect of our selves and our infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances from God: but if love makes you speak, speak on, so shall your prayers be full of charity and devotion, <hi>Nullus est amore superior, ille te coget ad veniam, qui me ad multiloquium;</hi> Love makes God to be our friend, and our approches more united and acceptable; and therefore you may say to God, <hi>the same love which made me speak, will also move me to hear and pardon:</hi> Love and devotion may enlarge your Letanies, but nothing else can, unless Authority does interpose.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. BE curious not to communicate but with the true Sons of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> lest (if you follow them that were amongst us, but are gone out from us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not of us) you be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and tempted to impute their follies to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. TROUELE your self with no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies willingly, but how you may best please God by a strict and severe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>

IF any Protestant live loosely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he dishonours an excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that it may be no more laid upon the charge of our Church, than the ill lives of most Christians may upon the whole Religion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. LET no man or woman affright you with declamations and scaring words of <hi>Heretick,</hi> and <hi>Damnation,</hi> and <hi>Changeable;</hi> for these words may be spoken against them that return to light, as well as to those that go to darkness, and that which men of all sides can say, it can be of effect to no side upon its own strength or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension.</p>
