         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by ſeveral Conveyances to the uſe &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the will of the ſaid <hi>I.

And the Jury aforeſaid do further ſay upon their oathes, that the ſaid Tenement, Lands, and Premiſes, with the Appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are now by mean Conveyance and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, come unto <hi>I.

S.</hi> and their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors have been Feoffees of the ſaid Premiſes, ever ſince the year of our Lord God 1611, and that they and the other Feoffees now living, claim no intereſt in the ſaid Premiſes, but as Feoffees in Truſt for performance of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170570:23"/>
Will of the ſaid <hi>I. B.</hi> and the ſaid <hi>I. S. W. C. A.

And it did alſo further appear by view of the ſaid books, that the yearly Accompts therein ſet down are imperfect, and that there are many alterations in the figures of the ſums of money expended by the ſaid Rent ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, And that the Accompts therein ſpecified are for the moſt part made by diſburſments of Sums of money in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170570:23"/>
wiith reference unto particular bills not ſet down in the ſaid Books, and that at one time, or in two or three years together, no Accompts were made by the Rent-gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: And that the ſaid <hi>Feoffees</hi> have failed to elect yearly new Rent-gatherers, And that they have allowed unto the Tenant of the ſaid Houſe and Lands, out of his Rent, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 40. <abbr>
                        <hi>s</hi>
                     </abbr> for a dinner, at their meeting, And that the ſaid <hi>Feoffees</hi> and Rent-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have from time to time kept monies in their hands, which they have received for Rent of the ſaid Houſe and Lands, which they call in their books of Accompts, houſe money, And divers ſums of money which they have received by ſale of the wood in <hi>R. W.</hi> which they call Church money, And that ſometimes they have expended the houſe mony upon the Church, And ſometimes the Church money upon the Highwaies, and have entered their Accompts as money borrowed of the Church, for the houſe, and of the houſe for the Church, And they have brought into Accompt divers ſums of money, to have been expended by them yearly upon the ſaid Churches of <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>T.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170570:24"/>
in repair of the ſaid Churches, from the year 1611 until this preſent time, and upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the ſaid Certificates, with the ſaid books of Accompt, It doth appear, That in ſome years, wherein the ſaid Rent-gatherers have ſet down in their Accompts to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended moneys in the repair of the ſaid Churches, that nothing was then ſet down in the ſaid Church Books to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by the ſaid Rent-gatherers; in ſome yeares the ſummes of Expenſes do agree with the Church-book, in ſome years more is ſet down in the Rent-gatherers book to have been expended upon the ſaid Churches, then is in the ſaid Church-book. And the ſaid Jurors do further ſay upon their oathes, That fithence the ſaid year 1611, until this preſent, divers <hi>Feoffees,</hi> ſome whereof are yet living, have been at ſeveral times Rent-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and <hi>Feoffees,</hi> And that for the moſt part of that time, the yearly Revenue, and Rent, of the ſaid Houſe and Lands, have been about 20 <abbr>
                        <hi>l</hi>
                     </abbr> which according to their Accompts, hath been expended yearly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of the Highwaies between <hi>M.</hi> and ſome three or four miles of <hi>E.</hi> and for their dinner at their meetings, and by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 40 <abbr>

As if land given to charitable uſes be intended to be ſold by Act of Parliament: and when the Bill is read in the houſe of Parliament, it is there ſpoken unto and declared, that the land is charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with a charitable uſe, and recompence is offered otherwiſe to aſſure the charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe then by that land, and afterwards the Bill doth not paſſe, and the Land is ſold to one of the Members of the Houſe that ſpake unto the Bill for money. Yet this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in Parliament, is not ſufficient notice, within the intent of the Statute, becauſe it was not known to ſuch a Purchaſor, but as a Parliament man in another capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

This
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170570:35"/>
ſecond Purchaſor ſhall hold the Land charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the charitable Uſe, for that the firſt Purchaſor held it ſo, and the ſecond Purchaſor coming under his Title, muſt hold it ſubject to the charges the firſt Purchaſor held it, for that he claims under him; But if the firſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſor had no notice of the Uſe, then is the Land diſcharged of the charitable Uſe: and if he aftewards ſell it to another for money that hath notice of the Uſe, yet he ſhall not hold it ſubject to the charitable Uſe, for that the Land was diſcharged thereof upon the firſt Purchaſe.</p>

                     <hi>Katherine Banne</hi> grants by Deed, a Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeek out of 208 acres of Land, for relief of the poor in thoſe Pariſhes, and limits this to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence after her death, and gives ſeiſin of this in her life, the Rent is behind for thirty ſix years, <hi>Hide</hi> Purchaſeth the Land, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the charitable uſe, and in the Grant, there was a <hi>nomine poenae</hi> of 50 <abbr>

                     </abbr> if the Rent be not paid by her Heirs within fourteen days after it was due by the Grant, and it was found that <hi>Hide</hi> had held the Land ſeven years, upon a Commiſsion for charitable uſes, the Commiſsioners Decree that <hi>Hide</hi> ſhall pay all the arrerages for thirty ſix years, and alſo the arrerages of the <hi>nomine poenae</hi> for ſeven
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170570:48"/>
years, being the time he had enjoyed the Land, and Decree that the Grantor ſhall diſtrain for the Rent for ever after. And the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners Decree being returned in <hi>Chancery,</hi> the Lord Keeper referred it to the Judges, who reſolved theſe points: Firſt, that <hi>Hide</hi> ſhould pay all the arrerages for thirty ſix years, for that the Land is chargeable with the Rent, in whoſe hands ſoever it cometh. Secondly, that the ſeiſin given by the Grantor in her life, is good, although the Rent did not commence, or was in <hi>eſſe</hi> at the time of the ſeiſin given. Thirdly, if Land or Rent be given to a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe, and miſimployed, a Purchaſor which hath notice of the Gift, ſhall not be further charged then during his own time; but where the Rent is concealed, a Purchaſor ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all the time of the concealment, for the Land is a Debtor, <hi>&amp; tranſit cum onere.</hi> Fourthly, if a Rent be granted out of Land to a charitable uſe, and one buys the Land for a valuable conſideration of money, having no notice of the charitable Uſe and Rent, yet the Rent remains, becauſe it is collaterall to the Land, and another thing, and the notice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Statute is to be given, as well of the Land, as of the charitable uſe. Fifthly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that the Purchaſor ſhall not pay the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerages of the <hi>nomine poenae,</hi> becauſe it was a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170570:48"/>
perſonall charge upon the Heir, who ought to have paid the Rent, and it doth not charge the Land. Sixthly, when the Heir or others, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to pay a charitable uſe, do break the truſt, the Commiſſioners may transfer the truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, as to the Churchwardens, or other Pariſhoners of the Pariſh where the charitable uſe is to be diſtributed. Laſtly, it was reſolved, that if a Rent ſeek be granted to a charitable uſe, the Commiſſioners by their Decree can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make this a Rent-charge, by adding a clauſe of diſtreſſe, unleſſe it be for that this alters the nature of the Rent in the creation of it, and is againſt the mind of the Donor.</p>

                  <p>Part of the <hi>Socage-lands</hi> Deviſed to the <hi>Hoſpitall,</hi> is by Commiſſion of the Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> ſet out to <hi>N. H.</hi> the Heir, for his third part. <hi>A. H.</hi> dies, and the <hi>Hoſpitall</hi> pays the 1000 <abbr>

                     </abbr> The Commiſſioners for charitable uſes have Decreed to the <hi>Hoſpitall,</hi> all the <hi>Socage lands</hi> Deviſed to the uſe of the poor. This being the ſubſtance of the Caſe, the queſtions hereupon ariſing upon the Appeal, were: Whether the <hi>Deviſe</hi> to the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſes be good, and whether the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners had power to decree the whole <hi>Socage lands</hi> deviſed, or but two parts only. It was agreed that by the Statutes of 32 and 34 <hi>Henry</hi> 8. the <hi>Deviſe</hi> is voyd for a third part. But it was inſiſted upon, that although
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170570:57"/>
the <hi>Deviſe</hi> be voyd for a third part by thoſe Statutes, yet this is ſuch a limitation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment within the Statute of 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> as doth well enable the Commiſſioners for chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſes to <hi>Decree</hi> the whole.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That it hath been generally held, that the Statute of 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> for charitable Uſes, doth ſupply all the defects of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances where the <hi>Donor</hi> is of a capacity to diſpoſe, and hath ſuch an Eſtate as is any ways diſpoſeable by him. And upon this ground it hath been held, That if a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder doth diſpoſe of <hi>Copyhold lands</hi> to a charitable uſe, without a Surrender, or if Tenants in tayl do convey land to a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe without a Fine, or if a reverſion be granted without Attornment or Inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and divers other the like caſes; yet theſe defects are ſupplied by the Statute of 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> becauſe the <hi>Donor</hi> had a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power of the Eſtate, and this is a good limitation and appointment within this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: But it is true, if an Infant, Lunatick, or any other perſon, who hath not capacity to diſpoſe an Eſtate, ſhall grant to a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable uſe, this defect is not ſupplied by this Statute: and this difference is reſolved in <hi>Colliſons</hi> Caſe, 15. <hi>Jacob.</hi> in the Lord <hi>Hobarts</hi> Reports, <hi>folio</hi> 136.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170570:58"/>Secondly, the words of the Statute of 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> are very conſiderable in this Caſe, for although the Statute doth give power to the <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> or <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on complaint to them made, to adnull, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, alter, or enlarge any <hi>Decree</hi> made by the Commiſſioners for charitable uſes: yet the ſame is with this limitation, ſo far as may ſtand with Equity and good conſcience, according to the true intent and meaning of the <hi>Donor</hi> and <hi>Founder</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>Whereby it doth appear, that in all Gifts, Appointments, Limitations and Aſſignments within that Statute, ſpeciall regard is to be had to the intent of the <hi>Donor,</hi> and this power of adnulling, diminiſhing, altering or enlarging <hi>Decrees</hi> made by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for charitable uſes, is appropriated ſolely to the <hi>Lord Choncellor,</hi> or <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> and not to any other, and to proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in according to Equity and good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Caſe of <hi>G. L.</hi> Hillar. 13. <hi>Jac.</hi> reported by the <hi>Lord Hobart,</hi> fol. 136. doth reſolve the point in queſtion: Where the Caſe being, that <hi>G. L.</hi> being ſeiſed in Fee of lands in <hi>Cardigan,</hi> 1571. in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 25. <hi>Eliz. Deviſed</hi> the ſame land to <hi>A.</hi> his wife for life, and after to <hi>J.</hi> his daughter for life, and after theſe lives ended, to the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170570:58"/>
principall Fellows and Schollars of <hi>Jeſus Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and their ſucceſſors, to find a Schollar of his Blood from time to time, and dyed, the lives ended, <hi>B. L.</hi> the Heir of <hi>G. L.</hi> being the Kings VVard, entred, and upon a Caſe made hereof in the Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> and by order of that Court, brought to the <hi>Lord Hobard,</hi> then Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and the Lord Chief Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>Tanfield</hi> to be reſolved of by them, who agreed, and ſo certified, that the <hi>Deviſe</hi> was void in Law, becauſe the Statute of Wills did not allow <hi>Deviſes</hi> to Corporations in <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> yet they held it cleerly within the relief of the Statute of charitable Uſes of 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> under the words, <hi>limited and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,</hi> and ſo it was <hi>Decreed,</hi> that the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> ſhould enjoy it againſt the Ward and his Heirs.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe of <hi>Colliſon,</hi> 15. <hi>Jac.</hi> Reported likewiſe by the <hi>Lord Hobard,</hi> fol. 136. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the point in queſtion, where the Caſe being, That <hi>Colliſon,</hi> 15. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Deviſed</hi> a Houſe in <hi>Etham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> to <hi>L.</hi> his Wife for life, and after her death, made <hi>J.

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:170570:59"/>
and his Wife died, and the Houſe deſcended to <hi>O. R.</hi> an Infant This Caſe being in <hi>Chancerie</hi> between the Pariſhoners and <hi>B.</hi> was referred by the Court to the Lord <hi>Hobart,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Chief Baron Tanfield,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it clearly, that though the <hi>Deviſe</hi> were utterly void, yet it was within the relief of the Statute of 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> within the words, <hi>limited and appointed to charitable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Decree</hi> was lately confirmed by the Lords Commiſſioners, Keepers of the Great Seal, for that it fully appeared to them, that it was the true intent and meaning of <hi>A. H.</hi> the <hi>Donor,</hi> that all the lands in queſtion ſhould go to the <hi>Hoſpitall.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>WHereas the ſaid Exceptant doth except to and againſt the ſaid Decree, for that the Meſſuage or Tenement, called <hi>C.</hi> given by the Will of <hi>A. B.</hi> therein named, to the charitable uſe therein ſpecified, are not the Meſſuage, Tenement and Lands in the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the ſaid Exceptant and his Tenants, and which are charged and Decreed to the ſaid charitable uſe: And alſo for that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptants Grandfather <hi>T. H.</hi> therein named, had at the time of his Purchaſe of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the occupation of him and his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, no notice of the ſaid charitable uſe; and that the ſaid Premiſes were heretofore conveyed by Letters Patents from King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſixth: And laſtly, for that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion directed to the Commiſſioners in the ſaid Decree named, wherein they made the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170570:78"/>
ſaid Decree, was not returned into this Court at the time of the ſaid Exception unto which Exceptions, theſe <hi>Reſpondents</hi> ſaving unto themſelves all advantages of Exception to the incertainties and inſufficiencies thereof, ſay, That they are upon the matter, ſtrangers to the matters ſet forth by the ſaid Exceptions, having not lived very long in the ſaid Pariſh, and being no otherwiſe concerned then as Churchwardens thereof; and it cannot be preſumed they ſhould know the facts and titles alledged by the ſaid Exceptions of their own knowledge. But they ſay, that the ſaid Exceptant was ſeverall times ſummoned and heard before the Commiſſioners that made the ſaid Decree, and the Jury by them impannel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; And he brought his Learned Counſel with him, who urged before the ſaid Jury and Commiſſioners, who were learned in the Law, and good and honeſt men, before their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict given, or Decree made, the ſubſtance and matter of the ſaid Exception, and what ever could be alledged againſt the decreeing of the Premiſes, and the ſame Decree was made upon a full hearing of both ſides. And one of the main points inſiſted on before the ſaid Jury and Commiſſioners, was the matter of the aforeſaid firſt two Exceptions, whether the Premiſes decreed to be charged with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170570:79"/>
uſe, were the Meſſuage, Tenement, and Lands given by the ſaid Will, yea or no, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a proper iſſue for a Jury of parcel, or no parcel, the ſame Premiſes in the occupation of the Exceptant were after a full and deliberate hearing and evidence on both ſides found by the ſaid Jury to be the ſame Tenements and Lands deviſed by the ſaid Will. And the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſaid two next Exceptions, Whether the ſaid Exceptants Grandfather had notice of the charitable uſe before, or at his Purchaſe of the Premiſes, or that the Premiſes were in the <hi>Crown,</hi> yea, or no, being alſo proper for a Jury, were likewiſe upon the like evidence then given, found by the ſaid Jury for the ſaid Pariſh againſt the ſaid Exceptant. And theſe <hi>Reſpondents</hi> verily believe, the ſaid Exceptant cannot but be ſatisfied with the ſaid Verdict and Decree, and doth trouble theſe <hi>Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> and the ſaid Pariſh, onely to drive them to ſome compoſition or low terms of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And in particular, theſe <hi>Reſpondents</hi> ſay, that they doubt not to make it appear by ſeverall particulars, and parcels of evidences and pleadings, and proofs in ſeverall Courts (if this Honorable Court ſhould now think fit to put them thereunto after the ſaid Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Verdict) that the Premiſes charged with the ſaid charitable uſe, are the ſame that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170570:79"/>
were charged and deviſed by the ſaid Will, and that the Purchaſer (if he was one) had and could not but have and take notice before, and at the time of his Purchaſe: And likewiſe ſay, that the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, or his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or either of them, were not at any time ſeiſed or intituled to be ſeiſed of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or any part thereof; and if the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth made ſuch Grant as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the ſame was not of theſe ſelf-ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but of other Tenements; and if it were, the ſaid King had no ſeiſin or Inheritance of or in the ſaid Lands, or right ſo to grant the ſame, nor doth the ſaid Grant, if any ſuch be, prejudice the charitable uſe, as the <hi>Reſpondents</hi> are adviſed. And theſe <hi>Reſpondents</hi> further ſay, that they are informed, the ſaid Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is returned into this Court, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Record: Wherefore theſe <hi>Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> humbly pray the ſaid Decree may ſtand ratified and confirmed, and the ſaid Decree and charitable Uſe may be performed, and theſe <hi>Reſpondents</hi> diſcharged with their coſts in this behalf moſt wrongfully ſuſtained.</p>
