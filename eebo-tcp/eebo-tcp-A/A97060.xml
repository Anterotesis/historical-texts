            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Service in the Camp, againſt the French Fleet, hinder'd me from Writing the laſt Poſt. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my now lie as they did when I wrote to you laſt; and on <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, about Five, the 15 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and one Man of War, with the Long-boats, made up to <hi>Tingmouth,</hi> and Rang a Peal of Canons about half an hour long; afterwards landed about 1000 Men, who entred the Town and burnt about 30 Houſes: went into the Church, broke the Communion-Table in pieces, the Pulpet and Desk; tore the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Book in pieces, and did ſome injury to the Font. I obſerv'd the Proclamation for the Faſt againſt a Pillar, which had but one cut with a Sword. There were in the Harbour about Eight Ships and Barks which they alſo burned, not ſparing the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage-Boat, nor the Village which lies the Yonder ſide the Paſſage. They alſo made an Incurſion about a Mile above the Town, and burnt ſeveral Country Houſes. About three Hours before they Landed, Coll. <hi>Bampfield</hi> was in the Town with his Regiment, but they pretending to Land about <hi>Brixham,</hi> he was Commanded there; and the Town left to the Guard of the Mobile, and a Mob. Troop of Horſe, Commanded by the young <hi>Heyden,</hi> who all ſcoured upon the firſt Firing of the Enemy, and left two pieces of half Canon planted upon the Shore, which the Enemy took with them. When they landed, there was ſo great a Miſt, that one could not diſcern the other: About Nine a Clock it broke up, and the Enemy retir'd to their Boats, when I enter'd the Town, in the Head of 200 of the <hi>Poſſe Com.</hi> where we found the Town all in Flames and Ruine, but no one ſtay'd to be killed; all left their Houſes, except an old Woman, of Eighty Years, who was taken in the Bed, and in danger of Raviſhment; but pleading her Age, eſcaped. She ſays, about Twenty enter'd her Chamber, all Engliſh; they made bold with her Coffers, but aſſured her, ſhe need not be afraid of burning her Houſe; and told her, If the reſt had ſtay'd, they might have ſaved theirs. I ſend you ſome of their Match, which I took burning in a Houſe; and were it not for the charge of Poſtage, would ſend you a Bullet of 30 <hi>l.</hi> weight, which I took up in the Ruins of a Chimney. I am juſt mounting again (having ſeen your Mare, who will be ſerviceable againſt you come) and therefore muſt bid you adieu, wiſhing us Victory over the Enemy, and a happy meeting,</p>
