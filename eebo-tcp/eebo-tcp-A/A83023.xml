         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>BEING An Exhortation to all His MAJESTIES good Subjects in the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> to the duty of Repentance and Humiliation, with an earneſt confeſſion of particular and Nationall ſinnes. <hi>For the obtaining a firme and happy Peace, now in agitation.</hi> To be uſed privately in Families, but eſpecially publikely in Congregations.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat flouriſhing Kingdoms have bin ruin'd by Impenitent going on in a courſe of <hi>Sinning,</hi> the Sacred Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth plainly tell us; and how neere to ſuch a Ruine our ſinful <hi>Nation</hi> now is, the preſent lamentable Face of it doth too apparently ſhew. And though we ſhould feele the heavy ſtroakes of God, yet ſeven times more, It is our duty to accept the puniſhment of our Iniquity, and to ſay, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and juſt are thy Judgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet becauſe the Lord who is juſt, is alſo Mercifull, and in his infinite Mercy hath left the excellent and ſucceſſefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of Repentance to <hi>Nations</hi> brought neere to the Gates of deſtruction and deſpaire, O let not <hi>England</hi> be negligent in the application of it. Humble addreſſes of a penitent People to a mercifull God have prevailed with <hi>Him.</hi> They prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for <hi>Nineveh</hi> when the ſentence ſeemed to be gon out againſt her, and may alſo prevaile for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therfore thought moſt neceſſary by the Lords &amp; Commons in Parliament, that all his Majeſties Subjects in this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> be excited and ſtirred up, ſpeedily to lay hold upon this only and unfailing Remedy of Repentance; freely acknowledging, and heartily bewailing even with the deepeſt humiliation, godly ſorrow, and deteſtation, ſecretly and in Families, but eſpecially publikely in <hi>Congregations,</hi> both their owne perſonall ſins, and chiefly thoſe ſins that are and have bin the ſins of this <hi>Nation:</hi> A confeſſion of <hi>Nationall Sins</hi> being moſt agreeable to the Nationall Iudgments, under which the Land Groanes, and moſt likely to be effectual for the removing of them.</p>
            <p>Neither ought this confeſſion to ſleight or light, when there is ſo heavy a weight of Sins, infinite in number, and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous in nature, that lies upon this <hi>Nation.</hi> Such are the high Contempt of Gods holy Ordinances, and of Holineſſe it ſelfe: Groſſe and affected Ignorance, under the glorious light of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> cleerely ſhining among us; unfruitfulneſſe under the precious meanes of Grace, Ingratitude for Mercies, Incorrigiblenes under Iudgments, multitudes of Oathes, and Blaſphemies, wicked Prophanations of the Lords Day, by Sports and Gamings, formerly encouraged even by Authority; All ſorts of uncleanneſſe; <hi>Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Exceſſe</hi> in Eating and Drinking; Vanity, Pride, and Prodigality in Apparell; Envy, Contention, &amp; unnaturall Diviſions, Oppreſſion, Fraud, and Violence; From diverſe of which Sins, &amp; many other, not one Perſon throughout the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> can ſay that he is wholy free; but all muſt confeſſe that they have contributed toward the great Stock of <hi>Nationall Sins;</hi> And ſo have increaſed the Treaſure of <hi>Wrath,</hi> againſt theſe daies of <hi>Wrath;</hi> and therefore ſince, according to the Language of the Holy Ghoſt, we are a ſinfull <hi>Nation,</hi> a People laden with Iniquity, and that from the ſole of the Foot, to the Head, there is no ſoundneſſe in Vs, we may juſtly expect the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations that are denounced againſt ſo great and generall a corruption.</p>
            <p>And as it is our duty to humble our ſelves and to give glory to God, the ſearcher of all Hearts, by confeſſing all Sins; So ought we to be affected and humbled with deepeſt ſence of ſorrow, for thoſe moſt crying Sins, which now we find, by too ſad Experience, to have a more immediate Influence upon the Deſtruction of a Kingdome; ſome of which are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Bloodſhed.</p>
            <p>That of Idolatry, as it was the Sin of our Anceſtors, ſo it is the ſpreading Sin of theſe latter times, while by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall connivence, and almoſt Tolleration, it hath beene ſeverall wayes Fomented and encouraged: The grievous Effects whereof this Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> now begins to feele, from multitudes of Armed <hi>Papiſts</hi> and their Abettors, and the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> far more heavily hath felt, being brought almoſt to utter Ruine, by the Inteſtine Warres of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Idolaters.</p>
            <p>And for that other crying and cruell Sin of Bloodſhed, that cals aloud for Vengeance (beſides many Murders not expiated, and the blood-guilty pardoned) did it not goe hand in hand with that abhominable Idoll of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſome of her Predeceſſors, when many hundreds of the deere Martirs and Saints of God loſt their precious Lives in flames and priſons? And though ſeverall Acts by which that Innocent blood was ſhed, have beene repealed by Parliament: yet to this very day, was never ordeined ſuch a ſolemn Publique and Nationall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of this Sin, as might appeaſe the wrath of that Iealous God againſt whom, and againſt whoſe People, with ſo high a hand it was committed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> that all the Sin and Miſery of this Polluted and Afficted <hi>Nation</hi> may be bitterly ſorrowed for, with ſuch griefe of heart, and preparedneſſe for a thorow Reformation, as God may be pleaſed graciouſly to accept: It is required and Ordeined by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That every Miniſter and Preacher of Gods Word, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> in their ſeverall Auditories and Congregations, eſpecially upon the Faſt daies, ſhall moſt earneſtly perſwade and Inculcate the conſtant practice of this publique acknowledgement and deepe humiliation, for theſe, and all our Nationall and crying ſinnes, and likewiſe the neceſſity of a Perſonall and Nationall Reformation, and ſhall publiſh this Ordinance concerning the ſame: That ſo at length we may obtaine a firme and happy Peace both with God and man, That Glory may dwell in our Land, and the proſperity of the Goſpell, with all the priviledges accompanying it, may Crown this <hi>Nation</hi> unto all ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <div type="license">
               <p>ORdered by the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, that this Ordinance ſhall bee forthwith Printed and publiſhed, and read in all Pariſh Churches and Chappels throughout the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> by the Parſons, Vicars, and Curates of the ſame.</p>
