         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Worthy and Learned
PRESIDENT
Of TRINITY COLLEDGE in

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Shall not need (as the Custome is) to
argue the decency and fitness of
this address, nor to excuse its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
nice and critical Solecismes,
because your absolute and unalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Right to all the Fruits of
my Studies has made it due and
necessary; (and the Obligations of Duty cancel all
the Laws of Indecency) so that if to present you with
so mean a trifle be unhandsome, yet not to have done
it, would have been unjust. For my Studies (Sir)
<pb facs="tcp:58766:3"/>
are too deeply indebted to your Incouraging Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to make any other repayment then by entirely
resigning themselves up into your hands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I cannot alienate any thing that's theirs, from
being Yours, without being guilty at once of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Injustice and Ingratitude. So that though I do
but Injure your Name by concerning its Authority
in behalf of so worthless a Trifle, yet an Injury that's
the result of Duty and Gratitude, may hope for
not only your Pardon, but (such Sir is your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour)
your Acceptance too; since you cannot suspect
the Reality of my Resentments, when I decline not
so Criminal an Evidence thereof, and rather wilfully
chose to commit any Faults and Indecencies then lose
the least Opportunity to prove it.</p>
            <p>I will not be so troublesome as to remind you of
the retaile of your Obligations, yet there is one, whose
peculiar matchlesness obliges me to as peculiar an
acknowledgment. For to your prevailing advice (Sir)
do I owe my first Rescue from the Chains and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of an unhappy Education, then which 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
either for you to have conferred, or for me
to have received a greater benefit, there being no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to be Valued at so high a Rate as a true Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Ingenuity of Mind: 'Tis this, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes
Churches from Heards. And those men
that have laid aside the free and impartial use of
their Reasons, are just as fit for Religion as Sheep
<pb facs="tcp:58766:3"/>
and Oxen, for they differ only in this, that the one
are Brutes without Reason, and the other Brutes with
it. How could the Scythian have sacrificed Rational
Beings, had he not first sacrificed his Reason; or
the Egyptian adored Irrational Creatures, had not
himself been one? Onyons could never have been
Deities if Egyptians had been men; but when Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was once banished the Temples, no wonder if
folly and superstition commenced Religion; a stock
might be a Deity when the Priest was no more. But
(Sir) the excess of my Ioy and Zeal tempt me to be
impertinent.</p>
            <p>Philosophie may perhaps think her self hardly
dealt with, to have two of her famousest Sects call'd
to the Barre by so mean a Cleark as my self, yet I
think I have done them not a little Honour in citing
them before so Eminent a Iudge, and one so much
their Peer in all Sublime Learning and Generositie
of Soul; that their great Masters <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi>
might justly Resign the Chair, and yield their Porch
and Academy inferior to the Colledge that you Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
Where the many good foundations, and grounds
of Polite Literature, that you alone have laid, may
well be thought the only <hi>Talismans</hi> of its present
flourishing and prosperous Condition. These Papers
therefore which were formed and hatched under your
immediate Influences, being to take their flight abroad
into the World, ought to be legitimated by no other
<pb facs="tcp:58766:4"/>
then that Sun, which has always shined so favourably
upon all my Endeavours. I cannot but acknowledge
that (<hi>Sir</hi>) I have one selfish design in this Epistolary
Address; namely, to bribe your affection that it may
defend me from the Power of your Iudgment. 'Tis
a very unusual request I confess, but yet 'tis mine at
present, that you would be pleased to Protect me from
your self; For I here offer to your sight that Paper
which (did I not know your Candor to be proportion'd
to your other Accomplishments) I could even wish
might escape it. And thus (Sir) by prefixing your
Name to this Pamphlet, I have not onely Rescued it
from your own Iudgment, and the Contempt of others,
but have also in some measure gratified my own Pride,
in that as many as shall chance by the sight thereof, to
understand that there's such a thing as I in the world,
may withal be informed of the Honour and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
I have in being</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE that are so inconsiderate, as to
print Books, sell our selves into the
greatest <hi>Slavery</hi> in the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby exposed to the severe
commands of those that know us,
and severer lashes of those that
know us not: so that you may
perhaps sooner expect to find me in a <hi>Venetian Gally</hi>
then in the Press again. Not as if I were either so
little a Philosopher, as to regard other mens Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
(for I have too little esteem for the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mankind, to be at all concern'd how they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of me; and you know 'tis one of my greatest
designes in this world, to be one of the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd
men in it,) or so little your Friend, as
to stile your commands Burthens: yet, (to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58766:5"/>
plain with you upon the warrant of our Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Friendship) had they not surprised me at a
very seasonable time, I had sent you no other reply,
then either of Excuse, or flat Denyal: For, though
I was then addressing my self to some <hi>Mathematical
Studies,</hi> to the pursuance whereof I allotted the
next portion of time, yet the main of my Studies
for some weeks before had been employ'd in <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Authors,</hi> so that both my Brain and my Papers
being well stuffed with <hi>Ideas,</hi> I was not displeased
with the oportunity you have given me of Venting
the one, and Methodizing the other.</p>
            <p>The Task then you enjoyn me, is, To give an
account of two Passages in my <hi>Tentamina Physico-Theologica;</hi>
The one out of the last Chapter of the
first Book, in which I exclaim against the <hi>Platonick</hi>
Philosophy, as an ungrounded and Fanatick Fancy:
The other out of the last Chapter of the second
Book, where disputing against those that assert the
necessity of the Worlds <hi>Eternal Existence,</hi> I was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
obliged, to glance upon the two grand
Attributes of Gods <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> hence
you enjoyn me to make good my charge against <hi>Plato</hi>
by giving you a larger, and more particular account
of his Phylosophie, and to send you a further Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Nature and Extent of the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Attributes,</hi> especially, as they have reference to
the lately reviv'd <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the <hi>Preexistence</hi> of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58766:5"/>
               <hi>Souls,</hi> seeing I have there reckoned that up among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rash and unwarrantable opinions, which some
men think to maintain from the Nature of Gods
goodness; together with a special account of the
groundlesness of the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>But if (<hi>Sir</hi>) I now pay one part of this Debt, I
owe to your Commands, I may safely presume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Candor for a forbearance of the other half;
because (as I have often told you) although the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
I sometimes take to frame my Thoughts
and Conceptions into words, almost equals the
Ravishing delight I derive from their first Births
and Discoveries, yet too long a continuance at this
imployment is to me (and I believe to most men
else) the most tedious and wearisome piece of
Drudgerie in the world; so that if after this pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in part, you will but grant me a short respite
to refresh my self with a little Varietie, I do here
engage to discharge the whole Debt, when ever you
shall demand it. At present therefore deferring
the latter half of my Task, I shall only send you
as satisfactory an account of the <hi>Platonick Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,</hi>
as I am able; and that it may be as full and
entire as its brevity will permit: I shall consider it
in all its parts, according to the most usual, and
perhaps most comprehensive division of Philosophie
into Morality, Logick, Phisick, and Natural
Theologie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58766:6"/>
FIrst then, as for their <hi>Morality,</hi> no <hi>Platonist</hi> can
set an higher estimate upon it, then my self; For
beside those useful and excellent Notices, which it
teaches in common with the <hi>Ethicks</hi> of other Sects,
it may challenge a signal Preheminence upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
accounts; as</p>
            <p>1. In that the Rules and Directions it prescribes
are Sober and Practicable; it does not flatter men
with <hi>Romantick Degrees</hi> of Happiness, upon fond
and fantastick Principles, but complies with the
conditions of <hi>Humane life,</hi> and neither Promises
nor Designes greater proportions of Felicity,
then our present Capacities will allow of. The
<hi>Platonists</hi> were not so Vain as to comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with high strein'd Paradoxes against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
of Sense and Experience: They do not
teach us, when we are in the extremity of Pain and
Anguish, to sing <hi>Quam suave, quam dulce hoc est,
Quam hoc non curo?</hi> No, but they esteemed of every
thing as they found and felt it, and therefore
whatsoever they experienced agreeable to their
Natures they put into the Accounts of Good, as
on the contrary, whatsoever they found to be a
Grievance, they needed no other inducement to
convince them of its Evil. Whereas it was the
humour of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> rather to strein for <hi>Parodoxes</hi>
and <hi>Braveries</hi> then give practicable Rules of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58766:6"/>
Life: And therefore it was well observed by some
of the <hi>Antients,</hi> that never any man could attain to
that height of wisdome, which the <hi>Stoical Philosophie</hi>
pretends to. <hi>Stoici eam Sapientiam</hi> (saies <hi>Cicero) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretantur,
quam adhuc nemo mortalis est consecutus;</hi>
And <hi>Seneca</hi> speaking of a true Stoick; <hi>Fortasse</hi> (says
he) <hi>tanquam Phoenix semel anno quingentis simo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scitur;</hi>
and then only mentions the single instance
of <hi>Cato.</hi> But the last time I had the happiness
to Discourse with you, you was sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
how little the vertue of <hi>Cato,</hi> and the honesty
of <hi>Regulus</hi> are to be valued. If you should demand
of me an account of the Stoical Principles,
they are such as these. That the Beggerly Stoick
is the only Rich man, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
forsooth he is Master of all other mens
wealth. That he alone is beautiful, free, and
noble, that all other men are ugly sordid slaves.
That he alone is Prince and Emperor of the
Universe. That he can vie Perfection &amp; Happiness
with God Himself; nay <hi>Seneca</hi> blushes
not to affirm,<note place="margin">Epist. 53.</note> 
               <hi>est aliquid quo sapiens ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedat
Deum.</hi> That he alone is a true Poet, Orator,
Painter, Shoo-maker, Cobler, Taylor, or that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is good for everything, and no body else good for
any thing. That to kill a Swallow is not a less villanie
then <hi>Parricide.</hi> That 'tis as great a vertue to take a
flea-biting patiently, at it is to preserve ones Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58766:7"/>
by the most Gallant and Heroick Actions. That
there is as much prudence in lifting up your finger
with discretion, as in managing the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi>
That he alwayes hath his will, <gap reason="foreign">

you will think this a Paradox indeed, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that 'tis impossible for a Stoick to be mad. So
Extravagant are their Principles, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> has
made it the Title of one of his Books, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>That the Stoicks talk more
Extravagantly then the Poets.</hi> I could quote you
many places out of <hi>Lucian</hi> to this purpose against
the Stoicks, but then it must only be to shew you
how well I am acquainted with his Writings, for
he is every where so abusive and bitter in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres,
against all sorts of Philosophers, that if his
mouth be any slander, they must have been a pack
of the Vilest Villains that ever breathed, and
upon that score I shall wave his Testimony: To
proceed therefore,</p>
            <p>Whereas it was a <hi>Fundamental Principle</hi> of the
Stoicks, to esteem all things out of the power of a
mans own will, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>nor good nor evil,</hi> and thence
not to reckon Health, Chearfulness, good Name,
Wealth, Friends, Sickness, Grief, Disgrace,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58766:7"/>
Poverty, Enemies, into the accounts of Good or
Evil. The <hi>Platonists,</hi> on the contrary, made their
measures of Good and Evil, from the observations
of Sense and Experience; They therefore went
not about to perswade themselves that any accident,
which they felt to be evil, was ere the less so, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
placed beyond the reach and command of their
own wills; but looking about into the Nature of
things, they first found that <hi>Man</hi> was a complex
and multifarious Being, integrated of Body and
Soul, and so that his felicity could not be consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
if one constituent half of him was miserable:
and then, that the body was liable to a thousand
forreign contingencies, which 'tis not in the power
of the mind of avoid, but yet that <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi>
which have the most immediate, and most
diffus'd influence upon the repose and satisfaction
of man-kind; derive entirely from within a mans
self, and depend not at all upon any external occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies;
whence they concluded, that though the
biggest portions of our felicity be at our own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals,
yet that it must be acknowledged that some
of the smaller parcels thereof are left to Chance,
and uncertain Emergencies. And these they did
not hope (with the Stoicks) to escape by a wilful
senselesness and stupidity, like <hi>Posidonious,</hi> who when
a very importunate fit of the Gout attempted to
interrupt his Harangue before <hi>Pompey,</hi> cries out,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58766:8"/>
               <hi>Nihil agis dolor, quamvis sis molestus, nunquam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitebor
te malum esse;</hi> the most pathetical Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the acuteness of his paine! But the course
they took, was to purge their minds of froward
popular humours, and to sweeten them with mild
and benign Principles; to moderate and command
their passions, to furnish themselves with prudence
and experience, and then whatever happened, to
govern themselves by the Lawes of Wisdom and
Moderation: Because, though all the Fountains of
contentment are not within, nor do all our joys issue
from our own Bowels, yet they receive their cheif
tinctures thence: and hereby almost all our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
is prudently confin'd within the compass of
our own minds; for all intellectual endowments
(which are our greatest perfection, because they
perfect and advance our highest faculties) depend
upon our selves, and when the mind is furnished
with Vertue &amp; Wisdom, it is able to extract some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beneficial to its own Interests, from the most
malicious accidents. For every thing having two
ends as well as two handles; if a wise man miss the
one, he will not fail to hit the other; as he in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
who throwing a stone at a dog, but hit his curst
Mother in Law, said, <hi>That he had not mist his Mark.</hi>
A Wise man having his <hi>Palladium</hi> deposited within
his own bosome, by whatsoever circumstances he
is besieged, must needs be secure, if by good, they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58766:8"/>
minister to the delights of Temperance, if by bad,
they are improved to the interests of Patience and
Contentedness; so that though a Wise man be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the spitful injuries of Fortune, and may
be assaulted by forreign calamities, yet his mind (his
Fort-Royal) is impregnable, and in the middest
of all disappointments, its serenity shines as indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbedly
as the Lights of <hi>Pharos</hi> in the mid'st of
Storms and Tempests. Hereby you see that though
many of the ingredients of our happiness grow not
within our selves, yet their composition being at our
disposal, 'tis easie, either to add to their good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
or to allay their bad ones. But because here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
consists the Fundamental difference between the
morality of the <hi>Academicks</hi> and <hi>Stoicks,</hi> I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to assert and illustrate it a little more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by discussing the main objecdtion of the Stoicks;
which is this,</p>
            <p>If (say they) our satisfaction should depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
forreign advantages, and any part of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
should be beyond our power, then it being sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on a thousand uncertainties, it would both
render <hi>Philosophie</hi> useless, and the condition of <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>
unavoidably calamitous and deplorable, in that
no body can be master of his own satisfaction, but
must be forced to intrust it with so blind and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
a thing as <hi>Fortune,</hi> and so must needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
liable to infinite misfortunes, and incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58766:9"/>
harassed with fears of loosing those things, which
are not more necessary to his happiness, then they
are uncertain and variable.</p>
            <p>Though this objection be pregnantly answered
by every mans Experience of humane affairs, yet
partly because 'tis the main <hi>Basis</hi> of <hi>Stoicism,</hi> and
partly because it reflects unhandsomely on the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Providence, supposing that mankind would
be hardly dealt with, if all his Goods be not placed
within the confines of his own power, I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to silence it for ever, which I think may be done
by these ensuing considerations.</p>
            <p>1. That our Earthly happiness is never mere and
unmixt, but when 'tis purest, its diluted with some
dashes of misery.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <gap reason="foreign">

            </q>
            <p>Unallayed satisfactions are too Divine to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
any where, but where the Divinity it selfe
Resides: For as to the happiness of this life, there
is no one <hi>ultimate Object</hi> or <hi>summum Bonum,</hi> to the
Acquisition whereof all other Goods do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
as <hi>Intermedial Instruments,</hi> but every thing
that Ministers to our Contentment, is a Portion
of our Soveraigne Happiness, which is nothing
else but a mans present repose and satisfaction. I
can not therefore but commend that Principle of
some of the <hi>Cyrenaicks,</hi> that neither expected, nor
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58766:9"/>
pursued any other happiness in this life, beside what
was to be found in every single action and affaire
thereof. For all unanimously teach, that the <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity</hi>
and <hi>satisfaction</hi> of the mind, is the Soveraign
happiness of this life, and yet that is onely an act
of the mind exercised about its present objects, and
not any distinct object thereof: But the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not replenished with that variety of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as to be able to gratifie all our Appetites,
much less with that infinite fulness as to be able
to satisfie them: for alas! all Created Beings
are but small fragments of perfection, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
serve to support our Souls, till we arrive at
the fruition of that <hi>Object,</hi> whose Prerogative it
is to be adequate and satisfactory to all our
desires and expectations. The Stoicks then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
themselves, when they think an impossibility
of being certainly and entirely happy here, such
an insupportable Misery; when all things in this
world are by the unalterable Lawes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
imperfect, variable, and subject to the
Vicissitudes of Fortune. Now Wise men,
that consider the Nature and Inconstancy of
things, will not designe to themselves more rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
degrees of Blessednesse, then the World can
afford: but will be content to be as happy as
their own Capacities, and the present Condition of
things will permit and not fruitlesly aspire to heights
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58766:10"/>
of felicity, which they can never reach.</p>
            <p>2. Though some smaller parcels of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be beyond the command of our wills, yet the
greater Portions thereof are not: for instance, all
that in which the Stoicks place their whose feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
and that is pregnant enough of Tranquillity,
to render our lives sedate and comfortable. What
though some appendages of our happiness are out
of our own reach, if the main body thereof be
within it? Sure if Vertue be so Soveraign a good,
as singly to compleat our felicity, it will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to support our repose in the absence of smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
helps and assistances; Why then should they
deem our estate so deplorable, when we can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
of our most important interests, though some
lesser concernments be left to the disposal of fortune</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis in our power to alleviate and qualifie
those evils, which 'tis not in our power to escape.
What though I can not avoid Sickness, Povertie,
and Disgrace, yet I may by prudent reflection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
being grieved at them, and may improve them
to the benefit of Vertue and Wisdome? The
mould of a mans Fortune is in his own hands, though
the materials are not. Although a firm and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
habit of body be exceeding conducive to a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tenor of mind, yet may I be chearful without
it, though I might have been much more so with it.
When I cannot suit events to my desires, I will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58766:10"/>
suit my desires to them, I will compromise with
those grievances which I cannot shun, and those
blows of Fortune, I cannot ward off by Prudence,
I will dead by meeting them with a hardy courage
and resolution. I know I cannot bend the Laws of
nature of my own will, there remains therefore no
other remedie then that I sweeten and mollifie their
rigour, by a cheerful and generous complyance with
them, and so according to that vulgar, but very
wise saying, <hi>Make a Vertue of necessity:</hi> and so that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
that's most solid and generous, is most malleable
too. But (to dispatch) methinks it becomes not a
<hi>dull Apathist</hi> to object that we should be disquieted
with perpetual feares, if any parcel of our happiness
should not be lock'd up within our own breasts:
sure he might resolve, when there remain'd no
other remedie, to cast himself into an <hi>insensible
Apathy.</hi> How ever every man that premeditates the
nature and uncertainty of things, will neither be so
stupid, as to be surprised with any disaster, nor so
silly as to double it by a fruitless anxiety, but will
make the best of his condition by prudence and
discretion.</p>
            <p>2. A second thing for which I value the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
above all other Philosophers, is the innocent
Gayety and Pleasantness of their Humours. For
Whether I look into their Principles, or into their
lives, I can see nothing but what is calme and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58766:11"/>
cheerful. For beside that their complexions were
generally brisk and spritely, the <hi>Genius</hi> of their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie
was free and facetious. It being one of its
main principles, That as God had provided ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pleasures for good men in the next world, so
he had made liberal provisions for their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this, and consequently that this life affords
enough to please, though not to satisfie; whence
they were willing to enjoy all its innocent pleasures
and sensualities, though they thought them not of
any great concernment to such as were furnished
with capacities of rising above it, and aspiring to
heavenly delights. And thus you may see, how at
the same time a wise man may enjoy the world and
despise it too. And from this manly and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick
indifferency of life, resulted a handsome and
generous contempt of death, for they did not so
much defie it, out of a dogged neglect of life, as slite
it out of a sober and Philosophick uncertainty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were better that they continu'd in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
happiness, or left it to enjoy more pure and
generous delights. This was the main ground of
<hi>Socrates</hi>'s undaunted constancy in reference to death,
because whether it were preferable before life,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>it was uncertain and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to all but God alone,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> concludes his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Apologie. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (saies <hi>Euripides</hi>)
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>Who knows whether
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58766:11"/>
is life to live or dye?</hi> To die, is to be born into another
world, which every goodman may justly presume
he shall find better then this. Though the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why they were so willing to bid adieu to this
present <hi>Stage of life,</hi> was an eager curiosity to be
acquainted with the transactions and <hi>Phoenomena</hi>
of the next. And methinks, had I no other Rule to
guide my self by, then mere Philosophie, I could
willingly play the Platonist in this particular: For
though I am neither valiant nor miserable, and am as
yet in my green and unexperienced years, and have
tasted less of sensual delights, then (I believe) any
one plac'd in the same capacities and circumstances
with my self (for I have hitherto scarce employ'd
any of my senses, but that of seeing) insomuch that
though my Palate be not surfeited and cloy'd with
the same repeated relishes, nor my Eye quite wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of beholding the same repeated objects, yet I
could be highly content (upon the account of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophick
curiosity) to leave this present Theatre,
that I might enter upon the next, for the delight of
being entertain'd with a new Scene of things. <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
having been discoursing of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">In Apolog.</note>
of good men after death adds <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
were I but
sure of the truth of these things, I would die a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
deaths, for an experimental knowledge of
them. Besides the whole life of man is transacted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58766:12"/>
in the short space of 24 hours, in the rest of his age
he does but tread the same Stage over and over,
the same businesses always returning in the same
compass of time. Now any wise or generous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that shall but reflect upon the best spent day
of his whole life, will scarce find the business of it
so enticing, as to make him over greedy of more of
it. But a man that has been running in this Round
several years, should (methinks) be so sick and
weary of doing the same things over and over, as to
be willing to be at <hi>Rest,</hi> or at least to change his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;</hi>
so that though life be no misery, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there may be a satiety of it, deaths a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
But for the <hi>Stoicks</hi> (that I may continue the
parallel with their only Rivals in mortality) they
founded their satisfaction upon a scornful &amp; Frierly
contempt of every thing, &amp; are so injurious to their
Creator, as to teach that he has provided nothing
to entertain his Creatures with, but a few such
childish empty trifles, as grave men (<hi>i. e.</hi> Stoicks)
should scorn to tast, much less to feed upon. But
though the <hi>Platonists</hi> are not so impious as to think
that God made the world vain, yet they are so
wise and observing, as to perceive that it has made it
self so; and therefore I meet with no Sect raised
so much above the admired and gaudy trifles of the
vulgar, as they, nor any more confidently putting
the worlds Pomp quite out of countenance by a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58766:12"/>
handsome and free-spirited disdain, then they; nor any
less concern'd in news, and the little transactions of
humane affairs; Nor any better entertaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the various and odd humours of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
making dayly Comedies to themselves from
the follies and little conceits of the <hi>inconsiderate many.</hi>
Thus the spangled &amp; glittering Squire, who came to
<hi>Athens</hi> very brave and gallant, with a numerous train
of Attendants, supposing himself fine enough to be
adored by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and to be reputed at least
a <hi>Demi-God,</hi> was by the discreet and facetious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
of the <hi>Platonick Philosophers</hi> laughed out of his
vanity, and reduc'd to discretion and sobriety. And
thus the Platonist in <hi>Lucian</hi> raises mirth to himself
from the several Acts of the <hi>Play;</hi> now he laughs
at the Rich mans displaying his <hi>Purple,</hi> with his
troublesome croud of poor-spirited Sycophants;
anon pleasing himself with the disturbances and
foolish madness of the <hi>Horse-race;</hi> &amp; then with those
pretty passages which happen at Funerals and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Wills; next at the silly pleasures of great
Feasts and curious Entertainments; and then at the
little tumults &amp; odd contingencys at the <hi>Baths,</hi> &amp;c.
But to conclude this head, the <hi>Platonists</hi> were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
souls, that being raised above the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
and <hi>under-Shreiveries</hi> of this life (as the
<hi>Cardinals of Rome</hi> are pleased to stile all secular em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments)
sate as unconcern'd spectators, looking
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58766:13"/>
down from aloft, with pity and disdain, upon the odd
Carriage of humane affaires. And happy is he
<q>
                  <l>—Celsâ qui mentis ab arce</l>
                  <l>Despicit errantes, humanaque gaudia ridet.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For no Prospect is so pleasant and delightful to the
mind of man, as when he sees all the <hi>world</hi> below <hi>him,</hi>
&amp; beholds all others scrambling for aspiring to those
things which himself contemns and tramples upon.</p>
            <p>3. The third good quality of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> was their
valuing <hi>good-nature</hi> at so high a rate, which though it
be a constitution no less virtuous and excellent, then
'tis charming and amiable, yet the estimate they
set upon it was proportionable to its real value.
Whence resulted that exceeding delight they took in
the Society of ingenious and sweet-natur'd young
Gentlemen,<note place="margin">V. Platonis Convivium.</note> upon which score they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
themselves as great <hi>Votaries</hi> to the
<hi>Celestial Venus,</hi> as common Mortals are
to the <hi>Earthly one,</hi> for their Amours were not
kindled by lust and petulency (they being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
the most generous contemners of Women in
the world) but were pure and cleanly enough to
become Angels and separated souls, <hi>Plato</hi>'s Love-Laws
forbidding to court any other objects then
abstracted and intellectual Beauties. And <hi>Plotinus</hi>
makes it the first ascent to wisdome,<note place="margin">Ennead. 1. l. 3</note> to
be affected with the meer proportions
of <hi>Harmony</hi> abstracted from the sensible sound, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58766:13"/>
to be enamour'd with the features of beauty, without
respect to the body, which they render beautiful. And
yet hence some have taken occasion to slander <hi>Plato</hi>
himself (together with his incomparable master
<hi>Socrates</hi>) as guilty of that unnatural beastliness of
the lustful Sodomites. Although <hi>Plato</hi> at the end of
his <hi>Convivium</hi> has said as much to remove all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
from <hi>Socrates,</hi> as a matter of this nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of. And himself in his first book of Laws
detests and strictly prohibits this <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>a most unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
impudence.</hi> But the forementioned calumny had
never gain'd any credit with us, had it not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by some of the Ancient Fathers, &amp; yet it is too
notorious to dissemble that they were not only very
careless in their relations concerning the <hi>Philosophers,</hi>
being apparently guilty of innumerable <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
but also in many Instances highly disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
insomuch that I find no Prose-writer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
so much with their reports as <hi>Lucian,</hi> whose
main design it was to abuse every body that was
grave and sober. Which may a little appear by
giving you an account of the original and progress
of the forementioned slander. The first Authors
then of this and other resembling reports were the
<hi>Comick-Poets,</hi> who were persons of a free, droling,
and Satyrical humour, and whose chief design in
their Comedies, was to abuse men with roguish and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58766:14"/>
unlucky Stories; whatever was their <hi>Argument,</hi> their
<hi>Plot</hi> was always <hi>Satyr.</hi> They therefore who
flourished about the time of the <hi>Peloponesian Warr,</hi>
when the government of <hi>Athens</hi> was popular, were
wont to traduce the great and rich men of the <hi>City:</hi>
But when the <hi>Grandees</hi> were grown too big to be
brought upon the Stage (by the alteration of the
Government into an <hi>Aristocracy</hi>) they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to abuse former Poets, and in that Age, <hi>Homer</hi>
was sufficiently lashed; but afterwards, when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie</hi>
began to flourish, the Philosophers (upon
every small quarrel that hapned between them and
the Poets) were brought upon the Stage, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
with all their <hi>Satyrs.</hi> And thus this foul
charge of Sodomy, wherewith <hi>Socrates</hi> has been so
loudly impeach'd, was nothing else but an abusive
invention of <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> who having an implacable
picque against him, endeavour'd by all means to
render him both odious and ridiculous: For <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
being of a grave and severe humour did not a little
dis-relish the vanity and looseness of the Stage,
whereupon <hi>Aristophanes</hi> the Poet Laureat of that
Age, was so netled, that he immediately left the old
<hi>Comical Argument</hi> of droling upon former Poets, and
set himself to abuse the Philosophers, but especially
<hi>Socrates,</hi> all whose actions he continually persecuted
with sharp and unlucky Satyrs. And therefore
whereas <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to take home to himself,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58766:14"/>
the most ingenious &amp; spritely Youths, he could meet
with, to bestow upon them an Education propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to their parts, <hi>Aristophanes</hi> (with too much
foulness for any Ingenuous Person) represents him as
one that pickt up the loveliest youths, to the foulest
and most beastly purposes. And whereas <hi>Socrates</hi>
taught, that God was to be sought after in Heaven,
and not in their Images. <hi>Aristophanes</hi> perstringes
him as one that Worshiped the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and to this
end he Wrote his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> only to abuse <hi>Socrates</hi> and
his <hi>Gods.</hi> Neither did their Malice rest here, but
proceeded to Death and Banishment; for the
Poets had the greatest hand in the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Socrates;</hi> and <hi>Melitus,</hi> that was his most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
Accuser, was one of <hi>Aristophanes</hi>'s Players.
And a while after (about the CXX. <hi>Olimpiad</hi>) one
<hi>Sophocles,</hi> a Pragmatical Fellow of the <hi>Poetick Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
procured a Decree for the Banishment of all
the Philosophers from <hi>Athens,</hi> which took effect,
till at length the Controversie being fairly debated
before the Senate, the cause of the Philosophers
seem'd so apparently innocent to them, that they
immediately caused the Decree to be cancelled, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that the Philosophers should be speedily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
home, and fined <hi>Sophocles</hi> five Talents. Now,
though the Fathers could never meet with any
such filthy Relations in sober and impartial Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
yet because they apprehended (though
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58766:15"/>
very ineptly) that it made for the Interest of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
that the best men among the Heathens
should be but bad enough; rather then be destitute of
competent Testimonies against <hi>Socrates,</hi> (the most
eminent instance of <hi>Ethnick</hi> Vertue) they would
cite them from such as were not only his Enemies,
but Poets and Satyrists too; <hi>i. e.</hi> from those who
were not onely obliged by their design to abuse all
men, especially the wiser and more serious sort,
but also were incensed with a peculiar spite and
malice against him. Any one therefore that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Grecian Comedy</hi> in
general, and with this now mentioned Contest of
the Philosophers and Comedians in particular, will
be far from thinking their Satyres a sufficient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
against any mans morality. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some of our modern Criticks are not very kind
to the Philosophers, when they think a good part
of the Philosophick History is to be collected out
of the Ancient Comedians. Having consum'd so
many lines in Vindicating our Philosophers chastity,
I shall wave adding any farther Evidences of the
goodness of their Natures; onely give me leave to
throw in this single item thereof, that in the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
History</hi> you may meet with more instances of
true Philosophick &amp; Heroick Friendship, then in all
the world beside. They were indeed generally some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too fond of their Friends, &amp; it was their expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58766:15"/>
the offices of Friendship and Good-Nature (by
way of Allusion) in amorous terms, that gave too
much ground for the forementioned slander.</p>
            <p>And now (Sir) how much will this Excellent
Quality recommend them to our esteem, when we
consider at how high a rate our Blessed Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
valued it? If we look into his Laws, what are
they but so many injunctions to the several instances
of <hi>good nature,</hi> Mildness, Patience, Mercifulness, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Candor, Ingenuity? His new and peculiar
Precept is, That we should love one another, and
be kind not onely to Friends, but Enemies. And
therefore a peevish ill-natur'd Christian, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
contradiction in the World. Peevishness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatest reproach and weakness of humane
Nature, and most contrary to the temper of the
Divine Mind: So that they, who, not long since,
were wont to discourse, that the Saints or People
of God (<hi>i. e.</hi> That sort of people who can be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
and Godly, without being Vertuous) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
peevish here, but in Heaven this imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall be removed, might as well have told us,
that the Saints are <hi>Drunkards</hi> here, but in Heaven
they shall be Temperate; the Saints are <hi>Cheats</hi> and
<hi>Knaves</hi> here, but in Heaven they shall be Honest;
the Saints are <hi>Adulterers</hi> here, but in Heaven they
shall be Chast; for an habitual Peevishness is as
inconsistent with the design of Christianity, as the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58766:16"/>
sins of an habitual dishonesty, Drunkenness, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery.
And then if we look into our Saviours
life, the unparallel'd civility and obligingness of his
Deportment, seems to be almost as high an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Truth and Divinity of his Doctrine,
as his unparallel'd Miracles were; For 'tis altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unimaginable that so sweet-natur'd a Person
should be such a base and profligate Impostor, as
he must have been, if he had been one. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all his Favourites, it was the Gentle and
sweet-natur'd St. <hi>Iohn</hi> that was his darling Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
whilst we often find him checking <hi>Peters</hi> rude
and unmannerly Zeal.</p>
            <p>But all this while, by <hi>good Nature,</hi> I do not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
design a sweet Complexion and temperament of
Body, (though that is an happy advantage to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue)
but such a Divine and Gracious temper of
Mind as produces a sincere kindness and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
towards all men. 'Tis the fairest Character
and Imitation of the Deity, that distributes his
Bounty to all, and like his own Sun, shines upon
the Just and Unjust. 'Tis a <hi>Catholick Charity</hi> that
enfolds the whole world in the Arms of love and
kindness. Only there are some persons of such pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
and self confined Spirits, that will not suffer
themselves to be embraced by those, whose unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
embraces equally comprehend all, and disdain
to be but the partial objects of an impartial Love.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58766:16"/>
These men confine the <hi>displays</hi> of their love and
tenderness, within the narrow and contracted <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference</hi>
of a small party, and Excommunicate
the residue of Mankind as unworthy their charity,
and think it a great pollution to entertain any kind
thoughts for any besides themselves, confining the
Elect within the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Geneva:</hi> Now
against such testy and irregular Spirits, the
sweetest Natures have the greatest Antipathies,
not from any malice or bitterness against their
Persons, but from a true Zeal, for largness and
ingenuity of Spirit, and a real hatred against all
those Pestilent qualities that tend to supplant or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
it. Whence the <hi>Blessed Iesus</hi> (who was the
highest and most matchless Patterne of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Good-Nature) was remarkably sharp
and severe in his Invectives against the Pharisees;
because these Ill-natured Fellows despised and scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all that were not of their Sect, endeavouring
to confine all Goodness to their own Faction, and
looking upon the rest of Mankind, as a rout of vile
and worthless Reprobates. Now, though our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
could win and oblige <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots,</hi>
(persons of the most debauch't and loosest lives)
by his mild and sweet Deportment, yet when He
had to do with these holy Pharisaical Zelots, his
usual Language was, <hi>Ye Scribes and Pharisees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
ye are of your Father the Devil.</hi> There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58766:17"/>
nothing more hateful to God, then a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to Religion, void of Charity and true Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>I have heard some men (of a bitter and envious
Complexion, that have too much Gall to have the
Innocence of Doves, and that through the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their own Spirits, cannot rellish the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Good-Nature) enveigh against the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Good-Nature, as if it were a more neat
and secret designe of undermining the Interests of
Religion, and advancing those of Atheism. A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
as absurd as 'tis impious: For how can
that undermine Religion, which is its prime intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Can any designe be injur'd or defeated by
its intrinsick and proper end? And what more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
then that one of the main purposes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
is to sweeten and refine our Natures?
What does our Lawgiver more vehemently and
frequently urge, then Meekness, Mercifulness, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
and other resembling Instances of Good-Nature?
What bids greater defiance to the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Spirit of Christianity, then rude, churlish, and
ungentile Peevishness? What more lovely in the
<hi>Blessed Iesus</hi> then the sweetness and obligingness of
his Conversation? What did he ever more inveigh
against, then an uncivil and Pharisaical Zeal, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
otherwise sincere and cordial? so that if to
urge upon men the practice of Good-natur'd Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58766:17"/>
be to supplant Christianity, then Christianity
must supplant and contradict it self.</p>
            <p>But men have unhappily of late Christned a sort
of sulphureous and Fanatique fire, by the name of
Zeal: And when once their minds are tainted and
enraged by this hot devotional Zeal, 'tis as natural
to them to be rude and base-natur'd, as 'tis to Dogs
and Tigres. Zeal is a fire in the Soul, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
qualified and slaked by meekness and a calm-nature,
doth not only prey upon the mind, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
its intellectual Powers, and enflame all the
Passions, but its rage breaks forth, and sets whole
States and Kingdoms into a combustion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the whole World to Ashes; the greatest
Zealots always proving the greatest Incendiaries;
so that what <hi>Homer</hi> sayes of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Star, is not
more true of any thing then this fiery Zeal,

            <p>4. A fourth preheminence of the <hi>Platonists</hi> (that
I may insist on no more) is their readiness &amp; ability
in the smaller Morals, by which I mean their skill
in all the Arts of behaviour and conversation. For
though I have sufficiently experienced a modest
shamefacedness, and uncoothness in ceremonial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,
to be the natural and unavoidable results of
privacy, (as all Metals contract rust by lying) yet
the <hi>Platonists,</hi> notwithstanding their contemplative
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58766:18"/>
retiredness, were not inferior to the most polished
Courtiers, in the neatness and complaisance of their
Deportment. Which I am apt to ascribe chiefly
to the readiness and pregnancy of their Fancies; for
though a sound and steddy Judgment (which rarely
goes in company with subtil and flashy imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
is the most useful and commanding ability in
businesse, yet 'tis the quick and spritely fancy that
takes and commands most in converse. A strong
ready wit, with a bold and plausible Tongue, shall
win more respect and reputation, then all other more
valuable and emproving accomplishments, if wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
these advantages. Besides, they did not spend
all their time and diligence in Bookishness, which
renders Schollars soft, silly, unexperienced things,
but proposing to themselves ability and judgment in
business, as one main end of Study; they rather used
their Learning, then admired it, according to that
Aphorism of my Lord <hi>Bacon, Crafty men contemn stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
simple men admire them, &amp; wise men use them.</hi> But
the main ground of their good-meen, was their being
blest with all the advantages of nature &amp; education.
Were it not too tedious to run through the whole
succession of the <hi>Academy</hi> from the first rise thereof
to its utmost period, it would not be difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to you, how every member thereof super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced
to a pure complexion, and a gentile educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the advantages of Travel and severe Study; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58766:18"/>
what more could be desired to compleat them in
all the Realities and Ornaments of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
As <hi>Plato</hi> himself was of so well-temper'd a
complexion, that he chose an unhealthy place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence,
for a check and revulsion to his too high
and luxuriant habit of Body, and yet liv'd to a great
age unacquainted with sickness and diseases, and at
last this Socratick Swan expired insensibly in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
contemplation: <hi>Est etiam</hi> (saies <hi>Cicero) quietae &amp;
purae atque eleganter actae aetatis placida ac lenis sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,
qualem accepimus Platonis, qui uno &amp; octuages<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo
aetatis anno scribens mortuus est.</hi> And then for his
Parentage, though I do as little credit that he was
begot either by <hi>Apollo</hi> or by a <hi>Spectre</hi> in his shape,
as I do that he was born of a <hi>Virgin Mother</hi> (and yet
both are reported by many Authors, and seem to be
believed by more) yet 'tis past doubt that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
was from two of the most Antient and
most Noble Families in <hi>Athens,</hi> his Mother <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione</hi>
being of the race of <hi>Solon,</hi> and his Father <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto</hi>
of the Family of the <hi>Codri.</hi> And then for his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
he was no Athenian Cockney, but was <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>'s
darling favourite, Travelled into all parts of
the Learned World, resided a considerable time in
the Court of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> where he was both admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and envied by the Courtiers for the unaffected
Gracefulness of his addresses, and some say the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why he received so bad usage from the <hi>Tyrant,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58766:19"/>
was that he excell'd him so far in all the Arts and
charms of conversation, that he seem'd to be almost
as much respected and admired as himself. For he
knew how to be facetious without being vaine or
trifling, &amp; how to be serious without being soure or
morose, his behaviour was alwaies mild and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
his humour alwaies cheerful and uniform, and
his gravity at an equal distance from moroseness &amp;
vanity; to be brief, he was entirely adorn'd with
all the accomplishments that can command either
love or honour. And then for <hi>Plotinus,</hi> his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as <hi>Porphyrie</hi> relates in his life) was so gentile
that his Audience was composed of a confluence
of the Noblest and most Illustrious Personages in
<hi>Rome;</hi> his integrity so eminent, that he was depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
over-seer to most of their Wills, and Arbitrator
in most of their Controversies, and yet mannaged
all with that Candor, Prudence, and Sincerity,
as that he neither lost one Friend, nor Purchased
one Enemy in five and twenty years Residence at
<hi>Rome,</hi> For the rest of his life consult <hi>Porphyrie</hi> and
<hi>Eunapius.</hi> For the life of <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> I refer you to
<hi>Eunapius,</hi> but yet I cannot omit this single instance
of the goodness of his humour, that after an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
conflict, and many reiterated controversial
Rencounters with <hi>Amelius,</hi> as soon as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Amelius</hi> stood together, he
neither scrupled to make a Publick Recantation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58766:19"/>
then, nor to record it to Posterity, that himself
was bafled (as he has done in the Life of <hi>Plotinus</hi>)
then which we scarce know a greater instance of an
Heroick Candour. For <hi>Proclus</hi> consult his Scholar
<hi>Marinus the Neopolitan,</hi> and <hi>Philostratus the younger
De vitis Sophistarum</hi> (I say the younger, because he
was Nephew to him that wrote the History of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius
Tyanaeus,</hi> though they be usually confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Authority of that careless Rhapsodist
<hi>Suidas,</hi> who has been the Author of infinite other
resembling mistakes) lastly consult <hi>Eunapius</hi> for
the lives of <hi>AEdesius, Iamblicus, Sopater, (Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
unhappy favourite) <hi>Eustathius,</hi> and his eminent
wife <hi>Sosipatra</hi> (of whom so many strange stories are
reported,) <hi>Crispus</hi> one of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Courtiers, a man
of eminent prudence and policy, <hi>Oribasius, Iulians</hi>
Physician, <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Chrysanthius</hi> his great
Favourites, the former whereof, was an eminent
Courtier, during the time of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Reign, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(I fear too much) an instance of Christian Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and Revenge; though the generous <hi>Chrysan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi>
could never be courted from his Philosophick
retirements by all the Emperours importunity: <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aeresius,</hi>
who was so famous an Orator, that the
City of <hi>Rome</hi> erected to him a publick Statue of
Brass with this inscription, <hi>Regina Rerum Roma, Regi
Eloquentiae. Hephaestion, Himerius, Libanius, Nymphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus,
&amp;c.</hi> and you will find them such a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58766:20"/>
succession of Gentile, Vertuous, and Generous
Persons, that the <hi>Ethnick</hi> world cannot shew the
like. To these I might add the novel restorers of
<hi>Platonism;</hi> for as the <hi>Platonick</hi> succession expired
not long after the reign of <hi>Iulian,</hi> having received its
mortal wound from <hi>Constantine,</hi> who dissolved their
Scholes and dispersed their Professors; so about
the fourteenth <hi>Centurie,</hi> it began to revive and to
wrestle with <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philosophie: for some of the
<hi>Grecian Prelates,</hi> that then sate in the <hi>Council of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
(call'd to reconcile the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latine</hi>
Churches) seeing all other Philosophie quite dashed
out of Countenance in these Western Parts by the
<hi>Aristotelian,</hi> they were not a little zealous to restore
that of <hi>Plato,</hi> whence arose the disputes between
<hi>Georgius Trapezuntius,</hi> and <hi>Georgius Scholarius</hi> on
the behalf of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Bessarion</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nice,</hi>
(made Cardinal for his eminent services in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil)
and <hi>Gemistus Pletho</hi> on the behalf of <hi>Plato.</hi> But
<hi>Pletho</hi> getting into favour with <hi>Laurentius Cosmo</hi> the
great Duke, inspired him with such a mighty zeal
for the Platonick Philosophie, that he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devoted young <hi>Ficinus</hi> (Son to one of his chiefest
Phisicians) to its Restauration, and educated him
accordingly; and invited that worthy Heroe <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes
Picus</hi> the Earle of <hi>Mirandula, Georgius Vespu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,
Christophorus Landinus, Angelus Politianus,</hi> and
others to <hi>Florence,</hi> where they erected an Academie.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58766:20"/>
Which, with much more, you may meet with in the
extant Epistles of the Earl of <hi>Mirandula, Marsilius
Ficinus,</hi> and <hi>Angelus Politanus.</hi> But I proceed,
though the <hi>Platonists</hi> could Artificially conform
their Behaviour to the more refined and Gentile
sort of Men, yet as for that salvage Beast, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Rout, they valued no more to please them,
then to gratifie Wolves or Tigres; for really (Sir)
folly is so moulded into the Constitution of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and mechanical sort of men, that that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
must be well-nigh as absurd as they, who
supposes them capable of wisdom, when they have
scarce wit or judgment enough to think a thought,
that is not inept and ridiculous. Their childish
and froward humour is not unhandsomely display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Charon.</hi> 
               <q>All that they think is Vanity, all
that they say is false and erroneous; that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
is good, that they approve is naught; that
which they praise is infamous, that which they
do and undertake is folly.</q> So that 'tis not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for any man, who aspires to wisdom, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to any compliance with their base and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
humours. And therefore these Sons of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
were <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>egardless of them, as of Apes and
Baboons.</p>
            <p>But now for the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> their Conversation was
insolent and supercilious, their looks affected and
artificial, their Deportment was such a soure and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58766:21"/>
morose behaviour, as the vulgar stile gravity. And
I think <hi>Iosephus</hi> was not much mistaken, when he
describ'd the rude and ill-natur'd <hi>Pharisees</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
them with the Stoicks, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
For as the supercilious Pharisees accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their own Sect the only School of Sanctity, so
the Stoicks esteem'd themselves the onely Sons of
wisdom, and all others Children, Fools, and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
I might both evidence these things by
several particular instances, and add several
other Prerogatives of the <hi>Platonick Morality,</hi>
but because I fear I have more need to beg
your pardon for having been already so tedious,
I shall onely tell you, that you may find the
fairest and exactest Idea and Picture thereof in the
Life and Precepts of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the several linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

an unavoidable necessity of assenting to the
Truth you assert? Which is the method that
<hi>Plato</hi> pretends to. I must confess that arguing by
<hi>Syllogismes</hi> is more sutable to Youths and Novices
in Reason, but 'tis far more Elegant and Manly,
to mannage a few short Interrogatories with that
dexterity and strength of Reason, as thereby to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
your Adversary so far, as to force him either
to Seal to your Opinion, or to retract his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
concessions: For in the former Method, the
Disputant moves on by slow Progressions, and takes
a great compass about to approach and get up to
his Enemy; but in the latter his motion is quick
and nimble, and the engagement so direct and smart,
that it cannot be closely pursued, but by Persons
very expert and knowing in the Art and Laws of
Reasoning.</p>
            <p>But some that make the best Laws, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58766:22"/>
their best observers. Thus though <hi>Plato</hi>'s
discoursings about practical matters are exceeding
handsome and pertinent, yet when he treats of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Notions, his rules of arguing could not be
more strict, close, and exact, then his Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were wide,<note place="margin">In his Plato Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otericus.</note> lose, and incoherent:
When <hi>Patricius</hi> confidently asserts <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s
demonstrations in his <hi>Parmenides</hi> to be so strong
and undeniable, <hi>Ut nullae tales apud Mathematicum
ullum reperiantur;</hi> I commend his confidence, but
dare not contradict his assertion, because I think it
unhandsome to contradict in a matter, which I
dare not be very confident I understand. But when
<hi>Cardinal Bessarion</hi> asserts,<note place="margin">Adv. Calum. l. 1. c. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Totum Platonis
Timaeum ex syllogismis demonstrativis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stare;</hi>
I who have read over that discourse with as
much caution and attention as I could, dare (by
the Cardinals leave) pronounce that there is not one
demonstrative syllogisme in the whole Book; nay
that there is not one true and valid Argument, but
that the whole discourse is weak and incoherent:
And (to speak out plainly) that Person will much
oblige me, that shall direct me to one material ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination
about <hi>speculative Theories</hi> in all <hi>Plato</hi>'s
Writings, where I cannot shew him some manifest
flaw or other. For they either (1.) bottome upon
uncertain and inevident Principles, as they generally
do; but because there can be no certainty in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58766:22"/>
conclusion, without a certainty in the premises,
and the certainty of intermediate propositions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the first, if that be uncertain, the whole
trayn of Inferences deduced from it, (though aptly
connected to each other) must needs be so too. Or
else (2.) they are circular, as in his <hi>Meno</hi> he bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
the Souls Reminiscency of those Ideas, it
conversed with in a former state, upon its presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Immortality; and yet in his <hi>Phaedo,</hi> he fairly
argues for the Souls Immortality from its presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Reminiscency. And any one that peruses
his Writings warily, will find them to abound
with infinite such Circles. Or (3.) he wanders into
matters remote and impertinent to the Subject and
Argument of his Discourse, roving into disputes of a
quite distant nature from the Question in debate; or
beating about through wild, intricate and uncertain
Ambages, or taking a wide and tedious compass to
pursue and drive a trivial word into its proper sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.
Though perhaps this charge will admit
of an Apologie. Because most of his disputes were
mannaged against the <hi>Sophists</hi> of that age, who made
it their whole business to maintain wrangles by
tricks and shifts of words, and therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
undertook to dispute against them, must
of necessity be ingaged in word quarrels. And
hence it was that <hi>Plato</hi> does almost every where
take such large compasses meerly to vindicate the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58766:23"/>
signification of a single word against their idle cavils,
and though sometimes he may pursue his task pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and coherently, yet because of the small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the matter debated of, his discourse must
needs be both very tedious and not very profitable.
Or else (5.) there is some flaw and incoherence in
some of the intermediate propositions, which must
needs marre the chain of his whole Discourse: For
the certain knowledge of <hi>Consequences</hi> is only <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi>
and supposes the Truth of <hi>Premises,</hi> so that
where any Proposition is false, there the coherence
ceases, and all conclusions that follow it are absurd,
because incoherent. But if I should give you a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue</hi>
of his Circular arguings, incoherences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
non-consequences, and all other viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Laws of Reasoning,</hi> I must send you a
Volumn as vast as his. And besides it would not be
less fruitless then tedious, and might seem to aim at
no other design, but merely his disparagement. But
yet that you may not suspect me of rashness in
drawing up so big a charge against so eminent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
without being able to <hi>back</hi> it with a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
evidence, I suppose it will not be impertinent to
give you a competent proof of it, if I can perform it
without being tedious. Which may be done by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
one instance and referring you to an Author,
that will supply you with infinite more, if you think
it worth the while to examine them. The Instance I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58766:23"/>
shall give you, is the known and famous Argument
for the Souls Immortality in his <hi>Phaedrus.</hi>

The sence of which
words is fully and more plainly contained in this
Analysis, <hi>The Soul is always in motion; that which
is always in motion, is self moving; that which is self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving,
is never deserted of it self; that which never
deserts it self, never ceases to move; that which never
ceases to move, is the source and origine of all motion;
that which is the source of all motion has no beginning;
and that which has no beginning can have no ending.</hi> To
omit that every Proposition is either false, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
or incoherent, as your self will easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
judge whether we are not likely to have a
mighty proof of the Souls immortality, when it
must be resolved into its own self-subsistence.</p>
            <p>The Author I shall refer you to, is <hi>Iohannes

of <hi>Plato</hi>'s arguings: Where you may be supplyed

            <p>After this brief account of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Logick,</hi> I come
now to his <hi>Natural Philosophie,</hi> in which I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
all possible brevity, because this part, as
well as the former, doth not so directly concern my
present design, the intendment of my charge being
chiefely against his <hi>Natural Theologie.</hi> But that my
Discourse may be entire in all its parts, and regular
in its method, I shall to my account of his Logick
cast in this of his Physiologie. Which will be
sufficiently display'd and disparaged too, by telling
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58766:24"/>
you that in its main strokes it accords with the
<hi>Aristotelean Philosophie;</hi> a parallel between them
was asserted and demonstrated by <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius,
Porphyrie, Hierocles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. Phot. eclog. <hi>CCLI.</hi>
               </note> and others
of the sacred succession among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
and among Modern Writers has been attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Foxius, Carpentarius, Marronius, Buratellus</hi> and
others. The Retail of instances you may see in them,
but he that tells you in gross that they agree in one
Principle, by which alone they solve all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
and productions of Nature, tells you all.
For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> resolves all <hi>Phaenomena</hi> into his
<hi>Forms,</hi> (which he starts from the Bosome of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
so <hi>Plato</hi> solves all by the <hi>Soul of the Universe</hi>
and <hi>Ideas,</hi> (which in Greek are all one with <hi>Forms.</hi>)
For the <hi>Mechanical Hypotheses</hi> having been probably
advanced to a considerable Grandeur by <hi>Leucippus</hi>
and <hi>Democritus</hi> (of whom <hi>Plato</hi> makes not any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in all his Writings) and other Ancient <hi>Vertuosi,</hi>
these two great and ambitious Wits, <hi>Plato</hi> and
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> designing a Philosophical Empire to
themselves scorn'd to be so meanly employ'd, as
only to improve other mens principles, and therefore
endeavoured to amuse the world with new ones,
which they knew others could as little confute, as
themselves could prove, by reason of their obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and remoteness from sence. How little <hi>Aristotle</hi>
intended his <hi>Forms</hi> should be understood is already
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58766:25"/>
infinitely notorious, and how little mind <hi>Plato</hi> had
that it should be ever known what kind of Thing
his <hi>Universal Soul</hi> is, is as notoriously apparent from
his descriptions of it, which are nothing else but
some odd fantastick Schemes of numerical figures
and proportions, as you may see in both the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi>'s;
where 'tis highly pleasant to read how se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
he prescribes the Method of its Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of numerical Ingredients. Take (saith he)
all the numbers which make up Musical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as <hi>Diapasons, Diapente</hi>'s, <hi>Diatesserons,</hi> and an
infinite number more, but be especially careful not
to omit the double <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that which arises by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
proportions, as 1, 2, 4, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that whose
proportions run into odd numbers, as 1, 3, 9, 27,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mix and pound them together with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

exactly into the shape of the Letter <hi>I,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it in the middle long ways into two equal parts,
cross them in the form of the Letter <hi>X,</hi> and be sure
to fasten them very strongly at the Commissure,
and then bow all four joynts, till at length you make
them so pliable, as to bring them into a Spherical
figure, and then 'tis brought to a right Animary
Temper and Harmony. If this description (to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58766:25"/>
what ever purpose 'tis design'd) be not prodigiously
silly and ridiculous, pray tell me what is. And
yet this sensless insignificant Jargon is made the sole
and intimate Principle of all <hi>Natural Events.</hi> All
Motions, Generations, Corruptions, Alterations,
Sympathies, Antipathies, the properties of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
the figure of the Heavens, the systeme of the
Stars, the motions of the Planets, Eclipses, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
Meteors, The roundness of the Earth, the

Smells, and all other Phaenomena of Nature are
only so many Tricks of this Magical kind of Soul.
If I could have satisfied my self it had been to any
purpose, I should have given you an account of his
enormous absurdities in all the forementioned parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
as they are discoursed of in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58766:26"/>
contains the whole Body of his Natural Philosophy.
But I shall beg your leave to dismiss this Theme,
partly because none have more professedly disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Platonick Physiologie,</hi> then they that stickle
most for his other Whimsies, partly because the
<hi>Aristotelian</hi> Philosophy having been of late so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
bafled, this which agrees so much with it in
its main Principles, and more in its Genius, must
of necessity perish together with it, and so will as
little need as deserve any particular confutation;
partly because their <hi>Physiologie</hi> is well nigh purely
<hi>Theological;</hi> The <hi>Platonists</hi> alwayes Treating of
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. as <hi>Proclus</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves;
so that in ventilating and sifting their <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
I must also of necessity discuss their Natural
Philosophie, which is every where so intimately
mingled with it; but chiefly because I am lately
grown such a despairing <hi>Sceptick</hi> in all <hi>Physiological
Theories,</hi> that I cannot concern my self in the Truth
or Falshood of any <hi>Hypotheses.</hi> For though I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Mechanical Hypotheses before any other,
yet me thinks their contexture is too slight and brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to have any stress laid upon them; and I can
resemble them to nothing better then your <hi>Glass
drops,</hi> from which, if the least portion be broken,
the whole <hi>Compages</hi> immediately dissolves and shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into Dust and Atoms; for their parts, which
rather lie then hang together, being supported only
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58766:26"/>
by the thin filme of a brittle Conjecture (not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal'd
by experience and observation) if that fail
any where, the whole Systeme of the Hypothesis
unavoidably shatters: And how easie a thing it is
to spoil the prettiest conjecture, is obvious to the
most vulgar observer. The cheif reason therefore,
why I prefer the Mechanical and Experimental
Philosophie before the <hi>Aristotelean,</hi> is not so much
because of its so much greater certainty, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it puts inquisitive men into a method to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, whereas the other serves only to obstruct
their industry by amusing them with empty and
insignificant Notions. And therefore we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
expect a greater Improvement of Natural
Philosophie from the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> (if they pursue
their design) then it has had in all former ages; for
they having discarded all particular <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> and
wholly addicted themselves to exact Experiments
and Observations, they may not only furnish the
World with a compleat <hi>History of Nature,</hi> (which
is the most useful part of <hi>Physiologie</hi>) but also laye
firm and solid foundations to erect <hi>Hypotheses</hi> upon,
(though perhaps that must be the work of future
Ages:) at least we shall see whether it be possible
to frame any certain <hi>Hypotheses</hi> or no, which is the
thing I most doubt of, because, though the <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments</hi>
be exact and certain, yet their Application
to any <hi>Hypotheses</hi> is doubtful and uncertain; so that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58766:27"/>
though the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> may have a firm <hi>Basis</hi> to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
upon, yet it can be fastned and cemented to
it no other way, but by conjecture and uncertaine
(though probable) applications, and therefore I
doubt not but we must at last rest satisfied with true
and exact Histories of Nature for use and practice;
and with the handsomest and most probable <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses</hi>
for delight and Ornament.</p>
            <p>And now I pass over to the main design of these
Papers, which is to give an account of the <hi>Platonick
Theologie:</hi> The <hi>Civil Part</hi> whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That
which concerns their <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> I shall omit,
For all the Religious Observations of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
being trifling, obscene, or inhumane, their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porising
Conformity to them, stands upon Record
as one of their greatest Blemishes: Though it must
be confessed that the <hi>Platonists</hi> were of all men the
greatest Refiners and Improvers of <hi>Helenisme;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of rude and barbarous Usages, introducing
civil and more modest Ceremonies. And yet the
latter <hi>Platonists,</hi> or <hi>second School of Plato,</hi> degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into the basest and foulest Superstition, being
the greatest Patrons of <hi>Theurgical Rites</hi> and <hi>Magical
Arts,</hi> or rather <hi>Iugling Tricks,</hi> (for whatever they
were, they could be no better) especially those of
them that did most <hi>Pythagorise,</hi> As <hi>Apollonius Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anaeus,</hi>
that grand stickler for <hi>Ethnicisme; Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
one of their Famousest <hi>Devoto's; Iulianus</hi> the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58766:27"/>
               <hi>Syrian,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Theurgus,</hi> from his Eminent
knowledge and agility in <hi>Magical Tricks,</hi> were great
Zealots for the <hi>Pythagorean Philosophie.</hi> But if
you look into <hi>Eunapius,</hi> you will see, that not only
these, but the <hi>Emperour Iulian, Porphyrie, Maximus,
Libanius, Amelius, Sopater, AEdesius, Chrysanthius,</hi>
and others were Zealous Asserters of this Magical
kind of Jugling, chiefly (as 'tis supposed) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
the Christian Religion, and the Miracles on
which it stood. But I forbear to prosecute this
Theme, my intention being not to discourse of their
publick and political actions, but only of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
sentiments.</p>
            <p>Their Theologie then consisted of two parts;
<hi>Practical,</hi> or that which concerns Theological Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
and <hi>Speculative,</hi> or that which concerns spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
about Theological matters. Which two
parts integrate a Body of Divinity not unlike to that
of King <hi>Ptolomies</hi> man in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who was one half
perfectly black, and the other exceeding white; so
that part of their Theologie, which relates to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
is eminently clear and perspicuous, whilst
that which is employed in Theorie and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
is monstrously dark and obscure. This lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I shall endeavour to evince more largely in the
sequel of my discourse; but for a brief evidence of
the first, take this short Catalogue of their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
concerning Religion, which are such as these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:58766:28"/>
Its main design is to perfect and dignifie humane
Nature, 'tis consonant to our Natural Reasons,
complies with our Natural Necessities, relieves
our Natural Wants. It consists in living up to
our Faculties, and acting as becomes Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
In clearing the Soul from prejudices and
prepossessions, and pursuing Truth with an honest
and impartial Simplicity: In following the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Reason, and being confident in its Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
seeing the Condition of him that does so is
as secure, as 'tis certain that <hi>Infinite Goodness</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be angry with him, that has endeavour'd with
all faithfulness and diligence to know and do his
Duty. It resides in the Mind and Spirit, not in
Customes and bare Ceremonies. It is Free and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous,
not Slavish and Troublesome, because it
flows from a true Love of God and Goodness. It
is truly Noble and Generous, and requires of us
to act suitable to the Dignity of rational Beings,
to keep up the Splendour and Grandeur of our
Natures, and to scorn any Action that's unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
or unworthy our Station and Quality: It
commands us onely to live like Men, and forbids
us nothing but what makes us Brutes or Devils.
It teaches us to imitate and resemble the Divine
Perfections, to be God-like in Wisdom, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Goodness, in Meekness, and Pity, and
Clemency, in Kindness and Patience, in forgiving
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58766:28"/>
Injuries, and Pardoning Enemies, in doing hurt to
no Man, and doing good to every Man. It inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
us not any Innocent Delights, but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
the Extravagancies of our Passions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.
It is the most conducive Instrument in
the world to the pleasures of both Mind and Body;
Infelicities (though Providence were banish't the
World) being the <hi>Spontaneous Issues</hi> of Vile Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices;
and Sin the <hi>Natural Womb</hi> of Punishment;
it therefore permits (unless in some special contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies)
all Corporeal Pleasures, as far as they are
healthful and pleasant, and debars us of no delights,
but those that are destructive of the <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of
our Minds, or <hi>Indolency</hi> of our Bodies. It produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
a sweet and gracious temper of Mind, that
causes an universal benevolence and kindness to
Mankind. It makes us Affable, Humble, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
Charitable, Moderate, Prudent, Unpassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate.
It consists of Love, Candour, Ingenuity,
Clemency, Patience, Mildness, and all other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Good-Nature. It detests nothing more
then a Peevish, Froward, Morose, Uncivil, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate,
Furious, Talkative, Fanatick Zeal. It
begets a true Liberty and Freedome of Spirit. It
Exempts us from all effeminate Fears and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and begets the greatest Serenity and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Mind. It instructs us to dread no Evil
from God, but to look upon Him as an infinitely
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58766:29"/>
Gracious and Benigne Being, that designs nothing
more then the happiness and perfection of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
that Transacts with Mankind by gentle and
paternal Measures, and that is so far from tying
upon us Niceties and Scruples, that he pities our
Infirmities, and bids us to concern our selves onely
about plain and palpable Duties. It is the most
spritely and vivacious thing in the world, driving
away all sad and gloomy Melancholly, begetting
in us a firm and rational Confidence, and the inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable
joys of a good Conscience. It advances the
Soul to its Just Power and Dominion, and enables
it to govern all Corporeal Appetites, and therefore
enjoyns us above all things to shun Intemperance,
not only for its own Intrinsique Baseness, but for
its mischeivous Effects; because it naturally so
debauches and dulls our Reasons, as to disable them
for all good and vertuous Actions. For Religion
is pure, cleanly and spiritual; but an intemperate
sensuality is nasty, sottish, and makes the mind of
man cheap and foolish, and unapt for any thing that
is Manly, Generous, and Rational, and so is the
greatest Impediment to all the ends and Exercises
of Religion, which directly tends to the enobling
of our Natures, the fortifying of our Reasons, the
subduing of all our lower and sottish Appetites,
the advancing of our manly and intellectual Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in any thing that renders us less like Beasts, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58766:29"/>
more like men. But as for Intemperance, that
does by a natural necessity besot and weaken the
vigour of our Reasons, and so directly thwart all
the ends of Religion, for it either stupifies or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
our Spirits, either stuffing our Bodies with
dull, watry, and flatulent humours, or putting their
Ferments into irregular and extravagant motions.
I have often known a rude, wild, dissolute, chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
ungovernable Spirit enter into persons (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of a well-inclin'd Complexion) by no other
way then a wide and devouring Throat. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
our work in this World is to see that the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> maintain its own Authority against all
the assaults of rude and barbarous Passions; that it
tame and civilize that wild and salvage <hi>Beast,</hi> to
which Providence has tyed it, that by a compleat
Victory over all ignoble and unhandsome motions
of the brutish Faculties, it may be in a manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to the condition of a pure and intellectual
Being; and so be capacitated to relish the joyes
proper to God and Spiritual Natures, for we are
not capable of that degree of Felicity which they
enjoy, till our Souls are rendred so by proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
degrees of Purity and Holiness; for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of Heaven is pure and intellectual, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our minds are purged here from all feculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of matter, that they may be fitted and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to relish its Enjoyments; so that when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58766:30"/>
Energy of the Soul has melted down all the
drossy parts of sluggish and unweildy matter, and is
become <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>God-like, and purely spiritual,</hi> then
it shall mount up into the Regions of Bliss and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and shall be admitted into an intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and union with the Divine Nature, and shall
live in the Ravishing Contemplations and Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings
of uncreated Beauty, and bathe its dilated Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in the full streams of Infinite Goodness, and
Sun it self in the Invigorating Beams of Light and
Love, and spend a whole Eternity in the blissful
Acts of Love, and Joy, and Peace, and every
thing that can procure or encrease its happinesse.
By all which, you easily discern that Religion is
no Arbitrary Exaction, but Wise and Rational,
and of natural necessity to perfect and refine our
Natures, to raise and purifie our Minds, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
and fit us for a higher and more Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
the Soul being not capable or fit without it
to enjoy the pleasures of God and Heaven.</p>
            <p>And now I descend to their Speculative or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
Theologie, which the <hi>Platonists</hi> stile Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;
The <hi>Peripateticks Primitive Philosophie;</hi> and
include in it that which they call <hi>Sapience</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks;</hi>
so that I shall not confine my self to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
meerly Theological, but shall take in all the
general Principles of Science; especially because I
do not intend a pursuit of all particular Disputes,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58766:30"/>
(for that would be an endless undertaking) but only
some such General Exceptions, as though they
may have a more direct aspect on <hi>Metaphysical
Speculations,</hi> yet may concern their Philosophie in
gross, and cast an oblique look upon all its other
parts, This premised, I proceed</p>
            <p>1. The first thing therefore, against which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
is their way of resolving knowledge into its
<hi>first and fundamental Principles;</hi> in that by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Testimony and Judgment of sense in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Philosophie, they do but involve and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
the Principles thereof, under the pretext of a
more abstracted and intellectual discovery of
things: For hereby the minds of men are taken off
from the <hi>native Evidence</hi> of plain and palpable
Truths, and are fain to ground all their knowledge
upon nice and subtle Speculations, whereby, at
least, clear and unquestionable <hi>Truths</hi> are resolved
into <hi>Principles</hi> infinitely more uncertain and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
then themselves. And that the <hi>Platonick</hi> way
of resolving knowledge is justly chargable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
needs no other proof then barely to represent
it. They then suppose that the Truth of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
consists in a conformity to their <hi>Archetypal
Ideas,</hi> whereby they mean some <hi>General Patterns,</hi>
by which all the <hi>Individuals</hi> of each <hi>species</hi> are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
so that to investigate the Nature of things,
we must endeavour to know the Resemblance they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58766:31"/>
have to their <hi>Originals;</hi> and that therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon these, and to consider their agreement
with sensible things, is the onely way to attain a
certain knowledge of the Natures of the things
themselves. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> concludes the
Omniscience of the <hi>first Mind,</hi> from the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that it is furnished with the <hi>Ideas</hi> of all things.
And that Mankind might be in a capacity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Natures of things, he asserts that God
has hang'd a multitude of these little <hi>Pictures</hi> of
himself and all his Creatures in every mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that by attending to them, he might direct
himself in his Conceptions and Notions of the things
themselves; and that herein alone consists
the Nature of true Science;<note place="margin">In Timao.</note> and therefore
the only difference he assignes between Science and
Opinion, is, that the one attends to these unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Ideas, but the other to the uncertain and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
Reports of sense. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place,<note place="margin">In Epist. ad Dionis Amicos.</note> discoursing more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of this Notion; to the Science of
a thing he requires a threefold knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> of
its Name, of its Definition, and of its Picture, which
last he asserts to be the cheif cause of knowledge,
and instances in a Circle, to the true Science
whereof, 'tis necessary that we know by what name
to express it, and then its Definition, that 'tis a
figure, whose parts are every where equally distant
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58766:31"/>
from the Centre; and lastly, that it be represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us by some visible figure; which, sayes he,
gives us a far more solid knowledge of the nature
of a Circle then the other two; and is that which
advances our knowledge from Opinion to Science:
Now (continues he) the same use that these deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neations
have in <hi>Mathematical Theories,</hi> Idea's have
in <hi>Physical Speculations,</hi> as therefore we best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what a Circle is by looking upon its Delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Figure, so the surest knowledge, we can have
of the Natures of things, is gotten by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Ideal Pictures or Images engraven on our
understandings.</p>
            <p>But first, methinks this fetching of Principles
and <hi>Proleptick Notions</hi> out of the mind of Man, is
the same thing, as to anatomise the eye to search
for the first Principles and <hi>Postulata</hi> of Opticks:
For as 'tis the Nature and Office of the Eye to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
and observe those objects with which 'tis
presented, and thence to frame Optical Rules and
Maximes, so 'tis of the mind to speculate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
those things, which are any way conveyed to
its notice, and thence to make general Rules and
Observations, which after an exact scrutiny and
comparison of every individual, are justly admitted
for Proleptick and fundamental Verities: so that
<hi>general Axiomes</hi> are only the results and abridgments
of a multitude of single Experiments; thus from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58766:32"/>
the plain experience and observation of all man-kind
was framed that unquestionable Maxime, <hi>That the
whole is greater then its parts,</hi> because they saw and
found it was so in all individual Bodies in the world,
and the Reason why all men assent to it at the first
proposal, is because they cannot look abroad, but
they are presented with innumerable instances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
every visible thing in the world being a <hi>whole</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of parts sensibly smaller then it self. Now
to what purpose should Providence imprint such
obvious and apparent Notices as this upon the
minds of Men, when as but to open our eyes, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to discover their undoubted Truth and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?
A man that has animadversive Faculties,
has as little need to be minded of such obvious and
apparent Certainties, as a man that has his Eyes in
his head, has to be taught that there is a Sun in the
Heavens. But suppose that we were born with
these congenite Anticipations, and that they take
Root in our very Faculties, yet how can I be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of their Truth and Veracity? For 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but the seeds of Error might have been the
natural Results of my Faculties, as Weeds are the
first and natural Issues of the best Soyles, how then
shall we be sure that these spontaneous Notions are
not false and spurious? Now the only way to be
fully satisfied of their Truth and Sincerity, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
them by a wary and discreet Experience,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58766:32"/>
the Test whereof will remove all ground to doubt
for the future of their Integrity. And if so, to
what purpose do <hi>Connate Principles</hi> serve; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have made Tryal, I cannot use them, because I
have no Reason to trust them, till I can be certain
of their Veracity; which I cannot be, but by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
which yet makes them useless; because
Experimental knowledge is of all others the safest
and most unquestionable, and therefore must needs
render all lesser evidence vain and unnecessary. At
least when our knowledge proceeds in an Empiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
way 'tis solid and palpable, and made so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
certain from the plain and most undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Testimony of Sense and Experience, as unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
to convince <hi>Scepticism</hi> of a pitiful and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Obstinacy. But when we begin our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
from Notions within our selves, besides that
'tis a difficult and nice dispute to prove that the
mind of man is furnished with any such innate <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepses,</hi>
and that we are destitute of any sure <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
to discern Natural Anticipations from Preconcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Custome and Education (unless we bring
them to the Touchstone of Experience) 'tis doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
that Generalites are not capable of so palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and convictive an Evidence, as single and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Observations.<note place="margin">Advancement of Learning. l. 1. c. 5.</note> And therefore
my <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> has well noted it as none
of the least obstructions to the advancement of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58766:33"/>
knowledge, that <hi>Men have sought for Truth in their
own little Worlds, and that withdrawing themselves
from the Contemplation of Nature, and the Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Experience, they have tumbled up and down in
their own Speculations and Conceits; And so have by
continual meditation and agitation of Wit urged, and as
it were, invocated their own Spirits to Divine, and give
Oracles unto them, whereby they have been deservedly
and pleasingly deluded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But secondly, however the case may be as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Innate Notions, the Existence of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Ideas</hi>
is altogether precarious and uncertain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
absolutely unfit to be made the foundation of
all Science, for by them they unanimously under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
real Pictures and Images of things, painted
and carved upon the Mind, rather then Habits,
Thoughts, or Conceptions, and therefore <hi>Plato</hi>
defines them to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
further appears from the grounds from whence they
labour to deduce them; for it is evident, say they,
that the <hi>Eternal Mind</hi> exerted Intellectual Actions
from all Eternity, but because there can be no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection
without an <hi>Intelligible Object,</hi> it must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that there must be <hi>Exemplars</hi> and <hi>Ideal objects</hi>
in the Divine Mind, to terminate the actions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
But to suppose that the understanding cannot
act, unless it be employed about an object really
existing, is not only precarious, but for any thing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58766:33"/>
appears to the contrary, contrary to every mans
Experience, seeing we are all able to create <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera</hi>'s
at pleasure. But though this <hi>Postulatum</hi> were
granted as to created Intellects, yet to tie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Contemplations of the <hi>Divine Mind</hi> to a
pre-existent object, is (beside many other absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities)
not less rash and unwarrantable then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the operations of Omnipotence to the Laws of
Matter and Motion: seeing then there's no tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Evidence to be produced of the Truth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of these <hi>Mental Images,</hi> what can more betray
the cause of Science to the Exceptions of <hi>Scepticks,</hi>
then to resolve its utmost Truth and Evidence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such uncertain and imaginary Principles?</p>
            <p>2. A second Fault, for which they are justly
blameable, is their serious endeavouring to know
and define the Notions of abstracted Essences; for
these pure and Seraphick Intellectualists forsooth
despise all sensible knowledge, as too gross and
material for their nice and curious Faculties, and
disdain to pursue any knowledge, but what is pure
and Intellectual, that is such as is sutable to their
refin'd, and as it were, separated Understandings;
and therefore they cheifly employ their Thoughts
about abstracted and purely Metaphysical Beings;
and thence they take upon them exactly to describe
the meer <hi>Essences</hi> of all sorts of Beings, whether
Material, or Immaterial; whether they belong to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58766:34"/>
the intellectual, or to the sensible World: In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whereto, they resolve all Beings into their sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and unmixt Ingredients, and then attempt to
assigne their precise notions and differences from
each other. Thus they Analyse all Physical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
into ten Principles or Primitive Ingredients;
for first, they supposing that all things, by how much
the less perfect they are, are so much the more
compounded, and then placing Bodies in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
ranck of Beings, they infer that something of
all Superiour Essences must concur to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
so that all Bodies must participate of the
nine Superiour Orders of Beings,<note place="margin">See Patricius's Panarchia, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh Book.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>viz.
Form, Quality, Nature, Soul, Mind, Life,
Essence, Unity, One,</hi> from the mixture
of which, after the four several wayes
of Composition, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Profundity, Latitude, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,
and Solidity results Corporeiety, And
some are so strangely subtle and abstractive, as to
make a real and substantial difference between Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Body. Again, to pass by their several
kinds of immaterial Motion and Harmony, they
make five sorts of Numbers, <hi>Divine,</hi> whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
is Uniformity; <hi>Substantial,</hi> whose Property
is Immobility; <hi>Animarie,</hi> whose Property is a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Self-moving; <hi>Natural,</hi> whose Property is a
Capacity to be moved; <hi>Mathematical,</hi> which is the
common sort, and the grossest of all, because (say
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58766:34"/>
they) it may be deciphred by External figures. But
if they are able to frame a Conception of any Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
besides that which is Mathematical, they have
more faculties then I, who am born but a Man, and
live by the use of my Reason, and five Senses.</p>
            <p>And yet they confidently enough assay to give the
world minute descriptions of these, and such other
nice and subtle Essences. It will be unnecessary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
their particular performances, if I can evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
Convict the Attempt it self of Folly and
Madness, as I presume to you I easily can, Because
I know you are already sufficiently convinced how
fruitless and insignificant these definitions of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical
and abstracted Essences are, for they are
in truth nothing else but notifying that thing by
more words of a narrower signification, which at
other times is signified by a single one of a larger
Import, as if in Arithmetical Accounts, we should
denote one greater summe by many little ones. But
the expressing of a thing by divers words, does not
more unfold its Nature, then when 'tis signed by
one; because the use of Words is not to explaine
the Natures of Things, but only to stand as marks
and signes in their stead, as Arithmetical figures
are only notes of Numbers; and therefore Names
are as unable to explaine abstracted Natures, as
figures are to solve <hi>Arithmetical Problems.</hi> I am
not ignorant that it has been an ancient and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58766:35"/>
Opinion of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> that Names have
in them a natural resemblance and suitableness to
things, and are peculiarly expressive of the several
natures and properties of those things they are used
to represent. But words being meerly several Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications
of sound made by the Organs of Speech,
can have no likeness to any thing but sounds; and
where a word signifies any peculiar sound, it may
have a natural resemblance to it, by giving it a
sound like that which it represents, as <hi>Tintinnabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
and <hi>Clangor,</hi> which words strike the <hi>Organs</hi> of
hearing somewhat after the same manner, as those
things do, of which they are expressive. But to
imagine that any words should carry in them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
to any things besides Noises, is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and groundless conceit; which will evidently
appear by imposing upon words contrary signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and applying them to express things quite
contrary to what they now signifie. For Example,
take the Names, by which <hi>Fire</hi> is expressed in all
Languages, and apply them to <hi>water;</hi> and so on
the contrary, call <hi>Water</hi> by the names of <hi>Fire,</hi> and
you will easily perceive they have no more natural
Correspondency to the one then to the other, and
that the Names of fire have as much agreement
with the Nature and Properties of water, as they
have with the thing they now signifie, and that they
would as well express it, if men would agree to
change their Imposition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58766:35"/>
And therefore I conclude that the office of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
is not to explain the Natures of things, but
to fix and circumscribe the significa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of Words;
for they being Notes of things, unless their signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
be settled, their meaning must needs be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal
and uncertain; that is, unless it be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
of what things such particular Names are
signs, no man shall be able to signifie his Thoughts
to another, because he will use uncertain signs. And
therefore to define Matter, Form, Substance, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
is not to unfold the Intrinsick nature of those
things, of which the names of <hi>Matter, Form, Substance,
Accident</hi> are marks and signs, but only to define
what things I intend to express and signify by these
Names. And unless I have some Idea and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that thing which I call Form or Accident,
Antecedently to my denoting of it by these Names,
they will be altogether insignificant, because I know
not what thing 'tis which they signifie, and the
Names themselves give me no more knowledge of
those things, then <hi>Gas</hi> and <hi>Blas</hi> or any other words
of no defined signification. All which I hope suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
evinces the vanity of Metaphysical definitions
in order to the discovering the hidden Essences of
things. But yet further, we are so far from attaining
any certain and real knowledg of <hi>Incorporeal Beings</hi> (of
an acquaintance with which, these <hi>Visionists</hi> so much
boast) that we are not able to know any thing of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58766:36"/>
               <hi>Corporeal Substances</hi> as abstract from their Accidents.
Ther's nothing can more perplex my Faculties,
then the simple <hi>Idea</hi> of naked matter. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it was never intended that meer Essences should
be the Objects of our Faculties. And therefore the
truely wise and discerning Philosophers do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after the dry and sapless knowledge of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
Natures, but only search after the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Qualities, Vertues and Operations of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Beings; the knowledge whereof may be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Observations and Experiments; but there are
no certain means or rational Methods (that I could
ever yet meet with) to investigate the mysterious
Ideas of bare and abstracted Essences. Besides, all
Beings are either Objects of sence, or not; now to
go about to discover the nature of the former by
metaphysical definitions, would be ridiculous, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are far better understood by our senses.
If any one should ask me, what a Bed-staff or a
Joint-stool is, the only way to acquaint him what
they are, is not to amuse him with fine artificial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
but to shew him the things themselves:
And besides to abstract sensible things from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality,
is to abstract them from themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their very Essences are Material. And then
of them that take upon them to describe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Beings that are not obnoxious to sence, I
demand by what ways and methods they came to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58766:36"/>
that knowledge. For tis not enough to prove that
this or that is the Idea of any thing, because some
fanciful men are able to make pretty <hi>Hypotheses</hi>
concerning it, but if any man have attain'd any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
knowledge thereof, he is able to give a rational
account of the way and method, by which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in his Enquiry. But this these bold definers
neither have, nor can do; but if you will be so ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
as to take their words, they will requite your
Civility by acquainting you with more strange and
stupendious Mysteries. And here (before I conclude
this head) I cannot but proclaim a Quarrel against
the Metaphysicks of the <hi>School-Doctors,</hi> who pretend
too by their definitions to unfold the most hidden and
abstracted Essences of Things, But their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
is a pregnant Argument of the vanity of
their undertaking. For their Vast Volums are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with well nigh nothing, but empty and insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
words, frivolous and confus'd distinctions,
useless and imaginary notions, precarious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
suppositions, senceless and unintelligible
Discourses, and with a deal of such phantastick and
uncouth stuff, as makes Fools stare, and Wise men
laugh: But the Intrinsick Essence of any one Being
is no more explain'd and unsecreted after all their
Labour, then it was afore. This, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
as a recantation of my Errour, or rather
bemoaning my unhappiness, in that I have (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58766:37"/>
to what you once advised me) lost so much time
and industry in these absurd and senceless Authors.
And though this be only to accuse, yet 'tis as easie
a task to make good my charge to the utmost, as 'tis
to make it, but that, because it cannot be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
by an induction of particular instances, would
require a larger Discourse then can be allowed to a

Symbols, Parables, heaps of
Metaphors, Allegories, and all sorts
of Mystical Representations (as is vulgarly known.)
All which upon the account of their Obscurity and
Ambiguity are apparently the unfittest signes in
the world to express the Train of any mans thoughts
to another: For beside that they carry in them no
Intelligible Affinity to the Notices, which they
were design'd to intimate, the Powers of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are so great, and the Instances in which one
thing may resemble another are so many, that there
is scarce any thing in nature, in which the Fancie
cannot find or make a Varietie of such Symbolising
Resemblances; so that Emblems, Fables, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols,
Allegories, though they are prettie <hi>Poetick
Fancies,</hi> are infinitely unfit to express Philosophical
Notions and discoveries of the Natures of things:
and besides, seeing they have left us no key to these
dark <hi>Cyphers,</hi> there can be no sure and constant way
to unriddle what conceptions are lock'd up under
them; so that it does not only require a great deal
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58766:38"/>
of pains to frame conjectures of their mea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing, but
the surest we can pitch upon are withal so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and ambiguous, that they unavoidably leave us
fluctuating in meer uncertainties. And what wife
man will take so much pains for such a knowledge
that can at highest amount but to a doubtful guess?
The truth of it is, they have by these Exorbitances
been highly injurious to the advancement of true
and solid Philosophie; for it needs little less pains
to discover their meaning, then perhaps it would
to have examined the thing it self, and yet when
that is done, we are as far from our end as before.
The end of Philosophie is to search into and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Nature of things, but I believe you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not how the Nature of any thing is at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
by making it the Theme of Allegorical
and dark discourses.</p>
            <p>But I must not too much aggravate this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
upon the <hi>Platonists</hi> in particular, seeing it
has been the Catholick Crime of all the Learned
World. The <hi>Monk of Viterbo</hi> in his Counterfeit
<hi>Berosus</hi> derives this Art of wraping up and unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mysteries at the same time from <hi>Noah,</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
another man would have fetch't its Invention
from the <hi>Oracular Devils,</hi> who taking upon them
to foretel, what they could not foreknow, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to use such shifts to hide their Ignorance.

And from hence they who affected a Title of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
imitated their Oracles, and because they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to explain those secrets, which were above
the reach of their Inquisition, that they might not
discover their ignorance instead of their knowledge,
they wrapt up their Mysteries in dark and aenigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

methinks I may dare to add the same Censure of

seem to be of a very quarrelsome Humour, and to
have a huge ambition to be esteemed the Polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Scripturients of the Age; whereas I have been
scared from Engaging with a <hi>Rosie-Crucian,</hi> ever
since I first saw the Controversial Rencountres of
<hi>Eugenius Philalethes;</hi> and besides, (to confess my
fears to you) I know not but the Romantick Heroes
of this Order may have retreiv'd the lost Invention
of Enchanted Arms, especially that lovely Fairie
Knight descended (as the Romance of his Life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates

            <p>But 'tis more fitting that these <hi>Pedantick Cheats</hi>

directly Poison mens minds, and dispose them to

there is so much Affinity between <hi>Rosi-Crucianisme</hi>
and <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> that whoever entertains the one,

And what Pestilential Influences the Genius of
<hi>Enthusiasme</hi> or opinionative Zeal has upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace, is so evident from Experience, that it
needs not be prov'd from Reason. To conclude,
I am confident, that from the beginning of time to
this day, there has not been so great a Conjunction
of Ignorance with Confidence, as in these Fellows,
which certainly of all other Aspects is the most
contrary and malignant to true knowledge.</p>
            <p>4. My next Accusation is, that instead of pure and
genuine Reason, they abound so much with gaudy
and extravagant Phancies. I that am too simple
or too serious to be cajol'd with the frenzies of a
bold and ungovern'd Imagination cannot be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to think the Quaintest plays and sportings of
wit to be any true and real knowledge. I can easily
allow their Discourses the Title of <hi>Philosophical
Romances,</hi> (a sort of more ingenious impertinencies)
and 'tis with this estimate I would have them read:
But when they pretend to be Natures Secretaries,
&amp; to understand all her Intrigues, or to be Heavens
Privadoes, talking of the Transactions there, like
men lately drop'd thence encircled with <hi>Glories,</hi> and
cloathed with the Garments of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias,</hi> and
yet put us off with nothing but rampant Metaphors,
and Pompous Allegories, and other splendid but
empty Schemes of speech, I must crave leave to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58766:41"/>
account them (to say no worse) Poets &amp; Romancers
true Philosophie is too sober to descend to these wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of Imagination, and too Rational to be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them. She scorns, when shee is in chase of
Truth, to quarry upon trifling gaudy Phantasms:
Her Game is things not words. I shall not presume
to censure <hi>Plato's</hi> Stile for its being too Pompous &amp;
Poetick, though this has been done already by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,
Dionysius Halicarnasseus, Vossius,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of the <hi>Critical Art.</hi> Only I remember I had
not long conversed with Platonick Authors, when
I took occasion to set it down as a note to my self,
that though a huge lushious stile may relish sweet to
childish and liquorish Fancies, yet it rather loaths
and nauceats a discreet understanding, then informs
and nourishes it. That <hi>Platonisme</hi> is almost nothing
but an Allegorie, is too notorious to want a proof,
<hi>Plato</hi>'s two famous Dialogues, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Symposium</hi>
and his <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> ranked by <hi>Ficinus</hi> among his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
and Theological Treatises, treat of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Love and Beauty, and of them too in
Poetick Schemes and Fables. 'Tis pretty to read
their Metaphysical Discourses of Truth, which are
nothing else but <hi>Love-stories.</hi> The soul being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour'd
with the transcendent Beauty and Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of Truth is enflamed with impatient desires
of enjoying her embraces, and therefore Wooes
and Courts her with indefatigable Patience, for she
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58766:41"/>
must be supposed (as all other Beauties are) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
coy and difficult, but by diligence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
the understanding wins and enjoys her;
And then they express their embraces in the same
language, they would speak of the private trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
between Man and Wife. Thus (you see) they
have the main Propertie of <hi>Romaneers</hi> to talk much
of Love. And indeed <hi>Plato</hi> himself seems to have
been the first Author of <hi>Amorous Romances,</hi> for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the beginning of his <hi>Convivium</hi> he chides the
Poets, that lived before him, for their Omissions in
reference to Love, and that when they had made
Panegyricks of all the other Gods. None of them
had ever attempted an Elogie upon This.</p>
            <p>Now to Discourse of the Natures of Things in
Metaphors and Allegories is nothing else but to
sport and trifle with empty words, because these
Schems do not express the Natures of Things, but
only their Similitudes and Resemblances, for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors
are only words, which properly signifying
one thing, are apply'd to signifie another by reason of
some Resemblance between them. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any thing is express'd by a Metaphor or Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,
the thing it self is not expressed, but only
some similitude observ'd or made by Fancy. So
that Metaphors being only the sportings of Fancy
comparing things with things, and not marks or
signes of Things. All those Theories in Philosophie
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58766:42"/>
which are expressed only in metaphorical Termes,
are not real Truths, but the meer Products of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
dress'd up (like Childrens <hi>babies</hi>) in a few
spangled empty words, such as the Greeks call
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> empty Phraseologies that have not Notion
&amp; Thing enough to fill them out. Thus their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
&amp; luxuriant fancies climbing up into the Bed of
Reason, do not only defile it by unchast and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
Embraces, but instead of real conceptions
and notices of Things, impregnate the mind with
nothing but Ayerie and Subventaneous Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes.</p>
            <p>But 'tis still more fantastick and absurd to talke
metaphorically concerning those things, of whose
Ideas we are utterly ignorant, &amp; of which we are not
able to discourse in Proper Terms, for such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
must needs be Non-sence, and the matter
of it must needs be nothing; because they treat of
they know not what. For Metaphors not signifying
things, and things being always signified by proper
Termes, what can be more evident then that meer
Metaphors without proper Terms are employed
about nothing at all, or only an Imaginary some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And they that talk thus, do but first ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
a Subject, and then imagine in it some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances
to something else, that is in effect, they
make a bauble, and then play with it. Of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(to give you one Instance) are the greatest
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58766:42"/>
part of their discourses concerning the Soul, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoursing
of which, they draw Metaphors from all
the Senses, Members, and Functions of the Body,
from all the General Hypotheses of Nature; from
all the Phaenomena of the Heavens and the Earth,
from all the several Properties and Operations of
the several species of Creatures, and apply them to
the Nature, Faculties, and operations of the Soul;
But because they are altogether ignorant of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and substance of the Soul, and are not able to
express the greatest part of these things by proper
terms; all these Metaphors must pass for idle and
insignificant Non-sense, because they signifie we
know not what, and describe we know not how;
so that methinks the <hi>Platonick Philosophie</hi> is just such
another thing as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> fancy the world to
be, a Mass of pretty words handsomely and luckily
pack't together; I must confess that before I had
examined it, by reason of its huge Tumid words,
I look't upon it at a distance, as the loftiest and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limest
knowledge in the world, but when I came
to survey it more closely, I soon found that it was
nothing else but words, so that I may more hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
compare it to a Landskip, in which at a
distance appear huge Rocks, and vast Mountaines,
that seem to vie height with, and out-reach the
Clouds, and yet by a nearer approach these vast
bulky Appearances are found to be nothing but a few
Artificial Shadows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:58766:43"/>
5. Another miscarriage is, that they employ
much of their Contemplations in things altogether
uncertain and unsearchable. They delight exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
to wander into remote and invisible Notions,
and to talk confidently (as Travellers into forreign
Regions are wont to do) of doubtful and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Problems, and any thing which is as far distant
from Humane discovery, as concernment. Which
scopeless desire of searching into things exempt from
humane Inquisition, is that which renders Curiosity
Criminal; For Curiosity it self is a gallant and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical
Quality, and the natural Product of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Complexion, but when it aspires after the
knowledge of things placed above its Reach, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates
into a vain and fruitless Ambition, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an unnatural lust of the mind after strange and
extravagant Notions. Though the Truth of it is,
The minds (or rather fancies) of men have such a
natural liquorishness after the knowledge of things
strange and remote, that they swallow nothing with
so grateful a Gusto, as stories of things rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual;
neither care they how uncertain and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
they be, so they be but odd and prodigious;
and hence it comes to pass, that men are generally
more tickled and enchanted with <hi>Legends</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,</hi>
then with useful and remarkable <hi>Memories.</hi>
Which (they say) is the Reason why the Ancients
made so much use of Fables and Apologues to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58766:43"/>
the People, because they carried in them
something monstrous, and exceeding the limits of
Probability. The senseless multitude, that could
not rellish the wise Discourses of <hi>Socrates,</hi> would
be much taken and surprised with a pretty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Tale of a Lyon, an Ape, or a Fox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But not to aggravate this Childishness of these dull
and muddy Souls. 'Tis an unpardonable Luxury
and Wantonness for Wise and considering Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
to spend their time and study to disclose
distant and inscrutable Mysteries, and frontlesly to
dictate to the world in such Theories, as are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
remote from humane knowledge and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and which 'tis as impossible to know, as it would
be if they had never been. And that the <hi>Platonists</hi>
are of all men most chargeable with this folly, these
few ensuing instances may demonstrate. As when
they confidently take upon them to give the world
exact and minute descriptions of Incorporeal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
To give an account of the Nature and Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of the God-head, and how the several Ranks
of Ideas are suspended upon the three <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Uniform Hypostases,</hi> to pry into the most hidden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of the Divine Mind, and distinctly to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neate
how the Ideas of all Created Perfections are
there displayed. To discourse about the Substance,
Nature, Properties, Offices, Actions, Orders, and
Polities of Angels: To assert that the Heavenly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58766:44"/>
Host is divided into three Hierarchies, and that each
Hierarchie is subdivided into three Orders, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Order into as many Legions, as there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
Individuals in every Legion, <hi>i. e.</hi> 6666; and
that this Ternary of Hierarchies, and Norary of
Orders do Circulate about the three-fold Essence
of God, (as the Planets about the Sun) with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
other the like Dreams about their peculiar
Natures, Offices, Distances, and Employments:<note place="margin">See Proclus in Plat. Theolog. l. 4. c. 19.</note>
And withall to pretend to demonstrative
Evidence in these things. Again, when
they confidently assert the <hi>First Mind</hi> to
be the onely Author of Souls; and that humane
Souls were temper'd in the same <hi>Vessel,</hi> where the
Soul of the Universe had been wrought; and that
they were made out of some remaining fragments
of that mixture out of which the Gods of the second
and third <hi>Classis</hi> had been framed; That the <hi>First
Mind</hi> had deputed the <hi>Genii</hi> or <hi>Iunior Deities</hi> Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
of his <hi>Of-spring;</hi> and that it is they, that
Marry them to their Respective <hi>Vehicles.</hi> When
they define whether the <hi>Apostate Genii</hi> be purely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material;
and whether they be vitally united with
matter; and whether they were made peccable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by union with their <hi>Vehicles;</hi> whether any of the
<hi>Aerial Spirits</hi> be <hi>Atheists</hi> or no, whether any of
them be of a sportive, droling humour, and delight
to effect Antick Prodigies in the Aire, to abuse and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58766:44"/>
affright silly Mortals; How they change Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and discourse together. When they deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the Cosmographie of the <hi>Archetypal World,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
with the Immaterial Ideas of all mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Beings; and describe the <hi>Systeme</hi> of the Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Heavens. When they frame particular <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses,</hi>
not onely of the nature of the Soul, but of
the manner of its living, before its lapse into this
life, and after its return home again. Lastly, when
they Graphically describe the manner of the worlds
last and final Conflagration: I might add too their
<hi>Hypotheses</hi> about the manner of the worlds Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
for unless they had been Spectators, it was
not possible for them to know in what way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
the Universe was Erected; that depending
wholly on the free Election of the Divine Will:
Though some Learned Men have thought it a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Confirmation of the Truth of the Mosaick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
if they could but evince a consonancy of any of
the, <hi>Philosphers Hypotheses</hi> with the Mosaick Account
of the Origine of the Universe; as if their naked
surmises could give any Testimony to Truth: For
either they received the Account they give, from a
credible Tradition, and if so, then <hi>Moses</hi> was the
first Author thereof, for none else could give any
certain Account of the Process, Providence was
pleased to use in the Production of things, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
tis no Argument of the Truth of the Mosaick
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58766:45"/>
Account, because the <hi>Iews</hi> told it to the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and they to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> for this can adde no
Authority or Evidence to it: Or else they were of
their own framing, and consequently were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
groundless and unwarrantable Conjectures;
for it was surely impossible any mans Reason should
tell him the particular Circumstances of the worlds
Creation; as that its material Principle was a <hi>Tohu</hi>
and a <hi>Bohu,</hi> that it was agitated by the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that several Portions were form'd at several
times, that all was finished in six days space, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then five or seven, and the like: this designe
therefore of discovering a Consonancy between the
Hypotheses of any of the Philosophers concerning
the Origine of the Universe, and the Mosaick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thereof, is absolutely scopeless and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
But this is a digression that has thrust its
self in here before I was aware of it. To resume
therefore my former Theme, is it not the highest
and most disingenuous madness for men to give such
confident and definitive sentences in matters so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and unaccountable? All the forementioned
particulars (to which it were easie to add a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
more) are apparently beyond the reach of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Cognisance, and such things as cannot be
known but by Revelation, there being no other
means to attain to any knowledge of things of
their vast distance and remoteness. And if we
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58766:45"/>
will but reflect upon our own Thoughts, we must
confess that we cannot perceive the Ideas of Beings
that are not placed within the Horizon of Sense,
and those that pretend to a discovery of them, had
better pretend to Oracles, Prophesies, Illapses,
and Divinations, then to the sober and steady Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes
of Philosophie. And therefore 'tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
with the <hi>Platonists</hi> to pretend to a kind of
Enthusiasme. They stile themselves <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the
inspired Priests of Truth; and their Philosophie
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as if it had been poured into them in
a Divine and Extatical Fury, and <hi>Proclus</hi> says it
a thousand times of <hi>Plato</hi> and his Commentators,
that they did <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if they had written with
a kind of <hi>Bacchical Enthusiasme;</hi> And they every
where talk so like Prophets and Oracles, as if they
were inspired at least by a <hi>Bath-Col:</hi> And 'tis huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasant to read their own Exorbitant Parades of
the Exalted, Divine, and Extatick sublimity of
Platonick Contemplation; they boast so often of
sequestring themselves from all Corporeal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and soaring up into the Ethereal Regions,
that a man would expect News from the third
Heaven every day. If they were in good earnest,
we might expect strange discoveries indeed, but
alas, these Sons of Imagination are as little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with <hi>Real Extasies,</hi> as other men, onely they
are pleased to express the Frenzies of their fiery and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58766:46"/>
subtle Fancies by these Allusions. So that let them
talk never so Seraphically of retiring from the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
and common Entertainments of sense, they do
but sit down in the Theatre of Fancy, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themselves with the <hi>Idola Specus,</hi> or Images of
their own Complexion, and though they take them
for great Realities, (as other Sleepers do their
Dreams) yet when they awake out of their fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Visions, and return to a strength and consistency
of Reason, they then discern them to have been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evanid Appearances represented (as all Dreams
are) upon the Scene of Imagination.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis a great mistake of some men to think
it necessary that we should be able to confute such
vain and ungrounded Positions; and that for this
Reason, because they are out of the Sphear of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
knowledge; for though they may sometimes
perchance, like the <hi>Cartesian Vortices,</hi> justle with
some certain Truths belonging to our Sphear by
reason of their Vicinity, yet that happens by chance,
and is not necessary: But being in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
out of our View, 'tis not to be expected we
should give any account of them, because that
would be to assert what we cannot know, which is
to commit the very fault we are now chastising;
'tis therefore sufficient to shew the absurdity of an
assertion, if I can evince it to be unevident, though I
can not to be untrue, for it is not less unbecoming a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58766:46"/>
Wise man to assent to an uncertainty than to an
untruth: because 'tis not the real certainty of a
Truth, that is a sufficient motive of our assent, but
its evidence to us; for all Truths are in themselves
equally certain (though not equally necessary and
durable) but 'tis from the variety of evidence that
the difference of our knowledge proceeds; and
howsoever assertions may be in themselves real and
certain Truths, yet unless they are evident as
well as certain, they will be to us vain and fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Phantasms. And therefore I cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
this one <hi>Paradox</hi> of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> That a Wise
man is always free from Opinion, Ignorance, and
Error: From Opinion, because he will not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to uncertainties: from Ignorance, because
what he knows not, he knows that he knows it
not, and so has as much knowledge of the thing,
as he is capable of: from Error, because he that
will neither assent to what is uncertain, and knows
what is to be known, and what not, can scarce be
liable to mistakes. And it was none of the least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Wisdom and Modesty, that he
made it one of his cheifest <hi>Physiological Canons,</hi> that
he had nothing to do with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
meerly Possible, and meerly Contingent;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was alwayes wont to state and conclude all
Questions about the Phaenomena of the Heavens,
and all other remote and unevident Enquiries,
with nothing else but <hi>It may be so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:58766:47"/>
Besides in such cases any man may assert whatever
a warm or giddy Brain may suggest, and we shall
have equal inducements to embrace contrary Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses;
thus as <hi>Mahomet</hi> has somewhere in his
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> described the Systeme of the invisible
Heavens, the Orders of Angels, &amp; the several Folds,
in which their several Choruses reside, as well as
<hi>Plato,</hi> so I have as great Reason to induce me to
credit the <hi>Mahometan Hypothesis</hi> as the <hi>Platonick.</hi>
And then (to dispatch) we are not concern'd in such
cases to shew the vanity of the Assertion (for that
we suppose impossible) but that of the Assertor,
whom we blame for acting so much against all the
Rules of Reason, in affirming that, which 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
impossible for him to know; whereby he
both troubles the world with debates equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
and endless, and obstructs the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of True Knowledge, by diverting those that
are in quest after it, into dark, dubious, and endless
Traverses: And certainly among the many things
that have been hindrances to the discovery of Truth,
none seem to have been of a more unhappy and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Influence, then that men have been generally
digging for it, where its veins lie too deep, and out
of the fathome of humane Industrie.</p>
            <p>Now if this one Caution against dogmatizing
in matters remote and unevident were well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed,
it would not only prove an effectual An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58766:47"/>
against many thousand pestilent controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
that infest the world, but also a deadly Bane
to the Platonick Philosophie; for if in reading the
Platonists, you shall as you proceed, but ask them
for a rational evidence of their magisterial dictates
(especially in those things which they boast of as
their sublimest speculations) and resolve that you
will not make them matters of opinion, 'till they
shall have given you some rational inducements
so to do, I will engage you shall never be one of
their Disciples, though you should study them to
the revolution of their Great Year.</p>
            <p>Before I take my leave of this Consideration,
I cannot but note that this Impudent humour of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
confidently of things uncertain and widely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from humane Cognizance was the peculiar
crime of the first and earliest <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church. Thus the main of the Heretical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> and the several sub-dividing
Factions of them, <hi>Valentinians, Saturnilians, Basili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
and other primitive Hereticks were only some
extravagant Hypotheses concerning the Divinity,
and its Essential Emanations, and their several <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zigiae,</hi>
and <hi>Pleromata,</hi> out of which they framed a
peculiar Oeconomie of the Godhead, compounding
the Divine Nature out of a multitude of Orders
and Individuals (you may fancy it such a kind of
Monster, as the Picture of Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s <hi>Leviathan.</hi>)
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58766:48"/>
And this they did by blending some Fancies out of
<hi>Plato,</hi> and Fables out of <hi>Hesiods</hi> Theogonia with the
Gospel of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> as the Fathers unanimously
conclude. And as 'tis reported of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
that he endeavoured to compound a Religious
Worship out of the Rites of Paganisme, and the
Sacraments of Christianity; so 'tis manifest that the
<hi>Gnosticks</hi> would have integrated one System of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
by mingling the <hi>Orphean, Pythagorean,</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi>
Theologie with the Doctrines of the Gospel.
Of this sort of men and their Doctrines all the more
learned Commentators understand the frequent
cautions of the Apostles against Heresies and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and peculiarly that eminent passage, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 8.
where the Apostle warns them against <hi>Philosophie
and vain deceit, after the Tradition of men, after the
Rudiments of the world,</hi> i. e. a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a false
knowledge that pretends to know the highest my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
upon the naked Assertions of some confident
men. And of these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the several emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Godhead do they understand those fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentions 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4. so that
the Hereticks, the Apostles speak of, were only giddy
and opinionative men, that took upon them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
the Opinions of the Philosophers into the
Christian Faith: For which reason it was that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
stiled the Philosophers <hi>Hereticorum Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
because from them were borrowed the greatest
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58766:48"/>
part of Heretical Opinions. Thus the Learned
<note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. de vita &amp; scriptis Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Holstenius</hi> has made a Parallel between the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gorean</hi>
and <hi>Manichean</hi> Principles. And
<hi>Iohannes Baptista Crispus</hi> in his discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinions, has at the end
of every Chapter shewn what Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
sprung from each Opinion. In this Notion of
Heresie the School-Doctors will prove as Arch-Hereticks
as any of the Ancients, for they have in
the same manner corrupted the simplicity and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Christian Religion, by blending the Placits
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> with the Articles of Faith, as <hi>Manes</hi>
and <hi>Valentinus</hi> did by mingling with the Christian
Faith, the Philosophy of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> And
then they have filled their vast Volumns with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and nice Hypotheses made out of this mixture,
out of which are of necessity generated an infinite
number of idle and unprofitable Altercations, or as
(as my <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> prettily stiles them) <hi>Vermiculate
Questions,</hi> because they are generated from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction
of ture and solid knowledge, like worms
from putrified substances: though perhaps they
may ere long deserve that Epithete upon another
score. I might have added to them the late grand
Dogmatical Master of Orthodoxy, whose rude
Dogmatising has occasioned as many Controversies
in the Christian Church, as ever <hi>Manes</hi> or <hi>Valentinus</hi>
did. The result of all this is to direct to the true
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58766:49"/>
Apostolical Notion of Heresie, which is not so
much an Opinion that is apparently false, as one that
is groundless and unwarrantable, and so naturally
tends to the creating unnecessary disputes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Factions and Divisions, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaks of
the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ennead 2. lib. 9.</note> that they were <hi>Inventors of
new and vain Opinions, to no other end then
the erecting of a peculiar Sect.</hi> And though most of
the Primitive Heresies were false and impious, as
well as rash and ungrounded, yet that which gave
them their denomination, was their vanity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to create mischeivous and destructive
Schismes. The way then to prevent Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
and to avoid Schisms, is not to define, but si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
groundless and dividing Opinions. The
Church should in such cases imitate <hi>Socrates</hi>'s <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
that never gave any positive Answer, but as
oft as it was consulted answered either <hi>No,</hi> or <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi>
because they are usually started about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
uncertain, and consequently undeterminable.
So that when both Parties determine contrary to
each other, and upon that separate, they are both
equally Schismaticks, because they both divide upon
insufficient and unwarrantable grounds. For instance
(to pass by that early and unhappy <hi>Quartodecimarian</hi>
Schism.) In that grand Schism of the <hi>Greek Church</hi>
from the <hi>Romane,</hi> though the latter was notoriously
Schismatical, yet the former was not altogether
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58766:49"/>
guiltless: for although they had Reasons sufficient
to warrant a secession from the Romanists; as the
Popes usurpation in challenging a Power to impose
on them new Articles of Faith, and putting of this
Tyranny into practise, by requiring of all that
would be Members of the Romane Communion,
to receive his addition of the <hi>Filioque</hi> into their
Creeds: Now (I say) had they divided only for
the maintaining their own Liberty against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Encroachments, and for not admitting the
addition of <hi>Filioque</hi> as an Article of Faith,
their separation had been just and noble. But
when they stood as obstinately on the other side,
as the Romanists did, and would not admit
of an Union, but upon Condition, that it might be
received as an Article of Faith, that the Holy
Ghost proceeded from the <hi>Father only,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be cleared of a Schismatical division. Now
if instead of being dogmatical in both these contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Extreams, both Parties had agreed to silence
the Controversie and decide it neither way, as
Truth would not have been less secur'd, so Peace
would have been much better preserved. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
therefore in the words of a late Learned
and Judicious Divine. <hi>If the Church had stopt
and damn'd up the Originals and Springs of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
rather then by the determining for the one part,
to give them as it were a Pipe and Conduit to convey
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58766:50"/>
them to Posterity, I perswade my self the Church had not
suffered that inundation of Opinions, with which at this
day it is over-run.</hi>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58766:50"/>

be valid, will fall foul upon <hi>Moses</hi> himself. Which
farther compleatly excuses his Rashness, seeing
he delivered his Theological Theories, not from
his own Fancy, but derived them from so good
and sure an Authority, as <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
And that he did so is the unanimous consent of all
the learned world: Fathers, School-Doctors, and

one Principle then this: <gap reason="foreign">

is now become as vulgar and trivial as a Proverb.
The particular account they give hereof, is this,
That <hi>Plato</hi> derived many of these Mysteries from
<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who in his Travels into Aegypt and the
East had either immediately received them from
the Jewes themselves, or from the Aegyptian Priests,
and the Chaldean Wise men, who came to know
them by Converse with, and Tradition from the
Jewes. And that <hi>Plato</hi> himself travelling into Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
in quest after knowledge, received his choicest
and most important notices concerning Divine and
Supernatural things from the Jewes, who about
that time in great flocks resorted thither, or from
the Egyptian Priests, who either derived them from
the Mosaick writings, or received them from the
Jewes by an Oral Tradition. For (say they) God
delivered to <hi>Moses</hi> in Mount Sinai a twofold Law,

                  <hi>Vocal Law,</hi> which is the Mystical and Enigmatical
meaning of the Former, but by reason of its extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
sacredness was not exposed to the rude Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but only whispered and conveyed in the slender
Pipe of Auricular Tradition from age to age among
the great Sanhedrim and the Prophets down to the
time of <hi>Esdras,</hi> by whom (and the great Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
of which many of the latter Prophets were
members) it was committed to writing, least by
reason of their frequent dispersions and captivities
it should by some ill fortune perish: which carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its stream out of the private Channel, in which
it run before, and soon spread it abroad among

where great numbers of Jews resided. For an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Egyptians, from whom <hi>Plato</hi> and his Followers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that clear and full knowledge thereof, which
appears so much every where in their Writings.</p>
               <p>To all which I answer in these ensuing Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>1. That it is so far from being matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
that it is rather a disparagement to have
been conversant in, and borrowed from the old
Eastern and Egyptian Learning. That the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58766:51"/>
Sages of Egypt and the East were acquainted
with the first Rudiments of Mathematical Sciences
is evident from the most authentick Records of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Times, &amp; from that skill, which the Grecians
gained among them. But it is as evident that all
their Theological Learning was lamentably frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
obscure, fabulous, uncouth, magical and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious.
The Scythian Tarabostesci, the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Magi, the Indian Brachmans and Gymnoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phists,
the Egyptian Priests, the Bards and Druids
of Gaul and Brittain, and other Ancient Sects have
(I confess) made a great noise in the world, yet
they that endeavour to celebrate them most, tell us
so many Superstitious and Pedantick stories, as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
evince them to have been no very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Persons. Any one that considers those few
Opinions and Ratiocinations of theirs that are still
extant, will easily conclude them to have been men
of no great Reason or Judgment. Some have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to maintain the Credit of this Ancient
Learning by retreiving and collecting its scattered
Fragments, and others by counterfeiting supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
Authors, such as <hi>Zoroaster</hi> and <hi>Hermes Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus,</hi>

<hi>Zoroaster</hi>'s Oracles, the Books of <hi>Trismegist,</hi> the
Writings of <hi>Psellus,</hi> and the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Mirandula</hi>'s
Riddles, with which he challenged all the Learned
world, will need no other proof of the Vanity of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58766:52"/>
all pretences to the more abstruse and mystical
Learning of the Antients. I do not question but
that great and honourable Personage I last mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
was a Person of stupendious Parts and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet I am sure that those Notions, wherewith
he made the greatest Noise in the world, were but
grand and pompous Futilities.</p>
               <p>The Old <hi>Egyptian</hi> Learning was so Famous,
that the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Act. 7. 22. 1 King. 4. 29, 30.</note> sets forth the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of <hi>Moses</hi>'s knowledge by his skill in
it, &amp; the matchlesness of <hi>Solomons</hi> Wisdom
by its exceeding it; And therefore I conclude that
it was conversant about more generous and more
useful Notices then afterwards; such as <hi>Geometry,
Astronomy, Policy, Physick,</hi> and other resembling
Arts, which either were perfective of their Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Faculties, or did minister to the uses and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of Nature: as is generally reported
by all Ancient Historians. But had the Pristine
Learning of <hi>Egypt</hi> been the same it was in latter
Ages, it had been as great a disparagement to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
as 'tis now justly reputed a commendation,
that he was accomplished in all the <hi>Egyptian</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and had amounted only to this, that he was
a vain, trifling, superstitious Fellow. And what
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest objected to the Greeks, that
they were always Children, might be more truly
applied to themselves, if it be the property of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58766:52"/>
to value trifles. What childish fooleries their
Hieroglyphicks were, Learned Men now prove
from the lost labour and fruitless industry of <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
Oedipus Aegyptiacus.</hi> CertaSinly, if they had
design'd to abuse and debauch this humour, they
could scarce have contrived more fond and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Emblems; and indeed their courseness and
unlikeness to the things they should resemble, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
discover them to have been but the rude Essays
of a barbarous and undisciplined Fancy. The
truth of it is, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> seem to have had onely
knowledge enough, to know that their neighbours
had none at all, and cunning enough to vaunt an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
into strange and abstruse Mysteries, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that others by reason of their Ignorance could
not controule them, and by reason of their credulity
would be very apt to credit them, and thence they
continually abused the credulous Grecians with
Tales and Fables. And surely the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest
took not a little secret pleasure,<note place="margin">In Platonis Timaeo.</note> when he
perceived Old <hi>Solon</hi> to entertain his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
and Legendary account of Ancient Times
with so much greediness and satisfaction; unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
himself had been imposed upon by earlier Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers,
for I fancy the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests to have
been such another generation of men, as our Monks
were in the darkest times of Popery, who believed as
well as recorded those Legends, which earlier Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58766:53"/>
had Coined. So that if the ancient Sages of
<hi>Greece</hi> had purchased no more knowledge by their
Travels into <hi>Egypt,</hi> then those few remainders of
<hi>Egyptian</hi> learning still upon Record (excepting a few
Mathematical Theories) they had spent their time
and pains to as little purpose, as the famous Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of <hi>Odcomb,</hi> who footed most parts of the known
world to no other purpose, then to describe his Hosts
Beard or Sign-Post. I might here also give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the mean abilities of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
but I delight not to speak too hardly of any <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoso</hi>'s
Ashes, and therefore I forbear: For it is not
my design, by representing these Primitive sages as
fools and dunces to rob them of that esteem and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
with which they have been deservedly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in all succeeding Ages, for though it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that their knowledge was much inferiour to that
of latter Ages, (for Learning being then in its Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
must needs be Childish, but is since grown more
solid and manly) yet it is but reasonable they should
be allowed bigger Proportions of Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
not only because they were very wise Men,
considering the rudeness and ignorance of the times,
in which they lived, but because they were the first
founders and discoverers of that knowledge, which
after Ages have but improved, and the world surely
is much more beholding to those that first invent
useful Arts and Sciences, than to those that onely
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58766:53"/>
improve them; it is therefore just, they should be
allowed greater Glory, though they had much less
knowledge then their followers. Besides, <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi>
speculations met with the latest and slowest
improvements, and therefore those that might have
considerable skill in other Theories, might be (as
indeed they were) barbarously ignorant in these.</p>
               <p>2. I perceive not any such clear Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Platonick Philosophie</hi> and the Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
as may give us any tolerable ground of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the one to have been derived from the other:
For most of the Notions, in which <hi>Plato</hi> speaks most
consonantly to the Scriptures, are so obvious and so
universally acknowledged, that it is easie to discern
how he came by them, without any acquaintance
with the holy Writings: such as are the Being of
God, the Immortality of the Soul, the Essential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Good and Evil, some general Rules of
Natural and Essential Goodness. Thus his Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against the Grecian Idolatry and Superstition
must by all means be transcribed from the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Writings, and when in the <hi>Eighth Book</hi> of his Laws,<note place="margin">V. Collium de animab. Pagan. l. 5. c. 17. 25. Clem. Alex. Strom. 1. Euseb. prepar. Evang. l. 11, 12.</note>
he enjoyns Solemn Festivals
in honour of the Gods, he must needs
have it from the fourth Commandment
of the Decalogue, and when in the <hi>Tenth
Book,</hi> he declaims against Irreverence in Divine
Worship, he must by all means borrow it from the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58766:54"/>
second Precept, and when in his <hi>Eleventh Book</hi> he
treats of honour due from Children to their Parents,
he must doubtlesly have read the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the like in other Instances. Whereas the
natural reasonableness of these Principles is in it self
so apparently clear &amp; evident, that they could scarce
escape the observation of any rational and inquisitive
man; and therefore <hi>Plato</hi>'s lighting upon them is no
more an Argument, that he was conversant in the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Writings, then is his saying that the Sun is
the brightest Star in the Firmament. And then as for
their more hidden and abstruse mysteries, where they
seem to agree most, their difference is greater then
their agreement; and it would not be difficult to
shew how these Notions, which have the fairest
Consonancy to Scripture, are derived from <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
that have none at all, as I shall anon evince in
the Article of the Trinity. And shall in the Interim
shew the infirmity and vanity of this conceit, by
shewing the weakness of that Authority, upon
which it is grounded.</p>
               <p>The first time then, that I met with it, was in
Modern Authors, who vouch'd the Authority of
the Primitive Fathers for it, betaking my self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to them, I found some of them to aver it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
with no small earnestness, especially <hi>Clemens
Alexandrinus, Eusebius, Theodoret,</hi> but upon no better
grounds, then the naked assertions of two or three
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58766:54"/>
                  <hi>Iews</hi> (especially <hi>Cleobulus</hi> and <hi>Iosephus</hi>) and that,
when contending about the Glories and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of their own Nation, in which Controversie
men of all Nations are apparently partial for their
own, but none so grossly as the Jews; who would
have their Nation the only Fountain of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and wisdom (as if all other men had been
meer Mushromes, and had not reason enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon and observe the natures and properties of
Things) and therefore <hi>Aristobulus</hi> (the
first Founder and Foundation of this
Conceit) does with the same Confidence maintain
that the Peripatetick Philosophie was stoln out of
<hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,<note place="margin">Apud Clem Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. Strom. 5.</note> as that the Fancies of <hi>Plato</hi>
and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> were taken thence. There are perhaps
one or two obsolete <hi>Grecian</hi> Testimonies produced
on the behalf of this Opinion, but I shall not be at
the pains critically to examine their weight and
authority, because I have as great a suspition of all
those obsolete records concerning the <hi>Iewish Nation</hi>
cited by some Ancient Authors, as I have of their
<hi>Sibillan Prophecies</hi> and other confessed Impostures,
in that most of them discover their own Forgery:

                  <hi>The Chaldeans and Hebrews alone are Professors of true

neither of them so honest or so simple, as thus open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to commend the <hi>Iewish Religion</hi> and condemn

from <hi>Persia,</hi> but no account of their <hi>Cargo
from Iudaea.</hi> And <hi>Lactantius</hi> justly and seriously
chides with the Ancient Philosophers, because they
neglected to trade with the Jewes for <hi>wisdome,</hi> as well
as other Nations.<note place="margin">De verâ Sap. cap. 2.</note>

There are indeed some <hi>conjectures</hi> to make
it probable that the <hi>Grecians</hi> might confound <hi>Iudea</hi>
with <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> which if true, 'tis a good Argument
that they had very little knowledge of it; for 'tis
not likely that any, who conversed with the <hi>Iewish

when there was so vast not only difference but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety

Customes, &amp; Laws being of so peculiar a constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

supposed but that those who so carefully observed
the Laws and Customes of <hi>Forreign Nations,</hi> as the
<hi>Grecian Philosophers</hi> did, should have taken a more
signal and particular Notice of the <hi>Iewish Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
if they had been acquainted with them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all which, let me add that we find as great a
consonancy of the opinions of the <hi>Wise men</hi> of other
Nations with the <hi>Hebrew Writings,</hi> where there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
no foot-steps of commerce between them, as
of the Grecians. For instance, though <hi>Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius</hi>
is generally acknowledged the first <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
(being more ancient then <hi>Pythagoras</hi>) yet there is
not the least appearance of any commerce between
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58766:56"/>
him and the Jewes. And therefore when Mr <hi>Selden</hi>
thinks that if those 7 Books of Wisdome

really his, that he was probably not unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Discipline of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> only because
<hi>Cassius Hemina</hi> and <hi>C. Piso</hi> in <hi>Plinie</hi> report that the
matter contained in them was very consonant to the
<hi>Pythagorick Philosophie;</hi> the best foundation of the
conjecture is the (deserved) greatness of his own <hi>name</hi>
and <hi>authority,</hi> for you cannot but perceive that in it
self 'tis very fond &amp; frivolous, and if such a licentious
latitude may be allowed in historical <hi>guesses, Quidli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet

I write a <hi>Letter</hi> not a <hi>Treatise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. As to the pretence of a <hi>Vocal Cabala,</hi> I can scarce
without amazement consider with what confidence
and eagerness some learned men of late have cryed
up an invention so novel and fanciful; for I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more precarious and destitute of tolerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
then these <hi>Cabalistical Traditions,</hi> being only a
late &amp; silly Invention of the <hi>Iewish Rabbins:</hi> for they
are altogether unknown to and unmentioned by the
ancient both Jewes and Christians.<note place="margin">Oedip. tom. 2. class. 4. prefat.</note> And
yet <hi>Kircher</hi> (who never gives out at cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58766:56"/>
would have every one that does not believe
the Divine Original of the <hi>Cabala</hi> to be convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Heresie as an Enemy to the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But for my part, I cannot understand
how any Rational man can be at all concerned for
so vain and frivolous an Invention of the Modern
(<hi>i. e.</hi> trifling) <hi>Rabbins.</hi> But he that could find
all the Learning of the world in an <hi>Egyptian Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick</hi>
may find all the Articles of his Faith in a
<hi>Rabbinical Fable.</hi> 'Tis certain that the <hi>Cabala</hi> was
invented since the dispersion of the <hi>Iewish Nation,</hi>
(there being not the least footsteps of it before)
but in what Century or Period is uncertain and must
remain so, for from the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
there commenced as to the <hi>Iewish History</hi> a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (a Period alwayes fit for Fables;) there
being no <hi>Records</hi> or <hi>Monuments</hi> of their Condition
and Affairs, (unless some few fabulous Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the <hi>Talmud.</hi>) But whatever became of
them, 'tis certain that being given up to a vain and
trifling spirit, they imployed themselves, in foolish
&amp; absurd Inventions, of which making Mystical and
Allegorical Interpretations of Scripture is none of
the least: especially when they prefer them so much
before the true and literal meaning: for they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Scripture it self to a <hi>Candle,</hi> but the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
sense to a <hi>Iewel,</hi> for the discovery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58766:57"/>
of the Candle is lighted; and the <hi>Misnical Doctors</hi>
(that is, they that study onely the litteral sense)
are compared to <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> who only prepare
those Medicaments, which the <hi>Physitian</hi> prescribes,
but the <hi>Cabbalistical Doctors</hi> to <hi>Physitians,</hi> who
understand their Natures, Uses, and secret Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.
And therefore they leave the litteral and
superficial sense of Scripture, to the rude and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
People, whilst they that are Learned dive
into the mysteries and depths of the Law, and by
the help of Fancy fetch strange and wonderful
secrets from Words, Letters, Points, from their
several Shapes, Combinations, Transpositions,
Abbreviatures, Arithmetical Indications, and the
like. And then with a frontless Impudence, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
that they came Originally from <hi>Adam, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and <hi>Moses.</hi> You may see enough of this <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistical</hi>
Trash in a thousand Authours, but most
Copiously in <hi>Reuchlin de Arte Cabbalistica,</hi> and in
that grand Thesaurus of Learned Trifles, <hi>Kirchers
Oedip. tom. 2. Class.</hi> 4. The first that produced
them into the Christian World was the <hi>Earl of
Mirandula,</hi> in whose time the very word <hi>Cabbala</hi>
was so unknown, that (as <hi>Hottinger</hi> relates out of
<hi>Garzon</hi>) it was taken for a Witch, <hi>Vetula venesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cits
dedit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> And the <hi>Earl</hi> himself relates in his
<hi>Apology,</hi> that one of his greatest Antagonists be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58766:57"/>
asked what this <hi>Cabbala</hi> was, replyed that he
was a certain notorious Heretick, that had oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself against <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and that from him
his Accomplices and Followers were named <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistae.</hi>
The <hi>Earl,</hi> when he had at a high price
purchased some small fragments of it from the
<hi>Iews,</hi> thought himself Master of the most ancient
and valuable Monument in the World: The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
was pardonable in him, but unpardonable in
those who since have had opportunity to examine
its first rise and antiquity, and cannot discern the
least <hi>Traces</hi> of it beyond the <hi>Talmudical Rabbins:</hi>
Besides this, I might overthrow the <hi>Cabbala</hi> from
rational Arguments taken from the thing it selfe,
as that it would reflect upon the Wisdom of God,
that he should conveigh down such material and
important Truths (as are supposed to be contained
in the <hi>Cabbala</hi>) by so uncertain and questionable a
way, as <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> That it renders the Word
of God ridiculous and useless, and makes its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether doubtful and ambiguous, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it to the giddy and fanciful Conjectures of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>warm Brain:</hi> but the groundlesness of the thing
it self, makes all other confutation needless. Some
(not unlearned men) have urged the <hi>Consistency</hi> of
the <hi>Cabbala</hi> with it self, and the <hi>suitableness</hi> of the
<hi>Allegory</hi> to the <hi>Text</hi> as no contemptible Argument
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58766:58"/>
of its Truth and Solidity. But alas, (beside that
most of their <hi>Analogies</hi> between the Mystery and
the Text are sufficiently forced and uncouth)
there's nothing more easie then for Fancy to find
some <hi>Consonancy</hi> between the most distant things,
especially in such various and unlimited things as
<hi>Allegories</hi> are. If you should require it, I think I
could with an ordinary plausibility draw up a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the <hi>Epicurean Philosophie</hi> out of the Writings
of <hi>Iacob Behem,</hi> and yet perhaps it would puzle
you to think of any <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of a more distant
<hi>Genius</hi> then they. Such an <hi>Africa</hi> is Fancy, that
it can couple things of the most distant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Natures. And therefore I shall never think
the prettiest <hi>Parallels, Analogies,</hi> and <hi>Similitudes,</hi>
to be any tollerable Arguments.</p>
               <p>4. Having thus evidenced the unwarrantable
Rashness of deriving <hi>Platonick Notions</hi> from <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Traditions,</hi> I come in the next place to give
(1.) A brief Account of the Rise of that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
agreeableness between the <hi>Platonick</hi> and the
<hi>Christian Trinity.</hi> (2.) To shew by what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

&amp; lighting upon these <hi>Spurious Books,</hi> in which the

and reconciled together, might thence be easily indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to fancy a true and real Consonancy<note place="margin">Pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

between them, And therefore <hi>Patricius</hi> avers
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58766:59"/>
that he was the first that understood aright the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Threefold Principle,</hi> and that he came
by this knowledge by perusing the <hi>Books of Trisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus.</hi>
And hence those Platonists that followed him
might speak of the <hi>Trinity</hi> more consonantly to the
Scriptures, then perhaps they intended, though not
long after these Impostures were discovered by
<hi>Porphyrie,</hi> as himself relates in the <hi>Life of Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the second, the <hi>Platonick Triad</hi> is widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the <hi>Christian,</hi> for they intend by it so
many <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Ranks</hi> of <hi>Intellectual Beings,</hi>
and frequently added a fourth, which was the
<hi>Humane Soul,</hi> and set it at no greater distance from
the Third, by which they meant the <hi>Soul</hi> of this
<hi>Universe,</hi> then that was removed from the Second,
by which they meant the <hi>First mind</hi> or soul of the
<hi>Immaterial world.</hi> And their <hi>Progress</hi> to the knowledge
of these Beings proceeded in this Method.</p>
               <p>1. They suppose all things to ascend by <hi>Scales</hi> to
Unity, as <hi>Plato</hi> endeavours to prove in his <hi>Parmeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Unity is the Origine of all
Number, or all mix'd and compounded Beings
must be at last resolved into some one simple and
<hi>unmix'd Principle,</hi> otherwise the resolution would
be endless, so that all blended and <hi>Heterogeneous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
both material and immaterial must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58766:59"/>
exist somewhere simple and unmix'd. And
then all <hi>Immaterial Perfections</hi> being found blended
together in the <hi>Humane Soul,</hi> they concluded that as
many degrees of Perfection as they could discover
there, that there were so many <hi>Ranks</hi> of superior
and more <hi>homogeneal Beings</hi> in the <hi>Intellectual world.</hi>
The Soul therefore (as they apprehended) consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of four parts, must have the fourth Rank in
the order of <hi>Intellectual Beings,</hi> and by consequence
there must be <hi>three superior Orders</hi> more simple and
uncompounded, which must by several steps as far
exceed each other, as the lowest order surmounts
the Soul, to the highest whereof must of necessity
agree pure and meer <hi>simplicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That which is the <hi>supream Being,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the <hi>first Author</hi> of all other <hi>Beings,</hi> must of
necessity be the highest perfection, and contain in it
self all the <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Accomplishments</hi> of all its
<hi>Productions,</hi> &amp; yet by vertue of the former maxime
it can be but one simple and uncompounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and therefore to find out its <hi>Nature,</hi> they
consider with themselves what one <hi>Simple Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
is so absolute and transcendent as to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all others; and at length conclude that Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the most consummate and most entirely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Perfection conceivable, and therefore that the
most simple and unmixt Goodness must be the <hi>First
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58766:60"/>
Being.</hi> Which as 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>i. e. pure goodness,</hi> so it is
<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>i. e. meer Unity</hi> or rather <hi>simplicity,</hi> and has the
same Relation to the other Beings, as Unity has
to Number. Now they do not attribute the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> to this <hi>Being</hi> we
have already discovered, but to the <hi>second Being,</hi> for,
say they, it could not flow from the <hi>First,</hi> unless the
<hi>Ideas</hi> of all Things had resided in him, but then he
could not have been <hi>absolutely simple,</hi> having such a
<hi>multiplicity of Ideas</hi> within him. But <hi>Ideas</hi> lodging
in the <hi>Intellect,</hi> the Second Being which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Intellect</hi> was not only capable of receiving
them, but had in him as it were an <hi>Ocean</hi> of them,
which <hi>flowing</hi> from him filled all <hi>Possibilities
of Being</hi> with <hi>actual Existencies.</hi> Upon this account
they stiled there <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> because it was not
the immediate <hi>Fountain</hi> of Things, but only the <hi>Cause</hi>
of that which was. And therefore I am apt to think
that upon what <hi>Rationalities</hi> soever they pretend to
introduce their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that their first inducement
to it was, that they might rise higher then <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
and those other <hi>Philosophers,</hi> that asserted an
<hi>Eternal</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be the <hi>First Being</hi> and <hi>First Cause</hi> of
all things.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Intellect</hi> or <hi>Understanding</hi> being the <hi>Noblest
Perfection</hi> next to <hi>Goodness,</hi> the second thing must
be simply and absolutely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and being the <hi>Supream

Entity,</hi> it must also be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but because 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

                  </gap> only by <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation.</hi>
And hence was started that nice Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy,
whether is superior <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Unum?</hi> The
Earl of <hi>Mirandula</hi>'s Book <hi>de Uno &amp; Ente</hi> is only a

superior to <hi>Entity,</hi> because they assert their Original
and Uncreated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be the <hi>Principle</hi> of all <hi>Beings,</hi>
whilst it self is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and therefore they
will not permit you to terme it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but have inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

nothing but the <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Existence</hi> of the

it may by consequence with as great Propriety of

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as any thing else. But
whatever that Term imports, the signification of

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is of necessity most uncertain and ambiguous,
