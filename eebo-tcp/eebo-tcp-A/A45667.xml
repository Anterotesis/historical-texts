            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe Papers which were writ with a more private deſign, yet chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Service of Their Majeſties and the Publique, are now addreſſed to your Lordſhips to render them the more uſeful to thoſe Ends; the ſeveral Eminent Stations in which all of you are, gives you the opportunity of improving whatever is herein propoſed to that purpoſe. The unhappy management of the Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi> on every Rebellion, hath made the Charge of their Reduction to <hi>England</hi> ten times more than needed. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> obſerved that by long uſage it was grown a miſchievous Cuſtom in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Rebels might with part of the Plunder they took from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> procure
<pb facs="tcp:94476:3"/>
Pardon: Whereby, and the Lenity of <hi>England,</hi> Rebellions were nouriſhed there. This is moſt certain that the Papiſts have always had ſuch Influence on the Councils of <hi>England,</hi> as on the concluſion of every Rebellion, they have been left in a condition to renew them at pleaſure; to the great Charge of <hi>England,</hi> and Ruin of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Planters in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of their Improvements. And now, they, the <hi>French</hi> K. and the late K. <hi>J.</hi> have their Inſtruments at work to that end. But five Rebellions having been raiſed there betwixt <hi>1567,</hi> and <hi>1642.</hi> and now a Sixth, (of which two formidable and chargeable ones hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happened within the memory of many yet living) will, if we be not doomed to Infatuation, inſtruct us in the neceſſity of breaking their power, and utterly diſabling them for future Rebellions.</p>
            <p>There are a Party of Men who while the late K. <hi>J.</hi> was in <hi>Ireland</hi> mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified both it, and the Force of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but upon the Tydings of the happy progreſs of His Majeſties Arm, (to detract from the Glory of His Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions) they repreſent that Kingdom as chargeable and uſeleſs, nay as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious to <hi>England.</hi> It hath however to their Mortification already yielded Laurels to incircle His Royal Brows, and will do Treaſure to His Coffers, with a rich Return to this Kingdom of the Charge laid out for its Reduction; if the Settlement thereof be duly attended. It is enough for His Majeſty to Conquer, it ought to be the Care of His Miniſters to ſettle and ſecure. There is indeed a great meaſure of Wiſdom required to improve Victories, as well as Courage and Conduct to Atchieve them. It hath been obſerved to be the Fate of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to loſe that by Treaty, which they gain by Conqueſt; Five Hundred Years Experience hath verified it (in great meaſure) as to <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Affairs and Trade of that Kingdom, its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility and Importance to <hi>England,</hi> and the Influence it hath on the Trade and Rents thereof, ſeems to have eſcaped the obſervation of moſt of our Stateſmen and Merchants; I have in theſe Papers attempted to reſcue them from that obſcurity, and to lay them before Your Honours. Now that the Affairs of that Kingdom are before You in Parliament, Councils and Committees: For which preſumption nothing can Apologize, but the Zeal for the Publick, with which they were written. I am in all humility,</p>

               <p>YOU are pleaſed to require my Anſwer to this and the other Queries which you propoſe, preſuming that my Acquaintance with that Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth Capacitate me to ſatisfie you therein. I confeſs I have made Obſervations that would at leaſt have Contributed thereunto: But my Abſence from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that would have inabled a more diſtinct and ſatisfactory Account of thoſe matters, might have excuſed my Diſobedience, at leaſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: But being you admit not thereof, but uſe the Power you have over me in commanding a ſpeedy Compliance; I will in Obedience briefly ſet down what occurs to me on that Subject; tho' my Sentiments in this matter being different from many others, I foreſee the hardineſs of undertaking to contradict Common-Fame, or to rectifie a vulgar Error. I have heard ſeveral, and among them ſome of the Famed States-Men of the Age, wiſh there were no ſuch place as <hi>Ireland,</hi> and fault its nearneſs to <hi>England</hi> as detrimental or unprofitable. As if had they been conſulted, they could have rectified the Creation, by leaving, it out, or placing it better elſewhere. The Error lies in not apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its uſefulneſs to <hi>England.</hi> Others gravely tell us (both in Diſcourſe and Print,) that the gaining and keeping <hi>Ireland</hi> hath coſt <hi>England</hi> more than the purchaſe of all that Kingdom is worth. But theſe are like him who pay'd Ten-Shillings for an <hi>Ewe,</hi> kept her Five Years, pay'd Twelve
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94476:4"/>
Pence <hi>per Annum</hi> for her keeping, tho' he Yearly received her Lambs and Fleece, yet believed he was Fifteen Shillings the worſe by having her. I confeſs I was once half of the mind, that the Expence of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in Blood and Treaſure about that Kingdom had been vaſt: My Curioſity led me to examine whether it were ſo or no; and I will here faithfully impart what I have met with on that Subject, which will at leaſt lead towards an Anſwer, if not ſatisfie your firſt Inquiry.</p>
               <p>Know then, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> footing in <hi>Ireland</hi> did not Commence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a publick, but private undertaking.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Mac-Murogh</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> having been driven from his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, gave his only Daughter in Marriage to <hi>Richard Strongbow</hi> Earl of <hi>Chepſtow</hi> and <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and with her his Kingdom after his Death, on condition he ſhould aſſiſt and reſtore him. The Earl purſuant thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, incouraged his Relations <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> to joyn in that undertaking, who with near 400 brave Men, put off from <hi>Milford,</hi> and Landed near <hi>Wexford</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>May Anno.</hi> 1170. They were ſoon followed by <hi>Legroſs</hi> with 130 more; and in <hi>Auguſt</hi> following by <hi>Strongbow</hi> himſelf with 1200. Many of theſe Parties were Perſons of good Quality, great Valour and attended with wonderful ſucceſs: For notwithſtanding the ſmart oppoſition made by the Natives, <hi>Strongbow</hi> in a ſhort time reſtored <hi>Mac-Murogh,</hi> and inlarged his Dominions to ſuch a Degree, as rendred him ſuſpected by <hi>Henry</hi> II. who by Prohibiting all Commerce with <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. conſtrained the Earl to yield him all his Acquiſitions in that Kingdom. The King granted back to <hi>Strongbow</hi> the Principality of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> reſerving all the Port-Towns, and certain Tracts of Land about them to the Crown.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Hen.</hi> himſelf, ſome write with 4500, others that were amongſt 'em ſay but with 500 Knights, Landed in <hi>October</hi> 1172. near <hi>Waterford;</hi> his Preſence and Fame, with the Terror and Succeſs of <hi>Strongbow</hi>'s Arms, ſo intimidated the Natives in <hi>Leinſter, Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Conaught,</hi> that Five of their Kings on Notice of his Arrival did him Homage; and became his Tributaries.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of his Charge was ſpent in Royal Entertainments; and his time (for the five Months he ſtayed there,) in endeavours ſo to ſettle matters, <hi>as wholly in future to cut off from</hi> France <hi>the uſual aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance afforded by the</hi> Iriſh <hi>when Attacqued by the Arms of</hi> England. He had experimented the benefit the Crown received without Charge by <hi>Strongbow</hi>'s private undertaking; Therefore he wiſely reſolved by like Methods to make that part he had gained, bear the charge of Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole. To that end he diſtributed large Scopes of Land to the great Men that attended him. As to <hi>Hugh Lacy,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Meath,</hi> finding 100 Knights for his Service for ever, <hi>&amp;c.

This young Counceller (like <hi>Rechoboam</hi>'s,) hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Princes that Congratulated his Arrival, ſo roughly, that they were provoked to Rebel: Whereupon Eight Months after his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival he left that Kingdom in a much worſe condition than he found it. King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Wars in <hi>France,</hi> the unnatural Rebellion of his Sons, and his other troubles permitted him not to relieve it; yet to purſue his former Method, he committed the Government of that Kingdom to the Renowned <hi>John de Courty,</hi> and gave him a Grant of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>

                  <hi>Richard</hi> I. was ſo taken up with his expedition to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> the perfidy of the <hi>French</hi> King, and his unhappy detention by the <hi>Emperor;</hi> That he concerned not himſelf with the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I find; further then that he Married <hi>Iſabel,</hi> the Sole Heireſs of <hi>Strongbow</hi> to <hi>William Maxfield</hi> Earl-Marſhal of <hi>England;</hi> who was alſo (in right of his Wife) made Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>Leinſter.</hi>

                  <hi>King</hi> John <hi>having received</hi> 1000 <hi>Marks from</hi> Volois <hi>Lord Juſtice of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>to diſcharge him without account for the Revenue he had received of that Kingdom;</hi> Soon after committed the Government thereof to <hi>Walter</hi> and <hi>Hugh Lacy,</hi> who abuſed his Authority, not only to the Oppreſſion of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but to the ſubverſion of many of the beſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families alſo, to that degree, that (our Writers ſay) their Exactions, Oppreſſions, and Tyranny (Murders might be added) was intolerable; yet King <hi>John</hi> inſtead of eaſing thoſe Preſſures, (if we believe <hi>Grafton</hi> and <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) <hi>impoſed Taxes on the People of</hi> Ireland <hi>towards his Wars with</hi> France, <hi>much greater than they were able to bear.

The King himſelf landed near <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> with an Army (their number no where given us.) The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Kings, and great Lords immediately appeaſed him by Submiſſions, Homage and <hi>Tributes.</hi> He granted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects in <hi>Ireland</hi> the benefit of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta,</hi> and the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> He ſetled twelve Counties, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Courts, Judges, Circuits and Corporations as in <hi>England; he granted vast Scopes of Land to his great</hi> Engliſh <hi>Lords, in Knight Service for ſmall Rents. For</hi> 2500 <hi>Marks, he reſtored</hi> Walter Lacy, <hi>and for</hi> 4000 <hi>Marks,</hi> Hugh Lacy, and returned into <hi>England</hi> in <hi>August</hi> the ſame year. In the year 1213, being threatned with an Invaſion from <hi>France, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from</hi> Ireland 500 <hi>men at Arms well appointed, and a great number of other Horſe, who came to his aſſiſtance at</hi> Barkham Down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> III. during his 56 years Reign, was ſo fully employed by the <hi>French</hi> in the Bowels of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> on his Borders, and his great Lords at home, <hi>That he neither aſſiſted, nor minded</hi> Ireland, <hi>further than to draw powerful Aſſiſtances of men thence, which he received against</hi> France <hi>Anno</hi> 1230, <hi>and</hi> 1254; <hi>and againſt</hi> Wales <hi>in</hi> 1245, <hi>in</hi> 1256, &amp;c. <hi>as he had done of Victuals in the beginning of his Reign, having received thence</hi> 1000 <hi>Bacons, two Ships load of Corn, and one of Oats. The Clergy of</hi> Ireland <hi>granted him a Subſidy, and he received Aid thence towards paying a Debt to the Dauphin of</hi> France. He made his eldeſt Son <hi>Edward</hi> Lord of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The <hi>17th</hi> of his Reign the King of <hi>Conaught</hi> exhibited a Complaint, That although he had ever ſince King <hi>John</hi> ſubdued him, <hi>duly paid his annual Tribute of</hi> 5000 <hi>Marks,</hi> yet he was diſturbed by <hi>John de Burgo.</hi>

                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt being in War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> generally in Rebellion, the <hi>Scots</hi> invaded <hi>Ireland,</hi> and committed all manner of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94476:5"/>
Barbarities; but were not only expelled, but followed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who ſeverely revenged the Injury they had received, and therein did acceptable Service to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Anno 1293. The King <hi>drew Succours from</hi> Ireland <hi>againſt the</hi> French, <hi>as he did againſt the</hi> Scotch, <hi>when Balliol, the Chair and Marble were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the two latter brought thence. Two years after another conſiderable Army from</hi> Ireland <hi>met the King near</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and tendred him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Service; as did a third Army from thence at the Battle of</hi> Falkirk. <hi>Soon after which</hi> Tho. Biſſel <hi>with a party from</hi> Ireland <hi>invaded</hi> Scotland, <hi>and poſſeſſed himſelf of the Iſle of</hi> Arrain, <hi>which the King gave to him and his Heirs as an acknowledgment of his good Service. This King received the whole Tenth of all Eccleſiaſtical Revenues in</hi> Ireland <hi>for ſeven years, and one Fifteenth of the Temporality towards the holy War: Alſo Aid towards the Marriage of his Siſter, and ſeveral times preſſed them for other Aids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> ſoon after they had given <hi>Edward</hi> II. that great defeat at <hi>Bonoksborne,</hi> (encouraged by that Kings Male-adminiſtration) took the opportunity to revenge the Miſchiefs they had received from <hi>Ireland</hi> in the former Reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward Bruce</hi> twice invaded <hi>Ireland,</hi> and notwithſtanding the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he met with, over-ran and ſacked a great part of it, deſtroyed Men, Women and Children, Towns, Churches, and all that came in his way, and excited the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to almoſt a general Rebellion, while the <hi>Scots</hi> King made a like havock in all the North parts of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Edward Bruce</hi> was Crowned King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but, though his Rage was great, his Reign was ſhort, it being but one year. The Cruelties committed by the <hi>Scots</hi> were ſo many, as cauſed even the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to abhor and abandon them, who therefore joyned with the Engliſh, who at laſt defeated <hi>Bruces</hi>'s Army, cut off his Head, and as an acceptable Preſent ſent it to King <hi>Edward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this War the</hi> Scots <hi>loſt</hi> 30000, <hi>and the</hi> Iriſh-Engliſh 15000 <hi>fighting men, beſides others.</hi> The whole Land was almoſt waſted, impoveriſhed and depopulated; yet the King was ſo far from relieving or ſuccouring it, <hi>That he required, and received th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In his <hi>16th</hi> year, <hi>he was attended at</hi> Curlee <hi>by the Earl of</hi> Louth <hi>with</hi> 6000 <hi>foot and</hi> 300 <hi>men at Arms, and</hi> 1000 <hi>Hoblers, all well appointed; and by the Earl of</hi> Ulſter <hi>with</hi> 300 <hi>men at Arms, and in the 17th year of his Reign he was ſupplyed thence with</hi> 5000 <hi>Quarters of Corn ſent him to</hi> Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>I do not find that there was any ſtanding Army in pay in <hi>Ireland.</hi> When <hi>Edward</hi> III. firſt aſcended the Throne (nor for ſeveral years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the whole charge of the Civil Liſt then amounted but to 308 <hi>l.</hi>

2 <hi>s.</hi> for a year, and it was becauſe the chief Governor was a great Favorite, that he had 500 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for his Entertainment, out of which he was to maintain twenty or thirty Horſemen.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>6th</hi> year of this Kings Reign, <hi>the Lord</hi> Darcy <hi>with a potent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from</hi> Ireland, <hi>invaded</hi> Scotland. So that (as our Writers expreſs it) what by the King on the one ſide, <hi>and by the</hi> Iriſh <hi>on the other,</hi> Scotland <hi>was ſubdued, and</hi> Baliole <hi>placed on the Throne. And two years after the ſame Lord</hi> Darcy <hi>over-run part of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and the Iſles,</hi> which he might have poſſeſſed had they been worth keeping. Notwithſtanding which, this King, the <hi>15th</hi> year of his Reign, recalled all the Royal Franchiſes and Liberties; and reſumed all the Lands and Signories that had been granted by him, or his Father; which put the <hi>Engliſh</hi> born there, into almoſt as bad a Condition as the Natives, and tended to unite them as fellow ſufferers, and laid the Foundation of innumerable Miſchiefs. <hi>Yet an Army went thence to help the King then in</hi> France, <hi>and did him good Service, and were with him at the Battle of</hi> Creſſey, <hi>as did another party from</hi> Ireland <hi>go to him, to the Siege of</hi> Calais, <hi>Anno</hi> 1347.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> but a great part of <hi>Ireland</hi> was laid waſte and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by Diſſentions in Arms againſt one another, in thoſe very years; ſo that the inſtance affects not the Caſe, for thoſe Rents and Profits were of very great value, and might have been a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more in ſetled times, notwithſtanding there was received no more in thoſe three years.</p>
               <p>This Duke carried over with him 1500 men, chiefly to recover his Wifes Inheritance; yet he was ſo far from uſing them ſolely to that purpoſe, That he only recovered part of <hi>Meath,</hi> and of the Sea-Ports of <hi>

                  <hi>William Winſor</hi> was ſent Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and with him a party of men; but their number (being as I ſuppoſe but ſmall) is no where given us.

               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>Anno</hi> 1384. committed the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Robert Vere,</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> during his Life, with Power to receive the whole Revenue without Account, and to keep an Army of 1000 Archers, and 500 men at Arms for two years. But I do not find that either he or his men went thither, for the Kings Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to him were ſuch, that he would not bear his abſence. Yet he continued Lord Lieutenant ſeven or eight years, during which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſeveral Deputies, <hi>and received moſt of the Profits of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his own uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King being reproach'd abroad, That he could neither rule <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> keep his part in <hi>France,</hi> nor finiſh the Conqueſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to retrieve his Reputation in reſpect of the laſt; To that end he took Shipping in <hi>October</hi> 1394, and landed at <hi>Waterford</hi> with an Army of 34000 Men, <hi>but to little purpoſe; partly for that he ſuffered himſelf to be cheated (as were his Predeceſſors) by the feigned Submiſſions of most of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Princes, and great Lords, who on his arrival humbled themſelves</hi> Some of whom quitted all Title to their Eſtates in <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and conditioned with their Swords (under the Kings Pay) to carve out Eſtates for themſelves in other parts of the Kingdom; with which the King was conſtrained to be ſatisfied, by reaſon of the Clamour and Importunity of the Clergy of <hi>England.</hi> Whoſe conſtant hatred of Reformation, and fear that the Enormities of their Lives, and Corruption of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines ſhould be expoſed by the <hi>Wickl fits,</hi> cauſed them to ſend the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>London</hi> to haſten the Kings return. The truth is, they wanted the Royal Authority for perſecution of the Innocent, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Truth.</p>
               <p>To gratifie their Importunity the King returned at <hi>Shrovetide</hi> or <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> following, having ſufficient Power, but not time to do any thing conſiderable.</p>
               <p>At his departure he left <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> his Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant who, (in right of his Wife) was Earl of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> Lord of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught, Meath</hi> and <hi>Clare,</hi> and next Heir to the Crown. He was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered there four years after.</p>
               <p>It was cuſtomary until near this time, for the Lord Chancellor <hi>to pay annually</hi> 2000 <hi>Marks into the Exchequer, for the uſe of the great Seal,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94476:7"/>
which went a great way towards bearing the charge of that Kingdom in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able times.</hi> But the Fees being much abated, that branch of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue did ſo too.</p>
               <p>In Revenge of the Murder of the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> went thither again in <hi>April</hi> 1398. with ſuch an Army, as with their Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Followers took up a Fleet of 300 Ships. <hi>The</hi> Iriſh <hi>generally mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified him by their old Method of Submiſſions.</hi> The obſtinate he intended to have ſubdued. But the Tidings that the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hen.</hi> IV.) was landed in <hi>England,</hi> and claimed the Crown, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him back; ſo that he landed in <hi>England</hi> the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> following, and ſoon after (for his Male-adminiſtration) loſt firſt his Crown and Liberty by Order of Parliament, — and then his Life by the hands of Villains. The Clergy nor Parliaments of thoſe times had not imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance, or Paſſive Obedience, or that the Crown could not be forfeited by Male-adminiſtration, or that it could not for the good and Preſervation of the Community be transferred, or that any Legal Poſſeſſor of it might diſſeize the Subject of his Liberty or Franchiſes, or take away and diſpoſe their Eſtates at Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>You muſt know that from the time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> II. his Expedition into <hi>Ireland,</hi> until this time, <hi>Ireland</hi> was of the ſame uſe to the Crown, that <hi>Tangier,</hi> and the pretence of a War with <hi>France</hi> was to <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> II. had often, and now <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. began to deſire Money from the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> for ſupply of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had a Subſidy grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for three years of 50 <hi>s.</hi> for every Sack of Wool Skins and Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels from every Deniſon; and 4 <hi>l.</hi> from every Stranger. Alſo one Tenth, and one Fifteenth for ſupport of his War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> relief of <hi>Calais,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> but he found ſo much uſe for it in <hi>England,</hi> that I do not find that one Penny of it went thither.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, being in War with <hi>Scotland, the</hi> Engliſh <hi>of</hi> Ireland <hi>fought the</hi> Scots <hi>in his quarrel at Sea,</hi> where many of the firſt were killed and drowned.</p>
               <p>In 1405, <hi>They took three</hi> Scotch <hi>Ships, and their Commander; and twice in Favour of</hi> England <hi>invaded</hi> Scotland <hi>with good Succeſs; and the ſame year invaded</hi> Wales, <hi>did much harm to the</hi> Welch, <hi>and carried away good Booty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This King made the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> for ſeven years. He went thither in 1401. and returned into <hi>England</hi> in 1403. his Entertainment or Salary was but 666 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> And it was becauſe he was the Kings Son that it was ſo much.</p>
               <p>So inconſiderable were the Armies that were kept up in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that it was an honour placed on this Duke, that he was permitted to have an Army of 1500 men in all <hi>Ireland,</hi> though many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94476:7"/>
and ſo frugally were the Affairs of that Kingdom managed, that this Duke was limited to keep up that Army but for three years.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Lammas</hi> 1408. The Duke Of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> went into <hi>Ireland</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and narrowly eſcaped being killed by ſome of the Rebels. At his arrival there he compelled the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> to pay him 300 Marks for his Male-adminiſtration. <hi>He had a Tallage granted him by the Parliament of</hi> Ireland, and returned into <hi>England</hi> next <hi>March</hi> after his landing in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Whoever looks into the Troubles of this Kings Reign, will ſee that he could ſupply <hi>Ireland</hi> neither with Men nor Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hen.</hi> V. was ſo fully taken up with his Conqueſts in <hi>France,</hi> that he minded <hi>Ireland</hi> no further <hi>than to draw Supplies thence, which he did</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1412. <hi>under the Earl of</hi> Ormond. <hi>And in</hi> 1417 <hi>the Prior of</hi> Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainham <hi>with</hi> 1600 <hi>in Mail, with Darts and Skeyns, all tall nimble men, arrived at the Camp before</hi> Rouen, <hi>and joyfully accepted the most dangerous Poſt, wherein they ſo acquitted themſelves, that our Writers tell us no men were more praiſed, nor did more harm to their Enemies: For by their Agility of Body, and ſwiftneſs of Foot, they did more miſchief the Enemy, than their barded Horſes did hurt to the nimble</hi> Iriſh. <hi>And in the ſeven years of his Reign, the</hi> French <hi>Historians tell us, that the</hi> Iriſh <hi>did over-run all the Iſle of</hi> France, <hi>did innumerable damages to the</hi> French, <hi>and daily brought Victuals and Preys to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Army,</hi> which ſo terrified the <hi>French</hi> about <hi>Paris,</hi> that they fled and left the Country deſolate. <hi>The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Ireland <hi>granted this King</hi> 1700 <hi>Marks at ſeveral times towards the maintenance of his Wars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> being waſted with the Supplies they had yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>Scotland, Wales</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the frequent Rebellions there, the Parliament there repreſented the ill Condition thereof in 1442, to <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. and that by reaſon thereof, the Publick Revenue was 1456 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> leſs than the neceſſary Charge.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> the better to engroſs the King, and that he might rule at Pleaſure, cauſed <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Earl of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> to be ſent Lord Lieutenant thither; to induce his Acceptance, he gained the King to promiſe the Duke all the certain and caſual Revenue of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and 2666 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> for the firſt year (to be paid out of of <hi>England,</hi>) and 2000 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling <hi>per Annum</hi> for ſeven years more; but this was ill paid. However he had ſeveral Succeſſes againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, gained the Hearts of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> made good Laws, and governed ſo worthily, That out of Gratitude and Inclination to him, he was aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in his Pretentions to the Crown by <hi>Kildare,</hi> and ſeveral great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as was the King by another Party thence under the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> in the <hi>34th</hi> and <hi>38th</hi> years. A great Party thence was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94476:8"/>
cut off, and fell with him at the Battel of <hi>Wakefield,</hi> as many from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did on the other ſide at <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s Croſs; theſe great Loſſes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Natives with opportunities to enlarge their Borders, and ſtreighten the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About <hi>Anno</hi> 1474. the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. The Parliament of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> erected the Fraternity of St. <hi>George,</hi> conſiſting of Thirteen Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were yearly to chuſe of themſelves a Captain of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, who for his year was to command 120 Archers on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, at 6 <hi>d. per diem,</hi> forty Horſemen at 5 <hi>d. per diem,</hi> forty Pages at four Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> to be paid out of a Subſidy of 12 <hi>d. per</hi> pound, laid on all Merchandize Imported or Exported. And theſe were all the ſtanding Forces in pay at this time. Six years after, <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> being Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> his Deputy <hi>did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to keep that Kingdom in peace with eighty Archers, and twenty Spear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men all on Horſeback for</hi> 600 <hi>l.</hi> per annum.</p>
               <p>The Infancy of <hi>Edward</hi> V. gave his unnatural Unkle the opportunity of Murthering him, together with his Brother in the Tower, whom he ſucceeded under the Title of <hi>Richard</hi> III. <hi>Anno</hi> 1483. but a period was put to his Tyranny, Uſurpation and Life in 1485.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> VII. held himſelf under no obligation to do much for <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe two walking Spectres thence, <hi>(Lambert</hi> and <hi>Warbeck)</hi> diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted a great part of his Reign, yet in 1487. he ſent over 500 Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sir <hi>Richard Edgcomb,</hi> (ſome write that he carried no Forces with him) and about fifty more <hi>Anno</hi> 1492. The next year after, the King by Act of Parliament there, reſumed all the Crown Lands that had been granted away ſince the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> VI.</p>
               <p>In the Ninth year of his Reign, he ſent over Sir <hi>Edward Poyning</hi> his Deputy, and with him 940 Men. He (by his Policy rather than force) did more Service to his Prince, and good to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, than any of his Predeceſſors, by gaining that Parliament to Enact, That all the Publick Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> made before that time, ſhould be in force in <hi>Ireland,</hi> That no Parliament be held there until the Bills be firſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to the King under the great Seal there; and thoſe Bills be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King and his Council to be expedient for the Land, and Power be given under the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> to call a Parliament; and many other beneficial Statutes. <hi>He gained the King a Tax of</hi> 26 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. out of every</hi> 120 <hi>Acres Arable Land, in Lieu of Purveyance, and a Reſumption of all Grants made ſince the firſt of</hi> Edward III. <hi>which in</hi> Anno 1409. <hi>was followed with a Subſidy of</hi> 12 <hi>d. per pound on Imported Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and a Subſidy from the Clergy and Laity; and in</hi> Anno 1508 <hi>he had</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d. granted him out of every</hi> 120 <hi>Acres Arable Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94476:8"/>In <hi>Anno</hi> 1515. The Parliament of <hi>Ireland granted</hi> Henry VIII. <hi>a Subſidy.</hi> In <hi>Anno</hi> 1520. The Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> was ſent Lord Lieutenant with 200 Men, (ſome ſay 900 more) but whatever the number was, they all returned for <hi>England</hi> with him the next year. The Souldiers pay at this time was 4 <hi>d. per diem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1524. The Earl of <hi>Kildare undertook the Government, and to defray the whole Charge of the Kingdom with its own Revenue,</hi> which he and his Deputy held with little interruption for near ten years. <hi>Anno</hi> 1529. Sir <hi>William Skeffington</hi> carried over 200 Men, according to ſome 500. In 1534. he carried over 750 to ſuppreſs the Rebellion of the <hi>Fitz-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds;</hi> as did the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> 200 more the next year, who ended it; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, 750 of the Army was disbanded. This Rebellion is ſaid to coſt the King above 20000 <hi>l.</hi> The Revenue of the Kingdom by reaſon of that Rebellion being but 5000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> To repay which, or prevent the like charge in future, <hi>The King had the firſt Fruits, then the twentieth part of all Eccleſiaſtical Livings, then the firſt Fruits of all Abbeys, Priories and Colledges, in that Kingdom given him.</hi> Kildares <hi>Eſtate of</hi> 893 <hi>l.</hi> per annum, <hi>and many great Eſtates of thoſe concerned in that Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were all given to the King, as alſo all Lands belonging to all Abbeys, Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Colledges there. And the Eſtates of many Abſentees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto the Wars in <hi>Ireland</hi> was moſtly between the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Native <hi>Iriſh,</hi> on the Score of Civil Intereſt. But from the time of this Kings firſt Divorce, and <hi>Kildares</hi> Rebellion, the degenerate <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> joined with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and pretended Religion for their ſubſequent Rebellions, which thenceforth became more frequent, and more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, being fomented and abetted ſometime by the Emperor, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by <hi>France,</hi> ſometime by <hi>Spain,</hi> moſtly by the Pope; eſpecially from the time of the Kings aſſuming the Supremacy. Henceforward they have been no longer Loyal, than whilſt they have been compelled to be ſo.</p>
               <p>In 1539. Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> carried over 250 Men. In 1542, the Parliament gave <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. the Title of King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors having only had the Title of Lord thereof.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Anno</hi> 1543. the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Revenue (beſides Cuſtoms, firſt-Fruits, Tributes — and ſome other particulars) amounted but to 8700 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and the whole charge to but 10500 <hi>l.</hi> The Chief Governour upon all Warlike Expedition (by an antient uſage in that Kingdom) did Tax each County with a certain Summ of Money to defray the charge thereof: So that it is not eaſie to apprehend that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at this time could be a charge to <hi>England.</hi> The ſtanding Army was but 375 Horſe and 150 Foot. <hi>In</hi> 1544. 700 <hi>Men were ſent from</hi> Ireland <hi>into</hi> France, <hi>who greatly damnified the</hi> French, <hi>and by pretty Stratagems,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94476:9"/>
contributed to the ſupply of the Army with Proviſions. And in obedience to the Kings commands</hi> 3000 <hi>Men were ſent from</hi> Ireland <hi>againſt</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>In 1547. <hi>Edward</hi> VI. to ſecure that Kingdom (upon the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion) ſent thither 600 Horſe and 400 Foot under Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Belingham,</hi> who with the Forces there, ſubdued the <hi>Demſeys, Connors,</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi> then in Rebellion, <hi>whereby</hi> Offailie <hi>and</hi> Leixe <hi>were forfeited to the Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This King being incumbred with Wars with <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and many Rebellions at Home, did (as <hi>Haywood</hi> tells us) <hi>draw much people from</hi> Ireland <hi>to ſerve him in his Wars.</hi> To repleniſh which, in the fourth year of his Reign, he ſent thither 400 men and 8000 <hi>l. And the next year the</hi> Engliſh <hi>from</hi> Ireland <hi>Invaded the Iſles of</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>In 1556. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> committed the Government of that Kingdom to the Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> who carried Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> with him, (and 25000 <hi>l.</hi> in Caſh) by whoſe aſſiſtance he finiſhed what <hi>Belingham</hi> had ſo Worthily begun, in breaking the power of the <hi>Demſeys, Connors, Moores &amp;c. whereby</hi> Leixe <hi>and</hi> Offailie <hi>were Veſted in the Crown,</hi> and Engliſh Plantations ſettled in thoſe parts, now called the King's and Queen's Counties. <hi>The</hi> Iriſh <hi>Parliament then gave the Queen a Subſidy of</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d. out of every Plough-Land for ten years,</hi> which was a great addition to the Revenue. In 1558. This Earl had 500 men out of <hi>England,</hi> with whom and the Forces of that Kingdom, <hi>he Invaded the Iſles of</hi> Scotland, <hi>took ſome, and ſacked ſeveral others of them;</hi> the ſtanding Army there, in this Reign when moſt, was leſs than 1700. and ſometimes leſs than 1100.</p>
               <p>In 1560. which was two years after Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Acceſſion to the Crown, there was 500 Foot ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> to recruit the Army.</p>
               <p>In 1565. The Army in the Queens pay was but 1200 Horſe and Foot. The Charge of the Civil Liſt about 1500 <hi>l. per annum. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of</hi> Ireland <hi>ſurmounted</hi> 10000 <hi>l.</hi> per annum, <hi>beſides large Summs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gained from the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Lords on their Submiſſions and Tribute impoſed on them, ſo that the Queens Charge could be but ſmall, conſidering that all the Freeholders on every occaſion of Marching the Army againſt any Rebels, were obliged to ſend certain numbers of Horſe and Foot, with Proviſions to attend the Chief Governour, or Commander in Chief of the Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Parſimonious Queen to avoid Expence, and the ſending men for <hi>Ireland,</hi> ordered that every Tenant there that paid her 40 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Rent, ſhould be obliged to find a Horſeman, and every one that paid 6 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d. per annum</hi> a Footman, Armed for her Service, to be ready on all occaſions.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>O Donnel</hi> ſubmitted to the Queen, <hi>and conditioned to pay</hi> 200 <hi>l. per annum, and to attend her Army on all occaſions with a number
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94476:9"/>
of Horſe and Foot; as did many others of the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>who ſubmitted on like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Compoſitions, and Aſſiſtance;</hi> which not only augmented the Revenue, and leſſened the Charge of the Army, but helped much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paying for their Fetters. <hi>This</hi> O Donnel <hi>five years after paid the Queen</hi> 1200 <hi>l. for Delinquency and Arrears of his Compoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1565. The Valiant Captain <hi>Randolph</hi> Landed at <hi>Derry</hi> with a Troop of Horſe, and 700 Foot to ſettle a Plantation; he did great Service, although at laſt he loſt his Life in the Improvement of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Victory which he obtained againſt the Rebels. In 1569. Captain <hi>Ward</hi> with 400 Souldiers were ſent into <hi>Ireland;</hi> he landed at <hi>Cork.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queens great Study was to inlarge and firm her Conqueſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without Charge. In order thereunto ſhe attempted to tread in the ſteps of <hi>Henry</hi> II. and ſeveral of his Succeſſors, who gained moſt of their Intereſt in that Kingdom, at the charge of a few of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, with little charge to the Crown or Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto, the Queen in 1572. incouraged Sir <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> at his own Charge to ſettle an Engliſh Colony in the <hi>Ards.</hi> She granted every Footman 120 Acres, and every Horſeman 240 Acres (which then was as much as 500 Acres in <hi>England</hi>) paying her one penny <hi>per</hi> Acre <hi>per annum.</hi> And the year following ſhe Lent the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> 10000 <hi>l.</hi> on a Mortgage, and gave him half the <hi>Clandeboys,</hi> on condition that he ſhould Plant 200 Horſe and 400 Foot; each Horſeman was to have 400 Acres, and each Footman 200 Acres, paying 2 <hi>d. per</hi> Acre Quit-Rent. Where that Noble Lord did perform many brave Exploits, and had done much better had he not been countermined by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and oppoſition of ſeveral Great Men both here and there.</p>
               <p>In 1576. An Antient Tax called the Ceſs (of five Marks on each Plow-Land) which had been diſcretionarily levyed by the Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours there, from <hi>Edward</hi> III's. time to this, (under pretence of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative) had by this time been Arbitrarily ſtretched to eight or nine pounds a Plow-Land; being now complain'd of as a publick grievance, was reduced within its firſt Bounds. Yet notwithſtanding this, and other Regulations, the worthy Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> who governed there, <hi>augmented the Queen's Revenue</hi> 11000 <hi>l.</hi> per annum <hi>above what he found it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Until this time (according to the beſt of our Writers) <hi>England</hi> gained and maintained its footing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with very inconſiderable Charge to the Publick. But henceforward the Charge became much greater, moſtly occaſioned by the Queens great Parſimony, who always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed incompetent force for ſubduing the Rebellions that were raiſed, whereby they were lengthened to trebble the time and charge that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94476:10"/>
would elſe have ſerved. I know not whether it ought to be reckoned as expended for the Conqueſt of that Kingdom (tho' that was the Iſſue of it) becauſe the greateſt part of it was occaſioned by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queen, to divert that King from attempting <hi>England,</hi> employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fought him in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> moſtly at the coſt of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and he to divert her from aſſiſting the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or Invading his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, fomented Rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and aſſiſted them with Men, and ſome Money, yet fought her moſtly at the coſt of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1579. There was 600 Men ſent out of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet they made up the Army there in the Queens pay but 1100 Horſe and Foot. But the Rebellion of <hi>Deſmond</hi> and others, (and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> that joined them) did require the augmentation of the Army. To that end three Companies were ſent from <hi>Berwick,</hi> and 150 Horſe under Capt. <hi>Norris.</hi> And in 1580. Six Companies under Capt. <hi>Berkley,</hi> and 150 Horſe under C. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> which in 1582. were followed with 400 under the Earl of <hi>Ormond.</hi> Theſe with the <hi>Militia</hi> of that Countrey, killed <hi>Deſmond,</hi> deſtroyed his Confederates in that Rebellion, expelled the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and reſtored ſuch meaſure of Peace to the Kingdom, that the publick Revenue of it for the year 1583. <hi>amounted to about</hi> 24000 <hi>l.</hi> and thenceforward it encreaſed mightily, by the firm Settlement of Eſtates, and Enlargement of Trade, inſomuch that in 1584. the Lord Deputy propoſed to the Queen, that if ſhe would add but 50000 <hi>l.</hi> for three years, to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Revenue; he would engage with both to defray the whole Charge of the Kingdom, maintain 2000 Foot and 400 Horſe, Wall Seven conſiderable Towns, Erect Seven great Bridges, and Build Seven ſtrong Caſtles: But ſhe comply'd not therewith.</p>
               <p>However in 1585. In order to put that Kingdom into a good poſture of Defence, and of little Charge to the Queen; the Lord Deputy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a groſs Survey to be taken of the Province of <hi>Conaught</hi> and <hi>Thomond,</hi> whereby they were found to contain 8095. Plow-Lands pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, the Proprietors of which agreed to pay the Queen <hi>a chief Rent of about</hi> 4000 <hi>l. per Annum, and to find</hi> 1254 <hi>Foot, and</hi> 264 <hi>Horſe for the Queens Service within that Province, and</hi> 347 <hi>Foot and</hi> 108 <hi>Horſe at any time for</hi> 40 <hi>days in any part of</hi> Ireland.</p>
               <p>A Militia alſo was ſettled in <hi>Munſter</hi> of 4500 Bill-Men and 900 Shot. <hi>And the Queen being Intituled to near</hi> 600000 <hi>Acres of Land by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures of Deſmond and his Accomplices</hi> (his particular Rents being above 7000 <hi>l. per Anmum</hi>) <hi>She granted thoſe in</hi> Kerry, Conilagh <hi>and</hi> Limerick, <hi>together at</hi> 2<hi>d. per</hi> Acre. <hi>Thoſe in</hi> Waterford <hi>and</hi> Cork <hi>at</hi> 3<hi>d. per</hi> Acre per Annum <hi>Quit-Rent. Every</hi> 300 <hi>Acres finding a Horſeman, and every</hi> 200 <hi>Acres a Foot-Man Armed for her Service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Militia being thus ſettled, the Queen in 1587. <hi>Remanded</hi> 1000 <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb facs="tcp:94476:10"/>
out of</hi> Ireland, <hi>which ſhe ſent into</hi> Holland, and that Kingdom enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a kind of tranquillity for above Twelve Years.</p>
               <p>In 1597. <hi>Tyrone</hi> and others broke but into Rebellion: Whereupon General <hi>Norris</hi> with 3000 Men were ſent thither. But the ſucceſſes of the Rebels required greater Forces, ſo that 100 Horſe and 2000 Foot more, were ſent thither Three Years after.</p>
               <p>In 1598. The Government of that Kingdom was committed to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with Power from <hi>England</hi> to encreaſe the Army there (which were about 8000 men) unto 20000 Horſe and Foot. Yet this Brave, but Unfortunate Earl effected little.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> ſucceeded in that Government, who with 15200 Horſe and Foot that he found there; and 2000 Men that were ſent him in 1601. from <hi>England;</hi> expelled the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſuppreſſed the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and formidable Rebellion that untill then had happened in that Kingdom. And therewith finiſhed the entire Conqueſt of that Kingdom, wherein this Queen imployed more Forces, and ſpent more Treaſure than all her Progenitors: For we are told that it coſt her Eleven Hundred Ninety one Thouſand two Hundred Forty Eight Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> beſides the Revenue of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="1">I. Conſider, that <hi>England</hi> being an Iſland, our outward ſtrength for Defence againſt Invaſion, for offence of our Enemies, and for ſecurity of our Trade, lies in the numbers of our Ships and Seamen. That Trade that employs, alſo enables the encreaſe of theſe, and is neceſſary to our well being.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:94476:12"/>That Money that we gain purely for our Ships let to Fraight to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of other Countries, is one of the cleareſt profits to the Kingdom, and as advantagious to the Publick as any other, not only in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned reſpects, but alſo for that we part with nothing in Lieu of this Money, but the Labour of our Men, and the Wear and Tear of our Ships; yet hereby at the Charge of others we encreaſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our Shipping, breed and pay Seamen. Thus the Netherlanders by being the Carriers of Chriſtendom have in a great Meaſure raiſed themſelves to their preſent opulence.</p>
               <p>Now that I may make it evident, that <hi>Ireland</hi> Contributes to our Strength, Security, the encreaſe of our Shipping and Seamen, and that we are yearly conſiderable Gainers in other reſpects alſo by that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; you muſt know that the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> have but few Ships of their own; That at leaſt two thirds of their Exportations and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations are made in our Bottoms.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1668. I was in that Kingdom, and did ſee a Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was delivered in to the Council of Trade there, by one of the Members thereof, who made it out, that tho' the Exportations of that Kingdom about that time amounted but to 450000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> that yet moſt, or all their Commodities being Groſs or Bulkey, they paid for Fraight to Ships of <hi>England</hi> for the Exportation of them, and for Importing the Proceed thereof, 130000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to the other Members of that Society. Yet being ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, it was found to be near 10000 <hi>l.</hi> ſhort of what our Seamen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived yearly thence.</p>
               <p>But this Scale of Trade between this and that Kingdom, having ſuffered a conſiderable alteration by our Folly in Prohibiting their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and forcing them to carry ſeveral of their Commodities to Forreign Markets, and thence to ſupply themſelves with many things that till then they wholly derived from us, whereby they have encreaſed their Forreign Trade and Shipping, (yet ſo as that there is not Ten Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Dublin</hi> their Metropolis)</p>

               <p n="2">II. That Trade that Annually takes off a good proportion of our natural Products, Manufactures, and of the Forreign Commodities that we Import (for which we can have no Sale, or Vend elſewhere,) is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for keeping up the Rents of our Lands, enriching our Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, employing our Manufacturers at home, and our Shipping and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men abroad.</p>

               <p>That kingdom likewiſe takes off yearly a good proportion of our Manufactures, as Fuſtians, Ticking, Haberdaſhery, Sadlers ware, Pinns, Needles, Knives, Gloves, Fanns, Cutlers ware, Belts, Laces, Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Fine-Cloath, Stuffs, Iron-ware, Braſs, Pewter, Glaſs, Earthen and Wooden-ware, Books, Caſtors. Hereby our Manufacturers are kept in work, and our Trades-Men that ſell theſe to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Merchants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched.

               <p>In theſe reſpects <hi>Ireland</hi> is not only uſeful, but neceſſary to <hi>England,</hi> for were there no ſuch place (as ſome fooliſhly wiſh) we could have no Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for the Ships lately uſed in that Trade.

Markets, would make it good beyond contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that the hands at preſent employed in our Natural Products and Manufactures, do as Trade now ſtands, more than ſufficiently ſupply our home Conſumption, and Forreign Trade; and that, if more of theſe were raiſed in quantity, it would by glutting all Markets, rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice than enlarge our Trade; and were there no ſuch place as <hi>Ireland,</hi> or were it cut off from its dependance on <hi>England,</hi> and ſupplied from elſewhere, we could no where Vend the Commodities that Kingdom yearly takes off.</p>
               <p>And a little Voyage from <hi>London-Bridge</hi> to <hi>Graves-End,</hi> (even in times of open Trade) may ſatisfie the doubtful, if not convince the incredulous, that we have more Ships than all our ſhare of the Trade of the World does conſtantly employ, and a view of the Ships (formerly employed in the <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Trade,) which now lie by the Walls at the Ports before named, ſince the Trade between us and <hi>Ireland</hi> hath been ſhut up, and which may be had at Fraight, at little more than half Fraight; do ſhew, that neither our Merchants, nor Seamen, know how otherwiſe to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That Trade that ſupplies us with Materials for our Manufactures, (and thereby employment for our People) eſpecially ſuch as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have, or not ſo Cheap from other Parts, is neceſſary to our well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being. In the former inſtance I ſhewed you, that <hi>Ireland</hi> takes off a good proportion of our ſuperfluities: In this you'll ſee that in Lieu of part of them, it ſupplies us with uſeful and neceſſary Materials for our Manufactures, and that Cheaper than we can have them from elſewhere. We do ſome Years receive 6000 <hi>l.</hi> Weight of Linnen-Yarn for Warps for our Fuſtians, to make into Courſe-Linnen, Thred-Buttons, Tapes, Inckles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 137300 Cony-Skins for Hatts, 1200 Dozen of Calf-Skins, 40000 Raw and Dreſſed Hides, 373600 Goat, Sheep and Lamb-Skins, and Pelts for Glovers, and many other uſes; Tallow, 38000 <hi>l.</hi> Weight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which ſerve for many uſes, both Domeſtick and Forreign. Some Years we received from <hi>Ireland</hi> 210000, ſome Years 254000 great Stones of Wool, at 18 Pound to the Stone, which (as was made out to the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by a Weſt Country Member of the Houſe of Commons,) employs 180000 of our Wool-Dreſſers, Combers, Carders, Spinners, Weavers, Dyers, Fullers, Dreſſers, Shears-men, Tuckers, Knitters, Calenders, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. And whereas it may be thought that the Wools of <hi>England</hi> would yield a better Rate, were none Imported from <hi>Ireland;</hi> 'tis certain that the Paſture Ground in <hi>England</hi> could not ſupply the quantity brought in from <hi>Ireland:</hi> And were the quantity leſs than now is, work would be wanting for the Poor; or were Wool dearer, the Price of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94476:14"/>
would be raiſed, and we ſhould thereby be in danger of loſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Forreign Markets for them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That Trade that furniſhes as with Commodities for Forreign Markets, which we cannot have elſewhere, is in ſome ſort neceſſary for us, both for employing our Stock, our Ships and our Sea-men. The chief way whereby the <hi>Dutch</hi> greatly enlarge their Trade, and augment their Wealth, is by buying up the Commodities of other Countries, and carrying them in their own Ships to proper Markets. <hi>Ireland</hi> furniſheth us with ſeveral Advantages of this kind; for our Merchants have had ſhipped off thence for their own Account in one year, 800 Tuns of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, 700 Tuns of Pilchards, 12000 Barrels of Herrings, 120 Tuns of Eels, 900000 Hake-fiſh, 1040000 of Barrel, Hogs-head and Pipe-ſtaves, 3600 quarters of Rape-ſeed, 300000 yards of courſe narrow-bandle Wollen-cloth, 38000 <hi>l.</hi> weight of Butter, 1000 <hi>l.</hi> weight of Cheeſe, 43000 raw Hides, 800 douzen of Calf-Skins, 25000 Barrels of Beef, 1000 Barrels of Pork, beſides Leather, Caddows, Bacon, Corn, and ſeveral other Commodities, few of which, if any, could be ſupplyed them from any other part of the World, or at leaſt not ſo cheap, or ſo conveniently as from <hi>Ireland;</hi> for our Ships in their way to forreign Markets frequently touch, or call in <hi>Ireland</hi> for ſome of theſe Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to compleat the Cargoes of other Goods they carry hence, which is of much greater advantage to our Trade than is apprehended at firſt view.</p>
               <p n="5">V. We are gainers by <hi>Ireland,</hi> in that they take our Money and pay us Intereſt for it; Suppoſe we have but 40000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money at Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (Intereſt there being 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi>) it yields us 4000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> continued there ten years, we have drawn thence 40000 <hi>l.</hi> for Intereſt, and at laſt we receive our entire Principal alſo. But conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Ireland</hi> takes off more of our Commodities yearly than we do of theirs, they are obliged to ſend us Money, and we having the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Exchange, we receive in <hi>Ireland</hi> 106 <hi>l.</hi> or 108 <hi>l.</hi> for every hundred Pounds we part with in <hi>England:</hi> So that at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, we part but with 37600 <hi>l.</hi> and yet receive 4000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Intereſt thence.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame Nature and Advantage is the Rent that our Noblemen, Gentlemen and Merchants yearly receive for their Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which are yearly tranſmitted thence hither. Inſtances of this kind are too many to be enumerated. I will ſet before you ſome conſiderable Inſtances of Profit that we receive from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and which that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom particularly yields us in three Schedules.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:94476:14"/>Firſt, by Rent of Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> belonging to Perſons that wholly, or for the moſt part live in <hi>England,</hi> and are therefore frequently tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted hither.</p>

               <p>If in the firſt Liſt the Eſtate of any man be over valued, 'tis moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that many of the others are under-valued; and that there are ſeveral Perſons of leſs quality not named, whoſe Eſtates are in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that ſpend them in <hi>England</hi> I have not wilfully erred. I have a Liſt of Particulars in my Hands drawn up by the Council of Trade in <hi>Ireland</hi> in 1672. whereby the Abſentees Eſtates then living in <hi>England,</hi> are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued to 116040 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> Nor is this a late Advantage that <hi>England</hi> reaps by <hi>Ireland,</hi> for both the Hiſtories and Laws of this and that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94476:15"/>
do complain, That from the firſt Conqueſt they have been impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed by their Nobility, and Gentry's, ſpending their Eſtates in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Second Liſt of Penſioners, I do not find that there hath leſs than 10000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> been paid for many years paſt to Perſons in <hi>England.</hi> Upon the Eſtabliſhment <hi>Anno</hi> 1676. The Penſions then payable to Perſons in <hi>England</hi> was 10500 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> All the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mentioned in this Liſt but three, were certainly in <hi>England,</hi> and I am informed the other three were reſident here alſo. However the Summ payable to thoſe three amounts but unto 5<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0 <hi>l.</hi> in all.</p>
               <p>As to the Third Liſt, it depends on Eſtimates, wherein as to the two firſt Articles, and the fourth, fifth and ſixth, I have been careful to keep much within what they really are. As to the third Article 'tis certain that the Annual Profits our Noblemen make of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth much exceed what I have ſet down.</p>
               <p>And as to the laſt which concerns the Surpluſages of the Revenue, whoever conſults the Eſtabliſhment of that Kingdom, will find, that for many years paſt there has been an Article in it appointing a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Summ to be returned Annually into <hi>England.</hi> In 1676. it was but 20000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Charles</hi> II. time, there was great Summs raiſed in that Kingdom, that never came into the Exchequer there; nor as I am informed is there any account how they were diſpoſed. Whether they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels as a reward for cutting Proteſtants Throats in 1641, or tranſmitted for <hi>England,</hi> I cannot ſay, but poſſibly it may one day prove worth his preſent Majeſties Enquiry, when once that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom tends towards a Settlement, if he thinks good, to have a retroſpect ſo far. Here I am likewiſe to take notice, that when Forces have been ſent from <hi>Ireland</hi> hither, or to <hi>Tangier,</hi> they have conſtantly been paid thence.</p>
               <p>By the particulars of this laſt inſtance, it is evident, That we not only reap the common advantages uſually made in the courſe of Trade between one Kingdom and another; but that we alſo make many other conſiderable ones by <hi>Ireland,</hi> which that Kingdom peculiarly yields us, and is like yet to do to a greater degree, if we put it into a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Trade and Improvement, which I ſhall hereafter make out.</p>
               <p>The three Liſts I have ſet down before you do ſhew, That we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 176017. <hi>l. per annum,</hi> in thoſe particulars, 75000 <hi>l.</hi> that they pay us annually for Fraight of our Ships, which makes 245017. enough of itſelf for ever to Cure us of our Jealouſie, That that Kingdom will be prejudicial to us in point of Trade, for theſe very Out-lets of their

Treaſure will infallibly keep them low. And the very encreaſe of their Trade and Conſumption will encreaſe the Revenue there, and make them liable to ſend ſo much more as that ſhall happen to be, annually to <hi>England,</hi> which helps to ſupport our Charge and Enrich us. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Revenue of <hi>Ireland</hi> amounts to yearly above the Charge of that Kingdom, hath been, and will be tranſmitted into <hi>England,</hi> and is ſo much clear profit to the King and this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>They are yearly liable to us for more than we receive in Commodity thence; and therefore much of what their Merchants ſend to <hi>France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. on their own proper Accounts is returned by Exchange, or brought in Forreign Coyns into <hi>England,</hi> ſo that they ſeem to ſubſiſt by Miracle. However they were in a thriving condition when King <hi>James</hi> II. Aſcended the Throne.</p>
               <p>Nor is the advantage ſmall to <hi>England,</hi> nor to our Nobility and Gentry, that whilſt the elder Brothers, Gentlemen of Eſtates here, juſtle and ſcuffle for Offices and Preferments, and think all too little for them, That their younger Brothers have <hi>Ireland</hi> to repair unto in Shoals (on every change of Government there, which uſually happens every three or four years) where they meet with Offices, Employments and Preferments both of Honour and Profit, Eccleſiaſtical, Civil, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary; and frequently arrive at conſiderable Eſtates, or a way of Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, whereby they live as plentifully and contentedly (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not ſo ſplendidly) as their Elder Brothers here.</p>
               <p>Nor is this advantage limited to the Nobility and Gentry only: For <hi>England</hi> breeds more Mechanicks, than it can maintain. The Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of theſe, that by their ſtay here would but impoveriſh the reſt, find Work and Livelihood in <hi>Ireland.</hi> As do many decayed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that repair thither yearly for Bread, and are received there with great Humanity, and Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>It is Ignorance, Envy, <hi>French</hi> Gold, or Wicked and Treacherous Deſigns that put Men upon Quarrelling with the Trade, Situation or Improvement of <hi>Ireland</hi> as prejudicial, or inconvenient to <hi>England,</hi> for the fair, ſpacious, and ſafe Harbours on the South, and South-Weſt Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> furniſh our Merchant Ships in their Voyages to <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and return from <hi>America,</hi> and moſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> not only with commodious ſhelter and refreſhments in Storms, Tempeſts, and other Extremities at Sea, but alſo retreat, refuge, and ſecurity from Pyrates, and Enemies in times of War.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Ireland</hi> by its Situation lyes conveniently, not only for Security and Advice for our Merchant Fleets in time of War, but alſo to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and interrupt the Trade of our Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94476:16"/>And how lightly ſoever theſe advantages may be paſt over by thoſe that poſſibly for French-gold, would cut, untwiſt, or weaken our Threefold Cord, yet they are obvious enough to all conſidering, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed States-men, Merchants and Navigators.</p>
               <p>For let it be conſidered, That the great currant of Trade runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and that were the Ports of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in one hand or both in War with us; That either, much more both, would ſhut up, and damage, if not ruine our Trade, in that in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe, it might be done meerly by Privateers without the Expence of a great and chargeable Fleet, as our Merchants already find in part to their great coſt and loſs.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee that <hi>Ireland</hi> is beneficial to <hi>England,</hi> by employing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 300 Sail of Ships conſtantly, together with the Hands and Trades that depend on them. That it takes off conſiderable quantities of our natural Products, of our Manufactures, and of our Imported Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which yields Employment to our People, contributes to keep up the Rents of our Lands, and Enrich our Merchants.</p>
               <p>That almoſt all the Commodities we receive thence, are not only uſeful, but neceſſary to us, to enable our Manufacturers, and employ multitudes of our People.</p>
               <p>That our Forreign Trade is encreaſed by the Commodities our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ship off from <hi>Ireland</hi> which they can have no where elſe, and lyes there conveniently for our Ships to take in in their way to their proper Markets.</p>
               <p>That we receive thence yearly above 240000 <hi>l.</hi> beſides many other advantages.</p>
               <p>That many younger Brothers, and ſupernumerary Artizans, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that fall to decay, and that cannot ſubſiſt here, are received and entertained with kindneſs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they grow Rich, or at leaſt Subſiſt.</p>
               <p>That the Situation of that Kingdom is ſo far from being prejudicial to <hi>England,</hi> That it is commodious for the ſhelter, ſecurity and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of our Trade.</p>
               <p>That were there no ſuch place, we ſhould want Employment for at leaſt 300000 of our People, and Sale for a good part of our Products and Manufactures.</p>
               <p>That ſhould <hi>Ireland</hi> continue in the hands of our Enemies, many of our People would be beggared, moſt of our Forreign Trade be greatly indangered and obſtructed, if not ruined.</p>
               <p>So that without further conſideration of this matter, I do conclude, That as <hi>Ireland</hi> is the antienteſt, ſo it is the moſt noble, and profitable Acquiſition that ever <hi>England</hi> made, though it is but little more than
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94476:17"/>
twenty years ſince the ſtanding Revenue of that Kingdom did conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſurmount the Charge of it; yet our Kings ever ſince King <hi>John</hi>'s time have drawn large Supplies not only of Men, but alſo of Money, from <hi>Ireland.</hi> K. <hi>James</hi> and K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt received ſeveral Summs of Money thence, which with the advantages by Trade, and moſt of the fore-mentioned particulars have rendred <hi>Ireland</hi> conſiderable to <hi>England</hi> for near 500 years paſt.</p>
               <p>You take notice that our Nobility, Clergy and Gentry have imbibed a Notion, that the abatement of the Rents of Lands in <hi>England</hi> for twenty ſix years paſt have been occaſioned by the Improvements of <hi>Ireland</hi> in that time: And thence you raiſe your</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi>Third Query,</hi> Whether the Improvement of <hi>Ireland</hi> was not the cauſe of the Abatement of Rents of Lands in <hi>England?</hi> Or whence elſe hath it come that Rents of Lands have fallen one Fifth part ſince the Year <hi>1662.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO ſet you right in this matter, it's expedient that I lay before you the true ſtate of that Kingdom and its Trade, whereby you will be able to ſee the folly of our ſuſpicions, and the difficulty, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of receiving prejudice by the Improvement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at leaſt in this or the next Age, unleſs we enforce it by bearing too hard on them, as we did in the buſineſs of Cattel, and compel them to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Husbandry at home, and to more Forreign Trade, than they are any way diſpoſed to, or prepar'd for. And then I will ſhew you whence it is, that our Lands have fallen ſo much in their Rents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> is indeed an Iſland, that for extent of Acres, richneſs of Soyl, ſalubrity of Air, numerouſneſs of good Rivers and Havens, variety of Fiſhings, native Products, and materials fit to be improved into Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, Scituation for Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> comes behind few Iſlands in the, World. Yet it hath hitherto advanced but very little in Trade, Riches or Improvement. Although it hath for 518 years owned Subjection to <hi>England,</hi> and been in great meaſure Inhabited by <hi>Brittains,</hi> to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, That three fourths of the preſent Papiſts there, are of <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Extraction, who yet by the influence of that pernicious Religion, are as much diſpoſed to Miſchief and Barbarity, as the native <hi>Iriſh;</hi> yet I ſay the Trade and Improvements thereof are inconſiderable. The Cauſes whereof I apprehend to be theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94476:17"/>1. That the Popiſh Religion is retained by about five ſixth parts of the Inhabitants; which not only enjoins about 26 Idle or Holy-days more in a year than our Church; by expence on which, the loſs of ſo much time, and of what might be gained therein, the ill habits, and indiſpoſition to labour contracted by ſuch Idleneſs, and the ſpungings of their Clergy, by which, and the diſpleaſure of God on that Religion, (being that abomination that cauſeth deſolation) they are kept Poor. <hi>Hereby they are liable yearly to ſend much Money to</hi> Rome <hi>to purchaſe Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Pardons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they actually do ſo; And are alſo at the Charge of training up their Youth at St.</hi> Omers, Doway, Valadolid, <hi>and the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites Colledges in</hi> France, <hi>(which is a real drain to their Treaſure) where they are fitted for all Villany, and inſtructed how to trouble Church and State.</hi> And by Gods juſt Judgment for permitting that Religion, (whilſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compulſion it is ſo eaſie to reform them;) they are made Thorns in our ſides. Theſe (I ſay) make up one cauſe of the Poverty of that Kingdom, and will remain ſo, as long as their Idolatry is connived at.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second Cauſe of the Poverty of that Kingdom, is, the paucity of the Inhabitants, the whole number being reckoned to be but 1200000 Souls, whereof 300000 are Children, many by their quality exempt from Labour, and the reſt are few enough for Tillage and Husbandry, there being Ten Acres, of Land <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure profitable, and five unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in that Kingdom for each Soul in it. Hence it is, that in the Fiſhing Seaſon, the Merchants of that Kingdom pay 20000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> to <hi>Scotch</hi> Fiſher-men, that go from <hi>Scotland</hi> to take the Herrings and other Fiſh, that preſent themſelves to their Netts in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Harbours. To which may be added, the poor and mean way wherein above three fourths of them live, their Food, (tho' they live the midſt of plenty) being moſtly Milk and Potatoes; their Cloathing, Courſe Bandle Cloath and Linnen, both of their own making. A Pot, a Griddle whereon to Bake their Bread, a little Snuff, Salt, and Iron for their Plows, being almoſt all that they trouble the Merchant or Shop-keeper for. A little Hut, or Cabbin to Lodge in, is all that the generality of them ſeek, or have Ambition for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Cauſe of their Poverty (which is alſo an evidence of it,) is, the Raw and Unmanufactured condition of the Commodities they Export. The Bulk of their Exportations beſides Fiſh; is Wool, Raw-Hides, Flax, Linnen-Yarn, Cony-Skins, Sheep-Skins, Pelts, Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads and Barrel Staves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Add hereunto the few Markets that they have for theſe. They are Prohibited, carrying their Wool and Yarn to any Market but <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Carribbe</hi> Iſlands were their beſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for Beef, Pork, and Proviſions, which tho' we have left them Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to carry thither, together with Servants and Horſes, yet 'tis under
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94476:18"/>
ſuch hard conditions, that they are in a manner wholly cut off from that Trade. Theſe being ſo Bulkey, and of ſo little Value, that it requires two or three Cargoes of them to Lade one Ship back with Plantation Commodities. And we have Prohibited them to carry any of their Manufactures (which would have help'd in this Caſe) thither, except they enter, and pay the Duty for them in <hi>England,</hi> which on ſome Goods is twice, on others the whole value of the firſt coſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſmall quantity of Coin that is in that Kingdom, and the great diſproportion between that and the Payments of the Kingdom. To clear this, I will give you a rough, yet near and probable computation, what the Rents, publick Payments and Trade there doth require, or of what Money is neceſſary to put that Kingdom barely into a thriving condition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There ought to be in it as much Money, as one Years Rent of near Eight Millions of Acres profitable Land which are in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Houſes doth amount unto, which ſuppoſe to be 1100000 <hi>l.</hi> This is the Land-Lord and Tennants ſhare of the Caſh of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is neceſſary there be alſo ſo much Coin as one Years value of the Natural Products of the Kingdom does amount unto, at leaſt as the Commodities Exported in that time do come to. This is the Merchants and Trades mens ſhare of the Money, and in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be about 500000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. So much Money as one Years Revenue and Taxes does amount unto; which in <hi>Ireland</hi> is about 300000 <hi>l.</hi> or at leaſt ſo much as is the Charge of the Kingdom, which including Penſions was 243663 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. So much Caſh as the Tythes and Church Livings amount unto, which for 27 Biſhopricks, Deanries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and about 2200 Pariſhes; I'll reckon 200000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It's needful that there be Manufactures in a Kingdom to employ the Indigent, and keep them from Rapin and Violence; and if ſo, it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary there ſhould be ſo much Mony for that uſe as one Years Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture doth amount unto; for which (becauſe they are ſo few in kind, and little in quantity) we'll reckon but 40000<hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe five make up a neceſſary Capital of two Millions and 83663 <hi>l.</hi> Now did the Caſh of the Kingdom equal theſe requirements, Rents, Taxes and Tythes might be well and duely paid, the Scale of Trade move nimbly, and ſome Manufactures be carried on.</p>
               <p>But where the Caſh of a Kingdom doth not exceed the firſt, third, and fourth forementioned uſes, ſuch Kingdom is incapacitated to advance in Trade, Shipping, Manufactures or Improvements.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94476:18"/>
               <p>Such Deficiences of Caſh, (according to the Degree of it) occaſions cheapneſs of the Natural product of ſuch Kingdoms, ill payment of Rents, and Debts, and neceſſarily impoſe a low value upon Lands both in purchaſe, and Rent.</p>
               <p>The Paſſant Caſh of that Kingdom in its moſt flouriſhing condition, was never eſtimated to be 400000 <hi>l.</hi> but grant it be ſo much, yet that is leſs than one Fifth of what is neceſſary to enable the payment of Rents, Taxes, and Tythes, and to carry on the ſmall Trade of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſee the Fundamental Cauſe of the ill payments, Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Lands, ſmallneſs of Trade, and Poverty of that Kingdom, tho' not the only one.</p>
               <p>The want of Stock in Trade, is the reaſon why the moſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of that Kingdom are Exported by our Merchants, and not by the Merchants of that Kingdom, whereby the profit made on them in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Market accrues to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Cauſe of the Poverty of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is, the high intereſt that Money is at there, being by Law 10 <hi>per cent,</hi> beſides Procuration, and Continuation Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the needy pay alſo. This is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent and proof of the former, and that which cuts the Nerves, and Hamſtrings of Induſtry. For as Scarcity of Coin, keeps the Natural Products of a Country at a low rate; ſo high Intereſt both hinders their being Manufactured, and advances the price of them when Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured, that they cannot be afforded ſo Cheap at Forreign Markets, as the like Manufactures raiſed where intereſt of Mony is low.</p>
               <p>If here it be Objected, that the Cheapneſs of Wool (as to the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufacture) will countervail the diſadvantage of high intereſt: It's anſwered, that it will not, for 12 Pound of Wool which coſts but two Shillings dearer in <hi>England</hi> than there, will make a piece of Serge that may ſtand ſome in 3 <hi>l.</hi> ſome in 4 <hi>l.</hi> or two pieces of Stuff that may together ſtand in as much; the price of the Wool being ſo ſmall a part of the Disburſe, will not countervail the high intereſt on the reſt. But beſides this, there being but little Manufacture there, and not full work for Tuckers, Dyers, Dreſſers, Calenders, Hot-Preſſers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there, as there is here, the rate of theſe there, is double to what it is here; and ſo is their Oyl, Dying Stuffs and Forreign Materials, moſt of which they carry from <hi>England,</hi> for which at a high value they pay 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> for Cuſtoms and Exciſe on their Importation.</p>
               <p>It is the leaſt skilful of our Workmen that go thither, and even the skilful there meet with a great inaptitude in the People to Manufacture, tho' they ought to be content with them for their own uſe, yet they
<pb facs="tcp:94476:19"/>
cannot perfect them ſo as to be able to Sell them as to any Tolerable price in the ſame Market with ours.</p>
               <p>A pregnant Inſtance whereof we had a few Years ſince. Some of our Merchants thought to make conſiderable advantage by Buying Bayes (like thoſe of <hi>Colcheſter</hi>) in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and gave Commiſſion for large quantities which were bought up, whereupon there was a great ſpurt of Trade for that Commodity for a little time. But notwithſtanding <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> Bayes is the eaſieſt part of the Woollen Manufacture to be made, imitated and perfected, yet when thoſe made in <hi>Ireland</hi> came to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the true <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Bayes in <hi>Spain,</hi> they differed ſo much for the worſe, that on a ſudden the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Weavers loſt their Trade, and ſome of them were Ruined by thoſe that were left on their hands, not being able to find a Market for them. Here you alſo ſee one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they Export moſt part of their Commodities Raw and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manufactured.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A ſixth Cauſe of <hi>Irelands</hi> Poverty, is, the Cheapneſs of Lands in that Kingdom, and eaſineſs to ſubſiſt, with the difficulties that attend Trade there, which makes their Merchants turn Purchaſers as ſoon as they have gotten as much as will maintain their Families; whereby the ſtock in Trade there is ſmall. For it's obſerved, that tho' many there gain a Livelihood by Trade, yet very few of the Merchants of that Kingdom have acquired conſiderable, or competent Eſtates, for the reaſons before mentioned, and becauſe of the many Cloggs that lie on this Trade, which will herein after be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Add to theſe their improvidence, the prodigality and exceſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, in the Conſumption of Forreign wares, moſtly ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they might well be without. As fine Cloath, Stuffs, Silks-Laces, Haberdaſhery, and the reſt that I have before enumerated, which they derive wholly from <hi>England.</hi> As alſo ſome that they have from other Countries: Above 3000 Tuns of Wine and Brandy have been Imported and Conſumed in that Kingdom in one Year. Some Vices and ſome Vertues ſeem to adhere to the Soil of moſt Countries, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Inhabitants are changed. Thus Luxury and Hoſpitality to moſt plentiful Countries; and ſo to <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpecially in Houſekeeping, wherein they exceed us as far as we do the Frugal <hi>Dutch,</hi> and ſo are no Savers by the great Plenty of the Country.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The unintereſſed (and frequent change) of the chief Governors who are moſtly ſent them from <hi>England,</hi> who tranſmit all that they get above their neceſſary Expence into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:94476:19"/>9. The frequency of Rebellions in that Kingdom (which diſcourages and deſtroys all Improvements) occaſioned by the folly and negligence of <hi>England,</hi> and the influence the Papiſts have always had on our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; ſo that on their reduction they have conſtantly found ſuch Favour as to be left in Condition to renew their Rebellions at Pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Cauſe of <hi>Irelands</hi> Poverty is the Clogs and Reſtraints on their Trade, partly by <hi>England,</hi> partly by their own Parliament, who, by a perpetual Law, have incapacitated the growth or increaſe of their Trade, eſpecially ſo as that it cannot interfere with the Trade of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truth is, both Parliaments have been impoſed on, partly by ſome Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms here; who to fix themſelves the better in their Seats, and at once to ingratiate themſelves at Court, and with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants that deal to the Plantations, pretended they could greatly encreaſe that branch of the Revenue by impoſing hard things on <hi>Ireland.</hi> Partly by two ſets of Men who deſigned the farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cuſtoms and Exciſe in both Kingdoms; and actually did Farm part of them here. Theſe by their Creatures in that Parliament, wherein were ſome Penſionaries; under pretence of advancing Trade, and the Rents of Lands in <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> gained ſeveral Acts to be paſſed very diſadvantagious to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Plantations, and of little or no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to <hi>England.</hi> Particularly thoſe that bar the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> from carrying any <hi>Aſian, African,</hi> or <hi>European</hi> Commodities to any of the Plantations, but Proviſion, Servants and Horſes, except they be brought into, entred, and pay Cuſtom in <hi>England,</hi> and be bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn hither with the proceed likewiſe.</p>
               <p>As the Plantations heavily complain of theſe Acts, ſo do the People of <hi>Ireland.</hi> I have ſeen certain Reaſons drawn up in <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt thoſe Acts, too many and too long to be here inſerted. Yet being they fall in with the preſent Subject. I will mention ſome of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That as <hi>Ireland</hi> is the Antienteſt and nobleſt, ſo is it the moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Acquiſition of <hi>England.</hi> Not only by taking off annually great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of the natural and artificial Commodities thereof: But alſo of <hi>Aſian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Commodities; (two thirds of the Importations of <hi>Ireland</hi> being from <hi>England</hi>) by employing conſiderable numbers of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, by the yearly Rents of the Eſtates of ſuch as live in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and of Abſentees tranſmitted hither, by the Charge of Students at the Univerſities and Inns of Court, Income of the Poſt-Office; Summs carried away by chief Governours, the ſurpluſſage of the Revenue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much of all which is carried into <hi>England</hi> in Caſh.</p>
               <p>That the Commodities exported from <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>England</hi> are all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or uſeful to <hi>England.</hi> But that the Commodities imported thither from <hi>England,</hi> are ſuperfluous, and ſuch as <hi>Ireland</hi> may, or muſt be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94476:20"/>
without, (to the prejudice of <hi>England</hi>) except there be a relaxation of the preſent Severities put on that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Ireland</hi> being planted with <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under the ſame Sovereign, under almoſt all the ſame Laws with <hi>England,</hi> in ſome reſpect under the ſame Legiſlative Power, (for Laws made in <hi>England,</hi> wherein <hi>Ireland</hi> is named, bind <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi>) <hi>Ireland</hi> is by theſe, and ſeveral other ways in a manner Incorporated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one Body with <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>In thoſe Acts they note two things; the ends of them, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of them</p>
               <p>The ends of them are, to keep the Plantations in a firm Dependance on <hi>England,</hi> to appropriate the Trade to, and from them to <hi>England.</hi> And that <hi>England</hi> may be a ſtaple for the Plantation Commodities. They ſay all theſe Ends (ſave in one little particular of ſmall moment to <hi>England,</hi> but of great Importance to <hi>Ireland</hi>) are infallibly ſecured to <hi>England</hi> without theſe Acts of Reſtraint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt, they ſay, That the Merchants of <hi>Ireland</hi> are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Extraction; and having many Plantations in theſe Iſlands, are part Proprietors; that it cannot be imagined that their Trade and yearly ſending many of his Majeſties Subjects thither, can weaken, but rather firm their Dependance on <hi>England,</hi> which confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly in thoſe Acts cannot be ſupplyed from, or not without great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to <hi>England.</hi> And which elſe muſt be ſupplyed with more Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, to the Hazard, if not Ruin and loſs of thoſe Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</p>
               <p>As to another End, which is, That <hi>England</hi> may ſupply thoſe Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with all <hi>Aſian, African,</hi> and <hi>European</hi> Commodities. They ſay that <hi>Ireland</hi> hath not been accuſtomed to ſend any of theſe, except thoſe of the Growth, or Manufacture of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Plantations, <hi>nor can they ſend any other if they had full Liberty. For by the Act of Cuſtoms in</hi> Ireland, <hi>all Wines, Tobacco, wrought Silks, all Haberdaſhery Wares, and all ſorts of Grocery Wares imported into</hi> Ireland, <hi>pay a great Custom, and draw back no part of that Duty on Exportation. The Law there denying the Merchant that Priviledge.</hi> By which Clauſe <hi>England</hi> is ſecured that the Merchants of <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot ſupply the Plantations with any Wines, Silks, Haberdaſhery, or Grocery. <hi>And by another Clauſe in that Act, the Merchants of</hi> Ireland <hi>are rendred uncapable to ſupply the Plantations — or any other part of the World with any Commodities whatſoever, which is once Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into that Kingdom;</hi> The Clauſe is this; <q>That all Forreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, except Wines and Tobacco, and thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations imported into <hi>Ireland</hi> by a Denizon from any the Parts or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beyond the Seas, other than <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> ſhall for ever pay one third more in Subſidy over and above the Subſidy payable for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94476:20"/>
ſame according to the Book of Rates, and every Stranger double, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> It is to be noted, That moſt Commodities but what <hi>Ireland</hi> conſtantly derives, or are ſupplyed with from <hi>England,</hi> are valued in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> book of Rates, at a higher value than the ſame Commodities are valued in the book of Rates in <hi>England. So that according to the intrinſick value of the Commodities, all Forreign Goods pay almoſt</hi> 10 per Cent. <hi>Cuſtom on Importation into</hi> Ireland, except what they have from <hi>England.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſay they, he that reads the Acts for Cuſtoms and Exciſe in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will imagine that the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> was in the Conſpiracy to ruin the Trade of that Kingdom. For though it is known, that theſe and other ſevere Clauſes in thoſe Acts were added in <hi>England</hi> when the Bills were ſent into <hi>England</hi> for Approbation; yet they were allowed and paſſed into Acts by the Parliament of <hi>Ireland. So that upon the whole, they conceive it clear as the light at Noon-day, That</hi> England <hi>can furniſh the Plantations, and all the World, with</hi> Aſian, African, <hi>and</hi> European <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,</hi> 6 <hi>if not</hi> 8 per Cent. <hi>cheaper than 'tis poſſible for the Merchants of</hi> Ireland <hi>to do it;</hi> which is a full ſecurity of that Trade to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the third End of thoſe Acts in <hi>England,</hi> that barr their Trade to the Plantations, which is, That <hi>England</hi> may be a Staple to all the World for the Plantation Commodities.</p>
               <p>The Merchants of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſay, this alſo is infallibly aſſured to <hi>England,</hi> though Liberty ſhould be allowed them to trade to the Plantations. As to all the World, <hi>Ireland</hi> only excepted; Not only for ſome of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given under the former head, which take Place likewiſe here; but alſo becauſe, although Plantation Commodities (ſince the additional Duties were added) pay a higher duty on Importation into <hi>England,</hi> than they pay on Importation into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Yet on Exportation out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they leave much more of the Duty behind, than they do on Exportation from <hi>England.</hi> To inſtance only in two of them. Ginger on Importation into <hi>Ireland</hi> pays 12 <hi>d. per</hi> hundred weight Cuſtom, and on Exportation draws back no part of that duty. Ginger exported out of <hi>England</hi> leaves behind.</p>
               <p>Tobacco (which is the moſt conſiderable of all the Plantation Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities) Imported into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and again exported thence, leaves in the Kings hands one penny <hi>per</hi> pound behind; but exported out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and,</hi> it leaves but a half penny behind, which is the eighth or tenth part of the value of that Commodity. <hi>So that</hi> England <hi>will certainly remain a Staple for theſe Commodities to all the World, except</hi> Ireland, <hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding full Liberty of Trade to the Plantations ſhould be, allowed the Merchants of</hi> Ireland. For that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants can ſell Tobacco 10 or 12 <hi>per Cent.</hi> at leaſt, and Ginger <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper than the Merchants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo likewiſe all other Plantation Commodities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94476:21"/>The ſecond thing they note in thoſe Acts, that prohibite the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Ireland</hi> to trade to the Plantations, but through <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> is the reaſon of them, which forms the Equity of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Plantations are Peopled with his Majeſties Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>England</hi> hath and doth daily ſuffer great Prejudice by tranſporting great numbers to thoſe Plantations for the Peopling of them.</p>
               <p>To this the Merchants of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſay, That in Fact it is moſt certain, that a full Moiety or near it, of all the working Whites, and many of the Proprietors in all the <hi>Caribbe</hi> Iſlands, and at leaſt three fourths of the Whites on <hi>Montſerat</hi> are of the People of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that if thoſe Plantations had not for many years been ſupplyed with People, cheriſhed and furniſhed with Victuals at low Rates from <hi>Ireland,</hi> they had periſhed, or not come to what they are. For had they been neceſſitated to have paid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rates for Food, they could not have ſubſiſted. So that, (ſay they) If <hi>Ireland</hi> hath not only in a great meaſure ſuſtained them, but alſo are part Proprietors, and have in a great meaſure Peopled them, and are daily ſending People thither, where they are needed; then <hi>Ireland</hi> is within the Reaſon of thoſe Acts, and (as they conceive) ought not to be debarred Commerce with them, at leaſt for their own Products, and Manufacture, which is all that they deſire Liberty for.</p>
               <p>They ſay, it ſeems to be a great Severity, (being they are of the People of <hi>England</hi>) that they ſhould be treated as Forreigners: And were the Tables turned, and their Brethren of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Legiſlators would think the Laws at leaſt unkind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it ſeems hard, that an</hi> Engliſh man, <hi>becauſe he goes to inhabit in</hi> Ireland, <hi>or is ſent thither to help to ſecure that Conqueſt to</hi> England, <hi>ſhould therefore loſe a great part of the Priviledge of an</hi> Engliſh man, <hi>and be treated as a Forreigner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That theſe Restraints tend towards untwisting or weakning our threefold Cord, by alienating (if it were poſſible) the Hearts of the People from</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and ſeem rather to be deſigned by</hi> France, <hi>than to flow from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temper of an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the ſame Parliament that Enacted thoſe Laws, were ſo ſenſible of the Advantages <hi>England</hi> reaps by <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that it is the Intereſt of this Kingdom to cheriſh That, that they comprehended <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Act of Navigation; and allowed the People and Ships thereof the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges as to the People and Ships of <hi>England.</hi> As an acknowledgment whereof, the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> by their Act of Navigation, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the like Privileges to the People and Ships of <hi>England</hi> as to their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:94476:21"/>That as to the <hi>Virginia</hi> Trade, which brings greateſt Advantage to his Majeſty, the Merchants of <hi>Ireland</hi> are in a manner wholly cut off from that Trade, except they will drive it to the utter Ruin of the Kingdom. (which they reſolve not to do) For neither Proviſion, nor Horſes will go off at <hi>Virginia,</hi> nor are Servants to be had to ſuch numbers as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that Trade; And the Export of their Manufacture is prohibited. So that if they will drive that Trade, they muſt do it with Caſh, and turn all the little Money they have into Smoak, or be at the exceſſive charge, double hazard and expence of time, to come unto, and return through <hi>England</hi> with that (as all other Plantation Commodities) which hath occaſioned frequent loſs of Seaſons, and of Ships and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go's to the loſs of the Duty to his Majeſty, and Ruin of many Merchants, as they made appear in very many deplorable Inſtances, too long to be here inſerted.</p>
               <p>They ſay, That whereas by an Act of the 25. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. For better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Plantation Trade, It is Enacted, That if any Ship or Veſſel, which by Law may Trade in any of the Plantations, ſhall come to take on board any Plantation Commodities, and that Bond ſhall not be firſt given, with ſufficient Surety to bring them to <hi>England, Wales,</hi> or <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> That there ſhall be paid there on white Sugars 5 <hi>s. per Cent.</hi> on <hi>Muſcovados</hi> 8 <hi>d. per Cent.</hi> on Tobacco 1 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome eaſe to the diſtreſſed Merchants of <hi>Ireland</hi> in returning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being neceſſitated to come to <hi>England</hi> to enter. <hi>Yet that door alſo hath been ſhut against</hi> Ireland <hi>by the Artifice of the Arbitrary Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms in</hi> England. <hi>For contrary to the plain Import of that Law, There was a Ship of</hi> England <hi>which paid that Duty in the Plantations, ſeized and condemned, under pretence that that Act was only intended for the Trade between Plantation and Plantation, although there is nothing in the Act that gives Countenance to that Conſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That tho' the Manufactures of <hi>Ireland</hi> are few, and that the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of them is Linnen, which interferes not with the Manufacture of <hi>England,</hi> and that the quantity exported in times of Free Trade to the Plantations was but ſmall, yet the Suſtenance of a good number of the moſt neceſſitous of their People depended wholly on that little, and that they cannot ſubſiſt barely by Air, more than the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That by reaſon of the eaſineſs to ſubſiſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Reſtraints on. Trade, the difficulty, if not impoſſibility (now) to grow rich by 'Trade, and the cheapneſs of Land; Merchants are inclined to purchaſe rather than Trade. That from hence; and the mean way of living of the Natives, paucity of Inhabitants, little demand of the Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in Forreign Markets, the want of any peculiar Commodity,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94476:22"/>
as Tinn is to <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> It appears there is little reaſon why the Gentry and Merchants of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be ſo jealous as they are of the Improvement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the growth of its Trade, and leſs why they ſhould bear ſo hard on it.</p>
               <p>That albeit Liberty is granted to the Merchants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſend Proviſions, Servants and Horſes to the Plantations; yet Proviſions and Horſes being of great ſtowage, and ſmall value, It requires two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes of them to lade one Ship home. And it is not to be expected that the whole proceed ſhould in the ſame Voyage be turned into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity for return. Hence it becomes abſolutely neceſſary for them to carry ſome ſmall parcels of the Manufacture of <hi>Ireland</hi> with Proviſions, Servants and Horſes, to enable a Cargo for the Ships return, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn half or one third empty, which doubles the Charge of Fraight, and Charge on the Commodities returned. Or if they will not do this, they muſt carry Money to <hi>England</hi> to buy, and take in ſome Manufacture there, which doubles the hazard and charge, and by loſs of time, and contrary Winds occaſion loſs of Seaſons, and often of Ships and Goods. And if any of the Woollen Manufacture of <hi>Ireland</hi> be brought to enter here (in order to ſend them to the Plantations) the half duty on them in <hi>England,</hi> is in ſome the whole, in others the half of their firſt Coſt. Which how hard ſoever, yet they muſt not (as the caſe ſtands) upon any eaſier terms trade to thoſe parts, tho' part of the Dominions of their natural Prince, and in a great meaſure peopled and ſupported by themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſince the Prohibition of Cattle to</hi> England, <hi>and as an effect thereof, the Merchants of</hi> Ireland <hi>have in return for Beef, Tallow, Hides,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that Kingdom with many Commodities from Forreign Parts, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Prohibition, were brought only from</hi> England. <hi>And that if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint be continued on their Manufactures to the Plantations, They will be neceſſitated to truck their Manufactures in</hi> Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. <hi>for Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and other Commodities which they uſed to have from the Plantations, and from</hi> England. <hi>Where if once their Manufactures be brought into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the prejudice to</hi> England <hi>will be a thouſand times greater than can ariſe from their carrying ſmall quantities of them to the Plantations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Condition of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the forementioned reſpects is very deplorable. For notwithſtanding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there are liable annually to <hi>England</hi> for thoſe vaſt Summs before mentioned, yet they are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to ſend their Sheep, Cattle, Beef, Pork or Butter (the product of their Land) hither. Nor can they ſend their Manufacture, the only Employment of their People hither, nor to any of the Plantations, no, not ſo much as Cloaths for their Servants. If they ſend Servants, they muſt not ſend Cloaths with them for one year, nor ſo much as handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94476:22"/>
to recommend them to a Market; nor Brandy ſufficient for their Voyage, leſt any ſhould be left at their Arrival. If they ſend Horſes they muſt not ſend a new Bridle. If they do in any of theſe Caſes tranſgreſs, they are ſure to be ruined by the Commanders of the Ships of <hi>England</hi> that watch that Trade, as many have been. They are by <hi>England</hi> prohibited to Plant Tobacco to employ their Lands at Home that is laid waſte. <hi>All which (ſay they) renders</hi> Ireland <hi>and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants thereof fit Objects of his Majeſty and the Parliaments Compaſſion, which they hope will in due time be extended to them, the hard Circumſtances in which they we being once underſtood by their Brethren of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>It is ſome Relief to thoſe that imagine themſelves under preſſures to be permitted to utter their Complaints. Thus I have (out of their own Mouths) given you part of the anxious reaſonings of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> about the Cloggs laid on the Trade of that Kingdom by <hi>England.</hi> Whereunto I ſhall add one more, which by reaſon of the weight and importance of it to <hi>England,</hi> I am not willing to omit; and it is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That if theſe Reſtraints be intended to compel them to take off more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from</hi> England, <hi>or that they ſhould Trade only with</hi> England, <hi>They are ill deſigned: For that according to the State, into which</hi> England <hi>hath brought the Trade of that Kingdom, (as is before ſet forth) it is impoſſible for the people of</hi> Ireland <hi>to enlarge their Trade with</hi> England. <hi>For ſhould they buy more of</hi> England <hi>than they do, and have done for five years paſt, they are (by theſe Prohibitions) rendred uncapable to pay for it. Bat on the contrary,</hi> England <hi>hath (by theſe Reſtraints) laid an abſolute neceſſity on</hi> Ireland <hi>to take off leſs of the Product and Manufacturies of</hi> England <hi>than they have formerly taken off. For when they enjoyed liberty to carry their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, as well as Proviſions to the Plantations, they uſually brought the Product of them into</hi> England, <hi>which they Trucked for</hi> Engliſh <hi>Commodities, or therewith paid their Debts here; or if they paid Duty, and Exported them to</hi> Holland, <hi>&amp;c. they returned the proceed of them into</hi> England, <hi>and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the uſes before-mentioned. But ſeeing</hi> England <hi>hath not only ſhut, but faſt lockt this Door alſo againſt them, they muſt now (though with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret) to the prejudice of</hi> England, <hi>neceſſarily ſeek new Trade, and ſupply themſelves for future from Places where they can vend their Native Products, and Manufactures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever there is in their former reaſonings, I am of Opinion, that this laſt deſerves due conſideration, as being of importance to the Trade of <hi>England.</hi> But here I'll put an end to the exerciſe of your patience as to that particular.</p>
               <p>As to the Cloggs laid on their Trade by their own Parliament, they have fallen in, and been mentioned with thoſe laid on them by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94476:23"/>
the moſt conſiderable being that Clauſe in the Act of Cuſtoms, which impoſeth one third more Subſidy on all Commodities Imported into <hi>Ireland,</hi> except thoſe Imported from <hi>England</hi> or the Plantations. This they ſay was added to the Bill in <hi>England.</hi> However it was paſſed by their own Parliament, and is in effect, or was intended by thoſe which added it, as a Prohibition of their Trade with any part of the World, but <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another diſcouragement which they alledge, is the exorbitant Fines in the Act for Exciſe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as loſs of Franchiſes, Impriſonment, and the Barbarous Corporal Puniſhments to be inflicted thereby, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are ſuch, That Merchant and Slave in <hi>Ireland</hi> are convertible terms; and had indeed been fitter to have been impoſed on Slaves at <hi>Algier</hi> than on Free-born <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men.</p>
               <p>If the view I have given you of the Trade and Condition of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath not ſatisfied you, that it is not the Improvement of that Kingdom that hath leſſened the Rents of Lands in <hi>England,</hi> I preſume the anſwer to the ſecond part of the Inquiry we are upon will fully do it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the Query, is, <hi>What have been the Cauſes that have occaſioned the Rents of Lands to have abated or fallen one fifth part, or conſiderably ſince the year</hi> 1662?</p>
               <p>This Query ſuppoſeth, That Lands generally throughout <hi>England</hi> did in 1662. or thereabout, yield conſiderably more Rent than now they do. I was deſirous to inform my ſelf as to the certainty of it, leſt this unhappineſs ſhould have been only particular to your ſelf and ſome few about you, I had the curioſity to inquire in <hi>Survey</hi> (fifteen Miles from <hi>London</hi>) whether like Abatements had hapned there as in your parts of the Countrey; and I had many Inſtances given me where ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parcels of Land which in 1662. and 1663. yielded 50 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> are now ſet (upon the Rack-rent) at 22 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and ſo proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for greater and leſs quantities of Land: So that being confirmed in the Truth of the matter of Fact, I have therefore the more ſtudiouſly enquired into the cauſes thereof.</p>
               <p>To reſolve this Query to ſatisfaction, it is neceſſary that we retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Condition of <hi>England</hi> unto the time when Lands were at a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low and mean value as to the Rents of them; and if we can find what it was that raiſed them to thoſe high Rents they yielded about 1662. it is probable that that will direct or help us to find the true cauſes of their Abatement.</p>
               <p>To go no further back than the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. we ſhall find, That <hi>England</hi> had no Manufactures, few Ships, little or no Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but a little Leather, beſides Wool, and Wool-fells, of which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 30000, at other times 10000 Sacks was Annually Exported (for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94476:23"/>
Cuſtom of which that King received 25000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi>) <hi>England</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had nor affected Trade further than in our own Seas, and to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> or not to any purpoſe; but lived wholly, or moſtly by Tillage, and Paſturage of Cattel. So that being deſtitute of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture and Trade, Lands yielded leſs Rent in <hi>England</hi> at that time, than they did in <hi>Ireland</hi> thirty four years ago (which was ſoon after that Kingdom had been depopulated by the Rebellion of 1641.) when good Land was ſet at 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Acre.</p>
               <p>This is evident by the low Rate of Proviſions in <hi>London</hi> in this Reign, where a fat Ox was ſold for 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> a fat Sheep 6 <hi>d.</hi> five Pidgeons 1 <hi>d.</hi> a Quarter of Wheat 2 <hi>s.</hi> a fat Gooſe 2 <hi>d.</hi> The products of the Fields being ſo cheap the Rents of Lands muſt needs be very low.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stow</hi> tells us that in this Kings Reign, a Tax of 5 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> being laid on each Pariſh in <hi>England.</hi> That 112 <hi>l.</hi> was abated to <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the like Summ to <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> becauſe of-the extream Poverty of thoſe Counties: But ſince they have become the Seat of ſeveral Manufactures, the Caſe is much mended with them.</p>
               <p>This Wiſe and Warlike King being as Maſculine in his Councels, as Valiant in Arms, projected at once the enlarging of his Dominions, and the enriching of them. He obſerved that his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wools were Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> wrought up there, and part of them return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Draperies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with vaſt advantage to the Manufacturers and to thoſe Provinces. <hi>And underſtanding that ſome of the Corporate Cities and Towns where the Weavers had Seated themſelves, had by hard and unkind Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and uſage, diſguſted many of their Brethren that dwelt in Country Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages. The King took the advantage thereof, and by the offer of many large Immunities and Priviledges, invited ſeveral of them to remove into</hi> England, where they were ſure to Buy Wool Cheap, and Sell Cloth dear. <hi>For their further</hi> encouragement, the King paid the Charge of <hi>their Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, gave them Freedom in Corporations, with many peculiar priviledges, Houſe-Rent free for ſome Years, defray'd the Charge of their Families out of his Exchequer, until their Labour brought in a competency for them;</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the wearing of any Courſe Forreign Cloth. <hi>
                     <hi>This had</hi> its deſired effect, for thereon many of the Clothiers with their dependents removed and ſettled in</hi> England. Whereby the Scale of the Trade of the Kingdom did much alter for the better by the <hi>28th.</hi> Year of that Kings Reign, for by that time Cloth was made in <hi>England,</hi> not only in good meaſure for home ſupply, but alſo ſome Courſe ſort for Exportation, as appears by the following Ballance of the Trade of that Year Recorded in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer. By which we may ſee as the State and ſmalneſs of the Trade of the Kingdom, ſo alſo the great Parſimony of thoſe times.</p>

               <p>The bringing in of theſe few Manufacturers inſtantly put the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into a thriving condition; for although it added but 16266 <hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> to the Exportations of this year, yet it ſo far decreaſed the Importations, as that there was 255214 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> added to the Stock of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Foundation firſt laid of the Succeeding Trade, Wealth and Opulence of <hi>England.</hi> Henceforward this Kingdom encreaſed in Trade, Shipping and Wealth; Lands yielded better Rents, and the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94476:24"/>
products of it a better price, for in 1520. the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's Reign, a fat Oxe in <hi>London</hi> was commonly ſold for 26 <hi>s.</hi> a fat Wether 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> which allowing for the different value of the Coin is twice as much in the firſt, and above three times as much in the laſt. For Silver and Coin was 20 <hi>d. per</hi> Ounce in <hi>Edward</hi> III's. time, and was advanced to 40 <hi>d. per</hi> Ounce and no more in 1520.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſtep <hi>was the diſſolving of Abbeys and Monaſteries.</hi> By this, and the caſting off the Popes Supremacy, the power of the Clergy, and their concern in Civil Affairs abated, to the great benefit of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Until this was done, the Drones ſuckt moſt of the Honey, and ſtarv'd the induſtrious Bees. But when thoſe Livings came into Lay-hands, the Rents and Money which before was hoarded up in Coffers came into the Publick Stock of the Kingdom, and circulated. <hi>I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſtripping the truly worthy reverend painful Clergy, I think they deſerve good pay and double honour. I would not have the labouring Oxen muzzled, nor the Labourers hire leſſened; Let them preach the Goſpel, proſper and live honourably by it.</hi> Yet I am of Opinion they do always beſt and are moſt happy where they keep within their own Province. There is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to accompliſh a States man than School and Book-learning; <hi>the retired Education of the generality of the Clergy-men begets a temper unfit for Civil Government. Chriſt was ſo far from committing that to his Diſciples, that he cautioned or prohibited their intermedling in it.</hi> Not only the Subjects, but even the greateſt Princes in the Land have been ſhocked and made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy by the Pride and Ambition of Popiſh Prelates, (<hi>Becket</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.) But now that Yoke, and the Popes were in a great meaſure caſt off to the unſpeakable advantage of Prince and people.</p>
               <p>In moſt places where Clergy men ſhare in the Government the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are unhappy, as in <hi>Italy</hi> and other Kingdoms, but where ever they govern Solely, the people are miſerable, as in the Popes Dominions If the pregnant Inſtances hereof given by Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> (in his preſent Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>England</hi> ſtated) do not convince all Mankind of this Truth, ſurely the late Improvement of thoſe Inſtances by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his five Letters will do it.</p>
               <p>The third happy ſtep towards the enriching of this Kingdom, <hi>was the Reformation of Religion,</hi> for this contributes to the enriching a People, not only by the Bleſſing of God, which hath always attended the National receiving and conſcientious practice of the true Religion, but alſo in that the nature of it is to civilize and moralize Men; to make them ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and diligent, and ſo tends to enrich them.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtant Religion as it makes men more diligent, ſober and induſtrious in their Callings than the Popiſh Religion, ſo it tends more to the enriching of them, in that it enjoins (as hath been obſerved)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94476:25"/>
fewer Idle days, which expoſe men to expence, breeds and begets ill habits, and an inaptitude to buſineſs and labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Companions of Superſtition and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suppoſe the working people of</hi> England <hi>to be but four Millions, and that the Labour of each Perſon be valued but</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> per <hi>day, their work for one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to one hundred thouſand pounds; which for twenty four days that they keep— in a year more than the twenty nine days obſerved by the Church of</hi> England, <hi>amounts to Two Millions and four hundred thouſand pounds Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> per Annum, which of it ſelf is ſufficient on the one hand to impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh and on the other to enrich a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Another advantage we received by entertaining the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and caſting off of Popery, was, That the greateſt part of that Money which went yearly to <hi>Rome</hi> for Pardons and Indulgences was ſaved to the Kingdom; which was no ſmall Summ.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſtep towards the enriching of the Kingdom accompanied or immediately followed our breaking off from (that Mother of Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations) the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ſent us as a Bleſſing from Heaven for that Separation, <hi>was the Serge, Say, and Stuff Trade, with all our new Draperies,</hi> which have vaſtly contributed to the Wealth of the Kingdom, and raiſing the Rents of our Lands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antwerp</hi> had for a long time been, and now was the greateſt Seat of Trade in the whole World, and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> of Manufacture: Thence we were ſupplied with all ſorts of new Draperies, and Fabrick of Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although Trade be the beſt humoured Lady in the World, yet ſhe is ſo great a lover of quiet and repoſe, and ſo ſenſible that ſhe carries her welcome with her where-ever ſhe goes, that ſhe expects to be Courted and Accommodated with Peace, Liberty and Security; where either of the two latter are denied, or taken from her, ſhe frequently removes, and carries Plenty, Wealth and Honour along with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignorance is the profeſſed Mother of the Devotion of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>Slavery and Poverty her two Daughters: Covetouſneſs, Cruelty and Ambition inſeparable from that Hierarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords Inquiſitors, and Biſhops of</hi> Spain, <hi>obſerved that Merchants and Manufacturers were not only a Richer, but alſo a more ſober, thinking, knowing ſort of people than others, more curious about what they entertain in matters of Religion, than the Debauched part of the Gentry, and common people; nor ſo much Prieſt-ridden, nor ſo eaſily cheated out of their Souls and Money. They longed to be fingering their Wealth; But the diſtance of the</hi> Netherlands <hi>from</hi> Spain <hi>did not permit them ſingly to ſtrip this ſort of People. Therefore theſe</hi> Hamans <hi>reſolve the Deſtruction of all that diſſented from their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Canons in thoſe Provinces; And rather than fail of their extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94476:25"/>
the moderate men, though of their own perſwaſion, muſt go to Pot. Having gained the Sole Direction of</hi> Philip <hi>the Second of</hi> Spain, <hi>they had as it were both Swords put into their Hands; and the World hath ſeen how they uſed them. They put thoſe Provinces into ſuch Convulſions as enfeebled the Monarchy of</hi> Spain, <hi>which from that time may date its Declenſion.</hi> Theſe Right Reverend Fathers appointed Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> Governour General of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> a Man of a fierce, cruel, bloody inflexible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (a fit Servant for ſuch Maſters) yet they thought it too great an Honour for him being a Lay-man, ſolely to engroſs ſo great a Stock of Merit as was to be acquired by the Ruin and Murder of ſuch Multitudes, as were then to be Sacrificed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cruelty. To Sanctifie the Villany, the Clergy muſt ſhare in it. <q>They therefore appointed fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen new Biſhops to be ſet up in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who ſhould be free from all Secular Power and Juriſdiction, even in caſe of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That all Commerce, Negotiations, Liberties and Priviledges ſhould be overthrown. That all (in the <hi>Netherlands</hi>) ſhould be reduced to extream Poverty, that thereby that Countrey ſhould be aſſured to them, and to <hi>Spain.</hi>

               <p>Theſe were part of the Inſtructions given by the Holy Fathers to Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> and the new Biſhops, who acted their parts to purpoſe in this Tragedy, for on <hi>D' Alva</hi>'s return into <hi>Spain,</hi> he boaſted that he having done the beſt he could to root out all Herefie, <hi>he cauſed</hi> 18000 <hi>perſons to be put to death in Six years by the ordinary Miniſters of Juſtice,</hi> beſides numbers that had been cut off by the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>It had been happy for theſe Kingdoms if theſe Inſtructions had been confined to thoſe Provinces, and had not in part been copied, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed here, as well as in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> I will not intermeddle
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94476:26"/>
with the direful effects of theſe Eccleſiaſtical Politiques further, than as to the influence they had on the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which were the greateſt Seat of Trade and Manufacture in the whole World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As ſoon as the peaceable Merchants and Manufacturers began to be toſt and teaſed between the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Courts, when once the ingenuous induſtrious Artizans and Traders could no longer quietly enjoy the fruits of their Labours, nor (as much as by connivance) be permitted to ſerve God according to his own Command and Will, nor yet (though they continued Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters) be ſafe, except they would be active and inſtrumental in plucking up the Foundations of Liberty and Property, to ſet up a Tyrannical and Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant power in Church and State, they thought it high time to remove; and this Perſecution in the</hi> Netherlands <hi>happening about</hi> Anno 1566. <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporizing with the Eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Religion in</hi> England, <hi>and the Liberty given in the beginning of Q.</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s Reign; very many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures were thereby allured over into</hi> England, <hi>and ſettled in ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, as</hi> London, Canterbury, Norwich, Colcheſter, <hi>&amp;c. where both</hi> French, Walloons <hi>and</hi> Dutch <hi>had ſeveral Priviledges granted them, were allowed Churches, with Liberty to ſerve God in their own way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive Simplicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A great part of them removed into <hi>Holland,</hi> and the other United Provinces, when once they undertook the defence of their juſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Priviledges, and allowed Men to ſerve God without the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others that were of the Popiſh Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, ſome into <hi>Italy, but moſt into</hi> France, <hi>and laid the Foundation of the Wealth and Greatneſs of that Monarchy: For from that time that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has mightily encreaſed in Manufacturies,</hi> but <hi>England</hi> much more, becauſe we had ſtore of good Wool and Matter for them to work up, of which <hi>France</hi> was in a manner deſtitute.</p>
               <p>From this time forward all the Cities and Towns in <hi>England,</hi> where theſe new Manufacturers ſeated themſelves began to be enlarged, and regulated in their Buildings, and Rents of Houſes and Lands advanced. The Proſperity of this ſort of People, and the Liberty and Immunities that were granted them, allured many more of them over to us, and as their Servants and Apprentices grow up to be Maſters, the new Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures ſpread into ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, and where-ever they ſeated themſelves, they furniſhed multitudes of the poorer ſort with Work, and comfortable Subſiſtence; they grew rich themſelves, and enriched their Neighbours, greatly leſſened the Importations, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Exportations of the Kingdom, and added to its Wealth abundantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus Perſecution greatly impoveriſhed the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Netherlands, and gave the firſt Blow to the greatneſs of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Monarchy; and Liberty enriched
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94476:26"/>
ſeveral parts of</hi> Europe, <hi>but</hi> England <hi>eſpecially:</hi> The Goſpel ſpread, the Church flouriſhed, and the Trade and Wealth of the Kingdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued on the Encreaſe, until there ſprung up a generation of Men in the Nation very zealous for the obſervance of Forms and Ceremonies, not ſo much regarding the neceſſary Duties of Religion, as Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who too much favoured the Spirit of Perſecution. <hi>In all Ages, and amongſt all Parties, thoſe men that have violently, and rigidly been for Impoſing particular External Modes and Forms in Religion, have leaſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the Power of it, and run moſt counter to the Civil Intereſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th time, the Worthy Pious Biſhops that firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Rome,</hi> differed about the degrees of diſtance they were to go off from the Mother of Abominations; ſome of them (upon Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conſiderations) that the change might be leſs ſenſible, and in hopes of alluring the common people, were for retaining the leſs Groſs part of the Ceremonies, and the moſt plauſible paſſages of their Liturgy, Canons, and the way of ordering Prieſts and Deacons. Others of the Biſhops were for caſting off <hi>Rome,</hi> and all her Ceremonies at once, and for returning to the Primitive Simplicity of Worſhip inſtituted and practiſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as ſeveral Forreign Churches had done with good ſucceſs. But reaſon of State (with a good meaning and honeſt deſign) prevailed; yet thoſe that were for retaining thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſeemed to intend them but for a time, and only until (as they ſay in the Preface to the Commination againſt Sinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) That the Godly Diſcipline uſed in the Primitive Church, could be reſtored. But what theſe firſt Reformers retained, or admitted meerly by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience, (judging the things indifferent in their own nature) their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ſome time after Impoſed with more rigour and ſtrictneſs than the obſervance and practice of neceſſary Duties; as if they thought the Canon of the Scripture incompleat, and that Chriſt and his Apoſtles had not ſufficiently directed or inſtructed the Church how to worſhip God, and that the Chriſtian Religion was deficient without this ſupplement of new Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whit gift</hi> was the firſt that began to Impoſe theſe about 1583. By doing whereof, he diſguſted and diſquieted the generality of the Pious Divines and Communicants of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at that time, who diſreliſhed them as unwarrantable, and uncharitable, gave a check to the Trade, and a ſtop to the Manufacturers who were flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Kingdom from all parts.</p>
               <p>To come to the matter in hand; <hi>theſe Impoſitions, and the Severities af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards uſed by A. B.</hi> Laud, <hi>put the Church into terrible Convulſions, and the State into a Bloody Civil War, expelled multitudes of our ſober wealthy
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94476:27"/>
people, ſome to</hi> New-England, <hi>ſome to</hi> Germany, <hi>ſome to</hi> Holland, <hi>many choſe rather to live in deſolate bowling Wilderneſſes; others in ſtrange Lands, among people whoſe Languages they underſtood not, with Liberty to ſerve God, than to live in</hi> England <hi>their Native Country, and be expoſed to hardſhips at home, and to be fleeced and ſtayed by a ſet of—Tormentors. Nor was this all, but beſides, many of our induſtrious Manufacturers were driven into</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Holland, <hi>and other of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, inſomuch that (as was evidenced to the Parliament in</hi> 1643.) <hi>The Clothiers, who (for Liberty of Conſcience, removed hence, and) ſetled in</hi> Holland, <hi>made there in one year</hi> 36000 <hi>pieces of Broad-cloth, to the unſpeakable loſs of this Kingdom; for hereupon Trade greatly decayed, and the Rents of Houſes and Lands abated ſenſibly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that I may help you a little to eſtimate the Advantage the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom reaps by theſe Manufacturers, and the great Damage ſuſtained by their Expulſion; I will give one Inſtance of the vaſt numbers of people they employ, which are moſtly of the poorer ſort, and another of what the Kingdom loſt by having thoſe 36000 pieces of Broad-Cloth made beyond Sea.</p>
               <p>As to the numbers of people employed in our Manufactures; take the Inſtance from Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, who being informed, (that in a time of Dearth and Scarcity) ſeveral Clothiers in <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> were fallen to decay, whereby the Poor wanted Work; ſhe required their condition to be reported to her; and I find part of the return to the effect following; <hi>viz.</hi> That in the ſix Hundreds of <hi>Berkly, Cumbalaſh, Thornbury, Longtree, Whitſtone</hi> and <hi>Biſlely,</hi> there inhabited 40 Clothiers, who employed 338 Looms; to each of which Looms did pertain eight perſons; <hi>viz.</hi> Weavers, Winders, Dyers, Dreſſers, Warpers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was (to the whole) 2704, beſides 4500 Spinners; ſo that by the decay of theſe 40 Clothiers, 7204 perſons in that ſmall Circuit were left without Work and Suſtenance.</p>
               <p>As to the Inſtance which reſpects our Profit, you muſt know, that particularly in White Clothes, all that we make of them above the coſt of the Wooll and Oyl, is raiſed upon the Labour of our People, and is clear Profit to the Kingdom. As ſuppoſe the Wooll and Oyl for one piece of Cloth coſt 3 <hi>l.</hi> and that the Cloth yields 13 <hi>l.</hi> then 10 <hi>l.</hi> is raiſed by the Labour and Workmanſhip of the Manufacturers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Wooll of ſome Cloths coſt much more (but then the Cloth will yield a better price, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But I pitch upon that price as a mean Rate: According to which value, this Kingdom loſt 360 thouſand pounds ſterling, which it had gained if thoſe Cloths had been made in it, and ſold hence. And about 13000 of our People were thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Work and Wages that the making thoſe Cloths would have furniſhed them with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:94476:27"/>In this ſingle Inſtance you ſee the Kingdom loſt 360000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> in the old Drapery, and the loſs could not be leſs than double ſo much in the new Drapery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all this for thoſe Trumperies; a mighty loſs indeed to the Kingdom! Yet, had the Church gained thereby, there had been ſome pretence for retaining and impoſing them; but inſtead of promoting the Edification, Peace, or Unity thereof, they have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only to rend and divide it.</p>
               <p>The fifth ſtep towards the advance of the Rents of Lands, <hi>was the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience granted by the Long, or Rump Parliament, and</hi> Oliver <hi>from</hi> 1642. <hi>to</hi> 1660. <hi>or</hi> 62. during which time all Proſecutions for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſervance of uninſtituted Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed, never was there a more pregnant Inſtance of the Benefits which Liberty of Conſcience, and Encouragements to Manufacturers brings to a Kingdom, than what that ſhort ſpace of time furniſhed. For notwithſtanding Civil-Wars in the bowels of theſe three Kingdoms for a great part of that time, whereby multitudes of the Inhabitants were cut off; yet Trade, and the Rent of Lands encreaſed, and advanced even miraculouſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I deny not but the removal, and taking off of all Monopolies, the bringing down Intereſt of Money to</hi> 6 <hi>l.</hi> per Cent, <hi>and the Act of Navigation, (which were alſo Acts of that Parliament) were concurrent cauſes of the encreaſe of the Wealth of the Kingdom. The firſt took off thoſe Reſtraints that were on Trade. The ſecond enabled the greater Emprovements of our Land, and making our Manufactures cheaper than before. And the laſt encouraged and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our Shipping and Sea-men, and ſaved great Sums of Money to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which the</hi> Hollanders <hi>were accuſtomed annually to carry from</hi> England <hi>for their Ships let us to freight. Yet the chief cauſe hereof was the Liberty given to People to ſerve God according to his own Word. For this Liberty invited multitudes to return with their Families and Stocks from</hi> New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany, Holland, <hi>&amp;c. but eſpecially many of our Manufacturers,</hi> (<hi>who had been driven away by Arch-Biſhop</hi> Laud<hi>'s Perſecution,</hi> &amp;c.) tho too many of them (by Purchaſes and Marriages that they had made in thoſe places) were detained to the unſpeakable damage of the Kingdom. However, the return of the reſt greatly encreaſed the Home-conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Proviſions, our Manufactures and Trade, and employed our Poor, which together advanced Lands in Purchaſe and Rent to that great height they were at about 1660, and 1662.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus I have faithfully ſet down the means and ſteps by which</hi> England <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at that high pitch of Wealth and Strength, which rendred her the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Envy of all</hi> Europe. <hi>And having done that, it will be eaſie to anſwer the Query, to aſſign the true Cauſes of its Declenſion, and the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Rents,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſince</hi> 1662. The moſt material I conceive to be theſe that follow; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:94476:28"/>
                  <hi>The principal Cauſe thereof, was that violent Storm of Perſecution, raiſed againſt the Non-compliers with Ceremonies, Liturgies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>preſſing the Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, whereby ten thouſand perſons ſince</hi> 1662. <hi>periſhed in Gaols, and by hard and cruel uſage, and very many thouſand Families, (moſtly ſober, uſeful, induſtrious People) have been ruined and expoſed to beggary, or compelled to ſeek that Liberty in Forreign Countries, which was denied them in their own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How the Diſſenters have been uſed, the World hath ſeen, but if the doubtful, curious, or inquiſitive deſire to be acquainted with ſome of the particular methods by which ſo great a number were ruined; they may find a Specimen of them given by a good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> in the fourth part of the Conformiſts Plea for the Nonconformiſt, beginning at page 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It hath been one of the great infelicities of the Kingdom during the three laſt Reigns, that a ſort of Men (few of whom have had Title to one foot of Land of Inheritance) have aſſumed to themſelves a power to diſpoſe Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, our Lives and Fortunes at pleaſure. They have indeed been very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them to thoſe Kings, in whom they Veſted the whole, in hopes they would bountifully reward ſo good Benefactors, either with high — Preferments, or large Portions out of that great Stock.</hi> But as ill-gotten Goods ſeldom continue long with the Poſſeſſors, neither did theſe with thoſe to whom they were given; for as the great Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> obſerved to <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>That never did Prince loſe more by this Pulpit-Law than he.</hi> Yet all this exorbitant Power which that ſort of Men cloth Princes withal, is only that it may be employed for their uſe; and that they themſelves may have ſuch ſhares as may enable them to domineer, to fleece and flay, all that diſſent from them.</p>
               <p>I have, as I preſume, clearly demonſtrated, That it was our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers chiefly that raiſed the Kingdom to its late opulence and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that our Manufacturers were at firſt attracted hither by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Immunities and Priviledges. <hi>Things being beſt increaſed, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and preſerved by the means by which they are gotten, obtained, or gained;</hi> we ought to have continued all thoſe unto that ſort of People. But that part of the Impoſing Men I have been ſpeaking of, have been no leſs pernicious to the Kingdom, than to thoſe Kings whom they ſeemed to Idolize by their flattery: For they have by falling on our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers damnified the Kingdom to a greater degree than I am capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of eſtimating. After-Ages may poſſibly be better able to do it: Yet to give you a little light into this matter, <hi>conſider, that one pound of Wooll ſold for fourteen pence, and one pound of Iron ſold at firſt hand for two pence: If they be thus Exported, the Kingdom gains little by them: But if the former be wrought up (as it may be) into three pair of fine Womens Hoſe worth</hi> 18 <hi>ſhillings; and the latter into fine Sciſſars, Locks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they may yield three
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94476:28"/>
or four ſhillings (according to the Workmanſhip) and that they be Exported the Kingdom, gains fifteen times the firſt value in the firſt, and twenty four times the value in the latter, beſides the much greater Duty to the King, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of our People, our Ships and Sea-men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid, you may ſee the uſefulneſs of this ſort of People to the Kingdom: Now if by a modeſt computation we reckon that only 40000 of the fore-mentioned number that were driven out of this Kingdom, were Manufacturers, it requires greater skill in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and knowledge in Arithmetick than I am Maſter of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately to aſſign the vaſt damage the Kingdom hath annually ſuſtained thereby. However, the Effects are viſible in the Abatements of Trade and Rents; The loſing of our Trade to other Countries, who have thereby gained upon us in thoſe Manufactures whereon we moſtly value our ſelves, and which were in a manner (until theſe Perſecutions began) peculiar unto us. And all this only to ſupport and pleaſe a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and keep up the uſe of two or three unneceſſary Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>The leſſer concurrent Cauſes of the Abatement of Rents ſince 1662. <hi>were the two Dutch Wars</hi> (which were fomented by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> Abetted and carried on by the <hi>Tantivy</hi> Party:) <hi>and the Deſtruction made by the Burning of</hi> London, which Ruined many Merchants, Tradeſmen, and Manufacturers: Yet had not the ſame Party by Stifling the Diſcovery thereof diſcouraged, and by Perſecution, driven great numbers of them out of the Kingdom, we had eaſily (by our Manufactures and Trade,) retrieved thoſe diſadvantages. For the Woollen Manufactures being then in a manner peculiar to Us; Forreign Countries muſt have been Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd from hence, had not our Merchants, Tradeſmen and Manufacturers been deny'd the Liberty and incouragements at home, which they were Courted to, and did receive abroad. <hi>Hereby we laid the Foundation of the decay of Trade, and Abatement of Rents, by making other Countries ſharers with us in our moſt profitable Trades.</hi> Thus I have ſet down as the means whereby Rents were advanced to what they were about 1662. So likewiſe the unhappy Cauſes of their Abatement ſince; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes my Anſwer to the third Query.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">

               <head>
                  <hi>The Fourth Query is,</hi> Whether the State of Trade through <hi>Europe</hi> conſidered as it ſtood before the preſent War, it be the true Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> that Rents ſhould generally advance above what they were about <hi>1662.</hi> and by what Methods may they be advanced?</head>
               <p>HAD we duly improved the advantages we had of Trade and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture about 1662. and carefully kept our Manufacturers, Skill, and People to our ſelves, it is difficult to ſay what advancement might have been made of Rents by this time. But now that by our own Folly, the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> ſome parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and even <hi>France</hi> it ſelf are become ſharers with us in our moſt profitable Manufactures, not only for their own Supply, (which they were wont to derive from us;) but alſo to that degree, that they Vie with us in many Forreign Markets; it is high time ſeriouſly to conſider, what is the true intereſt of the Nation, both in reſpect of Trade, Rents, and Manufactures.</p>
               <p>In Order hereunto, let it be conſidered, that the Strength and Security of <hi>England</hi> next under God, conſiſts in its Navy: Its Welfare and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity depends on its Trade, Natural Products and Manufactures. The Strength of its Navy depends on Forreign Trade; and the profitable part of Trade to the Kingdom reſults ſolely from our Exportations. It is therefore the true Intereſt of the Kingdom by all due Methods, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to preſerve, incourage and augment all theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe who get their Livelihood by Trade and Manufactures, are many more than thoſe who live by Cattle, Paſturage, Corn, and Fruits. Our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Products, which we Export, are not computed to be above one Fifteenth part of our Exportations; and tho' they that live by theſe muſt not be neglected, but encouraged; yet our main care ought to be laid out for our Manufacturers, as thoſe that have raiſed the Kingdom to its preſent Wealth and Greatneſs, which ſupports it, and makes up the Bulk of our Expectations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Trade of <hi>England</hi> being moſtly carried on by its Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, ſhould the Rents of Land here advance; ſuppoſe one fourth part above what they were in 1662. and Lands in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> do not riſe proportionably, I ſuppoſe it would be very prejudicial to the Kingdom in general: For I am not here ſpeaking of what would for a time gratifie the humour of our Nobility, Gentry, or Landed Men, but what would be their, and the Kingdoms true Intereſt.</p>
               <p>If Rent of Land ſhould advance one fourth part, or more, above what they were in 1662. The Fruits and Products of the Land ought to riſe in their price proportionably, one fourth above what they then were, or the Farmers would not be able to pay their Rents. And were the Natural Products thus advanced for a continuance, Proviſions being
<pb facs="tcp:94476:29"/>
ſo much Dearer; it would be but reaſonable, that the Labour of the Working People ſhould advance alſo. And were this ſo, our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures would be Dearer, which in the preſent State of things (as hath been obſerved) would be pernicious to the Kingdom: For by ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Rents, and the Price of our Natural Products, and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, we ſhould,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Loſe all our Forreign Markets, for that part of the Natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of our Lands which we Annually Export to other Countries, which could in that Caſe under-ſell us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We ſhould for the ſame Reaſon loſe all Forreign Markets for our Manufacture; and thereby the means of imployment for our People at home, and of our Ships and Seamen abroad, which would yet be more miſchievous to us. The Kingdom affords no Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that I call to mind peculiar to us but Tin, nor are we ſole Maſters of that neither, tho' we have more and better of that Commodity than any Country in <hi>Europe.</hi> Therefore all things conſidered, it is the Intereſt of the Kingdom that we raiſe both our Natural Product and Artificial Commodities and Manufactures ſo Cheap, as that we may be able to furniſh all Forreign Markets with them (their quality conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) ſome ſmall matter Cheaper than any other Country can: For thereby only can we ſecure Forreign Markets for our Surpluſage of both, and imployment for our People.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> &amp;c. do in ſome ſort Vie with us at For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Markets as to Fine Cloth, and ſome coſtly Fabricks of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, but they are not able ſo to do in Courſe Cloths, and Courſe Manufactures, becauſe of the much higher Prices of Food and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among them than us, which with the different Price of Wool there and here, enables us to make great quantities of theſe Courſer Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures much Cheaper than it is poſſible for them to do. But if now that we have caſt out ſo conſiderable a part of our Manufacturers into other Countries, and that by raiſing our Rents, Proviſions, Wool, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Manufactures ſhould be advanced much in their Price; we ſhould be in danger of loſing a much greater part of our Trade to other Countries than what we have already loſt. So great and tickliſh is the difficulty of Regaining any part of Trade, or bringing it into it's former Channel when once loſt or turned out of it.</p>
               <p>If againſt what hath been ſaid, it be objected, that experience tells us, that our Manufactures are raiſed Cheapeſt in Years of Dearth and Scarcity; I anſwer that extraordinary accidents do not conſtitute a ſtanding Rule: That 'tis true in ſuch years, the Poor are conſtrained to Work Harder and Cheaper than at other times: Yet in thoſe years they are conſtrained to run in Debt, and often Sell even the very Clothes
<pb facs="tcp:94476:30"/>
which they Earned in times of Plenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and did Proviſions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance for a continuance, Labour muſt do ſo too, or many of the Poor would periſh, and the reſt be reduced to live on Herbs, wear Wooden Clogs, or Shooes, and like the Peaſants of <hi>France,</hi> look like walking Ghoſts, which I hope will never happen in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the undoubted Intereſt of the Kingdom to recal, and allure as many of our Manufacturers home as poſſibly we can, to ſet up and encourage new Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures for the imploying of our People, for the augmenting of our Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the encreaſe of the Revenue,</hi> to improve the opportunity put into our hands, by cheriſhing the <hi>French</hi> that are already amongſt us; and inviting in as many more as we can get; They live more hardily, and therefore can work much cheaper than ordinarily our People can. <hi>Their labour may be applyed and directed to ſome new Manufactures, or new Fabricks which we have not yet, which we were wont to bring from</hi> France; <hi>and which may not interfere with thoſe we have, or with the preſent labour of our own People.</hi> A prudent management of theſe things would conduce more than a little to the regaining and enlarging of our Trade to the enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kingdom, and advancing Rents, by encreaſing the home Conſumption, the leſſening our Importations, and augmenting our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are ſeveral things that may by accident, and for a ſpurt advance the Rents of Lands: But it is only the leſſening our Importations, and the augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Exportations that can keep them up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to theſe great Ends, we ſhould remove all thoſe Bars and Diſcouragements which lye in the way. It's true, the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have in their Wiſdom by an Act of Indulgence ſuſpended the Execution of thoſe ſevere and unkind Laws with which Diſſenters have been ſo long plagued, and which have been ſo prejudicial to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Yet they are not repealed, but ſeem to be kept like Rods in pickle; and the Inſtruments of our paſt Miſeries, and which procured them, are many of them ſtill in being; longing, endeavouring, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatning the Repeal of that Act of Indulgence and Suſpenſion. In ſuch a State of things, no man of ſence, that is tolerably ſetled abroad, will be induced by a Liberty that's ſo precarious to return home; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he obſerves, that if he do return, and that he hath not ſtretched his Conſcience larger than it was at his going abroad, he muſt be content to be a Slave in one of the freeſt Kingdoms in the World, incapacitated to ſerve God or his Country in any Office Civil or Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and like <hi>Iſſachars</hi> Aſs be uſed only to bear a greater ſhare of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick burthen and charge, and do a greater part of the publick drudgery than his Neighbours; but muſt not be employed in any place either of Honour or Profit, but be like the Silk-worm, permitted to ſpin out his Bowels for others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:94476:30"/>It is a ſcandal to our Nation and Religion, and a thing abhorred by very many ſober Chriſtians, That the receiving the Sacrament, the moſt ſolemn Ordinance—of our Religion (in a mode never inſtituted by Chriſt, nor practiſed by his Apoſtles) ſhould be made a qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the bearing of Office or Arms, ſelling Ale, or keeping a Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe.</p>
               <p>The great end of his Majeſties glorious undertaking being to reſtore Liberty to every of the oppreſſed Proteſtants in theſe Kingdoms, he ſeems in Intereſt, as well as Inclination, concerned to take off all theſe Incapacities from the Diſſenters, and legally to put them into as good, or a better Condition than they were in under King <hi>James,</hi> who arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily compelled them to take Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon them, ſeeing the moſt criminal and culpable part of the Kingdom have been pardoned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnified, and at leaſt rendred capable of bearing Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There can no good reaſon be given why ſo great a part of the Nation that contribute ſo much to its Proſperity and Welfare, and bear ſo great a part of the publick charge ſhould ſtand exempted from the Priviledge of Subjects; unleſs their greater Enmity to <hi>France,</hi> their firm adherence to his Majeſties Intereſt, to that of the Kingdom and Proteſtant Religion bs made one; and that our Diviſions (in favour of <hi>France</hi>) ought to be perpetuated, be made another. Until thoſe Clouds which intercept the benign Rays of Government from ſhining indifferently upon all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects are removed; the King ſeems to be only King of a Part, and not of the whole of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>As it is the Intereſt of all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to joyn againſt <hi>France;</hi> ſo it is no leſs the Intereſt of all the Proteſtants (of every Perſwaſion) in this Kingdom, to unite for their common defence againſt that Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Mankind, the <hi>French</hi> King. For if he hath for ſo long a time withſtood or kept the united force of almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi> at a Bay, what are we to apprehend, if any occurrent ſhould diſſolve the Confederacy, and that he ſhould have opportunity to attack us ſingly in the divided, diſtracted Condition in which we are? eſpecially conſidering how great a Party he hath already amongſt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But his Majeſties Intereſt and Honour falling in ſo aptly with that of</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, <hi>the Safety and Proſperity of the Kingdom, and the Advantage of our Landed men, it will undoubtedly put him and them upon removing theſe Stones of ſtumbling, and Rocks of Offence in a Parliamentary way, and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe had not this ſort of People in the two last Reigns (to the Irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Court againſt them, and the Ruin of many of them) joyned with the ſober part of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in electing ſuch Members for Parliament as boldly aſſerted our Religion, Liberties, and Properties, we had in all probability long before this been made Slaves to Popery and Arbitrary

Government. And had they not fallen in to do the like in this laſt Revolution in Electing Members for the late Convention or Parliament, the Crown and Kingdom had in all likelihood been unſettled until this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the ſure way to advance the Rents of our Lands, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the taking off all Reſtraints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and giving due liberty to Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers, and alluring them Home; in incouraging and improving thoſe advantages which are in a manner peculiar to us; in diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and clogging thoſe Trades which draw away our Treaſure: In keeping a good Correſpondence with thoſe Kingdoms and Countreys whence we derive Materials for our Manufactures, and thoſe which take off our Natural Products, Manufactures and Artificial Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

                  <hi>The Fifth Query.</hi> How may the preſent Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Reduction thereof be improved to the future Security, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Advantages which we receive by <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of Their Majeſties Revenue; future Charge thereby to <hi>England</hi> be avoided, and that Kingdom rendred uſeful towards bringing down the Power of <hi>France?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT hath already been demonſtrated, That beſides the Supplies of Men and Money which <hi>Ireland</hi> Antiently yielded us towards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>France, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Wales:</hi> That we did Annually (before the preſent Rebellion) utter conſiderable quantities of our Natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and Manufactures (for which we had no other Markets) into that Kingdom. That we were furniſhed thence with ſeveral neceſſary Materials for our Manufactures, and Commodities for Forreign Trade, which we could not have elſewhere. That ſome of their Ports are of great conſideration to us; (the want of which, our Merchants to their great loſs have in this War experienced.) That beſides the profit which we make by <hi>Ireland</hi> in the ordinary courſe of Trade, we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thence yearly above 200000 <hi>l.</hi> All which Advantages had been much more, had we not (by prohibiting their Cattel, and debarring their Trade to the Plantations interrupted the courſe of Commerce between the two Kingdoms) compelled them to more Forreign Trade than they were otherways diſpoſed to ſeek. However you ſee, that what remains is well worth the ſecuring and improving; and if we be not under Infatuation, and ſtill fond of our Errors, the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94476:31"/>
of Affairs furniſheth us as with the opportunity to rectifie them; ſo alſo to ſecure and improve them; in order to which it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Lives, Liberties and Eſtates of the Proteſtants in that Kingdom be well ſecured.</hi> Whilſt theſe remain at uncertainties, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Affairs will drive on but heavily. It hath been the hard fate of the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> (as hath been ſaid) that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have had ſuch favour in, and influence on our Council in <hi>England</hi> on the concluſion of every Rebellion, that they have been left in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition if not wholly to extirpate, yet at pleaſure to annoy and ruin the Eſtates of the Proteſtants. I wiſh Their Majeſties Councils may be more happy. It is indeed high time to grow wiſe; dear bought Experience inſtructeth the weak, much more the Wiſe. <hi>Two very chargeable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions having hapned within the memory of many yet living, will, if any thing, inſtruct us what meaſures ought to be taken for preventing Rebellions for the future; for it is not reaſonable that every thirty or forty years</hi> England <hi>ſhould be at the Charge of Reducing</hi> Ireland; nor that the Proteſtants there ſhould be expoſed to the Mercy or Barbarity of thoſe who think they Merit Heaven by cutting their Throats. I am as much againſt Cruelty and Severity as any Man; but to what end doth God give us Victory over his and our Enemies, if we have not common wiſdom to improve it for ſecurity from future danger by them?</p>
               <p>As the ſafety of the People is the higheſt Law, ſo is it a great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Induſtry. For who will lay out his care and pains for obtaining that which he hath no proſpect of enjoying? Until the Lives and Eſtates of the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> be put into ſome good way of future ſecurity we can rationally expect neither advantage by them, nor aſſiſtance from them.</p>
               <p>The People of <hi>Ireland</hi> have been accurately computed to be about twelve hundred thouſand Souls, of which the Papiſts are one Million, and the Proteſtants but two hundred thouſand (Women and Children included;) ſo that <hi>there being five Papiſts to one Proteſtant in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Proteſtants muſt therefore have many advantages put into their hands, and the Papiſts be laid under ſeveral incapacities, or elſe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants can never be ſecured, as</hi> 130 <hi>years ſad experience hath verified.</hi> And it muſt be conſidered, that now the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are fallen in with the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and lye under the influence of ſo Potent and Reſtleſs a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, they will for this Age be more dangerous and apt to Rebel than ever. Therefore we ought to have, as the more jealous Eye, ſo alſo the ſtricter hand over them.</p>
               <p>For which end their Landed Men having by their preſent Rebellion forfeited their Eſtates; The whole forfeiture ought to be taken, as well
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94476:32"/>
for reimburſing part of the Charges of their Reduction, as the better to incapacitate them for new Rebellions. This though it leſſen not their number in general, yet it will in great meaſure the Intereſt and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this Party on the People.</p>
               <p>They are ſeized of above 2800000 Acres of profitable Land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if 200000 Acres belong to Minors and Innocents there will remain,</p>
               <p>300000 Acres, which may be leſt to His Majeſty to gratifie ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as have Merited in that Service.</p>
               <p>200000 Acres may be applyed to the Repriſal of the poor Proteſtant Farmers who have been plundered, and ruined by both ſides. And</p>
               <p>2100000 Acres to be ſold to Adventurers at an encouraging price, at ſix or ſeven years purchaſe; near two Millions may be raiſed to reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe the charge of the Reduction of that Kingdom, to the eaſe of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and expediting of Their Majeſties Affairs.</p>
               <p>Some pretended Well-wiſhers to Their Majeſties Intereſts, but real Engines for K. <hi>J.</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> K. are at this time endeavouring to hinder the Attainder of the Rebels, and the Selling of their Eſtates, under pretence that the value of them is inconſiderable, the Right of Innocents, Minors, Proteſtant Mortgagees, and Creditors being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, whereas in truth it is otherways. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to Innocents, <hi>that is, ſuch as have all the time of this Rebellion been in</hi> England, they are very few; upon inquiry I do not hear of three, and thoſe of no conſiderable Eſtates neither; as for thoſe who have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in <hi>France,</hi> (that being an Enemies Countrey,) it ſeems but reaſonable that they ſhould be accounted Rebels and Agents for the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to Minors, they are few alſo; I mean thoſe under Age whoſe Parents were dead before the commencement of the preſent Rebellion. <hi>As for the Children of thoſe in Rebellion, their Parents have ruined many thouſands of Proteſtant Minors, and Children, in their Fortunes, and if any Conſideration ought to be had of them, it ſeems Equitable that rather the Children of Rebels than of Loyal Subjects, ſhould be made the Sufferers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As to Mortgages and Incumbrances on the Papiſts Eſtates; where they are between Papiſt and Papiſt it ſeems but Juſt that the Forfeiture ſhould be taken, for the Rebellion is general: As for thoſe between the Papiſts and Proteſtants they are not the ſixtieth part of what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, though poſſibly many Mortgages, and Incumbrances are now in forging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a courſe may eaſily be taken for their detection, if it be not already thought on; but allowing all that can reaſonably be taken off upon the foregoing pretences, there may demonſtrably 1500000 <hi>l.</hi> be raiſed by thoſe Forfeitures, if they be rightly managed, and their Majeſties Revenue be augmented by the Quit-rent that may be reſerved on thoſe Forfeitures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:94476:32"/>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lawyers, (for whom the People have great veneration) have in all times by miſchievous Conſtructions of the Laws, diſpoſed the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to Rebellions; whilſt they remain amongſt them they will hinder the Settlement of that Kingdom; therefore they ought alſo to be expelled.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe neceſſary that the Souldiers that have taken Arms for King <hi>James</hi> ſhould alſo be tranſported to the Plantations, or to <hi>Hungary,</hi> or be Baniſhed: For they have lived ſo long by Rapine and Plunder, that they can never be reduced to live regularly; if they be permitted to continue in that Kingdom, they will always diſturb the tranquillity thereof.</p>
               <p>If His Majeſty would keep that Kingdom from Rebellion, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that their Prieſts, Fryars and Clergy of every ſort be baniſhed from amongſt them: They have been the chief Incendiaries to Rebellion in all Ages. The Author of the Politicks of <hi>France</hi> ſuggeſts to that King the facility of diſtracting <hi>England</hi> at pleaſure, by ſetting the Popiſh Clergy upon fomenting Rebellions in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that that Prince ſeldom neglects any means ſo obviouſly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him. <hi>And whatſoever may be ſuggeſted to His Majeſty concerning the Innocency of the Secular Clergy; yet it muſt be allowed, that they are only leſs miſchievous than the Regular, becauſe of leſs skill to do evil: For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ability they have always diſquieted that Kingdom: They have the Conduct of the Conſciences of that poor blind</hi> bigotted <hi>People, and are under Oath blindly to obey not only the Pope, but their Dioceſans: Had they no diſpoſition to move Rebellions of themſelves, yet if they be commanded thereto (as undoubtedly they will be) they muſt and will readily obey:</hi> For the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as all other ignorant People, are Prieſt-ridden; and their Prieſts make them believe that they ſhall be damned if they do not lay hold on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion to deſtroy the Hereticks, and that they ſhall certainly merit Heaven if they do. In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, thoſe that had not the opportunity to Rebel, did purchaſe Pardons, at dear Rates, from <hi>Rome,</hi> for their not having actually Rebelled. And we have had a pregnant Inſtance of the Empire theſe Prieſts have over the People in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Rebellion; for notwithſtanding Their Majeſties have by three graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Declarations invited that People to ſubmit; yet I hear not of one Gentleman that hath hitherto ſubmitted; and the People generally have choſen rather to quit their Habitations, and wander thorow the Kingdom, than to ſit down quietly under Their Majeſties gentle Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with the enjoyment of all their Poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>The Toleration of the Popiſh Clergy, and their pernicious Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it would be ſinful in Their Majeſties, ſo it would be deſtructive to that Kingdom, whatever the favourers of the <hi>French,</hi> or King
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94476:33"/>
                  <hi>James</hi>'s Intereſt may ſuggeſt to the contrary. For the Toleration or conniving at Idolatry, is a Land-deſtroying ſin. <hi>Ireland</hi> hath found it to be ſo. Our Church in her Articles and Homilies hath declared the Maſs to be the groſſeſt Idolatry: And God, who in Scripture appears ſo tender of the life of man, that he appointed even caſual Homicide to be puniſhed with confinement or baniſhment until the death of the High Prieſt, hath nevertheleſs poſitively commanded that Idolaters, and even the ſecret Enticers to it, ſhould be put to death without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the places defiled thereby to be deſtroyed. And where Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do not duly execute his Laws in this caſe, he uſually executes Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them, and their Poſterity. Moſt of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their Poſterity, were rooted out for this ſin, and the Ten Tribes for it have remained in Captivity and Obſcurity for 2400 years. And this ſin was one of the chief cauſes of the Captivity of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance at, or toleration of it hath twice in this Age proved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to poor <hi>Ireland,</hi> and pernicious to thoſe Kings that granted it. When King <hi>James</hi> the firſt granted a Toleration of Popery in <hi>Ireland,</hi> famous Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> did publickly before the State foretel, that for that ſin God would within forty years raiſe up thoſe Papiſts to cut the Throats of the Proteſtants there; and God fulfilled that Prediction in 1641. and that King never proſpered in any deſign or undertaking after that Toleration. And when his Son <hi>Charles</hi> I. would not be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in 1629. renewed that Toleration, ten or twelve of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Arch-Biſhops of that time had the honeſty and courage pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the Pulpit to proteſt againſt the ſinfulneſs of it, and alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their hands to declare,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Religion of the Papiſts is Superſtitious and Idolatrous; their Faith and Doctrine erroneous, and heretical; their Church (in reſpect of both) Apoſtatical. To give them therefore a Toleration of Religion, and to profeſs their Faith and Doctrine, is a grievous ſin, and is to make our ſelves acceſſary, not only to their Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Idolatries, Hereſies; and in a word, all the Abominations of Popery; but alſo (which is a conſequent of the former) to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ſeduced People which periſh in the Deluge of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Apoſtacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as it is a great ſin, ſo it is a matter of great conſequence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>How fatal it proved to him, and alſo to <hi>Charles</hi> II. and the late King <hi>James,</hi> the World hath ſeen. Nor will it be leſs ſo to any of their Succeſſors, who ſhall connive at, or tolerate the ſame. For the ſame ſins and degrees of it, brings like Judgments in every Age. <hi>Not only the Law of God, but thoſe of the Land alſo are againſt indulging this Religion; and Intereſt of State, the ſafety of the Proteſtants in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94476:33"/>
the quiet of</hi> England <hi>requires, That all the</hi> Roman <hi>Clergy, their Landed men concerned in this Rebellion, and that of</hi> 1641. <hi>together with their Lawyers, ſhould be baniſhed, and not to return on pain of Death.</hi> We may wiſh for Advantage by that Kingdom, but we cannot rationally expect it, whilſt theſe three Parties, or any of them are permitted to remain there, for they will be fit Tools in the hands of the <hi>French</hi> King to foment Rebellions, to which their joynt and ſeveral Intereſts, (the hope of regaining their Eſtates, the Church-Livings, and their Practice,) will prompt and diſpoſe them; and nothing leſs than their Baniſhment, or Extirpation will deveſt <hi>France</hi> of the means of diſtracting us at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, now that they are joyned with that Enemy of Mankind.</p>
               <p>As for the reſt of the Papiſts who ſhall be permitted to abide in that Kingdom; it is but reaſonable that they be excluded from living in the Cities, Walled Towns, and Corporations, which are the ſtrengths of the Kingdom. I am well aware that this latter, tho' as conſiderable as any other means for the ſecurity of that Kingdom, will meet with much oppoſition from many of the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> themſelves, who (like too many in <hi>England</hi>) prefer their particular (the Advancement of their Rents in thoſe Towns and Cities) to the Publick Safety, to which their Private Intereſt ought ever to give way. The Papiſts are already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Purchaſing any of the Houſes in any Corporation which were forfeited by the Rebellion in 1641. But this without the other is not ſufficient, and indeed there is no other way to deal with them.</p>
               <p>If His Majeſty imagines that the Poſſeſſion of their Eſtates, Liberty, for their Religion, a ſhare in the Civil-Juſtice will oblige and reſtrain them from Violence and Rebellion, he will (I fear) in the iſſue find it otherways; for in 1641. they had their titular Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, their Fryaries and Nunneries; their Secular and Regular Clergy; they were Juſtices of the Peace, Sheriffs of Counties, Members of Parliament, Mayors and Bayliffs of Corporations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They were ſeized of three fourths of all the Lands there: All the Laws againſt them were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended as to their Execution; they had all their Grievances redreſſed, even to the releaſe of the forfeiture of whole Counties. In a few months after which, they broke out into that horrid and barbarous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, wherein they Maſſacred 150000 Proteſtants in cold Blood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any provocation, beſides as many more that periſhed by Famine and Sword in the proſecution of that Rebellion; which is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the World, that theſe People are not to be retain'd in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by Immunities, Priviledges and Kindneſſes, nor reſtrained from Rebellion and Maſſacres, whilſt their Clergy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are permitted to abide amongſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:94476:34"/>If againſt what hath been propoſed, the favourers of the <hi>French</hi> and Popiſh Intereſt do object, That ſuch Severity toward the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige the Catholick Princes of the Confederacy.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; That the chief end of the Confederacy is to retrench the Power of the <hi>French</hi> King and his Adherents, as Enemies to all the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> That the Papiſts in theſe Kingdoms having above all others contributed to that Kings preſent Greatneſs (all the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and many of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Papiſts being actually in Rebellion, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his Forces) Their dependence being on him, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from him; it is as much the Intereſt of the Confederates, that they be rooted out or baniſhed, as was the taking of <hi>Mentz</hi> or <hi>Bonne.</hi> That thoſe Princes are very ſenſible that theſe are they which have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted His Majeſties Arms from their Aſſiſtance the two laſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, and that they will do ſo for the future, if their Power be not broken. That there cannot therefore be the leaſt danger of diſobliging them, by the Baniſhment or Extirpation of the afore-mentioned Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; eſpecially being it is of ſervice to them, upon Reaſons of State, and is done for the quiet and ſecurity of His Majeſties Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and becauſe they are Rebels, Incendiaries, and of Party with <hi>France,</hi> and not becauſe they are Papiſts.—In a word, <hi>Lenity to the</hi> Iriſh <hi>who have been in Arms, is down-right Cruelty to the Proteſtants of</hi> Ireland <hi>and their Poſterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As Reſtraints on the Papiſts are neceſſary to the quiet of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the other ends propoſed; ſo is Freedom and Immunities in Corporations to all Protestants that ſhall go to inhabit there, with Liberty of Conſcience to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of all Perſwaſions that are there, or that ſhall go thither to abide.</hi> There being five Papiſts for every Proteſtant in that Kingdom, it is the Intereſt of the latter in point of Security, to add to their number as much as may be. If to the Cheapneſs of Land there be added Civil and Religious Liberties, they will together probably allure Forreign Proteſtants to tranſplant thither.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants until about 1670. kept the Papiſts out of Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by tendering them the Oath of Supremacy, when they claimed admittance, but there being a Clauſe in the Act of Settlement or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, which impowered the Chief Governour and Council in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to make Laws or Rules for Regulation of Corporations, and that the Rules ſo made ſhould be of the ſame force as if they had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under colour thereof ſome well-wiſhers to Popery and Arbitrary Government, framed certain Rules and Orders which <hi>Charles</hi> II. cauſed the Lord Lieutenant and Council to paſs into an Act of Council, and to enjoyn them on all the Corporations of that Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one of which Rules requires all Officers of Corporations
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94476:34"/>
to take the ſhort Corporation Oath lately uſed in <hi>England,</hi> which ſeemed to have been calculated for ſetting up Arbitrary Government, (for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of which in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there was not until then any colour of Law;) thereby all Proteſtants who were not willing to for-ſwear that Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which the Law of Nature, and thoſe of the Land allows them, were turned out of Office; nor was that all, but by another Clauſe in thoſe Rules the Chief Governour is impowered from time to time to diſpenſe with ſuch as were not willing to take the Oath of Supremacy. —Hereupon whole ſhouls of Papiſts were admitted into the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Fraternities of that Kingdom, and qualified for Offices, and Chuſing Members of Parliament.—It will therefore be needful that the Corporations of that Kingdom be reſtored to the condition they were in in 1668. and that thoſe Rules be vacuated, or declared to be void, as thoſe who think that the Legiſlative Power cannot be transferred, conceive them to be.</p>
               <p>I am told, that to hinder many Proteſtants from returning, for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Forreigners and others from going to inhabit, the better to divide thoſe already in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to prevent the Improvement of it; there are ſome of K. <hi>J.</hi> his Creatures (who might be named, and who pretend to be of another figure, and to be well known in the Affairs of that Kingdom) that are now uſing their utmoſt endeavours to have the Sacramental Teſt impoſed on the People of that Kingdom; under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it will keep the Papiſts out of Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though that be no part of their deſign, but to incumber His Majeſties Affairs, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sale of the Rebels Eſtates, or render them of little value: To alienate (if poſſible) the Hearts of that people from Their Majeſties, by cauſing His Majeſty (contrary to the import of his Declaration) to put them into a worſe condition, than they were in under a Popiſh King. <hi>Theſe Men well know that the Security and Improvement of that Kingdom, and of Their Majeſties Revenue there, depends on its being peopled with Proteſtants, and that full Liberty and Incouragements to Proteſtants of all Perſwaſions, is the most effectual means to thoſe Ends: And that the planting thereof being hindred; the Papiſts will be kept in a capacity (at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to favour K.</hi> J. <hi>and the pretended P. of</hi> Wales<hi>'s Title, to countenance a</hi> French <hi>Invaſion,</hi> &amp;c. They know, if it be not planted with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, the Revenue will never defray the neceſſary charge of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but that it will be a continual and inſupportable charge and drain to <hi>England,</hi> and require greater Forces to be kept up there, and thereby obſtruct (at leaſt) in great meaſure the proſecution of the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France,</hi> which is their chief aim.</p>
               <p>The promoters of theſe deſigns are well aware that the impoſition of that Teſt, would ſend many Proteſtants out of that Kingdom; and that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94476:35"/>
where it would bar one Papiſt from Office, it would hinder a hundred Proteſtants from going thither. They know the injoining of the Oath of Supremacy, or an expreſs Order or Law for their Excluſion, would more effectually bar Papiſts than the Sacramental Teſt; for that many Papiſts have been diſpenſed with by their Prieſts for Receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in the manner required; and therefore it would never anſwer the end for which they pretend it, though it would the others for which they intend it. But that impoſition which hath proved ſo inconvenient to <hi>England,</hi> will, if laid on <hi>Ireland</hi> be pernicious to the Proteſtants there, be a Bone of Diviſion amongſt them; and ſeem but an ill requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal for their Sufferings, and firm adherence to the true Intereſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was about 1664. one or two <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, who having ſome Benefices conferred on them, and Stipends allowed by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tranſlated the Common-prayer Book into <hi>French,</hi> and procured a Chappel for the uſe of ſuch <hi>French</hi> as would join with them in that Service. About ſixteen or eighteen years after, many of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, with ſome of their Miniſters fled to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſet up the beginnings of ſeveral uſeful Manufactures; and being averſe to join in that Service, a certain Charitable Peer lent them his Houſe to Worſhip in, where they ſerved God according to the manner of the <hi>French</hi> Churches. Whereupon their Miniſter was Seized and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> until for obtaining his Liberty, he conſented to quit or abjure that Kingdom. Surely the uſage was as Unchriſtian as Impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick towards thoſe poor diſtreſſed Refugees, who had fled thither in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of that liberty (which was publickly allowed the Papiſts and) which was deny'd them in their own Countrey. And it was Impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; for thereupon they abandoned the place, and that Kingdom loſt thoſe profitable Trades which thoſe Men would have ſet up there. Not that this Severity proceeded from the temper of the Proteſtants of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (who are certainly the kindeſt People on Earth to Strangers, that either Travel, or abide amongſt them) but from the Bigottry of a few, who too much favoured or advanced the Popiſh Intereſt. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I doubt not but that the uſage thoſe Favourers of Popery received from K. <hi>James,</hi> hath opened their Eyes, and poſſibly rectified the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch of them as are living; yet I believe this Sin, this Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the diſtreſſed <hi>French,</hi> did help forward the diſperſion and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which have ſince happen'd to the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for ſins of this kind being committed by Authority, the Guilt becomes Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are not thoſe Laws in that Kingdom against Diſſenters, that are in</hi> England, <hi>nor any that I have heard of for impoſing the Sacramental Teſt;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94476:35"/>
and if it be the Intereſt of</hi> England <hi>to have thoſe Laws, and that Teſt taken off, 'tis certainly no leſs the Intereſt of</hi> Ireland <hi>to incourage all ſorts of Proteſtants. (Like Liberty with what's here propoſed, was one means which hath ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peopled and enriched</hi> Holland.) <hi>And as there are not thoſe Laws againſt Diſſenters there, as here, neither are there thoſe Animoſities among Proteſtants of different Perſwaſions as there are in</hi> England; <hi>nor thoſe Prejudices againſt their Majeſties Government. So that a perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion among Proteſtants there is much more feaſible than here. And if all parties of Proteſtants be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently admitted to places of Honour, Profit, and Truſt, they will then joyntly and chearfully promote the welfare of the Publick, to the great increaſe of their Majesties Revenue, of the Church Livings, and of the Advantages which</hi> England <hi>receives by that Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Militia of that Kingdom ought to be ſetled in the hands of men of Courage, Conduct, and Integrity;</hi> ſuch as will not connive at, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand countenance or abett the Enemy, give Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or ſecretly ſhare in Robberies and Plunderings with them, <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Naſh</hi> and <hi>Murphy</hi>'s Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the Popiſh Plot.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Arms of the Kingdom may neither be diverted from their Defence, nor turned againſt them. It is indeed the folly of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men that they are too little diſtruſtful, too unapprehenſive of dangers, and too remiſs in providing againſt them. Care ſhould be taken that all that are able ſhould buy Arms, and that thoſe that are not able may be provided with good Arms, and be duely exerciſed. That Kingdom is well furniſhed with brisk active men, whoſe native Courage and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Country qualifies them for Service, of which they have given good proof at <hi>Derry, Inniskillen, Limerick, &amp;c.</hi> as alſo of their forwardneſs and zeal for their Majeſties Service, even beyond what <hi>England</hi> did, (if I may be permitted to ſay ſo.) The Proteſtants in <hi>England</hi> were more than 200 to one of the Papiſts, yet when his preſent Majeſty had landed with a powerful Army to reſcue us from Popery and Slavery, the Nobility and Gentry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtood at gaze, and it was ſome time before any of them appeared to own his Cauſe, until the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> firſt, and then the Earl of <hi>Devon,</hi> ſlighting all dangers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for the defence of the Religion and Liberties of their Country. Whereas in <hi>Ireland,</hi> although the Papiſts were five to one of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and had all the Garriſons, Magazins, Army and Revenue of the Kingdom in their hands, yet the Proteſtants there, firſt in the <hi>North,</hi> then in <hi>Connaught,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Munſter,</hi> did expoſe themſelves to the utmoſt Perils; took up Arms and declared for their Majeſties, when no Succours appeared for them, nor were indeed provided. And had they then been timeouſly owned and ſupported, or afterward employed according to their Merits, for the Reduction of that Kingdom, they had
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94476:36"/>
ſhortned that work, and ſaved <hi>England</hi> two or three Milions of what hath and will be expended therein; which was too well known to ſome Perſons. But thoſe who wiſh well to King <hi>James</hi>'s Intereſt, and they whoſe uſeleſneſs would appear, were the Kingdoms once ſetled, were, and are for doing every thing at the utmoſt charge, that by great and continued Taxes they might if poſſible alienate the Hearts of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their Majeſties, and perplex their Affairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to that end, no doubt, miſrepreſented both the Affairs and People of <hi>Ireland;</hi> who, notwithſtanding all the Contempts and Reproaches caſt on them, and the Temptations, not to ſay Provocations to the Contrary, have almoſt to a man, firmly adhered to their Majeſties Intereſt. For among 200000 of them (upon a ſtrict enquiry) I do not hear of ſixty Proteſtants that have taken up Arms for King <hi>James,</hi> or abetted his Intereſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Preſence among them, Power over them, and their great Neceſſities; which poſſibly (if truth were known) might be the true cauſe of their being ſlighted by ſome ſort of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the preſent Wars in <hi>Europe</hi> continue, and that <hi>Ireland</hi> be once wholly ſubdued, the putting of the Militia of that Kingdom into a good poſture will ſave much Money to <hi>England,</hi> by giving his Majeſty the better opportunity to employ a greater proportion of his Army againſt <hi>France,</hi> which otherwiſe muſt be kept in <hi>Ireland</hi> to keep the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in Subjection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Notwithſtanding the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould be ſetled as hath been propoſed; yet conſidering the odds the Papiſts have of the Proteſtants, their preſent Inclinations to <hi>France,</hi> the Ferment that is on their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>&amp;c. it will be abſolutely neceſſary for the retaining them in obedience, to keep up a competent ſtanding Army in that Kingdom.</hi> Yet when the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> ſhall be well ſetled and Armed, the Popiſh Clergy, Lawyers, and forfeiting Perſons baniſhed, and the reſt excluded from inhabiting in any of the Cities, walled Towns, or Garriſons, the leſs force will be requiſite: For in that caſe the Forces which were kept up about 1680. (in times of Peace) will be ſufficient to ſecure the quiet of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which conſiſted only of 1363. Horſe, Officers included; <hi>viz.</hi> 24 Troops, each conſiſting of a Captain, at 19 <hi>l.</hi>— 12 <hi>s.</hi> each Calendar Month.

ſecure the Kingdom againſt Invaſion, which is that we are to apprehend from <hi>France;</hi> unleſs with the help of the Confederates, we conſtrain the <hi>French</hi> King to employ his whole Force for Defence at home.</p>
               <p>And here it may be conſidered, that although the War againſt <hi>France</hi> ſhould be ended, yet whilſt our Neighbours round about are Armed, and keep conſiderable Forces on Foot, it would be Prudence to keep up ſuch an Army as may ſecure us and our Neighbours from being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Now the Body of ſuch an Army may better be kept up in <hi>Ireland</hi> than in <hi>England:</hi> For the People of <hi>England</hi> have at all times been juſtly jealous of a ſtanding Army in times of Peace at home, and never will be eaſie whilſt they are among them.</p>
               <p>Such Army may therefore more conveniently, and with leſs charge be kept in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where, by reaſon of the plenty of that Kingdom they can ſubſiſt with leſs Pay: For as you may obſerve, the private Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men receive there but 2 <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> each Calendar Month, whereas they receive in <hi>England</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. per Diem,</hi> which is upwards of 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Month, and all the Foot (except the Regiment of Guards) receive but 3 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Week, which is one fourth, or 14 <hi>d. per</hi> Week leſs than is paid the common Souldier in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that 20000 Men may be kept there as cheap as 15000 in <hi>England,</hi> which is great odds.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As the Sword is to Defend a People from violence and injury in times of War; ſo ought the Laws in time of Peace. Therefore <hi>it will be requiſite to ſettle the Civil Juſtice of that Kingdom in ſuch Hands as may duly and truly Adminiſter it,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The remiſs Execution of the Laws againſt Murder in <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath been as a great hindrance to the Peopling and improvement of it, ſo alſo a great Reproach to it: And therefore remedy ought to be provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this particular on this Settlement. I have heard ſome judicious perſons in <hi>Holland</hi> ſay in deriſion of <hi>Ireland;</hi> that the Cattle, and the Mares of that Kingdom are better ſecured by the Laws, or uſual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations thereof, than the Lives of the People. It is indeed the Honour of the United Provinces, and a Bleſſing to the People, that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94476:37"/>
if ever, any perſon of what quality ſoever, that wilfully Kills the meaneſt perſon, eſcape Death: Whereas they ſay of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that only the Money-leſs and Friendleſs are Executed for Murder, whilſt Sheep-Stealers or Mare-Stealers Rarely Eſcape. Murder is by Law in <hi>Ireland</hi> made Treaſon; and becauſe the puniſhment is ſo great, during the two laſt Reigns, few of any Intereſt have been Executed for it. Which if true, is indeed ſad; for where Judges or Juries neglect to do Juſtice in this reſpect, or that Princes grant Pardons to Murderers, the guilt becomes National. Wonderful is the care which God in his Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth of the Life of Man; and many and Critical are the inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he appointed to be made for the Diſcovery of Private Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before the place where it was committed could be deemed acquit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And his command is poſitive, that whoſoever taketh away the Life of another, ſhould be put to Death, and none may hinder, lett, or ſtay him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the reaſon is given, becauſe that Blood is a Land-defiling Sin: And that the Land cannot in any wiſe be cleanſed from the guilt of it, but by the Blood of the Murderer. Therefore great care ought to be taken to prevent future abuſes of this kind, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and rectifie the defects and abuſes of the Laws in this particular.</p>
               <p>It is dangerous to the Community to ſuffer Criminals to Eſcape with impunity; but the worſt and moſt intolerable Robberies and Murders, are thoſe which are committed by the Abuſe of the forms of Laws, when thro' the corruption of Judges, the Laws made for ſecurity of Life, Liberty and Property are perverted to the Deſtruction of any of them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, What hath hitherto been propoſed, hath been for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing future charge by <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for the ſecuring the advantages which comes thence to <hi>England.</hi> I am now to ſhew that it is the Intereſt of their Majeſties, and of <hi>England,</hi> to put that Kingdom into a thriving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and how that may be done.</p>
               <p>That it is the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> and their Majeſties, is evident by what hath been already obſerved. The Revenues of <hi>Ireland</hi> before the breaking out of the preſent Rebellion, did ſurmount the charge of the Kingdom: And the Surpluſage was tranſmitted yearly into <hi>England.</hi> Now if by Trade, or otherwiſe, the Revenues of that Kingdom had been augmented or doubled to what it was in 1685. Then the Annual advantage to <hi>England,</hi> or to the late King, would have been ſo much more: As ſuppoſe for the Year 1685. The Revenue had ſurmounted the charge by 40000 <hi>l.</hi> more or leſs; and that in 1686. it had amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 150000 <hi>l.</hi> more than it did the preceding Year: In that Caſe there had been 190000 <hi>l.</hi> tranſmitted thence to <hi>England</hi> for that Year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this reſpect you ſee it is the Intereſt both of the King, and this Kingdom, to put <hi>Ireland</hi> into a condition of continual improvement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94476:38"/>Our Trade with <hi>France</hi> being the greateſt out-let of our Money, and <hi>France</hi> being the only Kingdom of the World capable of Annoying us; We ought long ſince to have ſtopt that yearly Drain. But it hath been our infelicity, that during the two laſt Reigns, our Councils being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by <hi>France,</hi> we ran Counter to our Intereſt in Trade, as well as Politicks: For inſtead of regulating our Forreign Trade, in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gaining more Markets for our Natural Products, and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; the hindring and abating the Importation of unneceſſary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and encouraging our Manufacturers (which are the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bees of the Nation;) we have been put upon driving the latter from us, and reſtraining the Intercourſe and Commerce between us and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Plantations and <hi>Ireland;</hi> to the advantage of a few, but great detriment to the Publick, not to ſay oppreſſion of our own People abroad, while we have given <hi>France</hi> the opportunity of drawing away our Money, and to run away with a conſiderable part of our Trade; and have thereby paid his Penſioners amongſt us at our own coſt. But his Preſent Majeſty being come to deliver us from ſuch <hi>Malevolent</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, it is to be hoped he will not by imploying the Inſtruments of our paſt Calamities, furniſh them with freſh opportunities to Betray the Kingdom, or Ruin himſelf.</p>
               <p>It is the endeavour of almoſt all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> to Retrench the Power of the <hi>French</hi> King; and 'tis no leſs the concern of <hi>England.</hi> And if I miſtake not, the preſent conjuncture of Affairs doth furniſh us with ſome ſpecial advantages above the reſt to that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is certain that in times of open Trade</hi> France <hi>did yearly Gain one or two Millions</hi> Sterling <hi>by Trade with</hi> England, <hi>which was ſo much clear loſs to this Kingdom. Neither was that all, but we did thereby yearly ſtrengthen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich our mortal Enemies.</hi> To give ſome evidence to this: I find by a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of one Years Trade between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> ſaid to be drawn out of our Cuſtom-Houſe Books, for the Houſe of Commons about <hi>October</hi> 1675. That by the certain Ballance thereof, we Imported from <hi>France</hi> 969105 <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> Sterling more in Commodities than we Export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither; but by the ſuppoſed or probable Ballance 2105255 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find likewiſe that about 1676 or 77. That King having ſome thoughts to Prohibit all our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures from being carried into <hi>France,</hi> the Ballance of Trade between both Kingdoms being laid before him, it did thereby appear that the yearly Exportations of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>England</hi> was 2640000 <hi>l. Sterling,</hi> and that the Importations from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> did not exceed one Million. So that by their own ſhewing, <hi>France</hi> Gained 1640 Thouſand Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> by <hi>England,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the over-Ballance of Trade, went out in Caſh. Amongſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars (in this laſt Ballance of Trade) ſaid to be Imported into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:94476:38"/>
the Tiſſues, Velvets, Sattins, Armozines, Tabbies, Ribons, wrought Silks, Stuffs, Laces, Serges, Hatts, Fans, Cabinets, Pins, Combs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we bring yearly from <hi>France,</hi> are valued to amount to 1140000 <hi>l. Sterling.</hi> All which may be Supplied by the Labour of our own People, and the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> that are and would come amongſt us, were due Liberty and Encouragement given and care taken to put things into the right way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the doing things of this Nature, I am perſwaded it would be of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe, if His Majeſty would by Order of the Council,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>conſtitute a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Council of Trade conſiſting of a great number of the moſt knowing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Merchants of</hi> London; <hi>who, (or a Quorum of them) might meet week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome one of their Halls, (having a Secretary, Door-keeper, and Meſſenger allowed them) where they might conſult how to remove all obſtructions of Trade, how to regulate it; what Manufactures may be ſet up to the beſt advantage of the Kingdom, and how others may be improved,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which, as they ſhall have matured, may be repreſented to His Majeſty and Council, or to both Houſes of Parliament as occaſion ſhall require.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as the Idle hands of the Kingdom, together with the <hi>French</hi> Refugees may profitably, and agreeably be imployed in the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fabricks of Silk, and other Manufactures which we were wont to bring from <hi>France;</hi> ſo may the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (even the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) be aptly employed in the Linnen Manufacture for which that Kingdom is in ſeveral reſpects much more proper than <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For that Land is Cheaper in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and where good Seed is had, the Country yields excellent Flax.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Female Natives who are averſe to any Robuſt Labour, are much inclined to the Spinning of Flax, which they can do with their Rocks, or Diſtaves as they ſit at their Doors, or under a Hedge tending their Cattle.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are a People that live on a courſer and cheaper Dyet, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the manner of <hi>France,</hi> than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do or can; and therefore can afford their Work cheaper, which is a particular of great weight in an Affair of this Nature. For except the Commodity be made at leaſt as cheap as we have it from <hi>France,</hi> it will be brought thence in ſpight of all Prohibitions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is a Labour to which they have been greatly accuſtomed; for before the Commencement of the Preſent Rebellion, there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of Courſe Linnen, Diapers and Damasks made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> much ſtronger than thoſe which we uſually have had from <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There is an Act of the laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament ſtill in Force, for the raiſing of Money to ſet up a Bleaching Yard in each Province of the Kingdom for the Encouragement of the Linnen Manufacture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:94476:39"/>If we conſider the concurrence of theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> the cheapneſs of Land and Labour, the aptneſs of the Soil, Inclination of the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There ſeems no place ſo proper for this Manufacture as <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many thinking men of good Sence have been jealous that</hi> Ireland <hi>by reaſon of the plenty and cheapneſs of Wool, would in time fall into the improvement of it into Manufactures, to the prejudice of</hi> England. <hi>And though their fears (at leaſt, as to this preſent Age) are groundleſs, yet 'tis Wiſdom to provide againſt even remote poſſibilities of detriment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This may be done effectually in this Caſe, by ſetting up and encouraging the Linnen Manufacture, and ſuch others in</hi> Ireland, <hi>as may fully, and profitably imploy that People, and yet not interfere with the Manufactures of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>Now if this can be done in a way which will leſſen the <hi>French</hi> Kings Revenue, and keep a conſiderable part of our Money from being carried into <hi>France,</hi> it ought to be the more acceptable to us.</p>
               <p>In the forementioned Ballance of our Trade with <hi>France</hi> drawn up by the <hi>French,</hi> they do compute, That Linnens, Canvas, Diapers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we yearly import from <hi>France,</hi> do amount to 400000 <hi>l.</hi> But by the Ballance drawn out of our Cuſtom-houſe-books in 1675. we find the imported Linnen from <hi>France</hi> in one year, did amount to 528248 <hi>l.</hi>—16 <hi>s.</hi> whereof the Particulars are as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>Now were theſe Linnens raiſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they eaſily may be, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the whole value of them ſhould be tranſmitted thither in Caſh, inſtead of ſending it to <hi>France,</hi> it would yet be of greater advantage to his Majeſty, and to <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, To <hi>England,</hi> In begetting a greater intercourſe of Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kingdoms.

               <p>Thirdly, It would be advantagious both to the King and Kingdom, in leſſening the Revenue of the <hi>French</hi> King, and impoveriſhing his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>As the Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> have enriched it, and yielded a great Revenue to the Crown to enable the keeping a powerful Navy at Sea; ſo the vaſt quantities of Manufactures which is yearly exported out of <hi>France</hi> into many parts of the World, and eſpecially to <hi>England,</hi> do as well by the Duty paid out of them, enable that King to keep up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral formidable Armies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as imploy and inrich his Subjects, and enable them to pay other Taxes. <hi>Now ſo far as we diveſt</hi> France <hi>of its Manufactures, and leſſen the Exportations, ſo far do we abate its Power, and diſable the keeping up of ſuch powerful Armies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Events and difficulties of War are great and uncertain; but this is a ſure way to weaken any Prince, and to bring any Country into a languiſhing Condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If to what hath been here propoſed any ſhall ſay, That it will be more the advantage of <hi>England</hi> to have this Linnen Manufacture ſet up here than in <hi>Ireland.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p>That the other Manufactures before mentioned, with which we are ſupplyed from <hi>France,</hi> will much more profitably and agreeably imploy our People than the ſpinning of Linnen, which in this caſe muſt be done at a very cheap rate, or it will not prevent the bringing of them from <hi>France.</hi> And <hi>Ireland</hi> in the forementioned reſpects ſeems much more proper for that purpoſe than <hi>England.</hi> And if we would prevent their growing into the Wollen Manufacture, it is but juſt they ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in ſome other which may imploy and maintain them: for they can no more than our People, live only on Air, though they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to work cheaper, and fare harder.</p>
