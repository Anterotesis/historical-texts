            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Poetical Dedication is one of those Accidents, I had almost said Diseases, which few persons of extraordinary Merit and Fortune can escape, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in this Town: soon or late it fixes on the most Conspicuous, and too often defaces the Beauties which it touches. The Apologies that usher in most addresses of this nature, sufficiently show, that they are thought a trouble even by those who presume to make them. It may well then seem strange, that I should own this, and at the same time dare to approach in that very manner a Person for whom I would express the greatest Respect. Yet, Sir, these Considerations, instead of deterring me from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, are perhaps the chief Inducements that embolden me to make it: For You are of too generous and obliging a Temper, and too great a Favourer of the <hi>Muses</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and more particularly of Dramatic Performances, not to be expos'd to the danger of having some of them forc'd upon You, by way of Dedication, beyond a possibility of escaping such a Compliment. Therefore, Sir, I flatter my self with the thoughts of having a better Pretence to do You that civil Violence, than many others, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps wou'd not use You so gently, but wou'd rudely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Your Character, and put You to more pain tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my tender Respect will suffer me to do. For 'tis but too common with some Authors in a manner to dissect their Patrons, and read tedious Lectures over every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual


<pb facs="tcp:64160:3"/>
Qualification. Now, Sir, I am not inclin'd to run into such a Fault: My Zeal may indeed make me afraid of saying too little, but my concern for the satisfaction of the Person to whom <hi>I</hi> write, makes me still more fearful of being thought guilty of saying too much; if yet too much can ever be said of such merit as seems above the reach of Flattery; Praise is a Tribute due to Vertue and acceptable even to the highest Powers: We offer up our Incense, and they shower down their Blessings. But a vulgar and unskilful hand sometimes prophanes the Rites it would perform, and no common Expressions can illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate uncommon Desert. Shou'd I say, that where-ever You appear, You captivate the hearts of one Sex, and raise the Envy and Admiration of the other, 'twou'd be but what is universally own'd, tho' no more than what has been said to many: And shou'd I wave Your outward Graces to speak of those Nobler Accomplishments of Your mind that only wait Occasions to signalize Your Life by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius peculiar to Your illustrious Family, I could do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than enumerate the Endowments of the living Ornaments and springing hopes of their Country. For, tho' most men have discernment enough to admire, very few have Capacity to commend. In an extraordinary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I wou'd say something new and worthy of it; but, in so beaten a path as Panegyric, 'tis next to impossible to make Discoveries; and little more than to give a new turn to old Thoughts is what can be done, even by Masters of Wit and Oratory. Thus, Sir, I please my self with the hopes of being the more excusable in not aiming at that Theme; since, after all, the greatest Artists might be reduc'd to speak like the rest of the World that would do Justice to Your


<pb facs="tcp:64160:3"/>
Character. Besides, some shining Truths, as well as Merit set off to advantage, are like those sparkling Diamonds which so much exceed the common magnitude, that they are sometimes suspected of not being what really they are. So blind some People are, not to consider, that a noble Soul looks most like her self in a graceful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. Certainly, Sir, had Yours been to have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen her Dwelling, she cou'd not have pitch'd on one more worthy such a Guest. A transient sight of such Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may create Envy, but even that Envy must Convert it self to Esteem and Love upon a nearer view: For that Discretion, that Prudence which secures You from the dangerous Attacks of insinuating Designers, when joyn'd with Your sweetness of Temper, and other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, must blunt the Darts of the most repining Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. The Judgment that attends Your kind disposition to oblige, never hinders it from becoming a diffusive Good, and only heightens the Favours You bestow, by Your Modesty in concealing them. Fortune is more oblig'd to You, than You to her. She has been thought one of those noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals who had rather be lavish of their Gifts than just in the payment of their debts; but we must cease to accuse her of Blindness, when we see how deservedly she has heap'd her Favours on You. May You live to possess <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>em long, and those richer Blessings, those native and acquir'd Treasures that so singularly set 'em off; and may You ever believe me to be, what I am ambitious of appearing,</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>THO' Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s Island Princess was frequently Acted of old, and Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved twelve years ago, with some alterations, the Judicious seem satisfy'd, that it wou'd hardly have been relish'd now on the Stage. As I found it not unfit to be made what we here call an Opera, I undertook to revise it, but not as I wou'd have done, had I design'd a correct Play. Let this at once satisfie the Modern Critics, and the Zealous Admirers of Old Plays; for I neither intended to make it regular, nor to keep in all that I lik'd in the Original, but only what I thought fit for my Purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess has answer'd my intent, far beyond Expectation. However, I am not willing to attribute it to my self, but chiefly to the Excellency of the Musical Part. What Mr. <hi>Daniel Purcel</hi> has set is so fine, that as he seems inspir'd with his Brother's wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Genius, it cannot but be equally admir'd. The Notes of the Interlude set by Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> have air and humour that crown 'em with Applause: And the Dialogue and Enthusiastic Song, which Mr. <hi>Leveridge</hi> set, are too particularly lik'd not to engage me to thank him for gracing my words with his Composition, as much as for his celebrated singing; Nor must I omit Mr. <hi>Pate</hi>'s admirable Performance, which, with Mr. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veridge</hi>'s, gives life to the whole Entertainment.</p>
            <p>I should now say something in answer to two late Books in which the Discourse about the Lawfulness and Vnlawfulness of the Stage, printed before <hi>Beauty in Distress</hi> is examin'd: but I am too much engag'd in other matters to do my Friend and my self that Justice at present. Yet if the doubting Gentleman will be pleas'd to meet the Booksellers and Me, they and I can convince him or any Friend of his that the Discourse was really <hi>English'd</hi> and sent me by the person mentioned in the Title.</p>
            <p>The Dialogue in the <hi>4</hi>th Act, should have been sung in the first Entertainment, which, as well as the last, is not very proper for that place, nor wou'd I have let 'em ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear thus but for Reasons as improper to be mention'd here.</p>
