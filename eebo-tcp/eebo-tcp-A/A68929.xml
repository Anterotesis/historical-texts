            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honourable, since I first began to keepe house in this Citie, it hath been no small comfort vnto mee, that a great number of Gentlemen and Merchants of good accompt (as well of this realme as of forreine nations) haue taken in good part such entertainment of pleasure, as my poore abilitie was able to afford them, both by the exercise of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke daily vsed in my house, and by furnishing them with Bookes of that kinde yeerly sent me out of Italy and other places, which beeing for the most part Italian Songs, are for sweetnes of Aire, verie well liked of all, but most in account with them that vnderstand that language. As for the rest, they doe either not sing them at all, or at the least with litle delight. And albeit there be some English songes lately set forth by a great Maister of Musicke, which for skill and sweetnes may content the most curious: yet because they are not many in number, men delighted with varietie haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed more of the same sort. For whose cause chiefly I endeuoured to get into my hands all such English Songes as were praise worthie, and amongst others, I had the hap to find in the hands of some of my good friends, certaine Italian Madrigales translated most of them fiue yeeres agoe by a Gentleman for his priuate delight, (as not long before cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Napolitans had been englished by a verie honourable personage, and now a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of estate, whereof I haue seene some, but neuer possessed any). And finding the same to bee singulerly well liked, not onely of those for whose cause I gathered them, but of many skilfull Gentlemen and other great Musiciens, who affirmed the accent of the words to be well mainteined, the descant not hindred, (though some fewe notes altred) and in euerie place the due decorum kept: I was so bold (beeing well acquainted with the Gentleman) as to entreat the rest, who willingly gaue me such as he had (for of some he kept no Copies) and also some other more lately done at the request of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friends. Now when the same were seene to arise to a iust number, sufficient to furnish a great sett of Bookes, diuers of my friends aforesaid, required with great instance to haue them printed, whereunto I was as willing as the rest, but could neuer obtaine the Gentlemans consent, though I sought it by many great meanes. For his answere was euer, that those trifles beeing but an idle mans exercise, of an idle subiect, written onely for priuate recreation, would blush to be seene otherwise then by twilight, much more to bee brought into the common view of all men. And seeing me still importunate, he tooke his
<pb facs="tcp:20978:3"/>
penne, and with an obstinate resolution of his former speech, wrote in one of the Bookes these verses of the Poet Martial.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Seras tutior ibis ad lucernas,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Wherefore I kept them (or the most of them) for a long time by mee, not presuming to put my sickle in an other mans corne, till such time as I heard, that the same beeing dispersed into many mens hands, were by some persons altogither vnknowen to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, like to be published in Print. Which made mee aduenture to set this worke in hand, hee beeing neither priuie nor present, nor so neere this place as by any reasonable meanes I could giue him notice. Wherin though he may take a iust offence, that I haue laid open his labours without his licence: yet since they were in hazard to come abroad by straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, lame and vnperfect by meanes of false Copies, I hope that this which I haue done to auoide a greater ill, shall deserue a more fauourable excuse. But seeking yet a stronger string to my bow, I thought good in all humble and duetifull sort to offer my selfe and my bold attempt to the defence and protection of your Lordship, to whose honourable hands I present the same. Assuring my selfe, that so great is the loue and affection which hee beareth to your L. as the view of your name in the Front of the Bookes, will take away all displeasure and vnkindnes from mee. And although this may bee thought a greater boldnes then the first (I beeing not any way able to doe your L. such a seruice, as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue so great a fauour) yet I hope these Songes beeing hitherto well esteemed of all, shall be so regarded of your L. as I for them, and they for themselues, shall not be thought vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of your honourable defence. With which hope I humbly commit your L. to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almightie: wishing to the same, that encrease of honour which your true vertue deriued from so noble and renowmed Ancestors doeth worthely deserue.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honourable, since I first began to keepe house in this Citie, it hath been no small comfort vnto mee, that a great number of Gentlemen and Merchants of good accompt (as well of this realme as of forreine nations) haue taken in good part such entertainment of pleasure, as my poore abilitie was able to afford them, both by the exercise of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke daily vsed in my house, and by furnishing them with Bookes of that kinde yeerly sent me out of Italy and other places, which beeing for the most part Italian Songs, are for sweetnes of Aire, verie well liked of all, but most in account with them that vnderstand that language. As for the rest, they doe either not sing them at all, or at the least with litle delight. And albeit there be some English songes lately set forth by a great Maister of Musicke, which for skill and sweetnes may content the most curious: yet because they are not many in number, men delighted with varietie haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed more of the same sort. For whose cause chiefly I endeuoured to get into my hands all such English Songes as were praise worthie, and amongst others, I had the hap to find in the hands of some of my good friends, certaine Italian Madrigales translated most of them fiue yeeres agoe by a Gentleman for his priuate delight, (as not long before cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Napolitans had been englished by a verie honourable personage, and now a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of estate, whereof I haue seene some, but neuer possessed any). And finding the same to bee singulerly well liked, not onely of those for whose cause I gathered them, but of many skilfull Gentlemen and other great Musiciens, who affirmed the accent of the words to be well mainteined, the descant not hindred, (though some fewe notes altred) and in euerie place the due decorum kept: I was so bold (beeing well acquainted with the Gentleman) as to entreat the rest, who willingly gaue me such as he had (for of some he kept no Copies) and also some other more lately done at the request of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friends. Now when the same were seene to arise to a iust number, sufficient to furnish a great sett of Bookes, diuers of my friends aforesaid, required with great instance to haue them printed, whereunto I was as willing as the rest, but could neuer obtaine the Gentlemans consent, though I sought it by many great meanes. For his answere was euer, that those trifles beeing but an idle mans exercise, of an idle subiect, written onely for priuate recreation, would blush to be seene otherwise then by twilight, much more to bee brought into the common view of all men. And seeing me still importunate, he tooke his
<pb facs="tcp:20978:37"/>
penne, and with an obstinate resolution of his former speech, wrote in one of the Bookes these verses of the Poet Martial.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Seras tutior ibis ad lucernas,</l>

                     <l>Tum te vel rigidi legant Catones.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Wherefore I kept them (or the most of them) for a long time by mee, not presuming to put my sickle in an other mans corne, till such time as I heard, that the same beeing dispersed into many mens hands, were by some persons altogither vnknowen to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like to be published in Print. Which made mee aduenture to set this worke in hand, hee beeing neither priuie nor present, nor so neere this place as by any reasonable meanes I could giue him notice. Wherin though he may take a iust offence, that I haue laid open his labours without his licence: yet since they were in hazard to come abroad by straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, lame and vnperfect by meanes of false Copies, I hope that this which I haue done to auoide a greater ill, shall deserue a more fauourable excuse. But seeking yet a stronger string to my bow, I thought good in all humble and duetifull sort to offer my selfe and my bold attempt to the defence and protection of your Lordship, to whose honourable hands I present the same. Assuring my selfe, that so great is the loue and affection which hee beareth to your L. as the view of your name in the Front of the Bookes, will take away all displeasure and vnkindnes from mee. And although this may bee thought a greater boldnes then the first (I beeing not any way able to doe your L. such a seruice, as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue so great a fauour) yet I hope these Songes beeing hitherto well esteemed of all, shall be so regarded of your L. as I for them, and they for themselues, shall not be thought vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of your honourable defence. With which hope I humbly commit your L. to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almightie: wishing to the same, that encrease of honour which your true vertue deriued from so noble and renowmed Ancestors doeth worthely deserue.

As for the rest, they doe either not sing them at all, or at the least with litle delight. And albeit there be some English songs lately set forth by a great Maister of Musicke, which for skill and sweetnes may content the most curious: yet because they are not many in number, men delighted with varietie, haue wished more of the same sort. For whose cause chiefly I endeuoured to get into my hands all such English Songs as were praise worthie, and amongst others, I had the hap to find in the hands of some of my good friends, certaine Italian Madrigales translated most of them fiue yeeres agoe by a Gentleman for his priuate delight, (as not long before cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Napolitans had been englished by a verie honourable personage, and now a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of estate, whereof I haue seene some, but neuer possessed any.) And finding the same to be singulerly well liked, not onely of those for whose cause I gathered them, but of many skilfull Gentlemen and other great Musiciens, who affirmed the accent of the words to be well mainteined, the descant not hindred, (though some fewe notes altred) and in euerie place the due decorum kept: I was so bolde (beeing well acquainted with the Gentleman) as to entreate the rest, who willingly gaue me such as he had (for of some he kept no Copies) and also some other more lately done at the request of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friends. Now when the same were seene to arise to a iust number, sufficient to furnish a great set of Books, diuers of my friends aforesaid, required with great instance to haue them printed, whereunto I was as willing as the rest, but could neuer obtaine the Gentlemans consent, though I sought it by many great meanes. For his answer was euer, that those trifles being but an idle mans exercise, of an idle subiect, written onely for priuate recreation, would blush to be seene otherwise then by twilight, much more to be brought into the common view of all men.

                     <l>Seras tutior ibis ad lucernas,</l>
                     <l>Haec hora est tua, dum furit Lyaeus,</l>
                     <l>Dum regnat rosa, dum madent capilli,</l>

                  <p>Wherefore I kept them (or the most of them) for a long time by mee, not presuming to put my sickle in an other mans corne, till such time as I heard, that the same beeing dispersed into many mens hands, were by some persons altogither vnknowen to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, like to be published in Print. Which made mee aduenture to set this worke in hand, he beeing neither priuie nor present, nor so neere this place as by any reasonable meanes I could giue him notice. Wherein though he may take a iust offence, that I haue laid open his labours without his licence: yet since they were in hazard to come abroad by straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, lame and vnperfect by meanes of false Copies, I hope that this which I haue done to auoide a greater ill, shall deserue a more fauourable excuse. But seeking yet a stronger string to my bow, I thought good in all humble and duetifull sort to offer my selfe and my bold attempt to the defence and protection of your Lordship, to whose honourable hands I present the same. Assuring my selfe, that so great is the loue and affection which hee beareth to your L. as the view of your name in the Front of the Bookes, will take away all displeasure and vnkindnes from mee. And although this may be thought a greater boldnes then the first (I being not any way able to doe your L. such a seruice, as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue so great a fauour) yet I hope these Songs being hitherto well esteemed of all, shalbe so regarded of your L. as I for them, and they for themselues, shall not be thought vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of your honourable defence. With which hope I humbly commit your L. to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almightie: wishing to the same, that encrease of honour which your true vertue deriued from so noble and renowmed Ancestors doeth worthely deserue. From London the first of October. <hi>1588.</hi>

As for the rest, they doe either not sing them at all, or at the least with litle delight. And albeit there be some English songes lately set forth by a great Maister of Musicke, which for skill and sweetnes may content the most curious: yet because they are not many in number, men delighted with varietie haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed more of the same sort. For whose cause chiefly I endeuoured to get into my hands all such English Songes as were praise worthie, and amongst others, I had the hap to find in the hands of some of my good friends, certaine Italian Madrigales translated most of them fiue yeeres agoe by a Gentleman for his priuate delight, (as not long before cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Napolitans had been englished by a verie honourable personage, and now a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of estate, whereof I haue seene some, but neuer possessed any). And finding the same to bee singulerly well liked, not onely of those for whose cause I gathered them, but of many skilfull Gentlemen and other great Musiciens, who affirmed the accent of the words to be well mainteined, the descant not hindred, (though some fewe notes altred) and in euerie place the due decorum kept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was so bold (beeing well acquainted with the Gentleman) as to entreat the rest, who willingly gaue me such as he had (for of some he kept no Copies) and also some other more lately done at the request of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friends. Now when the same were seene to arise to a iust number, sufficient to furnish a great sett of Bookes, diuers of my friends aforesaid, required with great instance to haue them printed, whereunto I was as willing as the rest, but could neuer obtaine the Gentlemans consent, though I sought it by many great meanes. For his answere was euer, that those trifles beeing but an idle mans exercise, of an idle subiect, written onely for priuate recreation, would blush to be seene otherwise then by twilight, much more to bee brought into the common view of all men. And seeing me still importunate, he tooke his
<pb facs="tcp:20978:105"/>
penne, and with an obstinate resolution of his former speech, wrote in one of the Bookes these verses of the Poet Martial.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Seras tutior ibis ad lucernas,</l>
                     <l>Haec hora est tua, dum furit Lyaeus,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Wherefore I kept them (or the most of them) for a long time by mee, not presuming to put my sickle in an other mans corne, till such time as I heard, that the same beeing dispersed into many mens hands, were by some persons altogither vnknowen to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, like to be published in Print. Which made mee aduenture to set this worke in hand, hee beeing neither priuie nor present, nor so neere this place as by any reasonable meanes I could giue him notice. Wherin though he may take a iust offence, that I haue laid open his labours without his licence: yet since they were in hazard to come abroad by straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, lame and vnperfect by meanes of false Copies, I hope that this which I haue done to auoide a greater ill, shall deserue a more fauourable excuse. But seeking yet a stronger string to my bow, I thought good in all humble and duetifull sort to offer my selfe and my bold attempt to the defence and protection of your Lordship, to whose honourable hands I present the same. Assuring my selfe, that so great is the loue and affection which hee beareth to your L. as the view of your name in the Front of the Bookes, will take away all displeasure and vnkindnes from mee. And although this may bee thought a greater boldnes then the first (I beeing not any way able to doe your L. such a seruice, as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue so great a fauour) yet I hope these Songes beeing hitherto well esteemed of all, shall be so regarded of your L. as I for them, and they for themselues, shall not be thought vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of your honourable defence. With which hope I humbly commit your L. to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almightie: wishing to the same, that encrease of honour which your true vertue deriued from so noble and renowmed Ancestors doeth worthely deserue.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honourable, since I first began to keepe house in this Citie, it hath been no small comfort vnto mee, that a great number of Gentlemen and Merchants of good accompt (as well of this realme as of forreine nations) haue taken in good part such entertainment of pleasure, as my poore abilitie was able to affoord them, both by the exercise of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke daily vsed in my house, and by furnishing them with Bookes of that kinde yeerely sent me out of Italy and other places, which beeing for the most part Italian Songs, are for sweetnes of Aire, verie well liked of all, but most in account with them that vnderstand that language. As for the rest, they doe either not sing them at all, or at the least with litle delight. And albeit there be some English songs lately set forth by a great Maister of Musicke, which for skill and sweetnes may content the most curious: yet because they are not many in number, men delighted with varietie, haue wished more of the same sort. For whose cause chiefly I endeuoured to get into my hands all such English Songs as were praise worthie, and amongst others, I had the hap to find in the hands of some of my good friends, certaine Italian Madrigales translated most of them fiue yeeres agoe by a Gentleman for his priuate delight, (as not long before cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Napolitans had been englished by a verie honourable personage, and now a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of estate, whereof I haue seene some, but neuer possessed any.) And finding the same to be singulerly well liked, not onely of those for whose cause I gathered them, but of many skilfull Gentlemen and other great Musiciens, who affirmed the accent of the words to be well mainteined, the descant not hindred, (though some fewe notes altred) and in euerie place the due decorum kept: I was so bolde (beeing well acquainted with the Gentleman) as to entreate the rest, who willingly gaue me such as he had (for of some he kept no Copies) and also some other more lately done at the request of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friends. Now when the same were seene to arise to a iust number, sufficient to furnish a great set of Books, diuers of my friends aforesaid, required with great instance to haue them printed, whereunto I was as willing as the rest, but could neuer obtaine the Gentlemans consent, though I sought it by many great meanes. For his answer was euer, that those trifles being but an idle mans exercise, of an idle subiect, written onely for priuate recreation, would blush to be seene otherwise then by twilight, much more to be brought into the common view of all men. And seeing me still importunate, he tooke his
<pb facs="tcp:20978:135"/>
penne, and with an obstinate resolution of his former speech, wrote in one of the Bookes these verses of the Poet Martial.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Seras tutior ibis ad lucernas,</l>

                     <l>Tum te vel rigidi legant Catones.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Wherefore I kept them (or the most of them) for a long time by mee, not presuming to put my sickle in an other mans corne, till such time as I heard, that the same beeing dispersed into many mens hands, were by some persons altogither vnknowen to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, like to be published in Print. Which made mee aduenture to set this worke in hand, he beeing neither priuie nor present, nor so neere this place as by any reasonable meanes I could giue him notice. Wherein though he may take a iust offence, that I haue laid open his labours without his licence: yet since they were in hazard to come abroad by straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, lame and vnperfect by meanes of false Copies, I hope that this which I haue done to auoide a greater ill, shall deserue a more fauourable excuse. But seeking yet a stronger string to my bow, I thought good in all humble and duetifull sort to offer my selfe and my bold attempt to the defence and protection of your Lordship, to whose honourable hands I present the same. Assuring my selfe, that so great is the loue and affection which hee beareth to your L. as the view of your name in the Front of the Bookes, will take away all displeasure and vnkindnes from mee. And although this may be thought a greater boldnes then the first (I being not any way able to doe your L. such a seruice, as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue so great a fauour) yet I hope these Songs being hitherto well esteemed of all, shalbe so regarded of your L. as I for them, and they for themselues, shall not be thought vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of your honourable defence. With which hope I humbly commit your L. to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almightie: wishing to the same, that encrease of honour which your true vertue deriued from so noble and renowmed Ancestors doeth worthely deserue.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honourable, since I first began to keepe house in this Citie, it hath been no small comfort vnto mee, that a great number of Gentlemen and Merchants of good accompt (as well of this realme as of forreine nations) haue taken in good part such entertainment of pleasure, as my poore abilitie was able to affoord them, both by the exercise of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke daily vsed in my house, and by furnishing them with Bookes of that kinde yeerely sent me out of Italy and other places, which beeing for the most part Italian Songs, are for sweetnes of Aire, verie well liked of all, but most in account with them that vnderstand that language. As for the rest, they doe either not sing them at all, or at the least with litle delight. And albeit there be some English songs lately set forth by a great Maister of Musicke, which for skill and sweetnes may content the most curious: yet because they are not many in number, men delighted with varietie, haue wished more of the same sort. For whose cause chiefly I endeuoured to get into my hands all such English Songs as were praise worthie, and amongst others, I had the hap to find in the hands of some of my good friends, certaine Italian Madrigales translated most of them fiue yeeres agoe by a Gentleman for his priuate delight, (as not long before cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Napolitans had been englished by a verie honourable personage, and now a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of estate, whereof I haue seene some, but neuer possessed any.) And finding the same to be singulerly well liked, not onely of those for whose cause I gathered them, but of many skilfull Gentlemen and other great Musiciens, who affirmed the accent of the words to be well mainteined, the descant not hindred, (though some fewe notes altred) and in euerie place the due decorum kept: I was so bolde (beeing well acquainted with the Gentleman) as to entreate the rest, who willingly gaue me such as he had (for of some he kept no Copies) and also some other more lately done at the request of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friends. Now when the same were seene to arise to a iust number, sufficient to furnish a great set of Books, diuers of my friends aforesaid, required with great instance to haue them printed, whereunto I was as willing as the rest, but could neuer obtaine the Gentlemans consent, though I sought it by many great meanes. For his answer was euer, that those trifles being but an idle mans exercise, of an idle subiect, written onely for priuate recreation, would blush to be seene otherwise then by twilight, much more to be brought into the common view of all men. And seeing me still importunate, he tooke his
<pb facs="tcp:20978:145"/>
penne, and with an obstinate resolution of his former speech, wrote in one of the Bookes these verses of the Poet Martial.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Seras tutior ibis ad lucernas,</l>

                     <l>Tum te vel rigidi legant Catones.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Wherefore I kept them (or the most of them) for a long time by mee, not presuming to put my sickle in an other mans corne, till such time as I heard, that the same beeing dispersed into many mens hands, were by some persons altogither vnknowen to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, like to be published in Print. Which made mee aduenture to set this worke in hand, he beeing neither priuie nor present, nor so neere this place as by any reasonable meanes I could giue him notice. Wherein though he may take a iust offence, that I haue laid open his labours without his licence: yet since they were in hazard to come abroad by straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, lame and vnperfect by meanes of false Copies, I hope that this which I haue done to auoide a greater ill, shall deserue a more fauourable excuse. But seeking yet a stronger string to my bow, I thought good in all humble and duetifull sort to offer my selfe and my bold attempt to the defence and protection of your Lordship, to whose honourable hands I present the same. Assuring my selfe, that so great is the loue and affection which hee beareth to your L. as the view of your name in the Front of the Bookes, will take away all displeasure and vnkindnes from mee. And although this may be thought a greater boldnes then the first (I being not any way able to doe your L. such a seruice, as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue so great a fauour) yet I hope these Songs being hitherto well esteemed of all, shalbe so regarded of your L. as I for them, and they for themselues, shall not be thought vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of your honourable defence. With which hope I humbly commit your L. to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almightie: wishing to the same, that encrease of honour which your true vertue deriued from so noble and renowmed Ancestors doeth worthely deserue.
