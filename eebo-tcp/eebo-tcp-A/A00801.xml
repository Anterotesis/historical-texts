            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Purpoſing then by the Lords aſſiſtance and your godly patience to ſay ſomething of this matter, let the order for me to ſpeake, and you to heare be the ſelfe ſame, which the holy ghoſt directeth vs vnto in the text.</p>

               <p>A doctrine as you well know, that both heretofore hath, and euen yet ſtill is of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant minds auoided as a dangerous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, iudged not fit to be ſpoken of, except it be in ſchooles, and charged with many wicked inconueniences as flowing from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> affirmation thereof.

               <p>For all theſe do ſhow, that the doctrine in no caſe is to be auoyded, but both ſpoken and heard of, as occaſion ſhall ſerue, to Gods great glory and his true ſeruaunts ſwéete comfort.</p>

                  <hi>and to our children for euer, that we may do all the words of the lawe.</hi>

               <p>Againe it is our dutie to eſtééme of the Lord and his word thus, that as he hath <note place="margin">A ſecond reaſon.</note> omitted nothing that is needefull to be knowen ſo hath he laid downe nothing, but what ought to be knowen and is most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:10905:8"/>
Thirdly, it is the dutie of all faithfull <note place="margin">A third reaſon.</note> miniſters to preach the goſpell wholie to Gods people and to deliuer vnto them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>all the counſel of God:</hi> But this doctrine is a part of the contents of this booke of God, therefore to be deliuered to Gods people as occaſion ſhall ſerue, or elſe we do not our duities.</p>
               <p>And leaſt any man ſhould diſtinguiſh of Gods people, &amp; ſay ſome be learned, ſome be vnlearned, the one may be thus prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto, but not the other, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider I pray you the words of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Go preach the goſpell, <hi>Omni creaturae,</hi> To all creatures,</hi> euidently giuing the ſimpler ſort as good right to the whole doctrine of his word, as the better, and the vnlearned as the learned. Which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> faithfull Apoſtle well knew when he ſaide: <hi>I am a debter</hi>

               <p>If any man will ſay: yet a care muſt be had of mens capacities, and of edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I confeſſe it willingly, and therefore haue alwaies added (as occaſion ſerueth) that is, as ſhall be fit for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people, to whom we ſpeake, going by degrées in all our doctrine, as may moſt profit, and euer ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10905:9"/>
and carefully keping within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the word. But vtterly to ſuppreſſe and alwaies to auoyd any truth reueled in the booke of God, or by name this truth of our election and predeſtination, I ſay it is not lawfull, but the contrarie a parcell of our bounden dutie both to God, our ſelues, and our brethren.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, they conſider as <note place="margin">Euidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> litle the euidence of ſcripture for this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine as they haue done before our duties. For I may bouldly ſaye there is no one thing more plainely and fully teſtified in the word then this is, being often iterated and beaten vpon in ſundry places. That a thing often ſpoken of might at one time or other be duelie marked and borne away. Firſt, the doctrine, then the branches.</p>

and <hi>Iacob, Peter</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> with the two theues at the death of Chriſt, &amp; many mo, declare thus much in example to vs. God hath loued, and God hath hated, God hath elected and God hath reiected, God hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; God hath caſt away for euer. Still but in iuſtice whatſoeuer he doth, without wrong to any all being his owne.</p>
               <p>Now if any man will not ſtay héere, but will ſearch further, and aſke a reaſon of this the Lords doing, why he reiecteth any, all being equall his workmanſhip and alike by nature, to theſe the wiſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Apoſtle anſwereth no otherwiſe, but <hi>he willed becauſe he willed.</hi> Noting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Ro. 9.</note> that his will ſhould content vs, which he hath reuealed, without any reaſon which is not reuealed. And if it do not, then heare I pray you what Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith to ſuch curious inquirers: <hi>Tu homo expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi>

For it is holy, it is ſwéete, it is the Lordes. <note place="margin">Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> It maketh no man ſet all at ſix and ſeuen as careleſſe what he doth, ſaying if I be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate <note place="margin">The firſt obiection.</note> to be ſaued, I cannot be damned, and if I be apointed to death I cannot be ſaued. But contrarywiſe it maketh men rather carefull to vſe meanes, as knowing that the decrée of God taketh his effect by meanes. And therefore ſuch as rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this doctrine &amp; cary in themſelues a care not to ſpeake prophanely of any truth of God, howbeit they knowe that the decrée of God ſtandeth euer in it ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and cannot be altered, yet looke they not at that, but at the meanes that God hath apointed all men to vſe, either for the obtaining, or auoyding of any thing wiſhed, or feared. And thoſe meanes they vſe with all care and diligence, ſéeking the ende by the way ordeyned, &amp; not any way made retchleſſe in the meanes by the end. As for example, that I may be plaine. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi> knew that GOD had apointed her ſonne <hi>Iacob</hi> to liue, &amp; to be a greater man then <hi>Eſau,</hi> becauſe God himſelfe had tould her, that he would make two mightie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her two ſonnes, &amp; the elder ſhould ſerue the yonger, yet did ſhe not conclude
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10905:17"/>
hérevpon as theſe men do, that therfore it ſkilled not what ſhe did when <hi>Eſau</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to kill <hi>Iacob,</hi> for being apointed to liue, he could not be killed. But contrarywiſe ſhe moſt carefully deuiſed, and moſt ſpéede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed meanes to kéepe him from danger, by ſending him away to her brother <hi>Laban</hi> till <hi>Eſau</hi> his anger ſhould be aſ waged. Knowing as I ſay that the decrée of God did not preiudice meanes, but rather binde vnto the ſame, as being to take his effect in time by the ſame. And ſo ſhe ran not raſhly to the counſell of GOD as theſe men doe, but looked what her owne dutie was and vſed that. By which meanes her Sonnes both liued, and all came to paſſe <note place="margin">Act 27.</note> well as God had decréed. Take an other example as plaine as this. In the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles we read that <hi>Paule</hi> and his company were in great danger vpon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſea. In ſo much that they were faine to throw all their lading out, and in the end the ſhip burſt in two. Before the extremitie of the perill, God, that is euer carefull to comfort his by his Angel, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> night foretould <hi>Paule</hi> of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould happen, had him not feare, for he ſhould eſcape, and for his ſake all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that were with him which were in

number 276. ſoules. Héere was Gods cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell knowen, his decree and purpoſe reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which <hi>Paule</hi> beléeued, and exhorted all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt firmely to be perſuaded of. What now? Did <hi>Paule</hi> vpon this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, as theſe men ſpeak, why then it ſkills not what we do. For God hauing determined to ſaue vs, we cannot be drowned. No ſuch matter, but leauing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> decrée of God, looketh ſtreight at the meanes that muſt be vſed, the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Mariners, who wold haue ſtolne <note place="margin">ver. 30.</note> away, had not <hi>Paule</hi> preuented them &amp; the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthning of their bodies by taking ſome meat. Which being don, ſuch as could ſwim threw themſelues firſt into the Sea, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to land, they might helpe others, &amp; the reſt on boards and broken péeces of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhip came all ſafe to ſhore. Thus did meanes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Godꝭ purpoſe, and not Gods purpoſe knowen of <hi>Paule,</hi> hinder the carefull vſe of meanes in him or the company.</p>
               <p>A third example, if you will, let vs adde to theſe two, as pregnant to our purpoſe, as either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Our Sauiour Chriſt him ſelfe in his youth was ſought for by <hi>Herod</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 2.</note> to haue bene ſlaine. Yet God had apointed him to liue and to effect the worke of our redemption. So in reſpect of Gods decrée it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10905:18"/>
was not poſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Herod</hi> ſhould hurt him, doe what he could. What then? would God haue this counſell of his a cauſe of ſecuritie or neglect of meanes in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the reputed father of our Sauiour? No. But his owne ſelfe willeth him in a dreame by his Angel to take <hi>Mary</hi> and the Child and to ſlye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egipt,</hi> there tarying till he ſhould bring him word Which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> dyd, &amp; ſo by vſe of meanes preſerued him, whom yet God had apointed to liue from euerlaſting, do <hi>Herod</hi> &amp; all the world what they could. Did <hi>Mary</hi> hinder <hi>Ioſeph</hi> from vſing theſe meanes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to him, tuſh, do not we know what God hath aponinted this Child vnto? Did not I heare what the Angell ſaid to me when I conceiued, what the Shepherds &amp; wiſe men ſaid when he was borne, what <hi>Simeon</hi> and <note place="margin">Lucke. 2. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>Anna</hi> ſayd at my Purification (all which things <hi>Mary</hi> layd vp in her hart ſaith the text) therefore let <hi>Herod</hi> doe what he can, Gods apointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt take place, &amp; cannot be preuented by his malice, though we ſit ſtill and ſlye not at all. Did, I ſay, <hi>Mary</hi> thus reaſon, or thus hinder him? Nothing leſſe. And therefore learne we euer by this example the true dutie of Gods children, &amp; the right vſe of the doctrine of gods prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10905:18"/>
Surely it is this, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the decrée of God is, we euer pitch our owne eyes vpon the meanes that God hath apointed, knowing that as he hath apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs to the ende, ſo he hath preſcribed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to come to the ſame by. If I wilbe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued I muſt doe this, if I will not be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I muſt auoyd that.

but yet they ſinne not conſtreynedlie, or by force thereof at any time. For then might their puniſhment ſéeme ſomewhat hard. But there is in them knowledge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times when they ſinne, will, delight, &amp; anger if they be reſtreyned or brideled any way, all which are teſtimonies againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the iuſtice of their puniſhment, fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing them in their conſciences, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; clering this doctrine of Gods decrée from being any compulſion to them to tranſgreſſe euer.
