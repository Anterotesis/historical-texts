            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

distill milk and honey: for it is you that
do it. Accept therefore these nine drops

I must advertise you, they still retein

                        <p>There are two things in Man
which are call'd <hi>Nature;</hi> one <hi>Reason,</hi>
which truly is his Nature, ruling all his
actions as he is Man, and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him from Beasts. The other is this
frame of our Materiall Instruments,
which we call our <hi>Body,</hi> consisting of
Motion, of Blood and Spirits, which
have a course in us so depending from
other causes, that neverthelesse a great
part is in our power. Of these two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Reason often contradicts the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour,
and therefore Grace and our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36853:8"/>
supernaturall way must do the same:
Whereas for <hi>Reason, Grace</hi> never
contradicts it, but guides it, and
shewes it that many things (which
otherwise it would never have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to) are very reasonable, and
by force of reason it self ought to be
enacted and put in execution. For our
supernaturall life is like a Graft, which
though it bear a better fruit then the
Stock, yet can it bring forth nothing
but by means of that, and in the season
wherein the Stock of it self flourishes.</p>

these two Heads, To learn the things

are chiefly, <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> in
Heaven I comprehend all that belongs
to Almighty God, as well to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head

to study what in this life imports you,
which is the real valuation of those

motives that govern mankind here,

to enjoy a clear serenity of mind, free
from those errours we see our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

much more, whereof, as yet, you have

for friends and acquaintance you

knowing all, being familiar with

                        <p>Because some would laugh at

                        <p>'Tis true, but I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

were perfectly understood by every

his own mind without the least im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to understand perfectly at the

this not onely to himself, but any one

are acquainted with the circumstances
of every passage, the conversation is
dry and unpleasing. Now here they
are very few, who have knowledge of
the same particulars that I have; for
their number is confin'd to such as I
live withall; and I know not whether
I can expect to meet many of them in
heaven, the straitnesse of the way and
the paucity of the enterers being so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                        <p>It were a very hard question
to determine the number of those that
go to heaven, and at this time would
divert our discourse: only this I will
say, that the paucity of the blessed may
well stand with this truth, that many
of such Christians as live innocently
in the world are saved. Wherefore I
fear not but you may have enough to
converse with, who are acquainted
with the particulars your self are. But
what will you think, if every one hath
as cleare a sight of all your circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as your own heart? for it were a
great simplicity to imagine the Soul,
abstracted from the Body, hath no
means to know things without it, since
in the Body it hath; and, if it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
with any means, it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but it should know whatever it
pleases. But (as I said before) the
proof of these things is to be sought
elsewhere: here we are onely to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how great and full the pleasure of
a blessed Soul is, these things being so
as I have declared.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36853:12"/>
made Heaven a tractable thing to me:
for by these considerations, I do not
onely find a common apprehension of
good, but I can lay hands upon intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
pleasures, whereby to content
my naturall desires, and with hope
thereof make them pursue the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,

                        <p>Reflect then a little, and
summe up, or rather conclude what
kind of life in Heaven this pleasure will
afford you. Remember some after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
or couple of houres, in which
your pleasing conversation hath been
at height, remember the twinkling of
some one conceit, which especially
carryed away your heart, and for the
time possessed it wholly: think with
your self, had the whole two houres
continu'd like that minute, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
your pleasure had been. Then
elevate your fancy, and conceive in
Heaven, not houres, nor dayes, nor
yeares, but ages of ages, but an eternity
will be of that dainty ravishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
Joyne (if you are able) all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36853:13"/>
these encreases and advantages, which
we have expressed, whereof there is not
one but drawes an incomparable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
with it: and if only this were

do not see how any temporall thing

opening seeds, which now ferment in
your heart: and this must be by often
thinking of and remembring these and
such other considerations, partly at set
times, and partly whenever you find
your self in a fitting disposition, that is,
at ease, alone, &amp; your mind free, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
inclin'd to good thoughts;
lose not these tides, as I may call them,
for they bring great waves of spirituall
profit. In the happy opportunity, strive
to penetrate with a cleer understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36853:13"/>
the verity of such points; then turn
your self upon your self, and see what
you do, and what you should do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these truths. Encourage your
self to what is wanting, amend what
is amisse, and sigh after the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
we all labour for.</p>

For (to begin with <hi>Persons)</hi> you shall

ever been the greatest and worthiest in

you shall have <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father
of that Nation, which, after so many
ages continuance in the Prerogative
of the Elect people of Almighty God,
is now by their dispersion into all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
become to them a Testimony of

was blazoned; you shall have <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Solomon,</hi> (if his Penance was true

of Christ and his Apostles, of Bishops,
Martyrs and Hermites? what of the
so fruitfull devouter Sexe? All these
have expressed the most generous evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Universall Gallantry, and
shewn the noblest effects of all such
vertues as breed admiration in humane
hearts. What Court, what Maske,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36853:15"/>
what Shew can feign or counterfit so

                        <p>'Tis true, but I am not taken
with these high and sublime vertues,
which I do not well apprehend. But if I

impression in my affections.</p>

degree too, and greater measure of

here, you must certainly be charmed
with a strange excesse of Pleasure. And

you are pleased with the outward

                        <p>You need not, for were they
counterfeit, or no greater in the heart
then in the outward shew, I should lose
my esteem of the persons. But out of one
generous Act expressed, we imagine the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36853:15"/>
heart, ready to perform a hundred, &amp; to
be as it were naturally and unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fitted to do the like again, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
is offered: this makes me highly
value and be delighted with the person.</p>

admirable qualities in a high perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so immutably settled, that soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
heaven and earth may fall in pieces,
then they decline the least tittle from
that degree of worth they are exalted
to; how can you then doubt that your
pleasure there, even in this very kind,
will not be infinitely preferrable to the
greatest the world can furnish you?
And for those high vertues, of which
you say you feel little apprehension;
your state there will be so improved, that
you will be able exactly to penetrate the
true value of every one, which will
make you see with how much passion,
ignorance, and over-sight the greatest
actions of this life are manag'd. You'l
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36853:16"/>
discern evidently that the valour of
Captains, the wisdome of Statesmen,
the skill of great Clerks, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to, make no bulk or shew in
comparison of that Knowledge, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Courage, which those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
persons, and here reputed-fools
ever carried enclosed in their breasts.
Think what infinite pleasure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
you will infallibly receive in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
them, and being informed
of their worths.</p>

confesse, but yet I do not see that in

of the persons, the gracefulnesse
of their behaviour, or the variety of their
attires, and such otherthings, wherewith
(I speak but in mine own weaknesse) I

<hi>of Things,</hi> which you distinguished

For take away the mind, and all the
rest may be in a <hi>Puppet-play or motion,</hi>
as they call it. Consider again with
your self, that a cunning Architect is
delighted as much with the Modell of a
House, as you with the building it self;
a good Musician with the notes in his
head, as you with the singing. Out of
which I draw this great and curious
truth; that when you shall be perfect
in knowledge (as is expected in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
you will not look after these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

here with their novelty, variety, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
and excellency, me thinks I

                        <p>When I reflect that <hi>Angels</hi>
have no bodies, and therefore all their
nature is to be purely knowing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
me thinks our Saviour in these
words signifies to us, that the pleasures
of the next world should not consist in
these corporeall motions which here
are gratefull to us, by reason of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
but that they should be of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
such as are proportioned to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
and although we should have bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
yet they should not hinder our
knowledge and pleasure even by them,
from being such as the Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
is, at least in likenesse, if not
in equality.</p>

                        <p>You are very right, and do
you not see every man conceits that,
though Angels are no bodies, yet they
have means (and those naturall means
too) to see and know any thing that
passes amongst bodies? do you not hear
them set for Governours of corporeall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36853:18"/>
things, even men deliver'd to their
charge? Wherefore you cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they have a naturall power and
force to know all things here below at
their will and pleasure. Conceive then
that Souls freed from the body have the
same capacity, though in a lesse degree;
and that at will they can see what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in this world, and not onely in this
Globe of earth, the world of Man, but
in all the other infinite Masse of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which in truth and rigour is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the world. Now therefore imagine
your self seated upon a high hill (such
as the Devil placed our Saviour on)
with your eyes so perfect and sharp,
that whatsoever you had a mind to see,
no remotenesse of place, no Hills or
Dales, no Clouds or darknesse, no
Walls or Dungeons could hide from
you: and then think, what could your
heart desire in this sort of pleasure, that
you were not Mistresse of? and know
that all is far short of what the state of
blisse will afford you, even in this kind.
For neither could you in that posture
(no not in a Masking house it self)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36853:18"/>
note all particulars to be seen, nor list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to all you would desire to hear, nor
know all you would be earnest to ask;
and (which is most of all) you could
attend but to one thing at once: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the state of blisse, you shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
every circumstance perfectly, and
all things that are done at once you
may know altogether, the one not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the other, though there be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of them.</p>

                        <p>It followes clearly out of
what we have said, make no doubt of it,
but raise your thoughts and mark. There
is a Generall mustering his flourishing
Troops, his Drums beating, his wanton
Colours dancing in the Aire, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
as glorious as the Starres in
the Firmament, his Ranks and Files
glittering in fearfull steel; Majesty,
beauty and strength at one sight ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
the beholders. Here is a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
or entertainment of some great
Prince, the wits of two Kingdomes set
a work for invention of sports and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36853:19"/>
Ballads; what Water, Fire, Aire, and
the dull weight of Earth can do, all
scann'd by exact Artificers, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
quintessence reduc'd into a modell
or taste, to please the ambition of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty-soul'd
Lords. There is a great
Admirall commanding the obedient
Waves, and prancing over the Billows
with Mast upon Mast, loaden with
towred wings, his Streamers flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his Canon roaring, his People
shouting. In other places battels join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
some by Sea, some by Land; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
giving and repulsing, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
of Walls, entrance upon brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Murtherers devouring all before
them with flaming mouthes. Here
great Windes and Shipwracks; there
glorious Palaces, mighty Treasures,
rich Jewels, Inventions of all sorts to
content those whom Industry or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
hath made the Masters of Money.
These and a thousand other things,
which at leasure you may reflect upon,
(especially those wherewith you are
most affected) consider and think that
with a cast of your understanding,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36853:19"/>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36853:20"/>
put you in mind of one circumstance,
which peradventure you may forget.
When you go to these Maskes and

                        <p>What need I say Yes, to you
that know better then my self the most
hidden thoughts of my heart? how
can I counterfeit to the Light, which
shines into every corner of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and shewes my self so cleerly
to me? I confesse therefore that I sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
go, but to be seen hath its share
in my wishes; nay, sometimes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
This makes me so exact in dressing
my self, that all things may contribute
to their good liking of me; this makes
me choice of my Company and
place, and desirous of any thing that
may draw eyes upon me. Happy they
that can content themselves with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
their own perfections in a
Looking-glasse! for my part, unlesse I
have the commendations of others, I
little satisfie my self. Hence also it is,
that if any great personage take notice
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36853:20"/>
of me in publick, my heart leaps to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
the whispering of friends and
strangers, the one taking notice of
the favour done me, the other busily
enquiring who is that so highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured:
when if they light on any of
my wel-wishers, receiving in exchange
a Catalogue of all that is good, and to
be esteemed in me, O this is a sweet
thing. And if perchance any of their
discourse come to my eares, I know not
how to expresse what a pleasing motion
it makes in me. But should it happen
that the King or Queen were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that graced me before all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
a year were not sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
congratulatory visits, to expresse
every circumstance of the favour, to
professe my self undeserving and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaden,
(though willing enough to hear
others say, it was no more then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.)
These things I confesse passe
within me, but I am so afraid any should
take notice on't, that fain I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my self many times, my actions
depend on other more justifiable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.
Wonder not therefore that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36853:21"/>
not this in Heaven, where all
hearts being open, I shall not for

                        <p>How easily the comparison
of this world misleads you in the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the next? since there you
shall desire it without shame, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
it more fully then your heart can
wish here. For if you look into your
own desires, you shall find that two
things chiefly delight you, to be known,
and to be esteemed. For the former,
consider here below the multitude of
persons into whose knowledge you
may fall, the quality of the knowledge
they are to have of you, the worth of
their persons, and the goodnesse of their
judgements, which may make you joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that their verdicts passe in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
As for the multitude, it scarce
ever exceeds one Kingdome even in
Princes, and of this Kingdome not one
Shire, not one Town are familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
no not so much as to know
you, if your cloaths were changed, but
you should walk undiscerned even in
the streets.</p>

                        <p>That is true, but all those
whose spirits are a little elevated will
know me, and their acquaintance is

you esteem in your whole life
time, how many are you like to be
known to? Consider, amongst those
you know and are well acquainted
with, how many of them your self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn:
think whether every tenth person
be thought fit to judge in those perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
matters truly; if either King or
Kings Favourite be known to ten,
(who are able justly to judge of worth
betwixt Man and Man) I think it a
great number. Turn then the leaf and
look into Heaven, where no part of the
Earth is excluded; of all Nations, of
all Ages there are to be found, not
one but whose judgement is a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of truth, the number excessive, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36853:22"/>
quality of the persons incomparable.
And if yet this do not content you, cast
a view upon the vale of <hi>Jeho saphat,</hi>
number if you can, the two great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which are at once to appear, the

<q>Cunctaque cunctorum cunctis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana

every one, from the greatest to the least,
shall know all that's true of you, all
that you can say for your self. Think
what honour 'twill be at that day, to be
grac'd by him that is in power; when
all those multitudes shall see it, and
clearly see as the glory you receive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the favour of the highest, so
'tis proportion'd according to what of

neglect, without ever reflecting upon
these two most evident truths; one, that
the highest honour and reputation in

for what is it to be in the good
opinion of so few as I perceive come to
the perfect and inward knowledge of
us? the other, that truly Fame and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is to be found in the next world;
especially at the great day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at the meeting of Ages, where
whole mankind and all the quires
of Angels shall see &amp; perfectly know
all that concerns us. But I'm afraid
that in so great multitudes I shall find
little regard, here I'm esteem'd amongst
that small number I converse with;
and 'tis a comfort that though my
acquaintance be few, yet they are as
many as I have need of, and my life is
amongst no more: There in such an
infinity, my place will be so low, and
my share so small, that no body will
vouchsafe me one cast of an eye.</p>

the esteem of the world, what it is,

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36853:23"/>
onely upon such as have sufficient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with you, to furnish them

must exclude, first, all whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are contemptible, because they

those who preferre unworthy respects,
as Riches, Nobility, Comelinesse, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Youth, &amp;c. before true wisdome and
the parts of Virtue, really and solidly
adorning your person; I speak not of
those supernaturall graces which are
generally contemned by men of this
World, but of such endowments as the
wiser sort prefer before all those empty
toyes that garboyle the fancies of the
multitude: Thirdly, take out of the rest,
those who (upon designe either of jeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their own sport, or flattering
for their private interests) counterfeit
to value and esteem you; as if some great
man seem to court &amp; honour you, what
assurance can there be that his civilities
proceed from his heart purely for your
consideration, and not for some friends
sake or particular project; so that your
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36853:23"/>
back once turn'd, you are no sooner out
of sight then out of mind? Nay, even
amongst those who are sincere and
cordiall friends, how soon may therebe
a change? upon what slight grounds
perhaps took they this opinion? &amp; upon
as slight an occasion can they desert.</p>

Already I understand that the

not subject to these blemishes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies;
they are all true, all hearty,
all constant, I must change if they do;
for as long as I remain with the same
worth, their Sentence cannot alter. Yet

keep me without any respect, justly I

to propose, and yet I confesse it
has a great power &amp; mastery over my
affections: 'tis that I love to be beloved.
If any shew the least signe of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for me, methinks presently, they
are the best persons in the world; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there so poor a wretch, but if I
see in him a hearty expression of love
towards me, I cannot chuse but love
him again. Alas, what do I talk of
Men? if a little Dog or Bird, or any
other dumb Creature come once to take
a haunt to me, and be delighted in my
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36853:25"/>
pany, 'tis a death to see any harm befall
them: and I find a very great satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and content to see them play and
pleas'd according to their low manner.
Now if this love be wanting in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
I fear 'twill put me out of conceit

                        <p>You are too fearfull, and too
little considerate of the joyes you aim
at. Think but with your self that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is nothing but the love of God
and your Neighbour, that 'tis the way
to Heaven, and that of our three guides
and conducters thither, onely that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
with us; and see then whether
there can be any fear you shall want
love. Consider that the principall and
main employment in Heaven is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but to love and be beloved;
and those there are the greatest lovers,
who are in the greatest favour and
highest glory. For God himself is love,
and none is in God, or God in them,
but by love. Measure therefore with
your thoughts the scope of Heaven,
from Gods eternall throne to the least
child which by Baptisme is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36853:26"/>
of the Adoption of Christ; and
be sure that all these shall love you, you
especially, love you as much as if there
were no others to be belov'd but only
your self; that the higher and greater
every one is, the more ardent, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and effectuall shall his love be to
you in person, in particular, by name
and design. What do you now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the base love of this world? of
the love of Dogs and Birds? raise a
little your thoughts, and look up at true
love where it reignes in its full glory,
where it shewes it self in its Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
fly at it there, fear not, if you
love, it cannot escape you; make but
your approaches, it will meet you: 'tis
too ethereall for this cloudy region; lift
but your self above your body, and of
it self it will bend and stoop to your
Arms.</p>

                        <p>What you have said cannot
chuse but be a great comfort, but I have
a foolish scruple, if you will give me
leave to utter it; yet I need not be so
coy, since you know enough by me:
this 'tis. I have been taught that we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36853:26"/>
should strive to love all men for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Gods sake; and so I suppose it
passes in Heaven, that all these great
lovers which you have express'd to be
there, are of this Nature, that they will
love me, because God Almighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it. And this alas, according
to my low apprehension, gives me but
little satisfaction, for this love and
good will is not to me, but to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God; whereas my perversenesse is
such, that I my self would be beloved:
and I mark in my self a great difference
between, when I give money to some
little child I am pleas'd with, &amp; when I
bestow an Almes on a poore body that
askes me for Gods sake: in the one I
find that affection I desire others
should bear to me, towards the Beggar
I have no such inclination; and the
cause as I conceive is, that one seems to
deserve my love, the other only to need
it. Now if you tell me, that in Heaven
they shall love me, but I shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it; I confesse (as my affections
now stand) 'twill be a great cooling to
the esteem I desire to have of their love.</p>

you cannot endure to be belov'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
your desert? I fear you endure it
often enough in this world, but here
self-conceit makes you easily think not
only all love and esteem due to you
which is offer'd, but for the most part
that too little is offer'd. Yet I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
sometimes it happens that we
truly conceit another to shew more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
towards us then we have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
though I never heard any offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at such excesse, but rather highly
pleas'd, and engag'd to an endeavour
of deserving it. Neverthelesse I'le strive
to give you content, even in this point:
Therefore tell me what you think of a
person in whom reason governs in full
measure, so that not a thought passes
but according to the pure direction of
it: do you believe in such a person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
love can be unreasonable?</p>

                        <p>I perceive whither you aime;
that since in Heaven all's govern'd by
reason, none there can love otherwise
then according to desert: but withall
I see there may be that desert in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and not in me; as for example,
they shall love me because God (who
deserves to be obey'd) commands them;
and if only thus, I rest as unsatisfied
as before.</p>

                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>Why, do you conceive that
God can command any unreasonable
thing, especially there, where reason is
in it's perfection? (for here I know not
what the mixture of bodily qualities
with reason may make it reasonable
for God to command.) or if God
would command others to love you
beyond desert, yet do you think that
himself (being the essence of reason
and understanding) can love you so?
or that any one by his command can
love you more then himself does?</p>

                        <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
                        <p>This is right again: Yet I see
we love many things for the connexion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36853:28"/>
they have with some other, and not for
themselves: a Dog, a Book, a Glove,
from a beloved person is much made
of, not for it self, but because the using
it kindly is an expression, or rather a
practise of our love towards the person
to whom it belongs. So I imagine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am a creature of Almighty
God's making, and have cost his only
Son so dear a price, those blessed spirits
inflam'd with the love of God, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
expresse an affection to me, which
you see is wholly by the desert of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not mine; and however it may
be infinitely more then I deserve, yet is
it not that which I express'd to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to my content.</p>

I shall not carry with me; as wholly,
or in part belonging to my body.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

                        <p>No matter: You shall be
belov'd there, because you had such
things in time and place, wherein
'twas fit to have them.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
                        <p>Now, surely, I have ground
enough, without farther curiosity or
dispute, to presume upon the content
I desire, since you have so plainly and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36853:29"/>
evidently demonstrated it. But I know
not whether I am arriv'd at my hopes,
for I feel in my self an expectation
that my familiar friends and kindred,
and such as I my self particularly love,
should likewise return me a speciall
love.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>Fear not, you shall have
that also: For mark well the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
I told you, that there should not be
the least thing love-worthy in you, but
you shall be especially belov'd for it.
Now then, if Friendship, Kindred,
Acquaintance, &amp;c. be things which
put a particular obligation of love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those persons betwixt whom they
are, you will be more lovely to them
for these very respects: wherefore all
those will love you more especially
then any others; which I think is that
you express'd to be your desire.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, this is well: but yet a
little difficulty molests me. I have been
taught that God loves most and next
to himself, the Angels or Saints, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they are in degree under
him: then if the lowest love me as much
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36853:29"/>
as I deserve, others will love me more
then I deserve, which is against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and so impossible.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>Two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in love; first the comparison of
one beloved object to another; and
this way all will love you according
to your desert: for none shall prefer
any thing lesse lovely before you, nor
you before any thing more lovely:
a second consideration is the strength
of the affection we call <hi>Love,</hi> which
(being according to the nature out of
which it proceeds) in all above your
condition will be greater then you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
in all under you, weaker; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proportion of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and strengths.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
                        <p>Yet one thing more comes
into my mind: I see some strong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in whom (though by reall effects
it evidently appeares they love their
friend yet) there is no tendernesse;
you can observe no motion of love in
their hearts, no shew in their change
of countenance: such a love gives me
small content. Shall we therefore have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36853:30"/>
in Heaven a melting, sweet, delicious
love, or onely those strong and solid
thoughts, which as they are very good,
so are they far from giving that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which this other soft and gentle
love affords?</p>

                        <p>Would you not think that
man unreasonable, who being cold,
and brought to a good fire, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to warm himself, because there was
no smoak, he having been alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to smoaky fires?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes certainly: for he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
his own pretence; smoak being
a hindrance to the heating he desires,
besides other inconveniences which
render it offensive.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>Such is the passion you call
<hi>Love,</hi> to that which truly is <hi>Love:</hi> for
(everything being to be discern'd by
the effects) you shall see those who
are most given to this whining sort of
love, least active to help themselves,
but wholly abandoned up to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of their Passion, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to procure what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
So in grief, if you see one fit still
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36853:30"/>
weeping and despairing, you count
him womanish; and not so much that
his sorrow is great, as that a little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
him. Besides, this passion is but an
expression of the inward mind, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a wasting of it; for we see that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
weeping eases and discharges
the heart, which becomes lighter after
such venting of it self by tears. So that
this which you desire to have in Heaven,
is not love, but an expression or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
of it, weakning and disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the affection for the present, and
wasting it for the future; and therefore
not fit to give content to such as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the happinesse of enjoying a
place in Heaven.</p>

                        <p>THere's yet another thing
wherein I find a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and drawing of Nature; and
certainly 'tis agreeable to some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
within me, though this kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
appears not so sensibly; 'tis in
hearing and understanding what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36853:31"/>
in the world. I cannot espie a whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but I long to know about what
'twas. If any of my neighbours or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
have met with any change
of fortune, I cannot endure to have
it concealed from me: nay, the more
secret such an accident is, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is my eagernesse to know it:
though, as I said, I observe not those
sensible effects in this sort of Pleasure,
as in the former; unlesse there happen
a speciall reason, out of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consideration to raise them.
And, perhaps, the curiosity of
hearing news proceeds from the
same cause, and belongs to the same
head; as also the love I have to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Histories, &amp; knowing what pass'd
in our forefathers times: for this, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
I long after, though I finde not
therein such apparent delight as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
entertainments.</p>

being wholy contriv'd and fram'd, both
in subject, fashion, and style to move,

These therefore I did not range un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Head (as likewise seeing of
Playes) because the content arising
from them seems to be of a higher or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

and these are of one nature,
though of different fashions? So that
the delight reap'd out of both must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of necessity be of the same nature.
And as for Playes, they are but the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
expression of some little part of that
which (compriz'd more shortly) makes
a History: so that they all agree in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
though differ from one another
in circumstances. Tell me then, what
is it that pleases you in all these things?</p>

                        <p>For playes and feigned Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
I perceive my self taken with the
Passions due to the subject represented.
I see I have a tendernesse and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
towards those who suffer imno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently;
I abhor cruel and unnaturall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36853:32"/>
actions; I am glad when good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
relieves the afflicted. In fine, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
word or deed come in very pat and
unexpectedly, I am highly ravish'd.
These things I observe both please me
in the reading or seeing, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I find my self great with desire,
till I have discharged my self of them
to some other, whom, I conceive, apt
to take pleasure in such passages. In
true Histories and Newes I am affected
with a kind of sober satisfaction; and
if I have heard or read half a story, I
feel a want of content till I know the
rest, and be fully possest of the whole
proceeding. As for home-bred Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities,
I cannot conceive what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
our affections concerning them,
except the common desire to know,
which I imagine is greater towards
those things whereof we have already
a beginning; for so, I see, this Itch is
pleased, chiefly, in the businesse of mine
own acquaintance.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>And do you think that the
common desire of Knowing is a Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of so triviall a consequence? which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36853:32"/>
peradventure (if all things were
throughly look't into) would appeare
the chief or sole cause of all our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
at least, it being the inclination of
our understanding and reason, that is,
the most substantiall and principall
part of us, it must necessarily have great
influence upon all our actions. But
besides this, I see another delight, which
is a kind of tickling our affections,
whereat they move and have their
course, as strings tuned to certain notes
answer one another. And this happens
in all humane affaires; but chiefly in
such as bear a particular relation to our
own state and private circumstances.
We heare not of any action done by
another man, but it presently strikes a
key in our breasts, either of pleasure or
displeasure, because it has a proper and
particular report to our condition.</p>
                        <p>Now consider how small a time you
can endure to sit ruminating on a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that no way concerns you; how
impossible it is to take off your hearts
from thoughts, wherein your interest
or affections are notably engag'd: and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36853:33"/>
then reflect on the choice which in
heaven you shall have, where (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what is declared) the whole
course of the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> shall be
clear before your eyes, none of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
or secretest thoughts hidden from
you Think how one reflection will
preoccupate another, how one delight
will surcharge another. If you will
see the Counsels of Statesmen and great
Princes, there opens it self a Carriere
<hi>aperte de vieu,</hi> as the French say. If
you will see how Scholars came to their
profound learning; how Artificers to
their great experience: If you will see
how petty fellows shew as much cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in a little circle, as the Grandees
of the world in their deep and politick
designes: If you will see the increase,
as it were, of souls, from the babling of
children that know not how to spell
their letters, to the learned Sermons
and sublime Speculations of the most
famous and renowned Masters: in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
kind, an excesse of examples, a
world of particulars will display them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to you; all different in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36853:33"/>
yet all agreeing in generall
heads; all inviting and enticeing by
their specialty; all contenting and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying,
by shewing their source in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
and common principles. Nor
shall therebe, in the whole multitude,
any one that shall not affect you with
some particular relish and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by its speciall conformity or diffor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to your nature; for both these in
that state shall yield content; as you
see here we laugh and are delighted
with that in another, whereat we
should be asham'd and displeas'd, if it
were in our selves.</p>

into what passes there, but by
revelation from him. Wherefore pray
make me know what you mean when
you say, <hi>No mans thoughts are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from the Blessed;</hi> for this, I hear, is
grounded in the holy Scriptures, &amp; so a
dangerous matter to be meddled with.</p>

the Scriptures are written to men, that
is, to people living in a vale of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and darknesse, may, perhaps,
too hastily passe their censure upon the
<hi>City of Light,</hi> whereof we discourse.
But, as far as I can understand them,
there is not a word in our holy books
excluding the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
from this-knowledge, and our Masters
use to give a rule, that speeches are to
be taken <hi>secundum subjectam materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
according to the matter we treat of;
for he that speaks is suppos'd to confine
himself to the particular subject of the
discourse he undertakes: neverthelesse,
you have not yet heard me say the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
habitation enjoyes this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
without Revelation; for here I
do not display the principles upon
which their conclusions depend; but
onely declare to you (admitting
such positions to be true) the excesse
of pleasure and content you are to reap
in that harvest, if you cultivate your
land in this world, as you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>

                        <p>Then I'le believe what you
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36853:34"/>
say without farther enquiry. For tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I see, that if the day of Judgement
declare the justice of Almighty God,
this cannot be done without full and
generall discovery of all hearts: and if
then every secret thought shall be laid
open before the whole world, me thinks
'tis no great matter the blessed should
in joy the priviledge of knowing them
before. Besides, it would be an unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
maime both to their knowledge
and content, if seeing the effects, they
should be depriv'd of seeing the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
which, for the most part, reside
in the inward thoughts. And so have
I fallen upon no small subject of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to me, that I shall see the Motives
and true Sources of all effects: a thing
I observe much aimed at by men of
sharpest understandings; whence 'tis
that Historians are so desirous to dive
into the secrets of affaires; those being
accounted the best, who are thought
most truly to have found the deepest
ground and bottom of matters of great
consequence.</p>

which here you find in talking,
reading, or fitting at a Play; perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
by comparison of your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
below, you will make a fuller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the content you shall meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;
finding there all the delights sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and pure, without the mixture of

                        <p>I have not so ill and slowly
follow'd you, but of my self I can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that there I shall not have that
incertitude of reports, which here we
wholy rely upon, and yet they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
so fallible, that it were a great
indiscretion to believe above the tenth
part of what is told us. Nay, even when
I heare any strange relation from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
who were present, whose eyes and
eares saw and heard what pass'd, yet
am I often troubled how to understand
their words; some for Interest and
Passion, some for carelesnesse or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
some because they think it a piece
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36853:35"/>
of wit to mend every thing they tell, so
disguising and altering the truth, that
it requires a sharp and steady sight to
discern it. Now for reports, how
easily they rise, upon what mistakes;
how they are increas'd, going from
hand to hand; with what assurance
even those who are accounted the best
intelligencers, will relate, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
stand upon them; our daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
gives so full a satisfaction, that
'tis almost a folly to believe any thing
certainly, till a common consent has
taken away all doubt. And all these
difficulties may, in a proportion, be
applyed to Histories; and perhaps, in
some respect remain lesse answerable
then the objections against living re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports:
so that I cannot but admire their
levity, who dare with such security
ground their judgements in matters of
great consequence, upon the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
relations of some one or few Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
though living and present.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>I see likewise I shall not be troubled
with the drynesse, the ill behaviour and
importunity of such idle braines, as are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36853:36"/>
generally the inventers of those News;
nor be molested with impertinent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
upon subjects of little moment
in themselves, and less concernments
to me, which often occur in the best Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
and Playes. Neither shall my
body be diseas'd, my head heavy, mine
eyes sore, my time over-slipt, when bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
or rest calls upon me: all which
are diminishing circumstances, I feel,
continually checking my appetite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
these delights in this world: and
I see (all these being taken away)
there arises a pure, a high, an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and never ending contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
an abundant, a filling and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
delight. Now methinks, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to understand how the waters <hi>our
Saviour</hi> promised the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> can
prove an everlasting Fountain of joy
and refreshment, perpetually spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to-eternall life. But yet I do not
find I shall have those pleasures, that
Playes and Romances aim at; which
consist in passion, and unexpected
Contrivances. Nay, methinks, both
are impossible to that State, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36853:36"/>
Passion nor Ignorance have any
place; and nothing can be unexpected
but what we are ignorant of untill it
comes.</p>

                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>True it is, you shall have no
<hi>Passion;</hi> yet shall you not want the
least delight, even That can afford. For
<hi>Passion</hi> does not please of it self, but
only so far as it increases our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or heightens our affections.
Wherefore if the impression in the Soul
be as great as Passion could make, you
shall have all the pleasure That can
procure. Now, unexpectednesse moves
us by that vertue which contraries, put
neer together, have, to encrease and
set off one another: such surprises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only a suddain joyning of some
accident unthought on, to what was
formerly in full and quiet possession of
our mindes. For whilst our thoughts
are wholly entertained and busily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to any conceit, we least expect to
see the contrary fall out.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Now consider with your self the
passage you must make out of the body
into the state of Eternity; how suddain,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36853:37"/>
how quick, how truly indivisible it will
be; so that whatever surprise can be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
in this world, is dull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
slower. Remember farther, that
whatever settles in eternity, can never
fade or change, so that how long soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you are out of the body, all things
shall be as fresh and new to you the
last day as the first. Conceit then what
an unexpectednesse, what a perpetuall
newnesse shall be in all you know;
what an extream difference betwixt the
conceits of them before, and those you
shall be endu'd with in that happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
An able and judicious person
was wont to compare this change with
our going into a Court-mask; when
out of a darksome Gallery, pestred with
crowding, noise and confusion, by the
short turn of a wheel, in the twinkling
of an eye, we are translated, as it were,
into a paradise of glorious light, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
spectacles and heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

                        <p>I see there will be no good
thing wanting, that can increase and
heighten our pleasures; but that only
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36853:37"/>
(in short) which would diminish and
abate the great delights God hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
us for; so that you need tell me
no more of this point, for I am fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and apprehensive of the vast
joyes I shall derive out of this subject.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>You must rise yet a little
higher, and set your self to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
those great Mysteries which have
blinded the sharpest sights, and puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled
the subtlest wits of the world. My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
that dazled the eyes of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
and struck his heart with wonder and
astonishment, whilst he stands admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>the depth of the riches of the
wisdome and knowledge of God.</hi> Think
with your self that the Abysses of
Gods judgement shall be layd open to
your discovery; the fates and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Men and Angels: why <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
elected and <hi>Esau</hi> a reprobate, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either of them had done or good
or evil;</hi> why <hi>Pharaoh</hi> obdurate and
<hi>Moses</hi> made his <hi>God;</hi> why S. <hi>Peter</hi>
head of the Church and <hi>Judas</hi> a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;
seeing it was in the power of the
Almighty to have disposed quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36853:38"/>
of their fortunes, or brought them
all to felicity. But far more content
will you receive, to see why the only
seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> for thousands of
years were the Elect people of God;
the rest of the nations all in heaps
tumbling into eternall misery: Why, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
since the Gospell, so many and
great Nations are inwrapped in no
lesse darknesse and dismall unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for ever: How all this can stand
with God's infinite Goodnesse and
Mercy: Why he does not rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
and annihilate the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Angels and Men, then reserve
them to such extremity of torments.
Certainly, though all these secret my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
effects are of so high a nature,
that we cannot reach their causes and
true Motives; (for who is able to be
the counseller of Almighty God in
the fabrick &amp; disposure of the world?)
yet may we arrive at this conclusion,
that of necessity there must be reasons
for all: Else what more unreasonable,
then to imagine that Almighty God
(who is Reason it self, essentiall Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36853:38"/>
and absolute Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
does these great things without
reason? What more absurd then to
say, that (whereas all upright mens
wills are govern'd by reason) God's
will (which is the Author, the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar
and Rule of our wills) is blind
and wilfull? What more extravagant
then to think that the will, which
cannot swerve from doing the best,
should work without a best? In fine,
what lamenesse were it in Almighty
God, to have his will more ample then
his understanding could direct? Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
therefore there are: and when
you come to lay your mouth to the
spring of eternall truth, there shall
you suck in these ineffable Mysteries;
there shall you see how from the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall
goodnesse and the impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of swerving from it, the world and
all the variety of Creatures inevitably
flow; there shall you behold how by
the infallible manuduction of Reason,
every particular is digested and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
how by a constant line of succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
the descent of effects from causes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36853:39"/>
draws out this long Play, that has so
many Ages been acting upon the stage
of this world; there you shall discern
the golden threads, whereby the just
retrive themselves out of the Labyrinth
of sinners; you shall penetrate the
Adamantine chain, with which the
wicked are confin'd to eternall flames.
In all you shall see the glorious <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
casting out its Rayes: in God
and his Saints strengthned with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceivable
force of Light; in the wayes
of Men struggling in a perpetuall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony
with contingency and servitude,
except where in few souls the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
light more and more hinders the
instability of its estate.</p>

world, is a principall end to which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

has design'd our application. And
truly, when we reflect that the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall

expression of Almighty God's Essence,
which nature can attain to; what

                        <p>This I easily believe: For
when I have the good fortune to hear
a strange discovery of some secret of
nature, such as Philosophers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers
use to look into; I cannot
understand the joy I feel in mine heart.
'Tis not of that kind which I have
when I laugh, and am taken with some
witty conceit. 'Tis not such, as when I
encounter any welcome news of some
advantage to my self or friends: but
of a higher strain mixt with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
methinks I am better and greater
then I was before: methinks, they who
know these things are more then men,
and are a kind of Demi-gods. And I
observe that Poets and persons of great
brain and capacity (having spent their
youth in vain and worldly pursuits)
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36853:40"/>
desire, ordinarily, to consecrate their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                        <p>Reflect then upon the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
which are stored up in Nature for
your content. Place before your eyes
the admirable government of this great
Fabrick, <hi>the World.</hi> Consider the
courses of the Sun, Moon, Planets, and
fixed Starres, and hope one day to
know what causes and wheels they
turn upon. See the Globe of the
Earth, and Men heels to heels walking
round about it, without any nayls or
glew to fasten them to it, yet how la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
it is to remove from it. Really,
the serious consideration of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi>
renders the mystery so strange
and hard to be believ'd, that, though we
are assur'd by experience of the truth,
yet if we should alwayes strongly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
our selves so walking, we could
not but fear, still, falling into the
Clouds, when we travail'd to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
See the perpetuall floating of
the Sea, like a monethly or yearly
Clock, warning us of the seasons, with
as great exactnesse as do the Moon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36853:41"/>
and Starres. See the various Climes,
with all their affections. The bounds
of Seas and Lands. The difference of
temperature in the same proportions to
the Sun. The diversity of Beasts, Birds,
Fishes, and Plants, according to the
variety of their habitations. Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
here black, there white, in some
parts tawny, some red: and their very
Wills and Affections following the
temperament of their bodily qualities.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>When you are weary of these won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
look into particular Natures. The
mixture of Metals and Stones. How
Juices and Liquids penetrate all, and,
incorporating themselves, frame these
strange multiplicities of things we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with. Plants more wondrous
then these: who can choose but be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to see a little Flower or Meal
hidden in the earth, and peep out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?
now green, then take body and
strength, disperse it self into branches,
bud forth leaves, and flowers, and fruit,
and at last other such bags of Meal
as it self was. Yet Living creatures are
furnisht with a farre greater plenty of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36853:41"/>
wonders. The Wormes, the Flies, the
Birds, the Beasts, the Fishes, every one
affording a world of admiration and
variety.</p>
                     <p>But above all, MAN the End and
Master of all, is a subject of amazing
contemplation. Who would not think
a life spent in delight, to understand
what composition that should be,
which, turn'd into blood, becomes first
one part of a heart, afterwards a whole
heart? what should make it spring and
shoot out into other vitall parts? how
can a poor heart frame such a variety of
Members as are necessary to the perfect
body of a man? What should set two
Armes, two Legs, two Eyes, just such
a number of Fingers and Toes upon
every man? so many different parts,
so various in their Nature, Figures,
Use and Service, and all these to agree
together; and Man, compos'd of all, to
keep so long in tune and harmony? the
deeper we go, the greater's the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though the words fewer. But what
astonishment will it be to discover the
subtil nets wherewith Power and Act
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36853:42"/>
(as Metaphysicians call them) are
forbidden parting, to penetrate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility
of substance it self? to sing the
loves of Matter and Form; and see
how by the Influence of the <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
Being,</hi> they become the Basis
and Foundation of this fair Pageant?
Shall I seek into the rationall Soul?
and see the union of the two worlds?
or search the Conduits and passages by
which knowledge is conveyed through
the Body to the Spirit? How the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of divers weights and figures upon
our senses, can beget the skill of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things? Shall I ask why the
Spirit, being subsistent within our
limbs, seems dead or asleep, and can do
nothing but by the impression it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from the body?</p>
                     <p>But what will it be to make this an
occasion of passing into the next
world, there to contemplate the state of
so many separated souls, all different,
yet all like one another? then, still to
mount up higher to the never-bodied
Spirits, and see their Being, their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
their Operations, their Quires,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36853:42"/>
their Hierarchies? And now there is
but one great step more, to behold the
influence of the Divinity upon all, and
in all manners; but in none so great
and admirable, as in shewing its self,
its Face, its Essence to the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
That Blessing, that Adoption, that
Deification, as it is the most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of all Gods works, so will it be
strangely ravishing to behold in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as well as feel in our selves.</p>

all you have hitherto mention'd; they
clearly deserving that estimation and
rank, by the Excellence and Nobility
of the Objects, and the pleasure which

but, if much and solid contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
make you able to manage this
point, you will in time experience that
even here these sublime things over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
all others. Look upon the pains
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36853:43"/>
a <hi>Democritus,</hi> an <hi>Archimedes,</hi> a <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
and other Philosophers have taken,
to know the lowest of Truths. The
first is said to have put out his eyes, that
he might contemplate the better. The
second to have been so absorpt, that he
suffer'd death for not taking notice of
the danger before him. The third to
have travailed through all parts, where
he could hear of learned men, to be their
Scholar. Another to have liv'd in the
fields two and twenty years, to discover
the customes and operations of Bees.
Think you not these excellent witts
found great pleasure in their contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations?
who was ever mov'd to so
difficult undertakings, by any worldly
designe? As for your <hi>Alexanders</hi> and
<hi>Cesars,</hi> if their lives be well look'd into,
they had many collaterall respects, and
by-invitements; alwayes conversing
amongst multitudes of men, who cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up their conquests, as actions
of immortall fame, still encourag'd
them to go on and finish their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.</p>

be able (I hope) to grapple with these
motives. But in the mean while is
there nothing in these secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which may touch my self, and so

the pleasures thereof?</p>

the Air contributes to the bodies which

that nothing created before you could

                        <p>Why should you fear the
lesse, if you be sure of the greater? Do
you, peradventure, doubt whether you
shall be partaker of the sight of God?
and yet this is so farre beyond all we
have hitherto spoken of, that there is no
comparison between them; not so
much as of a drop of water to the
whole Sea.</p>

                        <p>How can this be? since God
is but one indivisible Essence, and in
what you have declared, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36853:46"/>
of most worthy and ravishing
Objects. For though I doubt not but
the sight of God exceeds farre the sight
of any one, his perfections infinitely
surpassing all; yet methinks, when there
is nothing else to be done for ever, but
to see the one and the other, the variety
carries so high an advantage, in respect
of taking delight in knowledge, that
there needs a vast excesse in any single
object to counterpoise it.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>Your own words convince
you: for admit that God exceeds any
one object (compared with him, as to
the pleasure of seeing,) infinitely, that
is, to the proportion of his worth and
dignity; you, by the same reason, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him preferrable to two or three;
and so to any number, that is, to all.
However, I shall rather apply my self
to give you content in your demand,
then presse you severely with your own
argument. First then, consider, if there
were a colour or beauty of so high a
degree, that our eye were not capable
to see it without the assistance of some
new-found spectacle; and this, not for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36853:47"/>
the littlenesse or distance of the Object,
but because the purity of the light or
excellency of the colour was so stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and glorious, that an eye of this
composure would be blinded with the
lustre of its brightnesse: do you not
conceive the sight of so radiant a splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
would be nobler then the view
we have of our ordinary world? and
this in the proportion that the Eye
improv'd and fortified with the new
spectacle, is better and nobler then of
its own single nature.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
                        <p>So far I can espie no way to
escape your reason: for if both Eye
and Object be heightned in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the very seeing, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
the pleasure taken in it, must of
necessity rise in the same degree, or I
have lost my understanding.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>Then ponder what I'm sure
you have been often taught, that the
sight of God is so great, so sublime an
operation, that it exceeds the power of
all celestiall spirits; not onely such as
are, but even all that can be made, and
the whole campasse of creatures and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36853:47"/>
whatsoever is not God. Consider now
how full and overflowing a measure
of delight must necessarily follow upon
these premisses; I believe you'l find it
no lesse then I speak of.</p>

                        <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
                        <p>What may be the reason of this
incredible excesse? though I'm a fool to
ask a question you have already so fully
answered, by resolving it into the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
beauty of Almighty God, whose
perfections are beyond all comparison.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>In the beginning I bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd
with you not to expect the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of things in this discourse, but the
effects, that is, what pleasure arises out
of them, upon supposition of their
truth. Yet if you understand the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of a Spirit above Bodies and their
grosse parts, conceive that God so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
a Spirit, as that is more excellent
then a Body: I mean not in equality
of proportion, but I would onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
that their excellencies are cleare
of a different kinde; so that there is no
comparison of worths between them,
but the supereminent dignity of one so
farre surpasses the other, that in respect
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36853:48"/>
of the first the second is no wayes esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.
A more particular account you
may make your self at your leisure,
by reflecting that our apprehension of
things has three degrees: some we
conceive as compounded, others as sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and one onely thing, which we
call <hi>Being,</hi> has a different nature, in our
very language and understanding
from all the rest. Now our Masters
put Almighty God in the degree of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alone and by himself. If you could
throughly penetrate these three man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of apprehending, it would be a
great advance toward the knowledge
you desire. For the present let me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with this observation, that
many great Clerks and studied Sages
have so much esteem'd this Notion,
that they fear'd not to pronounce Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God absolutely invisible to any
created understanding, and inhabiting
a light by no power accessible.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>But herein the goodnesse of God
has exceeded the wit of Man, and
found a means to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to our Soules. Wherefore, wiser are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36853:48"/>
our Masters of Mysticall Divinity, who
acknowledge the gracious happinesse
of the next life, though here they find
themselves silenced. For when by long
speculation they have heaped up all
these great Titles of <hi>Being, Goodnesse,
Truth, Eternity, Immensity, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence,
Infinitenesse,</hi> and whatever
else we find attributed to the Deity;
after they have some little while exulted
in that height, reflecting upon what
they are pleas'd withall, suddenly they
turn the leaf, and with a more high
Ignorance acknowledge he is none of
all these; but <hi>an unknown Nobility,</hi>
whereof all these are so poor and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
an expression, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
of what they had said, and now
rest in a mute admration; not finding
words wherewith to expresse the thing,
which they onely can attain to by
confessing themselves totally ignorant
of it.</p>
                     <p>And this is not onely true in respect
of Men, but even of Angels; whose
languages if we could speak, that is,
were our apprehensions and conceits
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36853:49"/>
as high and great as any of theirs, yet
would it not profit us, because not
necessarily conjoyned with Charity.
However, even their languages exceed
our short capacities, and are not to be
expressed with the tongues of Men:
which seems the cause why Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
(who was made partaker of their
knowledge, though short of the sight
of the face of God) said, <hi>he had heard
words of secret that were not in the
power of Man to speak:</hi> for so (as I
take it) the Originall Text beares, and
not that it was unlawfull; since, what
Law was made against speaking that
which we have heard? unlesse we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
of the first Errour, conceiving
God through envy to hide Mysteries &amp;
great knowledges from us. It was not
then unlawfull, but impossible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what was revealed to Saint <hi>Paul;</hi>
no words of Man being capable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the conceits of an abstracted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
amongst whom he then
convers'd.</p>

                        <p>You seem to drive me farther
off from relishing this which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36853:49"/>
as the most eminent pleasure of
all others. For if you afford me no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceit of it, then of an unappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
Light, of a mysterious Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a learned Ignorance, I know
not how to fasten any Armes of love
or liking upon it. Therefore I beseech
you oblige me with some explication of
this difficulty, in such an intelligible
way, as may feed and encourage my
desire to see that Glory of Glories.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>What shall I say to you? If
you can fix your eyes upon what <hi>Being</hi>
is; how, although but one, yet it runs
through all that is in the world; how
not onely things and parts of things,
but even the most dilated and thin
conceits of every thing have this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as necessarily as the fullest: then
think Almighty God is the first root
and necessity of <hi>Being.</hi> He is <hi>Being</hi> it
self, in it self, and of it self, because it is
its self. I must leave the rest to your
quiet contemplations; but know
that in these few words, if you
ponder them to their just merit, you
shall find life and blisse. Yet let me
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36853:50"/>
say one thing more: Can you conceive
how in a Bean or Acorn, or a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-seed,
lies the Herb or Tree
which we see spring out of them? how
every Branch, and Flower, and Knot,
and what ever else is in the Off-spring,
lyes hidden in the Seed; not that every
part is distinct there, but the nature of
the Seed is such, that out of it they have
their ordinary proceeding and sprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without fail? From this low and
familiar instance, if you can raise your
fancy to conceive that Almighty God
is to all that can be or ever was, as this
Seed to that which comes of it, (not in
the dull manner wherein the Seed is
consider'd, in reference to what springs
from it, but) in all sorts of principall
and noble causality: then you have
made some little entrance into the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing
of this unspeakable treasure.</p>

one side you shall behold the <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

                        <p>Not so quick, you must take
along with you this notion likewise;
Our Masters tell us, that the Soul by
knowledge becomes the thing known:
as if it knew a House, it becomes a
House; if an Ox or Horse, it becomes
that Creature; Not by its being turn'd
into the Object, but by the assumption
of the Object into its self: as the Wall,
when the Sun shines on't, becomes the
light, Iron in the fire becomes red. And
that which perswades them to this
opinion is, they see Water or Iron,
when heated with Fire, will warm
or burn, and have the effects of the
assumed Nature; and that universally,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36853:52"/>
nothing hath the particular operation
of a thing, but its own Nature. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
finding that the workman, who
knows and has the <hi>Idea</hi> of a house, can
make a house; that as far as we know of
a Dog or Horse, so far we can humour
them, and work according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
they assure themselves, that
knowledge is a kind of having or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the thing we know. Our Divines
go farther, and tell us, <hi>Almighty God</hi>
cannot be clearly known by similitude;
and therefore say, 'tis necessary this
Essence should be immediately joyn'd
to the understanding of the blessed
soules, or else they cannot know him.
Out of all which I would derive to
your understanding this great truth,
That the sight of God is a full possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him, a kind of becoming his
nature, and a true and reall, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall,
Deification. Wherefore if
you have any esteem of Almighty
God, and Charity towards him, if
any love to your self, any desire to be
noble and excellent beyond all others,
if any consideration and rationality
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36853:53"/>
in you, fly at this great Quarry, run
for this glorious Prize, fight for this
incomparable Crown. Fear nothing,
only ruminate seriously upon it; do
but heartily desire it, and long after
it; do but wish it, and you cannot
faile; it cannot escape you, but of
it self will stoop to your lure and
hand.</p>

me, then by words expresse how sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
I am of the charming contents they
afford. Now I see you have led me by
degrees through all the pleasures of the
mind, from the most familiar and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
to those of so high a pitch, that they
exceed the apprehension of Men and
Angels. I know not what remaines,
but to enquire, since our Bodyes shall
be partakers of happinesse with the
Soul, whether it shall have any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36853:53"/>
pleasure of sense, as it seems to have
in this world.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>Well said you, <hi>as it seems
to have;</hi> for really it has none: all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which appear in beasts so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they make a shew of proceeding
from some degree of reason, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the quavering of certain aeriall or
watery parts of the body, so ordained
by Nature, as to be the beginnings of
helping it self in its wants. Now we,
out of our experience of our selves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
they passe with knowledge in them,
as we find they do in us. But marking
our selves well, we shall easily perceive
that in Beasts all those motions may
be without any true knowledge: For
if we observe our groning in diseases,
we shall experience that it is but the
course of our breath, which coming
forcedly, by reason of some restraint
within, sends forth that sad unmusicall
noise, as it would do out of a Pipe so
made as our bodies are in that case. By
the same Instrument is performed the
expression of Joy, though tuned to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
key; and every passion causing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36853:54"/>
some variety in our interiour Organs,
is the reason that our naturall expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are divers; which clearly discovers
the hypocriticall ambition of such as
professe to understand the language of
Birds, that truly is none at all. If then
we consider our body abstractedly; as
there is no knowledge in it, but only
a course of windy and watery substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
shut up in conduits and cases, so
there is no pleasure nor grief, but all
depends upon the mind, and is intirely
derived from it, even then when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
so impetuously &amp; irresistably seems
to oppresse us.</p>

                        <p>But at least, shall the Soul then
participate by the Body such pleasures,
as now she does by her senses? Neither
do I ask this out of any strong desire I
have of them; for your discourse hath
weaned me from that, by demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
such excessive store of far more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
entertainments: but only led
on by a curiosity, to know what shall
betide us in that happy Kingdome.</p>

and therefore propose you
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36853:54"/>
only one question, Whether you think
it fit any thing should be in that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
state, which might bring trouble
and disturbance to its rest and peace?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
                        <p>Nothing is more assured then
that whatever is interruptive of joy,
ought to be banished from so great a
felicity.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>Then go along with me in
one observation more; and remember
that all sensitive pleasures are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and importune, unlesse the body
be in a certain disposition when such
delights are seasonable: as to one whose
stomach is full, not only the taste, but
even the very smell of meat is nauseous.
Which single instance, if particularly
look'd into and improved to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
will sufficiently establish this
conclusion, that no corporeall pleasure
is good to Man or Beast, but in some
want or distresse in the Body; when
either tis too full, and would discharge
some oppressed part, or too empty, and
demands something to fill it.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
                        <p>All this I agree to, in pleasures
of the tast and touch, and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36853:55"/>
of smelling, which seems to have
great affinity with our tast: but how it
should hold in recreations and delights
conveyed to us by hearing and seeing,
I do not perceive.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Light.</speaker>
                        <p>Seeing in generally in order
to knowledge; and so the pleasure,
principally and purely, of the mind,
not of the body: But for hearing, 'tis
evident enough that is so, even by the
sole experience of musick; which we
plainly feel inclines us to sadnesse or
mirth, according to its quality. Who
has not heard that it discharges the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
of the <hi>Tarantula</hi> in <hi>Apulia?</hi>
And by what vertue think we, is this
strange wonder wrought, but that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
is to our inward, as dancing or
running to our outward parts? And as
Nature stirres up all young things,
Boyes, and Lambs, and Kitlins, to play
and run about, by which they disperse
the cloggy humours that otherwise
would settle in their joynts: so Musick
strikes our inward aeriall parts into a
quick and active motion, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
them of their grosser humours,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36853:55"/>
and purges all into a sprightlinesse, as
rivers clear themselves by running,
and winds by the swiftnesse of their
flying. For we feel, if we mark it,
the sensible stroaks of a <hi>Lute</hi> or <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
beat the same measure in our
Breasts, as if the strings of our Heart
and of the Instrument were both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
and certainly there is some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
there able to receive the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
as we see the Aire and Water
do of such things as have any quick
motion in them. So that the sound of
musick is sweet to us, because the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it makes in our ear is agreeable to
our Body; but if you take away that
proportion, by which such a shake or
motion is fit for us, Musick it self
would be ungratefull. Wherefore if
we conceive our Body shall be in the
most happy and excellent disposition
it can be put into, and that all Motion
must, of necessity, alter it from that
temperament, and by consequence,
change it into a worse: we see that
state is not a state of Motion, but of
Rest; and that all Motion and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36853:56"/>
will be displeasure to our body.
To which if you joyn this reason, that
all corporeall action is either Motion,
or performed by it; you may conclude
there can no pleasure hereafter flow
from Motion, nor passe through our
senses, all whose operations depend
upon it.</p>

your understanding shall participate
more perfectly then any sense can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;

a Strength irresistable; an Agility so

a Health firm and constant, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

of your expressions concerning it:
only, as for beauty, of which some are
particularly curious, I shall propose
this speculation; It may be so compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in a generall symmetrie of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that neverthelesse every individuall
person may enjoy such a singular and
speciall temperament, as shall be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of best; the joyes of the soul
darting their beams and diffusing their
influences throughout the very body,
and rendering it the most lovely and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36853:57"/>
desireable sight that can be imagined.</p>
                        <p>And now, having driven our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
up to this height, that we are
come within the view of heaven it self:
what remaines but burning desires, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
thoughts of, and a dwelling
(even whilst we are here) in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
happinesse above? which only
to understand and desire, is to gain,
and for ever possesse. But if neither

and repeat in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
thy infinite Bounties,
that I may love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and praise Thee, with my whole
heart and forces. Let me remember
how from all Eternity I was nothing,
till by thy order I sprung up a tender
Imp and bud, testifying my Origin
by my weaknesse and inability to help
my self. Nor did my Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(those kind instruments, to whom
thou would'st have me beholding for
my Being) know or intend me, when
they serv'd thee to make me: but thou,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36853:61"/>
before all time, hadst (among milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
rejected) named me and sign'd
my happy lot, whilest I lay sleeping
in my nothingnesse and unbeing.
What could'st thou see in me, dread
Lord, that might move thy will to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
me from that Masse of non-Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Peradventure, did I love Thee?
Alas, I who was not, what could I
love? yet if I could have lov'd, surely,
nothing lesse then Thee, who wast most
contrary to my Nullity. But though
I was not, to love Thee, Thou wast,
who could'st love me; and love me as
I was, not able to love Thee, nor yet
any thing else: for I cannot love but
what is, and by its amiablenesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a liking in me. How miserable
then were I, if Thou lov'dst not me,
till I could afford something that
might please Thee! But thou didst love
me, when I could not love Thee; and
sealedst Thy love, stamping Thine
Own Image on my face: on the face
of my Soul first, giving me a power to
love Thee; and consequently on my
Body, as 'tis fitted to such a Soul. The
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36853:61"/>
Marks of thy bounty are no lesse then
all I am and have. Ah, wretched I!
that continually weare about me all
those Tokens of thy kindnesse, and
yet not love Thee: and yet fear, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Thou lov'st not me. Dear Lord,
make me love Thee, that I may not
fear Thou lov'st not me: for, <hi>True
love knowes not what it is to fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, Thou art not content to have
made me of Nothing: if thou hadst
not surrounded me with innumerable
Helps; and created, as it were, the
whole World, for me; If the Aire
and Fire did not afford me breath and
warmth; the Land and Sea with their
infinite Issue, variety of food and
cloathing: and these, not what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
with my place of residence,
but even from their utmost bounds.
If I look upon my Table; I see Fish
from the <hi>Frozen Zone,</hi> Sugar from the

and the West. If on my Attire; the
<hi>Profundities</hi> of the Earth and Water,
the <hi>Longitude</hi> and <hi>Latitude</hi> of Mans
Habitation meet all in me, as in a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36853:62"/>
to bestow their Rarities upon me.
O Great God! who set the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of unhappy Creatures, buried in
the bowels of Metallick Hills, and
consumed in the Marishes of <hi>Brasil,</hi>
to labour for me? Who commands the
Sea-men to burn under the <hi>Equator,</hi>
and freeze by the <hi>Poles,</hi> to replenish
me with Dainties? Who ordained
Kings and Potentates, Counsellers
and Souldiers to beat their braines, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their sleep, and hazard their lives,
to produce me Quiet and Abundance?
Not they themselves, who for the most
part are carried with vile and wretched
appetites to pursue unworthy ends,
neither knowing nor dreaming of me:
but only Thou, my Lord and God,
who marshallest Heaven and Earth
for those thou art pleased to blesse;
who heapest thy favours on a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of dull stupid Creatures, that can
receive all thy gifts without returning
the least love to the Giver; that live
and move and have their being from
Thee, &amp; never so much as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thy Bounty. Why permittest
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36853:62"/>
Thou so unsufferable ingratitude?
Why dost Thou not either suspend thy
mercies, or make us more sensible of our
duties? From this houre, Dear Lord,
let not my hand touch a bit of bread
without a thankfull lifting up to the
Feeder: let me not put on a ragg with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bending my heart, and tuning its
strings to the love of him, by whom I
am rendered the But and Scope of the
whole World's government.</p>
                  <p>What shall I say to Thee, my heart-o'rewhelming
Love, when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how many millions are swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in eternall perdition, whilest I am
one of that small number<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Thou hast
brought to the light and height of
knowing Thee, and finding the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
path to salvation? That Thou art
not unjust I easily see; for all is thine,
and in thy hand to give and dispose
according to thy liberality; to which
he, where Thou extendst it not, can
pretend no claim, having more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to thank Thee for then he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to esteem. But why then didst
Thou set set thine Eye upon me, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36853:63"/>
this wretch before so many
thousands? Was I nobler or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
then they? O no: Angels and
Hosts of heaven, whose Being or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I am not able to apprehend, lye
chain'd in Sulphure and darknesse.
Was my Wit or Parts beyond others?
O no: the <hi>Sages</hi> of <hi>India</hi> and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<hi>Riddlers</hi> of the <hi>East</hi> were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of thy Law; and perisht in their
Ignorance. Was I mightier or richer
then they? O no: the Conquerours of
Kingdomes and the Gyants, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in warre, were not chosen by Thee:
much lesse the Sons of <hi>Agar,</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
that traverse the world to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
treasure, and heap up the wealth
of Nations, were called to thy light.
Let me sound as deep as I can; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thy self-Goodnesse, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Power, without the least
preceeding disposition in me, can I
find to be the source and spring of all
this advantage, O My Soul! What
dost expect, if this be not enough
to set thee on fire? yet, look but about
thee, and behold a farther endearment.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36853:63"/>
See thine own Countrey; thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
Acquaintance, thy Kindred
and Friends: how many maist thou
observe, in all degrees, more worthy of
acceptation, then thou; yet they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and Mercy indulged thee?
think but on those, whose good nature
and innocent life makes thy self ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times compassionatly grieve at their
unhappinesse, and desiring to be the
means of bringing them to that great
good, wherein thou art a sharer; and
reflect that former Ages and the vast
spatiousnesse of the Earth afford many
millions of such: yet, all permitted to
undo themselves, and run upon their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
ruine. Consider this strange
partiallity of mercy. And yet, thou
canst doubt, yet thou canst say, <hi>Were I
sure of Gods love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, why did I ask whether I was
better then others? so, deserving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence;
since I have or can have no
good, but from Thee? Could I pre-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
my self to be born of Christian
and Catholick Parents, who should
take care to incorporate me into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36853:64"/>
of the Heirs of Blisse by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
instituted and afforded by
Thee? Might I be the cause why my
Mother &amp; Nurses fed me as soon with
wholesome Doctrine as with their
Milk? why they prepar'd Priests &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to guide &amp; frame my tender Age?
was't I that led me to a liking of the true
Religion, that only Path of Heaven?
or brought I my self to believe and hope
in Thee; to love Thee, and those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thou hast prepar'd for them that
follow thee? No, no, dear and dread
Providence; Thou art our <hi>Alpha</hi> and
<hi>Omega.</hi> If I do any Good, Thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid'st
and fittest the means for it; if I
abstain from Evil, Thou divert'st the
Occasions, Thou presentest awing
Fears, and shak'st perpetually the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
over my head, that I may not be
lawlesse and undisciplin'd. If I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of any acceptable work, Thou
preparest me Motives, by Books, by
Teachers, by Friends, by Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
Thou directest my Thoughts and
apprehensions; ordering my Spirits in
my Brain, that what will be efficacious
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36853:64"/>
should occurre. Thou enlightenest my
Judgement, to discern the consequence
of Truths necessary to my Resolution:
Thou quellest my Appetite, that it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not those Truths from setling in
me. If I resolve, Thou so rangest all
things, that I chuse what is best, not
only for the present, but what shall
be so too in future occasions, whereof
I know nothing. And as I am utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant of the things that are to fall
out many moneths and years after,
which neverthelesse depend on this
Resolution, and in their season so
take their force from it, that they would
certainly fail if it had not been made
right: no more, or rather much lesse
know I any thing, or did I co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in the least to that long Chain of
Causes, which bred in me all those
parts and little circumstances; every
one so necessary to this Resolution, that
if any had miss'd, the Resolution had
miscarried more or lesse, not proving
the same, nor producing the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
So that let me reflect on any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
great or little, long or short, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36853:65"/>
however qualified, I find that 'tis I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
do it, but the force and vertue (&amp;,
by consequence, the honour and praise)
is thine. I do it, but as the Child to
whom the Nurse gives Nuts or Beads,
and holding his hand, throwes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a hole; whilst he, alas, thinks 'tis he
playes so well, and pleases himself as
with his own act, not having the wit
to consider 'tis his Nurses aime: Just so,
my God and my tender Sustainer, just
so dost thou with me, whilst I often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
thee; my weak brains reaching no
farther then to see that I do the deed,
without being able (through dulnesse
or pride) to passe my self, and discern
thee the only true cause and root of all
my good. But seeing my self consult, &amp;
resolve, and do, I often take this wretch
for as primary as Thou, for thy coeffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and helper, not purely thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
and wholly depending on
thee. Which since I barely am, and that
(vertuous action) my chiefest good
proceeds so entirely from Thee; what is
left for me, but to love, ever love, and
nothing else but love?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:36853:65"/>
Thus far reach the <hi>Entry and Porch
of Love's Palace. Then,</hi> we discover
<hi>Its great Hall;</hi> when we begin to
contemplate the Essentiall Deity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated
and steep'd, for our sakes, in
all the Miseries of Mankind. That
God of Gods lap'd up in a Virgin's
Wombe: delivered naked into freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
winds and the smart stroaks of
night-aire: swath'd in bands and
clouts: hanging at a Maidens breasts:
short in Age, weak in limbs; and not
forgetting to fulfill all infirmities of
his Brethren. Soon after, led by his
Mothers hand, setling his tender steps,
feeding on the fruits of our earth, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
his Parents to Jerusalem, lost,
and sought, and not found, with teares:
subject to his Mother, and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
growing in Wisdome and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as well as in Body. After this,
working with his reputed Father, and
in no visible fashion, differing from
the life of his Parents, till he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiz'd
by Saint <hi>John,</hi> his holy Precur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor.
Then, fasting forty dayes in the
Wildernesse, gathering Disciples, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36853:66"/>
them, working miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, living on the same meats,
dyeting and lodging with them; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by Alms, having no certain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad,
but most commonly among the
poor, and simple Fishermen. Farther,
we see him weary, thirsty, hungry, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
hunger for love of souls, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd,
slander'd, blasphem'd, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
now ready to be stoned, now
to be precipitated, flying, hiding
himself, troubled in spirit, weeping for
his friends, weeping for his Countrey,
contradicted, persecuted, conspired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst;
His confidents corrupted, his
followers excommunicated, his friends
sought to death, others not daring to
acknowledge him: and a thousand
such indignities.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>State of Love</hi> shewes it self
first in the <hi>Garden.</hi> O the dolefull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
cryes to Heaven! O the bitter
Agony and deadly Sweat of bloud!
O the ravenous throats of devouring
Wolves led on by one of his own
dearest houshold! See with what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes,
and howlings, and noyse, they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:36853:66"/>
drag him through the streets of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>
every one looking out at their
windowes to fill their eyes with gazing
at this strange wonder. See how He
is toss'd from one Tribunal to another:
here revil'd and buffetted, there flout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and spit on; every where despis'd
and maliciously affronted. But what
wofull spectacle is that <hi>Pilate</hi> presents
to the People, which causes so great
and loud cries? The Stature is of a
Man, but the Head of a Monster. A
Crown of piercing Thornes; bloody,
and bloodying all that is near it. Hair,
<hi>such as ravish'd the heart of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Spouse;</hi> but clotted with gore,
sticking some to his Neck and Flesh,
some to the horrid Thorns, all rudely
ruffled in a hideous disorder. A Face
and Eyes able to subdue all hearts; if
stripes, and buffets, and bloud, and
swellings, and marks of blind rage
permitted them to beseen. Well-shap'd
Limbs; but disfigur'd and hidden in
their own bruises, and tearings, and
shatters. A red ragged Mantle, and a
Sceptre of a Reed, to accomplish a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36853:67"/>
King of sorrow, calamity and scorn.
And why all this; this ingenious cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
to disguise a poor Man into so
monstrous an Object of disdainfull
Malice? Alas! all's but to glut the
blood-thirsty jaws of an unfaithfull
and rebellious Multitude; which, no
longer then five dayes since, sung prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and <hi>Hosanna's</hi> to this very Person,
and strewed their garments and Palm-branches
in his way. A People infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
oblig'd, and no wayes offended
by him. A people that cannot accuse
him of the least crime, that have seen
him cleered in all Tribunalls: the
Judge himself pleading. His Innocence.
Yet no lesse then his heart's last drop
will satisfie them, though it be at the
cost of their own and all their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.
Nor can they tell why, more
then that they are push'd on by those
who abuse and pillage them, and who
have conceiv'd this implacable hatred
against him, only because he discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their violences, oppressions and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannyes
over these very people that so
furiously exclaim against him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:36853:67"/>
Well: if there be no remedy, charge
those wounded shoulders with thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Cross, dear Saviour, and shew us, on
<hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> a greater and strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Transfiguration, able to dim That
of <hi>Mount Tabor.</hi> I see thy spread
Arms, thy nailed Hands and Feet, thy
rack't Sinews, thy pierced Side, thy
bended Neck, thy faln Looks, thy torn
Body, thy pale and bloudlesse Flesh,
thy Company of infamous Thieves,
and thy miserable Favourite and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
Mother. I hear thy last Words
and breath'd-out Soul into the Hands
of thy Father; not, as they command
Heaven, but as they reach to Hell.</p>
                  <p>O Love! canst thou love, or expresse
it, beyond this? Yes: heark, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
Those higher-endearing Charms
of heaven. The Father, the most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and perfectly-loving Father; whose
Essence is pure, distill'd spirit of love;
He put his Onely-his Equall-his Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate-his
Co-essentiall Son, with His
own hands, nay, with This Son's own
commanded Will and hands, to all
these and infinite more unspeakable
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36853:68"/>
tortures and miseries, for thy sake, for
thine, my soul; that thou mightest not
complain thou wantedst an Object,
a Motive, thou hadst not a Teacher, a
Pattern, an Exciter, an Enforcer to
Love.</p>
                  <p>IF there be a Hall for all comers,
certainly there's a Parlour too for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and choice friends; where they
may confer together of thine infinite
perfections, and often repeat with joy
thy unspeakable bounties; where they
may retire from the noise and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the World, and entertain
their thoughts with the sweet still-mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
of contemplation; where they may
sit alone, excluding even themselves,
and be chastly ravisht with the dear
embraces of the Divine Spouse of
Souls. O, what Droanes are our
highest-strain'd Lovers, whose memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in all languages affect immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for their fantastick passions! what
dull buzzing of Beetles are their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
expressions to the melting notes of
this heavenly harmony!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:36853:68"/>
But is there no further admittance
(O glorious King of Love) for those
who have so happily enter'd thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace?
I remember <hi>a large upper-room,
furnisht</hi> by thy self, and richly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to give yet a more noble treatment:
and methinks I hear something within
me bid me advance a few steps further.
What fair gilt door is that which daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles
so my sight to look on? Sure 'tis
the holy place we seek, sealed up for
thy peculiarly beloved. Open it, some
bright and flaming Seraphin. O my
God, what do I see? what's this my
eyes behold? <hi>Manna</hi> raining from
Heaven for those that can get to the
shoar of that former Red Sea of loves
flouds? Truly my God, my Lord, Love
has transported thee even to extasie, it
has made thee do extravagant and
frenetick actions: extravagant indeed
and freneticall, if measured by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and short judgement of poor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;
but heights, and depths, and
Abysses, if referr'd to thy uncircled
wisdome, and unlimited reach of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and goodness. Behold the Body that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36853:69"/>
hang'd on the Crosse, that was anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Grave, that rose again and
ascended to the right hand of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Creator: Behold, It falls down
in wheaten drops, like <hi>Coriander
Seeds,</hi> to feed and feast the wretches,
descended from <hi>Adam.</hi> Behold the
Body, the Blood, the Soul, the eternall
Person, the Deity, the Trinity; all
couch'd, as it were, in a corn of Bread.
The Omnipotency, that made Heaven;
the Wisdome, that link'd all possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
into the Chain of all Beings; the
Bounty, that crowded into Natures
teeming bosome all that was Best: these,
all these lie here covered like a Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
pill in a Sugared wafer, Those looks
from which Heaven and Earth ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedly
flie; in whose Presence the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the celestiall hosts, and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the World tremble: that Head,
on which depends the fate of Souls,
both past and to come: that Tongue
which shall doom in one word, the
Nations of all Ages: All are, here
humbly stoop'd and subjected, to me,
and other such wretches; even, to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36853:69"/>
abused by our wickednesse. Yes, yes:
all these are as truly, Here, as they
are on thy Throne in Heaven; as they
will be in the midst of the blessed, on
the Day of thy Triumph over Nations.
What do I say, <hi>as truly:</hi> and not,
even, more: in a far more excellent
manner? for thy Body is in Heaven,
as in another and different thing: but,
in the Sacrament, substantially, in It,
as mans Soul and Body are in Man;
as the adored Person of God is in my
Lord <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> as every thing is
in its self or in its whole, Thou art
therefore, my Jesus, both in Heaven and
in the Sacrament, truly; but in one
more properly, in the other more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently:
Reallity is in both, but the
Manner different. Wherefore, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
complain thou hast left us, by thine
Ascension; and bereaved us of that
comfortable Presence, whose force was
so magneticall in thy life-time. No,
no; I see Thee as truly, as they did
then: I feel thee as corporally, as did
That Master of Touching, who sought
thy Side and Wounds to embalme his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:36853:70"/>
Sense in: I Tast Thee as really, as the
<hi>Chanaan-Feaster</hi> did the Wine Thou
sentst him: Thou deludest not my
Senses, by making me onely seem to
See, Feel and Taste, when indeed I do
not; Thou entertain'st me not with
other things or Qualities, which are
with Thee, but not thy self. No, no;
the White I see is Thou; the Body I
hold in my hand or mouth, is Thine
and Thou; that which yeelds Savour
to my tongue and palate, is thy-self,
and no other thing. This thou hast
told me; this thy Church has ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and taught; this I believe
and confesse to Thee. But oh! can
I conceive without trembling, or speak
without horrour? Does Man's Hand
break the Body of my Saviour? do
Mans teeth rend and mangle the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
vesture of Deity? Yes, yes, my
Soul; fear not to confesse the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Mercies of thy Lord and
God: they may be hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
but they are the <hi>Words of Life.</hi>
So farre has He subjected his glorious
Body to our use, that what other bread
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36853:70"/>
can suffer, may be wrought upon Him.
Not that we can tear a Finger from his
Hand, or his Hand from his Arm, or
any one member from another: but
as when we break bread, every piece is
still bread; so when we divide his Body,
both parts remain his whole Body; for
it was not one part that became one
part of the Bread, and another the rest,
but all succeeded to each part of bread.
Let great Clerks in their Schools, with
their subtilties search how this can be
effected, (for, seeing it is done in
bread, it is not against Nature, nor
unintelligible, even by That) to me
let it suffice the Church has taught me
'tis so; and that 'tis the greatest benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and most gracious condescence that
God himself could expresse, to have it
be so. And is this more, perhaps, then
that thy immortall flesh should nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
my mortall Carcase? that it is
mingled with Mine, as Wine with
Water; as two melted Waxes incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
themselves? Let none tell me,
'tis Quantity that is digested into my
body: for then it is not Thou that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishest
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:36853:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me; and I will not forgo those
precious expressions, that <hi>Thou feed'st
me with Thy Flesh, and giv'st me Thy
Bloud to drink.</hi> So thy Words sound; so
thy Church has taught; &amp; so I believe.
How this can be done, without thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turn'd into me; or how thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
can, unchangedly, be chang'd
into mine, that thou mayest endue my
Flesh with a quality of Immortality, let
the Sages question: but I'm sure 'tis so;
this, I know, is the way of Love; and
the most charming Mystery, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting
Riddle, that ever love-spent
bowels were able to sing or sigh out.</p>
                  <p>ANd now, my Soul; having thus
(perfunctorily, Alas!) viewed the
excessive benefits of Almighty God:
'tis time to reflect a little upon thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and consider what motions and
affections they should stirre and work
in thee.</p>
                  <p>First, Thou hast seen how all thou
hast are gifts: and, not onely all; but,
wholly. If any friend has done thee
kindnesse: He prepar'd that Friend;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36853:71"/>
he gave him the power, the occasion, the
will to serve thee; he blest his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
with efficacy &amp; successe, If thou
thy self hast done any thing to thine
own improvement or advantage: He
gave thee, not onely Body and Soul,
with all their powers and faculties;
not only matter, opportunity, strength,
will, liberty, choice; but every least
imaginable perfection of the very
stroak of choise and liberty: insomuch
that there is nothing, no considerabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of it, so from thy self, that, even its
being from thee comes not from the
Almighty, in comparison to whom, no
Friend, no creature ever did or can do
any thing for thee. Shall then, the
friendship or love of any Creature have
power to draw my affection from
God? permit it not, my great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour;
but thorowly perfect thy work.
Why am I good by half's, since I am
entirely thy Designe? I professe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Thee, who seest my very heart, and
before Angels and Men, that I ought
not to be so, that 'tis folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to be so. Give me then thy grace
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36853:72"/>
utterly to abhorre and detest so injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
so unworthy an ingratitude. And
since Thou vouchsaf'st thus clearly to
convince me, that 'tis a great indignity,
and against all reason and truly-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
inclination to join any with Thee;
grant me ever with all exactnesse to
observe this duty, That as no Creature
has the least part in doing me good,
but merely so farre as it has it from
Thee; no, not I my self: so none,
none may share with Thee in my
Love, but just so farre as thy love, thine
order, thy direction applies it to
them.</p>
                  <p>Next, my Soul, thou hast seen how
the Benefits of God are not onely all
thou hast, but that they are in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Measure; wide as the World;
uncountable as the sands of the Sea;
great as the Creatures can be: since
neither the eminentest Men nor highest
Angels are exempt from being <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
spirits,</hi> employed for thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
nay, God himself, in the two
Persons of the Son and Holy Ghost,
has condescended to wait on Thee. So
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36853:72"/>
various and superabundant they are,
that they comply not onely with thy
necessity, but serve even thy delights
and recreations. So that thou art nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
able to conceive the multitude and
greatnesse, nor comprehend the worth
and pleasingnesse of his favours. What
then canst thou say? but onely lie
gasping with admiration of so vast, so
unknown a Goodnesse, and sigh out
in the centre of thy Heart, My sole-Good,
my All; I thought before I was
bound to acknowledge thy Benefits,
and love Thee for them, but now I
renounce both: for he that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
makes a shew as if he were able
to esteem; and he that loves, seems as
if he would render somewhat. Not so
I, my great Master, not so. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
my self infinitly below all thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
unable to value the least of thy
Blessings, much lesse to repay Thee
any thing for them: since, had I any
thing worthy thy acceptance, it were
all thine, and I could offer Thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thine own. What then shall
I do, but throw my heart at the feet
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36853:73"/>
of thy bounty, all-open, all-melted,
without any self-will or power of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
at every pulse of my breath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
this onely Burden, <hi>Do thy
pleasure upon me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Thou hast seen, my Soul,
that (far beyond all created Essences)
God has been so liberall as to bestow
Himself on thee. He bowed the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and came down, rendring his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Person subject to all the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Humanity. He laid aside all
the prerogatives of his most noble
and most perfect soul; exposing it
to labours, to teares, to griefs, to those
stupendious throwes in the <hi>Garden</hi> (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to such a height, that it admired
it self, in those expressive words, <hi>My
God, my God! to what a point hast
Thou let me be brought?)</hi> And, in
fine, to be commanded even to Hell.
He abandoned his Body; to heat, to
cold, to weaknesse, to hunger and thirst,
to wearinesse, to torments, to death:
and not content with this (after the
Resurrection, in Its state and season of
Glory) he sent it again into the World,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:36853:73"/>
to be subject to a thousand more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities,
scorns and abusings. Here
now my soul, compare seriously thy suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
with His, and consider, First,
Since nor health nor wealth, nor any
other good thou possessest is thine, or
from thy self, but onely vouchsaf'd thee
during his pleasure and discretion; all
thy sufferings can be but a not-enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any longer what is no way due to
thee: but He was incapable of any
wants in himself; if his own Will had
not taken upon him both a Nature that
could want, and its necessities. Again,
what commodities He at any time
seem'd to have, he held them from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and His purely they were; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He truly suffered when they were
ravish'd from him: whereas we, through
ignorance, attribute to our selves what
we possesse, being really but Trustees,
not Masters of the least pile of grasse.
Farther yet, our mis-call'd sufferings,
if rightly used, are indeed blessings: for
if we lose our Fortunes; alas, they
made us not know our selves: if our
Health; 'tis to disaffect us to this world:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:36853:74"/>
if we prove unhappy in our Children,
what greater distraction had we from
the love of our hoped glory, then our
care and tendernesse to them? But
Christ's sufferings could have no such
advantagious effects: no, they were,
chiefly, to shew us the straitest Path to
that life He promis'd us; and to assure
by his own Example, (who could
not but know and embrace what was
best) that the way of Tribulation
is the high-Road to Heaven. And
canst thou, my Soul, after this, think
any Crosse heavy, and affliction hard
to endure? canst thou chuse but be vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and enraged at thy Flesh and
Blood, which, against all evidence,
will force thee to esteem unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
an Evil?</p>
                  <p>O my great and sole Good! sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
these unreasonable follies which
boyl in my breast. Make me know
whatever happens, good or bad, to
me is securely my best, because it
comes from Thee; whilst my one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
care ought to aim at this, how
to improve it to my best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:36853:74"/>
Make me understand that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I beare with patience, I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for thy sake; because I take it, as
from Thee; because I do as Thou
commandest; because 'tis in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Thee; and lastly, because
it is to obtain Thee, my chief, my
onely, my most entire Treasure. O
rich Treasure! O masse of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!
in proportion to whose attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
all the labours and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that Men and Devils can heap
on me are nothing, nothing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
not deserving even the slightest
esteem.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, My Soul, thou hast seen with
what ambition and exaggeration of
Courtship, with what unparallel'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
and exquisite inventions thy
Lord has sought and woo'd thy love.
First, He gave thee heaven and Earth,
with all their Creatures, for thy Motives
to know and love Him. Next, He
made Himself thy Fellow and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in flesh and bloud, that thou
mightst not strain thy self, but famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
conversing, be caught with his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36853:75"/>
love. Beyond that, He has pass'd all
those fabulous imaginations of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and misfortunes, in which idle
witts have fram'd Errant Ladies to
have engaged their Servants for proof
of their fond &amp; obstinate loyalty. He has
heap'd on thee all the names and titles
of endearment, which either nature or
use have introduc'd among Mankind:
He is thy Maker, thy Father, thy
Spouse, thy Brother, thy Ransomer out
of thraldome, thy Deliverer from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
thy Saviour from misery and death,
thy Friend, even thy very Play-fellow.
He has gone beyond all this: He is thy
Food, thy Drink, thy Self: for since
when thou eatest Him, His Flesh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
thine, (as truly as the bread,
whereof we encrease and nourish our
substance, which by the power of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and conformity of quality remains
in us) how can we chuse but be his
Members, so, that if we dishonour
our body, we dishonour His? how
can we chuse but have a share of Him
perpetually in us? and in plain truth
be Reliques of Him, of His glorious
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:36853:75"/>
Flesh and immortall Bloud? O Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Wisdome, how truly didst Thou
say, <hi>It was thy delight to be with the
Sons of Men?</hi> Can Angels boast of
such priviledges, of such tendernesses, of
such Extasies of Thy love? No; none
but so weak a Nature as ours was able
to necessitate Goodnesse it self to so
deep a condescendence as this: and
none but all Goodnesse could so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
it self to all Infirmities. O
melting Goodnesse, that fillest every
corner and chink Thou findest capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of thy perfections, wave not this
poor soul of mine, but make it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the unmeasurablenesse of thy
bounties and Mercy. Shall I for ever
apprehend my past sinnes, still in fear
whether they are forgiven? Shall I not
rather, in the very moment of terrour,
turn me to Him, of whose readinesse to
receive me I cannot doubt? Mark how
easy thou art to pardon thy self; and
consider thou art one of his Members:
whence be assured, as soon as thou
sayest <hi>I have sinned,</hi> thou shalt hear
<hi>thy sin is taken away.</hi> Shall I fear
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:36853:76"/>
that I am not in state to receive his
Body, when the very preparing my
self, and having a true will to go meet
Him, puts me in state? Shall I seek
outward Medicines for my wounds,
whose ulcerousnesse onely consists in
bereaving me of Love? O my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Lord, make me love and joy in
thee: make me take pleasure to come
even corporally to Thee: but much
more to delight and solace my self in
thinking of thee, in remembring how
Thou lov'st me, how Thou art my
Friend, my Spouse, my Father, and
whatever dear name by which Thou
hast been pleased to expresse so blest a
relation. Make me place my chief feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in contemplating how happy I
shall be, when once I see Thee <hi>face to
face,</hi> and familiarly converse with
Thee, as a Friend does with his Friend.
Mean while establish firmly in my
soul this absolute judgement, that the
greatest pleasure and advantage this
world can afford me is, often, and long,
and heartily to practice here on earth
that sweet and holy conversation
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:36853:76"/>
which is to be consummated in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
What Maid, whose Parents have
promis'd her a person compleatly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
for her Spouse, is not pleased to
sit by her self, and stedily fix her thought
upon him, wishing for the day she
shall once meet and enjoy him; till
then, love and honour him in his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
see him in every one that has
seen and known him, and be overjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all Tokens that come from
him? Whereof what variety, my soul,
hast thou from thy God? All we have
hitherto discours'd is nothing else:
Heaven and earth, and all that is in
them: His Divinity, his Humanity, his
Body, Blood, and Soul, Thy self, all
thou hast, all thou dost, all thou hast
done or ever shalt do.â<hi>Se Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens
dedit socium, Convescens in Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,
se Moriens in Pretium, se reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans
dat in Praemium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But retire thy self a little, my soul,
from the multitude of the Creatures
(His benefits) to thy more united
thoughts: for <hi>Love's Palace,</hi> to be
compleat, must have a <hi>with-drawing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room.</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:36853:77"/>
Thither then retire, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this Great Courtier that makes
so many Embassyes to thee for thy
Love. Know who He is, whether He
be the best worthy thy Affections.
First what's His Extraction? Is He No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and of an ancient race? He is the
First of things, whence all Nobility
derives its esteem: His Ancientnesse
is Eternity, higher driven then Time
His Creature and Off-spring, which
yet is the measure of all other Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
True it is, He is the First of his
House, but the Last too. His nobility
is not by derivation from others, and
a participation of their worth: 'tis en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
His Own, out-wearing the
long Pedegrees of Mankind's successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by the never-changing greatnesse
of His Own Person. Is He power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
All things, except himself, are his
Creatures, and <hi>the Works of his Hand:</hi>
they depend for their being, all they
have, all they are worth, on his breath;
and would perish if he did not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
drop them from his omnipotent
Fingers. He works them and turns
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:36853:77"/>
them as he lists with a <hi>Fiat;</hi> and none
can breath a wish to resist him, but by
his permission: nor is Himself able to
make a Thing of such strength, that it
can break his least Order or Will. Is
He rich? Sea and Land, and all their
Treasures are His: Beasts and Birds,
Fishes, and Trees, and Plants are the
store of his Basse-Court: the mines of
the Earth and the Jewels of the Ocean
are the refuse of his plenty. All that
lies hidden behind the dazling starres,
(whose riches we cannot imagine)
all's His. There's no end of his Wealth:
and his Creatures are not able to make
use of the least part of it. All this is
well. But, peradventure, He is a great
way off, and I cannot come near Him.
He is every where: He makes Place
it self: He is in all Things and their
Places; to be separated from him is to
be Nothing and No where. He is in
thy very Heart, and in the bottome of
thy Soul: the inmost thing thou canst
finde in thy self is He; nor canst thou
look upon any thing without or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thee, but He is to be found and seen
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36853:78"/>
in it, if thou hast Eyes turned towards
him, and a Mind to discern him. Thou
canst never want his light, but by thine
own fault; never be excluded from his
Presence, but when thou turnest thy
back to him; which yet can be but from
his favours, not from his Power. With
all this, is he wise? The Device of the
World is His, He contriv'd the Order
of Heaven and Earth. The Planets roul
by his measures: Night and Day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
by his direction: the Waters in
the Sea expect his beck, turning and
winding just as he pleases. He joynted
the Beasts, every one to his peculiar
motion; and frames the Little-ones in
the Damm's Wombes. He prevents
and casts the counsels of Men, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those who think themselves crafty,
in their own snares, and over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in their most premeditated
projects. He changes Kingdomes and
States, making Tyrants the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their own ruine. In a word,
He governs the Fates of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and brings them to those Ends
he thinks fittest. Is He Bountifull
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:36853:78"/>
and magnificent? Behold the Earth
we walk on; all this he gave to One
Man. Alas, we but trample on the
out-side, and fill a small part of it;
there's a thousand times more we never
come to see: and of this surface we
inhabite, what vast Deserts are possest
onely by Beasts and Birds, whilst all
the Sea covers is stor'd onely with
Fishes? Think what abundance of
Plants, Beasts, Birds, and Fishes
live and die without the knowledge of
Men: yet all bestowed on them, and
created for them. Remember what a
heap of Benefits thou found'st laden
upon thy self, and know that Others
have no lesse. See the Sun and Moon
lighted like Torches to wait upon us;
one farre greater, the other not much
lesse then the whole Earth. See in a
fair night how the huge world about us
is bestudded with glorious Gemms
that serve for nothing but witnesses of
his great Magnificence, and unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Prodigality to us. But, Is He
<hi>Purely</hi> Loving, and has no Ends in
all He does? When no Creature had
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:36853:79"/>
a Being, He was brim-full of Glory,
and infinitely satiated with his own
happinesse: being Essentially Joy and
Pleasure to Himself: to Himself Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Praise, and all He could
wish; He could desire nothing, nor
aim at obtaining any thing. Now He
has made Creatures, He's never the
better for them: his Heart is not
touch'd with their praises or good-works,
no more then 'tis molested with
their dispraises or mis-deeds; nor can
any possible Creature have force to
move his Will, more then my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
has to change the course of the
Sun and Moon. He made all Creatures
therefore, not for any good in them, or
love conceiv'd from them; but meerly
out of the Intrinsecall Goodnesse of
His Own Nature, and the strong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
which Himself is <hi>to do Good,</hi>
because <hi>He is what He is;</hi> an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
stronger and more naturall
then any Lover in this world can have,
with as much advantage as God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has over a Creatures. So not
without reason is His Love, but totally
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:36853:79"/>
Reason; as not kindled by thinking
or casting to obtain any End, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
from Nature and Essence; and
no more to be wrested from Him, then
can His own Being: yet neverthelesse,
most perfectly free and rationall. This
is much. But He Loves a great many;
so that I fear I shall have a small por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in His Affection. O no; His
Heart is whole where it is: and as He
comprehends perfectly all things with
so high an eminency, that he knowes
every one as well as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to be known; so He loves
every one as dearly as if there were no
other. He is with one, without parting
from another: He fills one, without
emptying another; and (as a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
in a Multitudes Eyes, or Thunder
in all the Worlds Eares) He is Whole
in All, and Whole in Every one. His
Affection, his Care, his Tendernesse
is intire, indivisible to every one: the
Multitude of those He loves, improves
and raises every ones happinesse to a
farre higher degree, in that it makes all
them love one another, and publishes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:36853:80"/>
his particular Love of thee, to be known
and esteem'd by all the loves. Nor is
there the least subject of any Envy or
Jealousie: He can wait on All, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
All, fill All, content All, blesse
and beatifie All at once.</p>
                  <p>And now, my glorious Lord, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sifted and rack't my brains to find
some exception against Thee, some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
to palliate my withholding the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I owe Thee, some Cross-knot to dull
the <hi>piercing of thy two-edg'd sword,
dividing my Soul and Spirit:</hi> behold,
nothing imaginable; but all sweetness,
all heat, all light. O then let me turn my
course, and joy at my missing desired
misfortune. Let me sit with the happy
Spouse, so pleas'd with every part of
her Lover. Let me delight my self to
consider the Greatnesse of every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in Thee, and the Infinitenesse
of All. Let me compare Thy Eternity
to the weak imitation of humane No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
and scorning This, joy in the
immense eminency of That. Let the
vast extent of thy Power (in wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and profundity to all effects, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:36853:80"/>
to Huge ones) make me laugh at the
narrow-compass'd and beggarly ends
which the ambitious Hearts of this
world aim at. O the poor Treasures
that can be hoarded in caves, in houses,
or towers! what proportion do they
bear to Thy wealth? O the scant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and jealous absence of Lovers in
this world! the outwardnesse of them,
and hearts to-be-guess'd-at! what bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-sweets
must they of necessity cause?
Besides, their shallow wits and short
reaches, in no other respect to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd,
but because we find no better:
their hungry benefits and pinching
prodigalities, proportion'd to their petty
affections: their by-ends and base aims,
in their most reall and truest professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
their weak and impertinent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
their fond and changeable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
easily consum'd in a few tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall
disgusts. What miserable penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
blasts are these to blow the coals
of Love? And yet have these so long
mov'd my Heart, whilst it has lyen so
heavy and restiff to lift it self up and
follow thee. O my onely Good,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:36853:81"/>
henceforth for ever make me run like
the blessed <hi>Magdalen,</hi> without care or
consideraton, after the <hi>Odours of thy
Perfumes.</hi> Make it all my pleasure to
sit hours, and dayes, and nights, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Excellency of thine, and
considering how good it is for all
Creatures, and particularly for me, that
Thou art so rich in glory, so full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
but above all, how thy ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Attributes become Thy self, how
bright and beautifull they sit upon
Thee. Make me spend all my forces in
blessing Thee that Thou art such, in
rejoycing at it, in protesting that 'tis
all reason, all fitnesse, all justice it
should be so; that 'tis the blisse of thy
Creatures, but yet a greater good and
farre more excellent in it self. Make
me vapour away into Acts and Wills
to have it so; to render it such (were
it not so, and in my power to procure
it) and that for what it is to me, but
much more for what it is to Thee. But
oh for that day, when this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of mine (now childish, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
partiall, and Enigmaticall) shall
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:36853:81"/>
be turn'd into manly, noon-like, full
and clear Vision. O how unmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
must my Love be there increas'd,
where the Object cannot fail to deserve
infinitely more then I can employ! yet
shall I then employ infinitely more
then I can now imagine: and as the
degrees of Love are multiplied, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Joy must still grow higher;
and the more the Joy is, so much more
must the Love be redoubled: thus rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
still one the other, to the very
breaking in pieces the Adamantine si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
of my Soul; whilest the Object
ever stretches by its infinite perfection
the bounds of a capacity ever yielding
to embrace it. O how shall I cling
to, and incorporate with him! not for
fear of losing, but for eager desire of
more enjoying. O how shall I melt
into esteemings and praisings, and
Love-breathing Dittyes! how shall I
inessence my self into that Fountain of
Goodnesse! Oh come, oh come, that
happy day: come even now. I fear
neither Hell nor Judgement; for I
know Thou canst bear no wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:36853:82"/>
those that love Thee. Come
then, come while these sweet sighs call
on Thee: wrest my soul from this load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
this loathsome body: skrew up
even these very aspirations to such a
pitch, that they become the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to break my heart-strings
(those fetters and bonds of my impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
Soul, which keep it from the sight
of my so-beloved Spouse and Master)
and set me at liberty in the eternall
freedome of thy Palace, and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glory of thy celestiall Presence.
<q>
                        <hi>Fiat, Fiat.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>BReath a while, my Soul, and recall
a little thy Spirits. This Stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Palace of Love</hi> still deserves a
more curious search: 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
here to be humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive.
Let's see whether there be
not yet some farther secret worthy
our discovery. And behold a Lock
and little Door. Oh, 'tis <hi>Loves Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net!</hi>
Certainly He there reserves some
rare Jewel to enrich and adorn thee.
Knock, call aloud: and if he delay to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:36853:82"/>
open, at least peep through the key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole,
and see what's within. O Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!
'tis the very Quintessence of Loves
Object. I see how, because God is
sole Eternall, all things must be made
by Him: and since nothing can give,
but what it has, nor make, but what
it is, I see the whole frame of all that
is or can be must be in Him; with all
their joynts and intriques, wherewith
they are intangled in their flowing
from Him. Whence I plainly discern
that by knowing Him, I shall know
all things, and all causes of all things.
O vast and spacious Wisdome! O in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
content! For since my Soul
is nothing else but a Vessel and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of knowledge, and This alone is
the knowledge of all things, by their
proper Causes too, and those resolv'd
into theirs, even to the very highest
cause (not ascending backward, but
beginning at the Spring-head, and
most knowing it; and from it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
even to the lowest, the most
impartible grain of Sand or Dust:)
what can my Soul wish more? what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:36853:83"/>
can it imagine greater? Yes, my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
opens it self farther, and I see
that, since all created things are in
themselves dispers'd and multiplied
with infinite variety, and sometimes
incompossibility and contradiction,
but in God refin'd and resum'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a most simple and indivisible Being;
they must infinitely be better in Him
then in themselves; &amp; He yet infinitely
better then they. For as four cannot be
different from three, but because it has
somewhat that three has not; so God
must have something that is not in
Creatures, to be different from them:
and this being of a higher order and
more eminent rank, must of it self be
better then all they put together, and
of a far nobler and richer glorious pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.
I see yet more, that since
God is cause of all other things out of
Himself, He himself can have no cause;
and that they having their <hi>being</hi> from
Him, may <hi>be</hi> and not <hi>be,</hi> as compos'd
of <hi>being</hi> and <hi>what is;</hi> only God
has no such composition: wherefore
since He cannot be <hi>what is,</hi> without
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:36853:83"/>
                     <hi>being,</hi> He is <hi>being</hi> without <hi>what is;</hi>
whereas all Creatures Substance is
<hi>what is,</hi> and <hi>being</hi> an Accident to
them. This I find that God is not only
none of these things we see, but nothing
like any of them: of a higher and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-excellent
strain, not agreeing with
them in any name that can signifie
Substance; infinitely above our utmost
conceptions, incomparably sublimer,
nobler, more wonderfull, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
knowledge, and more stirring
and straining an appetite of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all this, I see that God is not such
an Existence and <hi>being,</hi> as we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
by this name we give it, and
which we exalt above <hi>what is by it;</hi>
but as far retir'd above it, as that's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<hi>what is.</hi> He is not a <hi>being</hi> by
which a thing is, but a <hi>being</hi> which is
a thing, a Substance. He is a <hi>being</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
upon it self, giving and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>being</hi> to and from it self, and yet
neither (for this is impossible;) but a
higher inexpressible force, implying
both without their contradiction. I
see that all I have said and can say,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36853:84"/>
are pure follyes, not expressing, in the
smallest degree, the thing which I see
is: and the more I force my self to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it, the farther I am from it,
<hi>(one abysse</hi> still <hi>calling upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)</hi>
because it is infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundable,
but only to God himself.
O happy darknesse, if once to become
lightsome! the more hidden thou art
now, the greater blisse wilt thou be
then. Oh that my heavy thoughts had
the wings of an Angel to soar aloft and
towre height upon height, till I came
within view of these celestiall Quires!
not to discern Thee, my dread Lord,
(for I should be never the nearer) but
to quicken my desire, and encrease
my longing. O how fix'd would mine
eyes stare upon Thee, when thou
shouldst be pleas'd to remove the
skreen of my mortall body, that now
intercepts the view of thy glory, and
demolish the strong-wall that as yet
unhappily detains me from thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence!
Methinks I see that no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of nature, no falling weight, no
bent of forced steel, no earth-bursting
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:36853:84"/>
vapour, no tower-shivering thunder,
or bulwark-tossing mines could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the eagernesse of my Souls em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
Thee. Methinks I see Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
too short to enjoy Thee in; and
that my Soul would sooner wane to
nothing, then part from Thee. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
there's no possibility of Pleasure
which is not in Thee, nor any out of
Thee; no faculty in my Soul to wish
or think of any other thing but Thee:
Thee, my onely, my eternall, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
All, my dear, dearest Lord,
and my God.</p>
                  <p>If the good God has reserved for
his Friends be so immense, and the
joy and blisse it brings the Soul so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream;
who can doubt but the losse
must be proportionable, and the grief
and anguish of missing it be measured
by the same weights? what then must
thou do, my poor Soul, wavering yet
betwixt hope and fear of these so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
contraryes? what must thou
do to assure thy chief interest, and
make thy self secure Mistresse of so
great, so glorious pretensions? Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:36853:85"/>
spend thy time in wishes and
flashing thoughts, like the Northern
Fire-drakes, or the lightning breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of fair Sommer nights, which but
vent their own heat without firing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

too deep to be contented with pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and superficiall remedies. Adieu
then those so charming warbles of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

and whatever else the Wit of Man,
or even the Spirit of God has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
to tickle materiall fancy, and

                     </gap>nteliz'd Souls. These
are Milk for beginners; Lenitives to
take away the angrinesse of their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
hearts, when they first tear off
from worldly toyes; Metaphoricall
expressions, which have no proper and
solid meaning to feed the truth-hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
mind. The affections growing out
of these are grounded upon love to
our selves; even then when we wish
more good to another then to our
selves; even when in comparison we
wish harm to our selves. But, that
God is our Good and finall End, is as
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:36853:85"/>
true as that He is our Maker: and the
very Essence of our Soul is nothing else
but a pure capacity and emptinesse of
Him; all its strength by nature or
grace, nothing but an inclination to
apply it self to Him, and be replenished
by Him. Here all the sinews of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are rack't to their height: to this
the Soul's more strongly bent then to
its own being; since we see our
thoughts are first driven outwards, and
from the Objects return to make us
reflect on our selves; only at this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
we aim not to make it ours, but
to make us its. All other knowledges
are but as it were divers figurations
and dispositions of our Soul: this is an
adhering and union of our Soul to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing. All Ends are Masters of
our wills (as far as they are Ends) the
Medium's only master'd by us; the last
End therefore must be the absolute
commander and forcer of the very Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of our Will. And as the <hi>basis</hi>
of a Statue (had it an appetite propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
to its nature) would not wish
to be above, but to lye under and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:36853:86"/>
the Statue; or as the motion and
way towards a form and term would
wish to perish, in bringing the thing
alter'd or mov'd to that state whereto
its Essence imployes its service: so our
Soul, rightly affected, can wish no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to be most subject, most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable,
and most entirely fitted to
its last End. That then, my Soul, which
thou hast to do, is (in the greatest
peace and discretion and quiet of thy
Heart) to cast about and seriously
consider in what course of life (all
things maturely ponder'd) thou art
likeliest to cultivate and improve thy
self best, and render thy thoughts most
apprehensive of this only, this eternall
Good: which having once found,
with thy whole strength, with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of all other things (as far as they
avail not to this) be sure to prosecute
vigorously, never sitting down, or so
much as looking back; and in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
actions (even in this chosen
way) still have a pure eye open to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
what most conduces to this <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary</hi> work, or least deviates thee
from it.</p>

O <hi>Gregory Lopez,</hi> Thou (after
the Apostles) unparallell'd Master of
Christian life! who will give me that
prodigious unheard-of constancy of
thine, in every breath, for moneths
and yeares, continually to fix my
thoughts upon this main aim of my
<hi>being;</hi> till I had made it hard and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
impossible for me to restrain them
from it? But since this is more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
then Humane, obtain me
grace, at least, from our Generall (thy
immediate Master) every day to spend
some competent space of time, in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a lively view of <hi>this Great truth,</hi>
and settling a strong resolution to
continue in it for ever. Still may I
strive by the following Act to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe

may I pursue the perfect Conquest of
my self, till there remain in me no
affection able to shew its head, no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

<hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
you happy favourites of the
World's Redeemer, who
by especiall prerogative of love are still
let in to his greatest secrets, obtain for
me permission to wait on you into the
Garden of <hi>Gethsemani,</hi> and with an
humble silence to observe what passes
there. Grief has already, I see, seiz'd
on your hearts, and raising drowsie
humours into your heads, may sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
perhaps surprise your eyes, and
seal them up in their own tears. My
heart is too stony to admit so deep an
impression, my head too full of vanity
to be opprest with so rationall, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:36853:88"/>

improve my levity into vertue, whilst
you relieve your sorrows with the short
comfort of an hour's repose.</p>
                  <p>But while I speak, behold my Lord
whirl'd away by the vehemency of his
Spirit, like a ship rent from its shoar
and anchors, with a strong and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
tempest: Behold him cast on the
ground, his knees bent, his eyes o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown,
his hands stretch'd up towards
heaven, all cover'd with gloomy clouds
and darknesse, his heart swoln, his
lips ready to break into some loud and
dolefull complaint against mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.
Oh, my Lord! what means this
unusuall strife &amp; contention in thy own
brest? Thou wept'st indeed o're <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
and the pious <hi>Magdalen</hi> drew
tears from thy eyes, but there was no
such astonishment as this. Thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursedst
of thy Passion in Mount
<hi>Thabor,</hi> but with a glory that ravisht
the hearts of all that beheld it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from Heaven it self an attestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

thou profest a great desire to see this

houre, often complain'd that the time
was so long deferr'd; and when thou
cam'st this last voyage towards the
Town, thou advancedst with so quick
a courage, that thy swiftest followers
could not equall thy pace. And now
thou art arrived at the place of thy
wishes, and the day thou hast so impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
expected approches neer: hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
seizes thee, grief surrounds<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> thee,
cold and stupifying fears oppresse thee,
and that strong and resolute heart
seems wholly o'recome with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of this sad Tragedy. Art thou
daunted at the sight of danger? is the
face of Death so frightfull to thee? O
no: but thy kind design is to be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all things without sin, that we
may be comforted in the faintings and
tremblings of our heart. To fear, to be
perplext, to grieve, is an imperfection
and weaknesse in humane nature,
which might, and therefore ought to be
assum'd for our salvation and example;
that we may learn of thee this great &amp;
difficult lesson, how to comport our
selves at the <hi>full tide</hi> of anguish and

before thee and thy mercifull
eyes he humbly unbinds and layes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
all his wounds, too deep to be cur'd
by any but thy almighty hand, too
near his heart to find remedy, but from
him who is in the centre of his heart,
the only searcher and perfect healer of
all hearts. Hear him, most gracious
and bountifull God, hear him, who so
justly calls thee Father. Remember 'tis
he whom thou dost essentially and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
generate. Remember that Soul-ravishing
delight of God and Man
wherewith thou art his Beginner. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thy Divinity is as truly and

he is that right hand with which

he is the light of thy eyes, that

                  <p>Nor canst thou alledge the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
of this request, to justifie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse
of thy refusall. He asks not
a Hecatombe of men and Angels to be
offer'd in sacrifice to his great name;
which yet thy Justice could not deny
the Dignity of his Person. He demands
not that the world's fabrick should
crack, and its sinewes be strain'd in
pieces, to change all Fates and Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
for his pleasure; yet were not this
too great a boldnesse for him that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
their poise with his power, and
cements them together with his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
He pretends not to honour,

persecution: his prayers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to his own afflicted person, for
one poor life he offers up all his sighs,
all his teares; nay, not so much, for the
only deferring of death; and if that be
yet too high, he humbles his petition to
this low request, only a les<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And hark how it tears its way

him, when Thy own hands deliver'd
him to his Enemie. Say not the hearts

pleasest, thy Grace can instantly mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie

the course of time, and scourge

things are thus at thy dispose, see how

<hi>If it be possible, let this Cup passe

whole power, summons it all to his
assistance. He whose absolute will is
absolutely irresistable, with his whole
strength and utmost affections soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
thy Omnipotency to rescue him
from this dismall period. Behold this
meek and humble heart swoln high
with sighs, and running over with the
vehemency of his passions. Behold thy

own thoughts divided, betwixt grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what seems so unjust in it self, and
denying what is so necessary to us,
the finall sentence of death against an

Mankind is unavoidably ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
forever; if thou refusest, thou seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to destroy at once all the hopes that

to have their prayers admitted, since

                  <p>The afflicted <hi>Father</hi> in the Gospel

for a confident answer was doubly
recompenc'd, both with the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and fruit of her faith, her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
recovery. The mourning Sisters
of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> by once repeating this
short Charm <hi>thy friend is sick,</hi>
drew this thy Son into the midst of
his Enemies, who watch'd continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
all occasions to oppresse him: and
with one sorrowfull cast of their eyes,
mov'd in his heart so deep a compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:36853:91"/>
that immediately he broke the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of death, and opened the prison of
the Grave to restore them their lost
Brother, whom they only wisht for,
and barely represented their condition,
not thinking it necessary to ask any
thing in direct terms of so noble a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour.
And yet (O Father of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
He told us he did nothing but
what he saw thee do before him. Where
is then the God of <hi>Elias?</hi> are thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els

are the eternall springs of <hi>Libanus</hi>
dryed up? are the Heavens become of

O no; 'tis only to set before our eyes
a glorious lesson of perfect patience

will be done.</hi> I have prepar'd thee a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:36853:93"/>
desolate Mother to stand at the foot
of thy Crosse, and afflict thy departing
Soul with the sight of her grief, and the
disconsolate condition thou leavest
her in: and above all (to verifie thy
prophesied title, of <hi>Man of Sorrowes)</hi>
I will be a rigid and austere Father to
thee, abandoning thee into the hands
of the <hi>powers of darknesse,</hi> and strictly
charging them not to spare so much as
thy life's last breath. Even so, <hi>Thy will
be done, not mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O invincible courage! O admirable
fortitude! which <hi>neither life nor death,
nor things present, nor to come,</hi> nor
feares, nor torments can shake or
stirre one inch from its settled resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Pardon me, my dearest SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR,
I cannot weep, I cannot pity
thy Sufferings, nor contain my heart
from singing <hi>Alleluia,</hi> in the midst of
the strongest throes and bitterest pangs
of thy Agony: For this one act makes
thee more happy, more amiable, more
glorious, then all the world can give,
then all thy miracles can deserve. Not
Mount <hi>Thabor</hi>'s glory, not <hi>Palm-sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>'s
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:36853:94"/>
acclamations, not the true and
hearty praises of the people fed with
thy bread, and resolv'd to force thee to
be their King; not the Wisdome
to confute thy adversaries, not the
Power to change, at pleasure, the course
of Nature; no, not the <hi>sitting at the
right hand</hi> of thy eternall Father, to
command the Vertues of the Heavens,
&amp; absolutely govern the Fates of Men
and Angels, can render thee so rich &amp;
contented in thy self, so beautifull and
adorable to the redeemed by thy Cross,
as this immovable Constancy, this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Resignation, this unparallell'd
Tranquillity and evennesse of Mind.</p>
                  <p>But beware, my Soul, thou beest not
mistaken; for his words import that his
will be not fulfill'd: it is not then His
will that is so constant and fixt: yet
His it is, for were it His Fathers will,
by which he speaks, he could not call it
<hi>thine;</hi> since he that speaks is to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>I,</hi> and not <hi>thou,</hi> and the will by
which he delivers his Speech, <hi>mine</hi> and
not <hi>thine.</hi> But how then can he say
<hi>not mine,</hi> of that which he will have
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:36853:94"/>
done? 'Tis therefore <hi>His;</hi> and more
his, then what he calls his: yet he calls
it <hi>not His,</hi> and the opposite <hi>His.</hi> And
were it not His, it would do us no
good, for whom he does what he does.
For we have also contrary wills; and
yet we have not two wills, following
two natures, as he had: therefore even
in him, these two wills, <hi>with</hi> one
whereof he speaks and <hi>concerning</hi> the
other, are both of his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that by them we might cure the
contrariety we find in ours. Why
then is one of them his, the other his
Fathers? why? if not because the one
he had from infirmity, the other from
strength; the one from flesh and blood,
the other from heavenly inspirations:
what proceeds from weaknesse, from
defect, from the odour of nothing, is
our own; but what comes from vertue,
from strength, from Being, all that is
Gods, and to be acknowledged totally
from him, as Beginner and Perfecter
of all things.</p>
                  <p>But is there no remedy for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Soul? must he alone tread the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:36853:95"/>
winepresse of sour grapes, alone drink
of this bitter <hi>Cup?</hi> Ah! dearest <hi>SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR,</hi>
leave no means unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that possibly may bring thee at least
some small refreshment: arise and try
whether thy old friends can afford thee
any comfort; those who were so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with thy glory on Mount <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor;</hi>
who sung so cheerfully but five
dayes since at thy triumphant entrance
into <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> who just now so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
protested their readinesse to die
with thee. Alas! they are all asleep;
so fast, so dead asleep, that neither chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
nor shame, nor compassion on
their dear Masters desolate condition
can awake them, to say so much as one
short prayer for themselves. O weak
foundation of humane Friendship! un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
and already deceiv'd is he that
builds on so false a bottome: how
farre better is it to trust in God then
Man, in the Maker of Princes then
the mouldring hand-work? O ill-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
Master? is this the fruit of all
thy teachings? is this the reward for
all thy benefits? is this the profit of all
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:36853:95"/>
those stupendious wonders thou hast
done before them? At least <hi>Judas</hi> was
tempted by the glistering shine of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that dazzles the eyes of all the
world; he was exasperated by the losse
of the price of the Ointment, and by
the publick reproach of his treason:
whereas these thy beloved, thy cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Disciples, have no plea to excuse
them, but their dulnesse, but their cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and want of love to their Master.</p>
                  <p>Though Earth fail, Heaven may be
true. Renew thy complaints, and let the
fervour of thy prayers melt those azure
floors the Angels tread. And already
behold a bright and suddain dawning
from the East, and the visible shape of
a heavenly Messenger. Come down
thou long expected Embassadour of
peace, and fill this horrid desart with
the charming musick of thy celestiall
voice. But oh! he stayes at the gates
of heaven, and onely looks down
afarre off, as if earth now were become
an abomination, and unworthy to be
approacht by sanctified persons: no
<hi>glory to God,</hi> no <hi>peace to Men,</hi> no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:36853:96"/>
note, not so much as a cup of
cold water to refresh the fainting
bowels of this afflicted Sufferer. O
strange mutation! how undutifull a
disobedience is this, in respect of the
obsequious service tender'd him at his
baptisme? Are heavenly affections sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to change? do Starres encrease and
wane like sublunary meteors? O no:
gladly would this Spirit of happinesse
stoop low as Earth, to raise the head,
and support the weak members of his
Lord: but that severe Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and narrow limited permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
allow onely so farre to relieve the
oppressed heart, that it may be able to
drink up the very dregs of that bitter
potion he has temper'd for him. O
Heaven, now more cruell then Earth!
which charitably stupifies the sense, and
takes away the pain by encreasing the
torment; whilst tyrannicall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
sends fresh supplies of strength,
onely to heap on a greater load of
grief.</p>
                  <p>O my dear Lord, all thy troubled
thoughts seem'd wholly restored to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:36853:96"/>
their usuall calmnesse; and, by that
noble act of Resignation, all thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
ran smoothly in their own
channels: but now again the storm is
raised, and louder and fiercer then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
See how it beats against that
strong barrier of <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> See
how the broken waves return with
doubled fury to invade this Rock of
patience, whose firmnesse, the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
it is assaulted, the more steddily
'tis fixt, and his prayer more extended
to his eternall Father. Hear him, hear
him, fountain of Pitty; if not for thy
own goodnesse, if not for respect to
him, at least that we may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
to call on thee, that we may hope
to be heard by thee. Thou invitest us
to come to thee, shall this be our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment?
thou chid'st us <hi>for asking
nothing in thy SON'S name,</hi> yet
shut'st thine eares against His voice,
begging for his own Soul. Undutifull
and wicked <hi>Reuben,</hi> that had abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
defil'd his Fathers bed, found
compassion for his little Brother, <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the anguish of his heart, when he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:36853:97"/>
humbled himself before them,</hi> and
after reproacht his brethren, that his
life was justly demanded at their
hands; and will not the cry of this
innocent <hi>Abel</hi>'s bloud reach up to
heaven, and mollifie the rigidnesse of
those severe decrees?</p>
                  <p>But whither am I straid? here on
earth is subject enough to require my
whole application. Behold how his
bloud boyles in his veins; his flesh
grows red and swells all or'e his body;
his sinews and arteries stretch, as on a
rack; the pores of his skin open like a
sive; and, in a moment, more foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
then feed the Ocean, break from
this source of misery. What's this I see
on that once-comely visage? not cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall
teares, not a gentle and trickling
dew, but whole drops of ruddy and
blackish sweat. Wo is me, they are
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ed and knotty berries of bloud:
Unfortunate fruit of this fair Tree.
Physicians and Naturalists, you say
thick humours cannot be purg'd by
transpiration; study me then how this
is come to passe. O the most beautifull
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:36853:97"/>
and gracious among the sons of men!
Was it for this thy body was fitted to
thee of Virgin-bloud, untoucht by men
and Angels? Was it for this thou wert
made the Top and Crown of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;
thy senses the most quick and
delicate that could be sifted from the
finest dust of <hi>Adam?</hi> Was it for this
thou wert nurst by the purest of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and carried in the hands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
lest thou shouldst at any time
offend thy tender feet? Were all
these diligences used, all these privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
bestowed, onely to prepare thee
a body for the rack; a subject to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
on a thousand intolerable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts;
a person to be made the unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd
example of prodigious calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
Such ought the <hi>Lamb</hi> to be that's
brought to the Altar for sacrifice, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blemish, without spot.</hi> A just and
reasonable Law, but here too severely
interpreted, too cruelly applied.</p>
                  <p>O unfortunate <hi>Adam!</hi> now the
effects of thy fond disobedience are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
too sadly evident; now thou art
cleerly convinc'd the unnaturall mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:36853:98"/>
of thy Posterity; now that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
wound thou gavest mankinde is
rendred incurable. Rise up, with all thy
numerous children about thee, whose
repentance expects a blessed eternity:
force the gates of <hi>Limbo</hi> with your
sighs, and let your strong groans tear
the bowels of the earth; that opening
a wide passage towards heaven, and
this <hi>Garden,</hi> fruitfull in miseries, your
cries and exclamations may be heard.
Protest to God, and Angels, and Men,
and all creatures, that Hell is too gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a pain, eternity too short a time to
punish your misdemeanours. Let the
Devils invent some more exquisite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then their wits and malice have
yet devis'd, and stretch the measure of
time beyond infinity, that you may pay
your debts, and dis-engage this imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
Lamb of God, this inestimable
pearl of the Deity. Contest the Judge
of righteousnesse to lay the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
where he findes the fault: charge
him with his word, that 'tis not his part
<hi>to chastise the innocent with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
but every one bear his own bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:36853:98"/>
But why do I cry and murmure?
I hear my complaints contradicted by
Him they most concern: I hear him,
in that weak voice is left him, humbly
say, <hi>How then shall the Scripture be
fulfilled?</hi> My Father has promis'd,
can he deny himself? my Father is all
Truth, dare I offer to falsifie his Word?
my Father is essentially Goodnesse,
can I make him go lesse? No, no, let
us march on confidently towards my
Passion, for <hi>behold him at hand who
is to betray me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, my Soul, Thou who hast
been a witnesse of this great spectacle,
a searcher of this profound mystery:
Thou who hast discover'd the source
of this impenetrable secret, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
God had no need of us, took not
our nature on him to please himself; but
we, and I in particular, were the chief
mark he aim'd at, and all these excesses
and heights of incomparable goodness
contriv'd to exalt our affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; nor this, because our loves
refresh or better him, but purely for this
sole motive, that they are our good, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:36853:99"/>
contain in them our eternall felicity:
If thou art able to look at so glorious
a light, to balance so great a weight, to
judge of and value so infinite a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
tell me what I have to do. After
this can I love any thing but my
Lord JESUS CHRIST? can
I love any thing but the Love of
my blessed SAVIOUR? Father
and Mother, Brothers and Sisters,
Kinsfolk and Friends, what is't you
have done for me? what goods have
you wisht me? what wishes can you
make to deserve the least share in my
Affection? Health and Pleasure,
Riches and Honour, what charmes
have you comparable to this ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
object of love? dull and fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appearances, take away your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
flatteries. Turn thou thy face
to me, sweet JESUS, that I may
every day still more and more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and admire thy love: Make
it the businesse and delight of my life
to study how much thou lovest me:
Set me in solitude to consider thy
works upon me, to repeat thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:36853:99"/>
to me: Let nothing but desires
and affections towards thee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
my thoughts, nothing but strains
and tunes of thy Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
sound in my Eares.</p>
