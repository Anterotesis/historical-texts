         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here present, or rather
pay, what I have often
promised you, and what
you have a right to; <hi>The Poems
of HORACE</hi> in the <hi>English
tongue:</hi> To the Translation
<pb facs="tcp:109967:5"/>
whereof my pleasant <hi>retirement</hi>
and <hi>conveniencies</hi> at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome
<hi>Habitation,</hi> have <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
contributed.</p>
            <p>And now according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of my <hi>Predecessors,</hi> having
spoyled some paper with writing
a bad <hi>Book,</hi> I am to waste more
in a worse <hi>Preface,</hi> least I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
under the <hi>imputation</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>heretick</hi> in Book-writing.</p>
            <p>However, I will be so kind to
you and my self, as to spare so
much time and paper as might
be employed in celebrating your
Greatness, Virtues, and generous
Inclinations towards me, being
Themes for a higher Pen than
<pb facs="tcp:109967:5"/>
dare pretend to, and only tell you
how you came to be <hi>disturbed</hi>
with these undertakings.</p>
            <p>'Twas not because I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this <hi>Author</hi> better than
others do, nor because I thought
I did. But the same <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
which induced our Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>Eve</hi> to eat fruit, prevaild
with me to read <hi>Horace,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because forbidden.</p>
            <p>But the frequent <hi>Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of him by all sorts of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
men, and the <hi>Hault-goust</hi>
which the <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of his
excellent sayings gave, made
me <hi>languish</hi> till I had broken
through all the <hi>difficulties</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:109967:6"/>
my <hi>imbecillity</hi> contended with,
and thrown my self on this <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious</hi>
adventure.</p>
            <p>In the prosecution whereof <hi>I</hi>
never <hi>blushd</hi> to ask the <hi>advice</hi>
or take the <hi>assistance</hi> of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whom I thought able to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi>
either. And among the
rest, of that <hi>indefatigable</hi> and
eminently <hi>learned</hi> person with
whom, by your <hi>indulgence</hi> and
his own <hi>condiscension</hi> I had the
honour and happiness to grow
acquainted, whom I found so
skill'd in all the <hi>difficulties</hi> of
this <hi>Poet,</hi> that he was to me more
then all the <hi>Voluminous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109967:6"/>Sir, For my speedier <hi>dispatch</hi>
and your <hi>advantage,</hi> I made
bold to take in all such parts of
<hi>HORACE,</hi> as have been <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished</hi>
by the <hi>Lord Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
Fanshaw;</hi> and what were
<hi>omitted</hi> by him, I <hi>supplyed</hi>
with such as have been done
by Sir <hi>Thomas Hawkins,</hi> or
Dr. <hi>Holiday,</hi> or both, for they
are both the same; and whether
of the two is the <hi>Author,</hi> remains
to me <hi>undiscovered:</hi> What were
not touched by these, I gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of Mr. <hi>Cowleys</hi> and
other Printed Books; and such
as were not <hi>Translated</hi> by others,
my self and several friends of
<pb facs="tcp:109967:7"/>
mine at my request have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted:
<hi>De Arte Poetica</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long since <hi>Englished</hi> by that
great <hi>Master</hi> thereof <hi>B. Johnson,</hi>
I have borrowed to <hi>crown</hi> the
rest.</p>
            <p>So that you will easily finde,
that as this Book consists of <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
men endeavors, so those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
men went <hi>several</hi> wayes;
but all studied to shun a nice
<hi>Pedantical Translation,</hi> which
<hi>Horace</hi> could not abide. By
reading all which you are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of two Pleasures, <hi>Liberty
of censuring,</hi> and <hi>variety of
matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I have this <hi>felicity,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:109967:7"/>
if any dislike what is done, it
will not be safe for them to <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi>
it publickly, least they
should reproach some of the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers</hi>
to their faces; for we
are considerable for <hi>number</hi> and
<hi>quality,</hi> consisting of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and those either <hi>Right
Honourable, Right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
Reverend,</hi> or (which is as
good) <hi>Well-beloved;</hi> and if I
for my part have herein played
the <hi>Fool,</hi> 'tis in very good <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as it is I <hi>expose</hi> it to
publick <hi>perusal,</hi> with this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<hi>Confidence,</hi> that the
excellence of the <hi>Author</hi> will
<pb facs="tcp:109967:8"/>
make amends for the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the <hi>Translators;</hi> and
having this in my prospect, that
<hi>HORACE</hi> may chance to find
as good fortune as his dear
friend <hi>VIRGIL</hi> had, who
being plundered of all his <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments</hi>
by the old Trasla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
was restored to others
with double lustre by those
<hi>Standard-bearers</hi> of Wit and
Iudgment, <hi>Denham</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</hi>
To which end I humbly
commend this rude <hi>Essay,</hi> to
those Persons whose <hi>Learning,
Wit,</hi> and <hi>Leisure</hi> shall ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do him such right as he
serves. And for a president, I
<pb facs="tcp:109967:8"/>
desire them to compare these
lines of <hi>Phaer,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>This end had <hi>Priams</hi> destinies, all this chance him Fortune
sent,</l>
                  <l>When he the fire in <hi>Troy</hi> had seen, his Walls and Castles
rent,</l>
                  <l>That sometimes over Peoples proud, and Lands had raign'd
with fame</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Asia</hi> Emperour great, now short on shore he lies with
shame,</l>
                  <l>His head besides his shoulders laid, his corps no more
of name.</l>
               </q>
with this done by Sir <hi>John Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Thus fell the King who yet surviv'd the State,</l>
                  <l>With such a signal and peculiar fate,</l>
                  <l>Under so vast a ruine, not a grave,</l>
                  <l>Nor in such flames a funeral fire to have:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:109967:9"/>He whom such Titles swelled, such power made proud,</l>
                  <l>To whom the Scepters of all <hi>Asia</hi> bow'd;</l>
                  <l>On the cold earth lies this neglected King,</l>
                  <l>A headless Carcass, and a uameless thing.</l>
               </q>
By which they may perceive
how highly Translations may be
<hi>improved.</hi> And if any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
will be so industrious and
kind, as to amend, or but to find
out the faults in this Essay (which
may easily be done) or furnish the
Stationer with any better against
the next Impression, they will be
so far from disobliging me, that I
invite them to it, conceiving it a
<hi>work</hi> by which they may gratifie
and oblige <hi>Posterity:</hi> And should

was born at <hi>Venusium,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
one of the best Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in <hi>Italy,</hi> now called <hi>Venoso;</hi>
of mean Parentage; his Father
<pb facs="tcp:109967:11"/>
was one whom the <hi>Romans</hi>
called <hi>Libertinus,</hi> viz. <hi>the Son
of a Slave who had been made
free;</hi> and by Profession he was
a <hi>Praeco,</hi> or a <hi>Coactor,</hi> whose
Imployment was to gather in
Debts for <hi>Usurers.</hi> Of his
<hi>Mother</hi> we find no mention;
onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tis agreed by all the
<hi>Dutch Commentators,</hi> that he
had one. He was born two
years before <hi>Catalines Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
viz.</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of the Ides of
<hi>December; Cotta</hi> and <hi>Torquatus</hi>
being Consuls. His Education
was at <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Father
finding him very pregnant,
kept him at <hi>Schoole</hi> under
<pb facs="tcp:109967:11"/>
               <hi>Orbilius</hi> a <hi>whipping Schoole-Master;</hi>
his Father also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a very prudent man, had
a severe and <hi>watchful</hi> eye over
him, and instructed him in
Virtue. Having attained to a
good measure of <hi>Grammer</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was sent to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
(then the <hi>most famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi>
in the World) and there
studied <hi>Philosophy;</hi> in which,
if he adhaered to any Sect, it
was to the <hi>Epicuraeans.</hi> At
first he was no great <hi>Zealot</hi> in
Religion, but rather jeared
than adored any of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Gods;</hi> of which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
he afterwards repented
<pb facs="tcp:109967:12"/>
and made an <hi>Ode</hi> professedly
to testifie his <hi>Recantation.</hi> In
the Civil Warr betwixt <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
and <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi>
he being the familiar Friend of
<hi>Brutus,</hi> took his part in the
battle at <hi>Philippi;</hi> in which he
was a <hi>Tribune,</hi> which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to a <hi>Colonel</hi> here: but
whether he fought or not, does
not appear; onely by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so great a <hi>Commander</hi> and
so <hi>ingenious</hi> a person, 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the <hi>Muses</hi> might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
him with <hi>Wit</hi> enough to
keep himself out of <hi>danger:</hi>
Some have <hi>traduced</hi> him for
<hi>running away,</hi> which if true, is
<pb facs="tcp:109967:12"/>
               <hi>excusable;</hi> for <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi>
are two <hi>spirits</hi> which possess
onely <hi>some</hi> men, and that but
at <hi>some times:</hi> So that the same
<hi>Commanders</hi> who have proved
<hi>Cowards</hi> in a just and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>War,</hi> have afterwards in a
<hi>Tavern</hi> dared to <hi>challenge</hi> such
as call'd them so; and by the <hi>law</hi>
a Souldier is no more bound
to fight when he is out of his
<hi>humor,</hi> then an Orator to speak
when he is out of his <hi>wits:</hi> Nor
is it prudent for a man of <hi>Wit</hi>
and <hi>Learning</hi> to have his <hi>brains</hi>
beaten out by one that has
none. <hi>Augustus</hi> having won the
Battle, it appeared that <hi>Horace</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:109967:13"/>
had taken the wrong side, for
which his great friend <hi>Mecae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi>
a very rich noble man of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and in great esteem with
<hi>Augustus,</hi> obtained a pardon:
And <hi>Augustus,</hi> like a good-natured
<hi>Prince,</hi> not only <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,</hi>
but <hi>rewarded</hi> him for
being against him, and (if
it had then bin in fashion
there) would have <hi>Knighted</hi>
him. Now being become a
<hi>Courtier,</hi> and not <hi>old</hi> or <hi>bold</hi>
enough to <hi>begg;</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi>
so newly after a Warr, not
<hi>rich</hi> enough to <hi>give;</hi> he (like
others of his Order) wanted
<hi>Money,</hi> and that put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:109967:13"/>
making <hi>Verses,</hi> which he
performed to <hi>admiration,</hi> and
was the first that introduced
the <hi>Lyrick Poëtry</hi> among
the <hi>Romans:</hi> By which, and
his great <hi>ingenuity</hi> and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Conversation,</hi> he grew
so much in favour with <hi>Mecae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi>
that he by his good will,
would never have him out of
his Company; and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him in his Studies, and
enable him to live without
cares, bestowed on him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Estate among the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi>
where he had a <hi>Country-house,</hi>
to which he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
from the noise and
<pb facs="tcp:109967:14"/>
bustle of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>write</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template,</hi>
and in which he took
great delight and recreation.
By <hi>Mecaenas</hi> he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to a familiar acquaintance
with <hi>Augustus,</hi> who offer'd to
make him his <hi>Secretary of
State:</hi> But <hi>Horace</hi> (like other
great Wits) hated business.
<hi>Augustus</hi> also considering what
immortality <hi>Poets</hi> conferr on
<hi>Princes</hi> and other great men,
wrote a Letter himself, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to come and live with
him as his <hi>companion.</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
read some of the <hi>Satyres,</hi>
and found not himself <hi>concern'd,</hi>
or his name <hi>mentioned</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb facs="tcp:109967:14"/>
he complain'd of it, and
asked him, <hi>Whether he thought
it would be a disparagement to
him to have it recorded to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that</hi> Horace <hi>was a famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
friend to</hi> Augustus? As to
his <hi>Stature,</hi> he was short and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fat, blear-ey'd, gray-headed
in his youth, and bald in the
forehead. And for his <hi>morals,</hi>
he was a very good man, pious
and grateful to his Father,
whom being grown old and
poor, he releived and kept at
his Country house: much a
<hi>Gentleman</hi> in his nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour;
very merry and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ious</hi>
in company, soon angry
<pb facs="tcp:109967:15"/>
and as soon <hi>pleased:</hi> As to his
Diet, he was that which we
by a grand mistake call an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,</hi>
for he loved and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
how to eat and drink
well; and though he was very
<hi>temperate</hi> and <hi>frugal</hi> general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet at a <hi>Treat,</hi> if he lik'd
his Company, he would give
nature a <hi>loose,</hi> and come up to
<hi>Ohe!</hi> He had that good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Vice</hi> (if it be one) which
constantly adheres to great
<hi>Wits,</hi> and is much indulged by
high <hi>imagination;</hi> an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>women,</hi> which he is the
less to be <hi>condemned</hi> for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was a <hi>Bachelour,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:109967:15"/>
in his time and <hi>Country</hi> it was
not esteemed a crime. He was
well acquainted with, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>valued</hi> by, all the eminent
<hi>wits,</hi> and persons of quality in
his time. By frequent <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany-keeping,</hi>
and strict obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
he informed himself of
all the <hi>vices</hi> and <hi>humours</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which he reproved and
<hi>chastised</hi> in a way of raillery,
whereby men were <hi>jear'd</hi>
out of their ill manners and
not offended: So considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was he for his <hi>parts,</hi> and
so eminent for his <hi>writings,</hi>
that he deservedly won the
applauses of divers of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb facs="tcp:109967:16"/>
Schollars in their times,
as <hi>Tibullus, Virgil, Ovid, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius,
Persius, Quintilian
Alex. Severus,</hi> St. <hi>Augustine
Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Bishop Iewel,</hi>
who have all written in his
<hi>Commendation,</hi> and are known
to be neither <hi>Fools</hi> nor <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi>
How long he lived, is not
agreed on; some say 50, some
55, some 59, others 70 years;
but when he finish'd his second
Book of <hi>Epistles</hi> he was 44
years old. And he dyed soon
after <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> namely (as
the best Authors report) 5 Kal.
<hi>Decemb. Censorinus</hi> and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
being Consuls, which was
<pb facs="tcp:109967:16"/>
five years before the birth of
<hi>Christ,</hi> having made <hi>Augustus</hi>
his <hi>heir,</hi> to whom he left his
<hi>Library,</hi> which was a good one;
and a years <hi>provision,</hi> which he
alwayes designed to keep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand; and being a great
contemner of <hi>wealth,</hi> and a
<hi>derider</hi> of covetous men, he
never aim'd at more. Being
<hi>dead</hi> he was <hi>buried</hi> next to
<hi>Mecaenas</hi> himself, in the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiliae;</hi>
an <hi>honour</hi> which good
<hi>Poets</hi> deserve, and which great
<hi>Princes</hi> have in all times taken
care to <hi>conferr</hi> upon them.</p>

                     <p>He sayes he dismisses his trifling studies, and embraces those
that tend to vertue: yet so as not to swear to any Masters
words. And that these studies are such, that there is none
but may be better'd by them, if he but lend a patient ear
thereunto. In the end he reprehends the depraved judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men placing vertue after wealth and honours,
and caring more for the things of the Body then the things
of the mind.</p>

what is honest, then some Philosophers; bringing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to prove the same. That in the Iliad, what are
the incentives of war to foolish Kings and Nations is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed:
and in the Odyssee, by Ulysses example, what
vertue and wisdome can do, is shown. Then exhorts to
the study of wisdome, as that which will heal the diseases
of the mind, which he reckons up. But teaches withal,
that men must from their tender age accustome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to such like precepts.</p>

                  <l>In this high <hi>Rage,</hi> he storm'd a <hi>Fort</hi> himself</l>
                  <l>That was well fortifi'd, and stor'd with wealth,</l>
                  <l>And laid about him with such force, they say,</l>

His ART of

            <l>IF to a Womans head a Painter would</l>
            <l>Set a Horse-neck, and divers feathers fold</l>
            <l>On every limbe, ta'en from a several creature,</l>
            <l>Presenting upwards, a fair female feature,</l>
            <l>Which in some swarthy fish uncomely ends:</l>
            <l>Admitted to the sight, although his friends,</l>
            <l>Could you contain your laughter? Credit me,</l>
            <l>This piece, my <hi>Piso</hi>'s, and that book agree,</l>
            <l>Whose shapes, like sick-mens dreams, are fain'd so vain,</l>
            <l>As neither head, nor foot, one form retain.</l>
            <l>But equal power, to Painter, and to Poet,</l>
            <l>Of daring all, hath still been given; we know it:</l>
            <l>And both do crave, and give again, this leave.</l>
            <l>Yet, not as therefore wild, and tame should cleave</l>
            <l>Together: not that we should Serpents see</l>

            <l>Ye have oft-times, that may o're-shine the rest,</l>
            <l>A Scarlet-peice or two, stitch'd in: when or</l>

            </l>
            <l>Or Rainbow is describ'd. But here was now</l>
            <l>No place for these. And, Painter, hap'ly, thou</l>
            <l>Know'st only well to paint a Cypress tree.</l>
            <l>What's this, if he whose money hireth thee</l>
            <l>To paint him, hath by swimming hopeless scap'd,</l>
            <l>The whole fleet wreck'd? A great jarre to be shap'd,</l>
            <l>Was meant at first; why forcing still about</l>
            <l>Thy labouring wheele, comes scarce a Pitcher out?</l>
            <l>In short; I bid, Let what thou work'st upon,</l>
            <l>Be simply quite throughout, and wholly one.</l>
            <l>Most Writers, noble Sire, and either Sonne,</l>
            <l>Are, with the likeness of the truth, undone.</l>
            <l>My self for shortness labour; and I grow</l>
            <l>Obscure. This striving to run smooth and slow,</l>
            <l>Hath neither soul, nor sinews. Loftie he</l>
            <l>Professing greatness, swells: That low by lee</l>
            <l>Creeps on the ground; too safe, too afraid of storm.</l>
            <l>This seeking, in a various kind, to form</l>
            <l>One thing, prodigiously, paints in the woods</l>
            <l>A Dolphin, and a Boar amid the floods.</l>
            <l>So, shunning faults, to greater fault doth lead,</l>
            <l>When in a wrong, and art less way we tread.</l>
            <l>The worst of Statuaries here about</l>
            <l>Th' <hi>Aemilian</hi> School, in brass can fashion out</l>
            <l>The nails, and every curled hair disclose;</l>
            <l>But in the main work hapless: since he knows</l>
            <l>Not to design the whole. Should I aspire</l>
            <l>To form a work, I would no more desire</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:109967:200"/>To be that Smith; then live, mark'd one of those,</l>
            <l>With fair black eyes, and hair, and a wry nose.</l>
            <l>Take, therefore, you that write, still, matter fit</l>
            <l>Unto your strength, and long examine it,</l>
            <l>Upon your Shoulders. Prove what they will bear,</l>
            <l>And what they will not. Him whose choice doth rear</l>
            <l>His matter to his power, in all he makes,</l>
            <l>Nor language, nor cleer order ere forsakes.</l>
            <l>The vertue of which order, and true grace,</l>
            <l>Or I am much deceiv'd, shall be to place</l>
            <l>Invention. Now, to speak; and then differ</l>
            <l>Much, that mought now be spoke: omitted here</l>
            <l>Till fitter season. Now, to like of this;</l>
            <l>Lay that aside, the <hi>Epicks</hi> office is.</l>
            <l>In using also of new words, to be</l>
            <l>Right spare, and wary: then thou speak'st to me</l>
            <l>Most worthy praise, when words that common grew,</l>
            <l>Are, by thy cunning placing, made meer new.</l>
            <l>Yet, if by chance, in utt'ring things abstruse,</l>
            <l>Thou need new terms; thou maist, without excuse,</l>
            <l>Fain words, unheard of to the well-truss'd race</l>
            <l>Of the <hi>Cethegi;</hi> And all men will grace,</l>
            <l>And give, being taken modestly, this leave,</l>
            <l>And those thy new, and late-coyn'd words receive,</l>
            <l>So they fall gently from the <hi>Grecian</hi> spring,</l>
            <l>And come not too much wrested. What's that thing.</l>
            <l>A <hi>Roman</hi> to <hi>Caecilius</hi> will allow,</l>

            <l>Or <hi>Varius?</hi> why am I now envi'd so,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Cato</hi>'s and <hi>Ennius</hi> tongues have lent much worth,</l>
            <l>And wealth unto our language; and brought forth</l>
            <l>New names of things. It hath been ever free,</l>
            <l>And ever will, to utter terms that bee</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:109967:200"/>Stamp'd to the time. As woods whose change appears</l>
            <l>Still in their leaves, throughout the sliding years,</l>
            <l>The first-born dying; so the aged state</l>
            <l>Of words decay, and phrases born but late</l>
            <l>Like tender buds shoot up, and freshly grow.</l>
            <l>Our selves, and all that's ours, to death we owe:</l>
            <l>Whether the Sea receiv'd into the shore,</l>
            <l>That from the North, the Navy safe doth store,</l>
            <l>A Kingly work; or that long barren fen</l>
            <l>Once rowable, but now doth nourish men</l>
            <l>In neighbour-towns, and feels the weighty plough;</l>
            <l>Or the wild river, who hath changed now</l>
            <l>His course so hurtful both to grain, and seeds,</l>

               <hi>Shall perish:</hi> so far off it is, the state,</l>
            <l>Or grace of speech, should hope a lasting date.</l>
            <l>Much phrase that now is dead, shall be reviv'd;</l>
            <l>And much shall dye, that now is nobly liv'd,</l>
            <l>If Custom please; at whose disposing will</l>
            <l>The power, and rule of speaking resteth still.</l>
            <l>The gests of Kings, great Captains, and sad Warres,</l>
            <l>What number best can fit, <hi>Homer</hi> declares.</l>

            <l>All the Grammarians strive; and yet in Court</l>
            <l>Before the Judge, it hangs, and waits report.</l>
            <l>Unto the Lyrick Strings, the Muse gave grace</l>
            <l>To chant the Gods, and all their God-like race,</l>
            <l>The conqu'ring Champion, the prime Horse in course,</l>
            <l>Fresh Lovers business, and the Wines free source.</l>
            <l>Th' Iambick arm'd <hi>Archilochus</hi> to rave,</l>
            <l>This foot the socks took up, and buskins grave,</l>
            <l>

            <l>The Comick matter will not be exprest</l>
            <l>In tragick Verse; no less <hi>Thyestes</hi> feast</l>
            <l>Abhors low numbers, and the private strain</l>

            <l>The place allotted it, with decent thewes.</l>
            <l>If now the turns, the colours, and right hues</l>

            <l>The Oracles, too, were given out in Verse;</l>

            <l>Plays were found out; and rest, the end, and Crown</l>

            <l>Let what thou fain'st for pleasures sake, be neere</l>
            <l>The truth, nor let thy Fable think, what e're</l>
            <l>It would, must be: lest it alive would draw</l>
            <l>The Child, when <hi>Lamia</hi> 'has din'd, out of her maw.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Poems</hi> void of profit, our grave men</l>
            <l>Cast out by voyces; want they pleasure, then</l>
            <l>Our Gallants give them none, but pass them by:</l>

            <l>With honour make the far-known Author live.</l>
            <l>There are yet faults, which we would well forgive;</l>
            <l>For, neither doth the String yet yield that sound</l>
            <l>The hand, and mind would, but it will resound</l>

            <l>Nor alwayes doth the loosed Bow, hit that</l>

            <l>How then? Why, as a Scrivener, if h' offend</l>

            <l>Deserves no pardon; or who'd play, and sing,</l>

            <l>So he that flaggeth much, becomes to me</l>
            <l>A <hi>Choerilus,</hi> in whom if I but see</l>

            <l>But, I confess, that, in a long work, sleep</l>
            <l>May, with some right, upon an Author creep.</l>
            <l>As Painting, so is Poesie. Some mans hand</l>
