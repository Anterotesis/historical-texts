            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But this common faith seemed not sufficient to the auncient fathers, in that purer age of the primitiue &amp; Apostolique Church: who though mistrusted not the lessons &amp; instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Apostles, yet were they also in this respect adiudged prayseworthy, because they did conferre the doctrine, which they receyued of the Apostles, with the bookes of the Law, and the prophets: which obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the elders was of no smal importaunce, to procure credite to the establishment of faith. But the state of Christianitie is nowe come (I know not to what passe) that this Christian faith, which behoued to be most deepely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in the hearts of euery of vs, is either not so well garnyshed in manye of vs, as it ought to be: in others very faynt and feeble: and in some others skarse any resemblaunce at all appearing, which slender portion and sparkle of faith, be it neuer so small, as is not altogether to be reiected, so neyther is this wonderfull sluggishnes, and retcheles secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the men in our age, in any respect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable: of whome some ouergreedily busied

of this action, truely we shal neuer find them els where, then in the hidden and secret closet of Gods election. For be it so admitted, that the Gentiles were for this cause engraffed into the true Oliue tree, because they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, yet if question be moued, from whence their faith proceeded first, it may well be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, not from any their merites truely, neither in respect of any their own worthines more, then as the impes which do issue out of the naturall wylde Oliue tree, can boast of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their excellencie, wherefore they ought to be transplanted into the fatnes of the true O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue tree.

the barren vnfruitefull wylde Oliue tree did furmount the true Oliue in excellencie of fatnes? to wit, in integritie of life and merits? surely I thinke not so. Wherefore then were the Iewes forsaken, and the Gentiles recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? S. Paul maketh this answere.

(say they) promised, that he wil neuer forsake his Church? what then? Haue not the keyes lyneally descended vnto vs from blessed S. Peter, euer hitherto, being the chiefe head of the Apostles, which the Lord hath promised shal neuer be taken away? Is there any more yet? what? is it possible for Gods trueth it selfe to defraude the credite of his couenant, whereunto he hath bound him selfe with a most sacred othe?</p>
                     <p>Uery well now. And whereupon doth the blinde arrogancie of the Iewish Nation magnifie their race? do we not deriue our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigree (say they) lyneally from our most holy father Abraham? Are we not borne, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Israelites, by the name of our great graundsier Israel, the Patriarch? did not the Lord credite vs only with the safe custodie of the Arke of his couenant? Haue not we a promise from God by the mouth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, of a Messhias and Sauiour to come? Hath not god prepared an euerlasting throne for the kingdom of our Messhias? Is not he of power to make his couenant inuiolable, that with so many othes hath ratified y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same? Nor will hee not perfourme the othes which he hath made? Surely I wil not much gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,


<pb facs="tcp:9109:27"/>
that it is in deede no final matter, wherof eche partie debateth so largely of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of almightie God. Yet all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, all things depend not so alwayes vpon Gods promises made, but due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ought also be had of the minde and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of him that maketh the promise in the scriptures: and the same well weighed and compared with the due circumstances and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the scripture, if we will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted true and syncere interpretoures of Gods holy scriptures: that is to say, It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth vs duely and orderly to define and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose all and euery thing apart by it selfe, not those thinges onely which are promised, but must withall respect the persons, the place, the cause and consideration, and al other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the promises. And therefore albeit we do graunt vnto them that all those promises are true, whereupon they bragge so much, touching the succession of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches and Apostles, yet shall they neuer be able to winne this at our handes, To wit, that this ordinarie discent according to the lawe of the flesh, is a sufficient fundation to buyld the Church of God vpon.<note place="margin">

                     <p>As concerning the promises of God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this is vndoubtedly to be holden, that the promises be in their owne nature simply true: yet in such wise true notwithstanding, as God hath not alwayes chained them to time, place or persons of men: which albeit were

tyed fast to place and persons, yet are the proude and high mynded shaken of, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises remayning still in their force.

Some writers also mislyking the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinions, doe make their reckoning otherwise. Besides this scrupule manie seeme to bee encumbred much about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate and confused supputation of the yeres

and reignes of the kings which succeeded Cyrus and continued vntill the comming of Alexander, which thing chiefely aboue all the rest entangleth the accompt most by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the vncertaine limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those times. There is also no lesse disagreement in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the yeres, betwixt them which do nomber from the raigne of Cyrus: amongst whome those which applie to the byrth of Christ, do recompt the nomber of yeres to be 540: some reckone 501: some otherwise either more or lesse.

to my simple vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. And yet I see no cause, why I should spend any long time herein: for I doe firmely trust, that all those sayings are already noted by you, yea &amp; deepely imprinted in your mindes, which the Apostle doth teach here, touching the due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of our calling, so that mine exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal not be much needeful in this place. First, I suppose that you are not ignorant of the great rigor that God executed vpon his people, wherwith if he would haue punished you, what might haue letted him I pray you? Yea rather what was the cause, why he did not punish you? Do ye thinke that any of you were endued with any such excellencie, as ye myght thereby challenge any preeminence aboue the Iewishe nation? Were not wee sometimes euen in the same plyght, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Iewes remayne in at this day: to witte, vnfaithfull vnbeleeuers in the sight of God? Then if God excluded the Iewes for their vnbeleefe (as he dyd) what argument myght enduce him to haue more compassion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Gentiles, who were sometymes as voyde of fayth, as they are nowe? Whereby you may perceyue (my deare brethren) howe the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable mercie of God doeth miraculously

woorke in mans election, beyonde all hope and capacitie of man, <hi>who hath compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on whome it pleaseth him, and harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the hearts of whome him lysteth.</hi> That it may ryghtly be sayde, <hi>That it consisteth neyther in the power of the wylling, nor of the running to obtayne mercie, but in the mercyfull God.</hi> If this be not yet appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt vnto you, looke vpon those Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, that are yet forsaken of God: who were sometymes in his fauour, and you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their steade. What was the cause thereof, I praye you? Thou wyle saye, that the Naturall braunches were broken off, that I myght be engraffed in. It is true in deede, they were broken off, as thou say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. But good sir, this was not done for thy sake, but for their owne vnbeleefe sake. And yet it followed hereupon, that we were planted in: neither is this false, that thou spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest. But this is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> point I seke for: there is yet an other thing, to witte, not whether the Iewes were broken off: But I woulde fayne knowe, what vertue was in thee, that myght procure thee to be engraffed in their place. And wherfore should they, beyng natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches, be hewen off? If you compare


<pb facs="tcp:9109:99"/>
with them in auncienty of race, they did farre excell you in auncientie of byrth, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of parentage. For they were your elders farre, by which tytle they myght lawfully challenge the preeminence of the birthright. If you stande with them vpon deseruinges, howe precisely dyd they pursue the prescript rule of ryghteousnesse? whereof thou dydst take no regarde at all, although in trueth they were neuer able to attayne the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they sought for. If thou contende with them in excellencie of zeale, they wanted not very feruent and entier zeale, albeit their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest bent affection wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted true vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. If thou boast vpon thy vpryghtnesse of lyfe, surely we Gentiles were in no respect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable vnto them in conuersation of life. If thou haue regarde to the paynefulnes of the toyle, or estate of the calling, they did beare the brunt and heate of the sunne, and were then first, when as thou camest into the vineyarde skarsely amongst the last, euen at the last caste. All which notwithstanding thou doest playnely perceyue, that they are rent off from the naturall stocke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they grewe, and thy selfe beyng other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a starueling boughe of a wylde Oliue

And because they do so, we haue bene withholden by the commandement of our God from making any couenant with them, or hearkening vnto any of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; teachers: for that were but to make <hi>Israel</hi> to sinne, and to prouoke the holy one to anger. When they talke with vs, they saye


<pb facs="tcp:9109:112"/>
they are not such as our Prophets speake of, who worshipped beasts and other creatures, as the sunne &amp; the moone: but they worship onely the creature of man, who was made to the image of God, and by whome God hath wrought great and marueilous workes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. To whom we answere by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of our Lawe, that all idolatrie is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs: the commaundement forbiddeth not one thing more than an other, neither giueth greater libertie for one thing, than for an other: but saith in these wordes, Thou shalt not make the likenesse of anie thing that is in heauen aboue or in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, or in the water vnder the earth, thou shalt not bowe downe to them nor serue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And if anie creature might be worshipped, reason would the sunne &amp; moone should haue that honour done them: for they serue vs to greatest purposes, &amp; by them we reape daily profit. <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob: Mosheh, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Elizahu</hi> with the rest of the Prophets were good men, and by them God wrought wonderfull things, and yet we neuer worshipped any of them. And we can not thinke that this wisedome was or should haue bene hidden from all them, and all our

fathers, if it had bene so great wisdome in the sight of our God. They say vnto vs often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that they do not worshippe them as Gods, but they worship God in them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Heathen, we say, that are rounde about vs so blinded with the imagination of their heartes, as that they thinke that the stockes &amp; stones carued, or the tables which they paint them selues, to be God: but they are persuaded that the liuing God may bee worshipped and serued in them.

And yet those common Christians go verie farre: for the Christians of <hi>Spayne</hi> &amp; <hi>Portugal</hi> haue it written in their bookes, as in one which they call <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plationes del Idiota ala virgen Maria,</hi> That that virgin is the Lordes treasure, and that she bestoweth giftes and graces vpon hir ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes to make them worthy dwelling hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for hir blessed sonne and the holy Ghost: that hir mercie often time pardoneth them, whome the iustice of hir sonne might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne:
