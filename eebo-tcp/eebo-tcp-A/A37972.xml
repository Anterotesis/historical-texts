         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Late Writer hath taken the
confidence to make very Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respectfull,
Indecent, Rude,
and Scurrilous Reflections upon You,
and hath with that Scorn and Insolence,
which are peculiar to him, and cannot
be supposed to be in any other Man, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
your <hi>Studies</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Learning,</hi> which are at this
day own'd and practis'd by you. They
have always born the brand of Infamy
who have shew'd their ill will to these
<hi>Publick Schools of Education</hi> and
<hi>Professed Seminaries of Arts and
<pb facs="tcp:57882:3"/>
Literature. Pope Paul</hi> the Second
and <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth who succeded him
were infamous on this account, for both
of them were ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erv'd to bear a Hatred
to <hi>Universities,</hi> and publickly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their abhorrence of <hi>Academick</hi>
Men and Learning. Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is a
Modern Instance, who was wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
the <hi>University-Studies</hi> and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
because he had espoused a Set of
Notions which were destructive not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Academick but all Religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
But a later Instance we have
in one Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> who though he infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
comes short of the forenamed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Parts or Good Letters, yet hath
taken the courage to tread in his Old
Friend's steps, and publickly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
his dislike of <hi>University-Men,</hi>
and to remonstrate against the <hi>Methods</hi>
they take in bringing up of Youth. The
Name of <hi>Publick Schools</hi> and <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies</hi>
is as hatefull to him as that of
<hi>Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nasius</hi> to a <hi>Socinian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57882:3"/>Nor is he pleas'd with our Old <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
but hath offer'd a New Scheme
to the World, the same (the very same
in words, as well as to the Thing) with
what Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> propounded as the
Perfect and Compleat Model of Faith,
<hi>viz. To believe in Christ is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else than to believe that Jesus
is the Christ: and no other Faith,
besides this Article, is required to
Eternal life.</hi> De Cive cap. 18. <hi>The
belief of this Article, Jesus is the
Christ or Messias, is all the Faith
required for Salvation.</hi> Leviathan.
Part. 3. Chap. 43. This is the Doctrine
which is revived and furbish'd up in the
pretended <hi>Reasonableness of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity:</hi>
and you see whence it is borrow'd.
When that Writer was framing a <hi>New
Christianity,</hi> he took <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi>
for the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and
the <hi>Philosopher</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> for
our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Apostles.</hi> See
how naturally a Man passes from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning
<pb facs="tcp:57882:4"/>
and vilifying the <hi>Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
to affront and abuse <hi>Religion!</hi> He
had with pride and contempt trampled
upon the former, and now he attacks the
latter, and treads <hi>Christianity</hi> it self
under his feet.</p>
            <p>It may be few of you have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Affronts done to <hi>your selves</hi>
by this Bold Assailant, as not busying
your selves with such sort of Writers,
or as thinking such Reflections below your
Resentments. But I having had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to enter the Lists with this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
it falls in my way to take notice
of his Double Insolence, i. e. to <hi>You</hi>
and to <hi>Religion,</hi> but more especially
the latter, which he hath miserably shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
and unsettled, and almost reduced
to nothing; having baulk'd a great part
of the <hi>Gospels,</hi> and wholly laid aside
the <hi>Epistles,</hi> and renounced all <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Christianity</hi> but <hi>One</hi> as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believ'd to constitute a Man
a Christian, and having every where
<pb facs="tcp:57882:4"/>
shew'd his disdain of the <hi>Ministry</hi> and
<hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> especially
the <hi>Clergy of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
So that he deserves to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with <hi>Satyr</hi> rather than <hi>Argument.</hi>
And therefore if there be in the ensuing
Papers a kind of mixture of the former
with the latter, I hope it will not be
disrelish'd even by the most Serious and
Iudicious Readers when they consider
on whom it is bestow'd.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I have now an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of vindicating the Honour of those <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned</hi>
and <hi>Learned Bodies</hi> to which
you belong, and likewise of asserting and
defending the <hi>Cause of Christianity:</hi>
wherefore I thought I should be defective

            <head>A
Brief Vindication
OF THE
Christian Faith, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AFter I had observed the rude and surly
Genius of a late Penman, the <hi>Author</hi>
and <hi>Vindicator</hi> of a Treatise which he
entitules <hi>The Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> I
had a mind to see what was his Humour in
some other of his Productions, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
I look'd into his Papers of <hi>Education,</hi>
and there I soon discover'd that it was his
settled Nature and Temper to Traduce all
ranks of Persons, and that he had taught his
Tongue to Revel, and that he can't write three
Pages without thrice as many Calumnies and
Falshoods, and so I less wondered at his <hi>Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
to Me. There I found that he libels the
most <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Celebrated Societies</hi> of Men
in this Nation, that he strives to blast the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the most <hi>Useful Perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> and to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule
their <hi>Publick Employments</hi> and <hi>Statiens,</hi>
that with an ungovernable pride and disdain
he discards some <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> and laughs
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57882:6"/>
at the <hi>Professors</hi> of them: And in brief, I found
that he imperiously flies at all, and like some
Barbarous Invader makes havock wheresoever
he comes, and spares no Sex, Place, or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Persons. Of which I will now give
the Reader some particular Instances, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
proofs.</p>
            <p>For I conceive it will not be expected that
I should first endeavour to make it clear, that
the Author of <hi>the Reasonableness of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is the same person that writ concerning
<hi>Education,</hi> for all his Friends and Admirers,
(who would not wrong him, we must think)
make him the Father of both: And he owns
it <hi>himself,</hi> for when I saluted him by the <hi>name</hi>
of Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> in a late Treatise [The <hi>Socinian
Greed.</hi> Chap. 6.] he readily answer'd to it.
<hi>In his Socinian Creed, p 120. he begins with
M E,</hi> saith he, Vindicat. p. 398. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the same Page and the four following
ones, he particularly applies to <hi>himself</hi> what
I said of him by <hi>Name</hi> in that Chapter; and
he concludes p. 402. <hi>This is all that is new,
which I think My self concern'd in, in his Soc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Creed.</hi> This <hi>All</hi> is what I had said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his <hi>One Article,</hi> and concerning his
baulking of the <hi>Epistles,</hi> and concerning his
crying down of <hi>Systems</hi> with a design to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
one of his own. All along I charg'd Mr.
<hi>Lock</hi> with these things, to which the Author
of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> submissive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
replies, <hi>I think</hi> MY SELF <hi>concern'd in all
this,</hi> which is as much as to say, I am Mr.
<hi>Lock</hi> whom you mentioned so often in that
Chapter. And we shall find in p. 424, 425.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57882:6"/>
of his <hi>Second Vindication,</hi> that he takes to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
whatever I had said with particular refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> whom I expresly named
in the foresaid Chapter. Here we see the
<hi>Masker</hi> pulls off his Vizour, and after all his
Disguises owns himself to bear that <hi>Name</hi>
which I call'd him by. I think then I may
proceed.</p>
            <p>First, to give the Reader a right Idea of this
Gentleman, I will take notice of his way of
treating the <hi>Universities</hi> whether at home or
abroad, for we must know that he is a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Hater of them all, as appears from his
scornful censuring and disparaging <hi>the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now in fashion in the Schools of Europe,</hi> page
158 of his <hi>Thoughts of Education,</hi> by which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
terms he means the Formed <hi>Academies</hi>
as well as the meaner <hi>Schools</hi> and Seats of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
which are in these <hi>European</hi> parts. Our
Universal Railer spares neither Foreign Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of Learning, nor those in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
It is as easie to him with the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
Breath, to blast the one as the other.
And his Pride and Arrogance prompt him to
blow upon both, and to defy all Methods of
<hi>Education</hi> but his own. But chiefly his spight
is heightned against those Two Famous Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
of Learning which our own Nation is
blessed with, and thence it is that they fall
under such Benedictions as these from him,
which I shall next take notice of. <hi>The Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi>
(saith he) <hi>think it their great business to
fill the Studies and Heads of their Pupils with
such Authors as these,</hi> viz. <hi>Burgersdicius</hi> and
<hi>Schiebler.</hi> p. 162. This is an unpardonable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57882:7"/>
fault, and therefore the Lash is due from our
Severe <hi>Educator,</hi> and accordingly he here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
it on the <hi>Cambridg</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> Tutors.
I charge you, young Men, as I am Tutor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
not to deal in such Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hors. Read <hi>Iohn
Lock</hi> who writ of <hi>Humane Understanding,</hi> and
hath had little of it since, and not over much
then. If you would <hi>fill your Pupils heads</hi> with
Whimsies, there is a Book for you, If you
would have <hi>no Idea</hi> of the Supreme Being, and
a <hi>false one</hi> of Christianity, and a <hi>fantastick one</hi>
of Good Manners, then <hi>think it your great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to fill your Studies with my <hi>Essay,</hi> and
my <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> and my
<hi>Thoughts of Education.</hi> Though I know not
whether <hi>Burgersdicius</hi> and <hi>Schiebler</hi> be Authors
in fashion amongst the generality of Tutours
at this time, but rather think they are not;
yet if they have been, or are among some, it
is enough to ground an Out cry upon. In the
same page he tells us that <hi>Burgersdicius'</hi> s and
<hi>Schieblers did not swarm in</hi> Seneca' <hi>s days, as
they do now in these.</hi> No, good Sir, nor did
such Whimsical Writers as <hi>Iohn Lock</hi> and
<hi>Sam. Bold</hi> swarm in those days, as they do
now. He very worshipfully urges <hi>the little
advantage of Logick,</hi> p. 234. and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
adds, that <hi>the Skill of Reasoning well is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or never got by studying the Rules which
pretend to teach it.</hi> Again, in the same place,
merely to disparage the <hi>Academick</hi> Studies, he
tells us that <hi>Right Reasoning is founded on some
thing else than the Predicaments and Predicables,
and consists not in talking in Mood and Figure:</hi>
But we know, Good Sir, it is inconsistent
with talking against them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57882:7"/>In an other place, p. 145. he hath a fling at

methinks this should not be his meaning that

from the University?</hi> Ay, there it is, I will
warrant you: He imagines that it must be

the charges.</p>
            <p>But heark! there is a Terrible Broad-side
coming, for by way of a Concluding Stroke
he boldly tells us, that the <hi>Education which is
at this day in the University</hi> (and by this way
of speaking you may perceive he intends one
of our own Universities) is useless <hi>for the
World, and Mans Life.</hi> Now we are sunk,
and never can rise again. A Man of <hi>Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Education</hi> is to be kick'd out of the <hi>World,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57882:8"/>
and deserves not to <hi>Live</hi> in it, because he is
not bred up according to the Rules of one Mr.
<hi>Lock</hi>'s <hi>Education.</hi> His University Learning
is not useful for the World, it will never
make him a <hi>Committee Man,</hi> and help him to
understand <hi>Manufacture</hi> and <hi>Fishery:</hi> And if
it will not do that, what is it good for?</p>
            <p>And this Lewd Declaimer is full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives
against the Persons as well as the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of University Men, for he lets us know
that the <hi>young Tutour from the University is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
well-bred, nor skill'd in the world, nor well
principled in the grounds and foundations of true
vertue and generosity,</hi> p 145. His <hi>Latin</hi> and
his <hi>Logick</hi> were bad, but his <hi>Ethicks</hi> are much
worse; he hath been fooling with <hi>Burgersdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
but hath not look'd into <hi>Machiavel,</hi> and
thence principled himself with the grounds
and foundations of true Vertue and Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
which cannot be but from him alone.
And then he is very sharp again upon the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity-Tutors
because <hi>they are not well bred,</hi>
and <hi>have not the knowledge of a man of Business,</hi>
p. 159. and have <hi>no knowledge of the World,</hi>
p. 162, 163. and therefore are unfit to be <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and to read Lectures to Gentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

impossible</hi> (as he adds) <hi>that any one should come
forth well fashion'd out of unpolish'd ill bred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi>
p 163. The Universities are this <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polish'd

            <p>This is ths best Language Mr. <hi>Iohn Lock</hi>
can bestow upon <hi>University-Men.</hi> He would
have us know that <hi>he</hi> hath engrossed all <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>

and <hi>Good Breeding</hi> to himself, that <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity-Air</hi>

meaning the foresaid persons, and rattles them
again for their want of <hi>Good Breeding.</hi> Again,
in an other place he derides and scoffs at the
<hi>Liberal Arts, and the Tutors Learn'd Enc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paidia,</hi>
p. 150. There is some unlawful <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>
in this <hi>Circle</hi> of the Arts, and he would
not have any one come within the Compass
of it. In short, from what this <hi>Tutorer of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
hath let fly already against our present Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies,
we may perceive him enclined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
as heartily against them as <hi>Culpeper</hi> ever
did against the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Physitians.</hi> But the
two Grand things which he upbraids them
with are their Deficiency as to their <hi>Learning,</hi>
and to their <hi>Breeding.</hi> With respect to both
which, if he were indulged his Liberty, it is
not to be doubted he would use such Language
as this:</p>
            <q>
               <p>The <hi>Students</hi> in the Universities, as well
as the <hi>Books</hi> in the Great and Common Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
of one of them, are all <hi>Chain'd;</hi> they
are Tied to certain Methods of Study, and
their Authors are prescribed them. They
live in perfect Durance, and the <hi>Bocardo</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57882:9"/>
and <hi>Toll-booth</hi> are but representations of their
respective <hi>Colleges.</hi> At their very entrance
they are imprison'd and Shackled, a <hi>Burgers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicius</hi>
or some such <hi>System-maker</hi> is clapt into
every youths hands, and they can't be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculated
without <hi>Predicaments</hi> and <hi>Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
There is nothing but Restraint and
Imposition here. <hi>Oxford</hi> presents us with a
<hi>Bible</hi> in its <hi>Armorial Ensigns,</hi> thereby pinning
the <hi>Epistles</hi> upon us, as well as the rest of
the Scripture. The <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Cups</hi> (as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi>
as they are) of the other University
are fantastick Emblems, and serve only to
<hi>dazzle</hi> and <hi>intoxicate</hi> the minds of the ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Pupils of <hi>Alma Mater;</hi> who (poor
Souls) are <hi>not skill'd in the World,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> and know
not that <hi>Sturbridg-Fair</hi> is the best <hi>Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Again, as their <hi>Knowledg,</hi> so their
<hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Scheibler. Logick</hi> gives one an ill Mien and

there is not a <hi>well fashion'd Tutor</hi> among them.

(their first Principles) those of the other
were reduced to their old <hi>Inns</hi> and <hi>Hostles,</hi>
it would be suitable to their merits: But it
would be much more agreeable if they were
remov'd out of the World. I ever thought
that the best way to decide the Controversy
between <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Twyne</hi> about the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57882:9"/>
of these Societies is to dissolve them
both. They are so Useless and Insignificant
a part of Mankind, so <hi>Ill bred a Company,</hi>
that the Nation would not be a Farthing the
worse if they underwent the same fate
with the <hi>Abbeys</hi> and <hi>Monasteries.</hi> In short,
I am one that like nothing which belongs to
the <hi>Ford</hi> or the <hi>Bridg,</hi> No, not so much as
the <hi>Buildings</hi> of the former, for in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Lowse-Hall</hi> is as good a Structure as the
<hi>Theater.</hi> I see nothing that is <hi>Genteel,</hi> or
<hi>Learned</hi> in either of the so much Celebrated
Universities. Both their <hi>Behaviour</hi> and their
<hi>Studies</hi> are to be abhor'd because they are
not according to the Pattern of my <hi>Seraglio</hi>
which I intend to publish to the World, and
have partly done it in my <hi>Education.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>But where then can we suppose this Raving
<hi>Tutor</hi> and <hi>Reformer</hi> to have been bred, who
thinks and talks after this rate? And to what
Society doth he belong? If Charity did not
give a Check here, we might mention the
Famous and Renowned <hi>Gymnasium</hi> at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> that Academy of poor
shatter'd Noddles, that Receptacle of Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Meninges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because the <hi>Universities</hi> are constantly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
from the <hi>Publick Schools,</hi> therefore it is
no wonder that he who is a profess'd Enemy
to those Higher and Supreme Seats of the
Muses, shews his rancour against the Inferiour
ones, and such as are in order to the other.
He is severe upon <hi>School-masters</hi> (though not
so severe as he every where complains they
are upon their Boys) and their way of <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57882:10"/>
and will not entertain a favourable
thought of any thing they do. As before I
observed that he routed <hi>Burgersdicius,</hi> so now
he laughs at the Teachers of <hi>Lily</hi>'s <hi>Grammar,</hi>
p. 290, nay he would have <hi>no Grammar at all,</hi>
p. 291. <hi>The way of learning Latin in a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-School</hi>
he declares against with great su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perciliousness,
p. 291. He would not have
<hi>any Language learnt by Grammatical Rules,</hi> p.
288. but only by <hi>roat,</hi> p. 295. In an other
place he shews his dislike not only of <hi>Logical
Disputes</hi> (which is a Touch to the <hi>Academick</hi>
Gentlemen) but of <hi>Set Declamations,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vigorously appears against <hi>making Latin
Themes and Decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ations,</hi> p. 297. and 7 pages
more, not only because he was so dull at these
Exercises when he was in his Boyship, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is, as he saith, <hi>the Vulgar Method of
Grammar Schools,</hi> which he hath a strange An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
against, and is so weak and indiscreet
as to discover it by ill Language. Surely <hi>the
fear of the School-Masters Rod</hi> (which with
some emotion and trembling he mentions p.
268. and in other places) was betimes begot
in his mind by his early deserving it: And
that frightful Idea made so deep an impression
on his thoughts, that it will continue with
him all his days, and he will ever have a fling
at that <hi>Instrument of Education,</hi> as he calls it.</p>
            <p>A Publick-School is the worst of Prisons,
that which we silly folks call a <hi>Free-School</hi> is a
house of Bondage with him, <hi>the Children are
chain'd to the Oar seven, eight, or ten years,</hi> p.
268. Again, in the same place, <hi>They are put
into the Herd, and driven with a Whip or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57882:10"/>
Scourge,</hi> &amp;c. This is very sad and lamentable
indeed, they are both Slaves and Beasts. You
Gentlemen that are Masters of the Great
Schools in <hi>London, Westminster, Eton, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
and all the rest of you that are of that
so Useful and Honorable Employment, you
are all of you a company of <hi>Tyrants, Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
Task-masters, Herd-drivers, Overseers of
Gallies:</hi> You unmercifully as well as unjustly
treat the poor Children that are under you,
cruelly chaining them to the Oar, and at the
same time driving them like Beasts, as this
Man of Sense expresses it. And you that are
their <hi>Parents,</hi> how unreasonable do you act
when you put them to School? You commit
them to the <hi>Common Gaol</hi> (as you know
<hi>Westminster-School</hi> is but one Remove from
the <hi>Gate-house</hi>) you enter them <hi>Gally-flaves,</hi>
and you make their condition equal with that
of your very Brutes: And all this you do to
<hi>get them a little Latin and Greek, which might
be had at a great deal cheaper rate of pains and
time,</hi> p. 268. And then after all this, you and
their Masters give some of them their Mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
to the Universities, where they are in
Bondage and Jail again: There they tug at
the Oar, there they run the Gantlet through
<hi>dry Systems of Logick and Philosophy,</hi> p. 164.

of Divinity,</hi> p. 283. So that it seems not only

and <hi>Propagating</hi> as if these were two Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
things, especially the former. This
would well enough become a Town-Wit and
have pass'd in a Play, but it sounds odly and
prodigiously from a Grave Tutour, from a
Stanch Metaphysitian, from a Formal Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
up of Youth, and from one who lays down
<hi>Rules of Civility, Good Manners, and Breeding,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Surely some Persons of Honour of either

note this, that this Writer hath no regard to
his own Rules, that he teaches men to trample
upon his own Dictates, and that he gives the
world to understand that his Foppish Gravity
is to be hiss'd at. If there were some real
ground for what he saith, yet a Writer of a
book on purpose (as he pretends) to chastise
the <hi>Indiscretion</hi> and <hi>Ill Breeding</hi> of others,
would not have used terms of that nature. Or,
if a discreet man had censured the practice it
self, yet he would have been careful to do it
without those unmannerly and indecent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on a great part of the present <hi>Nobility</hi>
of our Kingdom, with others of the <hi>Gentry.</hi>
Or, if he had made bold with <hi>my Young Master</hi>
(as he calls him) yet he might have forborn
reflecting so rudely on their <hi>Honourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57882:12"/>
and speaking so disrespectfully of some
on whom our Dependence hath been, and
making himself and the reader merry with his
Lampoons upon them. Is this the man that
cries up himself for the Gift of <hi>Educating?</hi> Is
this deportment which I have been mentioning
the Character of a <hi>Well-bred man?</hi> Or is it not
rather the Idea and Pourtraiture of an <hi>Ill-bred</hi>
and <hi>Wandring Pedagogue,</hi> of an <hi>Itinerant Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
who scampers from one Shire to an other,
to give documents about <hi>reading Reynard the
Fox</hi> p. 279. which he calls <hi>Education,</hi> and
hath writ a Book about it?</p>
            <p>He flings at the <hi>Reverend Iudges,</hi> by fixing
a Pasquil upon one of them, p. 105, 106. of
his <hi>Second Vindication.</hi> Which is either true
or false; if we can suppose the former, yet
no Discreet man would publickly mention it,
out of respect to the the Honourable Robe. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this Writer should not have exposed any
of that Order, seeing he had particularly
commended and urged <hi>decency of words,</hi> p.
256. <hi>Educat.</hi> and had declared that <hi>it is the
part of a Well-bred Man to express a respect to
persons according to their Rank and Condition.</hi>
p. 258. But on the other hand, if this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
be <hi>false,</hi> then he deserves to fall into
the hands of those <hi>Ministers of Iustice,</hi> and to
be sentenced according to his Crime. But I
return to his Treatise of <hi>Education.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is observable that the <hi>Softer Sex</hi> have
found no Protection from this Rough Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He is not only an University Hater but a
Hater of Women. He exposes the behaviour
of two <hi>Ladies of Quality,</hi> that fell out with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57882:13"/>
one an other in Company, and relates the
Paritculars of it. p. 265, 266. It is likely
that one or both of them have been told of
this passage in his book, and they can't but
think it is an Affront to them, and must needs
be so far from believing him to have any of
that <hi>Good Breeding</hi> which he pretends to teach
the world, that they will ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her stigmatize
him as a <hi>Scandalous Blab</hi> that tells all he hears,
a <hi>Tom Coriat</hi> that relates whatever he picks
up in his perambulations. Joyn this with his
Reflections on those Persons of Honour before
mention'd, and then give me your opinion of
the <hi>Breeding</hi> of our <hi>Gensorious Tutour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he hath an Antipathy to the <hi>Whole Sex,</hi>
one would guess from what falls from his
Pen, p. 14. <hi>If women were themselves to frame
the bodies of their children in their wombs, we
should certainly have no perfect children born,</hi>
which perhaps may go down very glib with
his Admirers, but you see he ventures to
border upon Prophaneness and Blasphemy
rather than he will not express his dislike of
the <hi>Female</hi> Order. Whether this be done in
revenge to the Sex, who generally, where
<hi>some body</hi> comes, dub him <hi>the Hard-favour'd
Man,</hi> and sometimes upon occasion make use
of him to <hi>scare their Children,</hi> I will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
Or it may be he that hath been used to
play with the Young Ones, thinks he may
make bold to be rude even with the Mothers.
Else he would not have given them the
odious name of <hi>Munkies,</hi> p. 15, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
have called the House of Office <hi>Madam
Cloacina,</hi> p. 36. This is the cleanly, genteel,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57882:13"/>
and polite language of <hi>Iohn Lock</hi> that writes
himself <hi>Gent.</hi> And this stile and behaviour
are the more strange because they are observ'd
in one that hath been freely admitted to the
Concerns of that Sex.</p>
            <p>I might here harmlesly divert the Reader
with his <hi>Scotchhoppers</hi> and <hi>Dibstones,</hi> p. 115,
237, 275. with his Documents about <hi>Milk-potage</hi>
and <hi>Water-Gruel</hi> p. 18. and his teaching
Children to <hi>evacuate</hi> dextrously, p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33 to p. 38.
Which latter succeeds only when the Party
is present, it being promoted by his <hi>Vespasian</hi>-Looks.
<hi>He hath spent some time,</hi> he saith, <hi>in
the study of Physick,</hi> p. 40, and especially of
the <hi>Guts,</hi> which he very feelingly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly
discourses of p. 34, 35, 36. as if they
were that part of the Body which he most
minds. Which is one reason perhaps why he
hates <hi>Colledg-Commons,</hi> and for their sake the
<hi>Universities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will not make any farther Additions,
because I will not prevent my self in what I
design at an other time, and because what I
have before produced out of his Pages is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to convince us what a Talent of <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
he hath, and how fit a person he is to
have Youth committed to his charge. <hi>He
hath been consulted of late,</hi> he saith, <hi>by many
about the breeding of their children,</hi> Epist. Ded.
but let me request such to <hi>consult</hi> their Reason,
and demand of that to tell them whether a
Rash <hi>Censor</hi> of the Studies and Learning of
our own Academies, whether a Rude Revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of those in the most Honourable Station,
whether a Defamer of Laudable Arts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57882:14"/>
a Supercilious Innovator and a Fantastick
Reformer in the Methods of Teaching, and
lastly whether a Corrupter of our Holy Faith,
and a profess'd Depraver of the Chief Articles
of the Christian Religion (of which I shall
speak anon) be a person fit to be <hi>consulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the breeding of their Children.</hi> The <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>
Parents (and I hope we have some of
them left in England still) will surely be
caution'd by this not to commit them to this
bold Patron of so Bad a Cause, who prides
himself in his <hi>Heterodoxy,</hi> and boasts that he
hath renounced the receiv'd doctrines of the
<hi>Christian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus having in a preliminary way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scanted
on some part of his book concerning
<hi>Education,</hi> that the Reader might thence have
some insight into the Man I was to deal with,
I shall proceed now to take notice of his other
Papers, which relate to <hi>Religion:</hi> for his <hi>New
Education</hi> was in order to the introducing of
a <hi>New Religion.</hi> He had spoken before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Learning in fashion,</hi> and now he
comes to censure <hi>the Religion in fashion,</hi> (as
he calls it) and the <hi>Fashionable</hi> and <hi>Titular
Professors</hi> of it (as he Stiles them, p 93) <hi>i. e.</hi>
the establish'd <hi>Ministers</hi> of it. He had shew'd
his perverse spirit in his Notions about the
breeeding up of <hi>Children:</hi> next he will try
how successful he can be in the perverting of
<hi>Men.</hi> He will see what he can do with
<hi>Grown people,</hi> as well as with his <hi>Young Masters.</hi>
Having taken upon him to reform the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
and Schools, and to cast off their
Studies and Learning, he is encouraged to go
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57882:14"/>
on, and to reform Religion, and to give us a
New Model of Christianity. Accordingly
he publish'd a Treatise entituled <hi>The Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of Christianity,</hi> wherein he pretends
to teach the world what they have been so
long ignorant of, <hi>viz.</hi> that if a man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
a God, there is but <hi>One Article of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Belief</hi> which is necessarily required to be
embraced by him in order to the constituting
him a Christian. As for all other Articles
and Doctrines delivered by Christ and his
Apostles in the Writings of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he pronounces them to be unnecessary
and useless as to the making a man a Christian,
and capacitating for Life and Salvation. This
Novel Conceit, which is an unwarrantable
Restraining and Confining of the Christian
Faith and makes Christianity a far different
thing from what it is represented by our Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Saviour and his Apostles, hath been <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated</hi>
by him once and again. And as I
thought my self obliged to reflect upon his
<hi>First Vindication</hi> in a Discourse which I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ituled <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi>
so now I am designing to attack his <hi>Second
Vindication,</hi> and by exactly setting down his
<hi>own words</hi> (which I shall very faithfully do)
and by impartially examining them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the Unbiass'd Reader of the Vanity,
Weakness and Inconsistency, of the Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Falshood and Dishonesty of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and on the contrary to establish this
Doctrine in mens minds, that <hi>there are More
Articles then One in the Christian Religion
which are the necessary and indispensable matter of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57882:15"/>
our Faith, in order to our being True Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only first let me be permitted to observe
how the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> to bubble the Reader,
insinuates that in my <hi>Socinianism Vnmask'd</hi> I
used <hi>ill language</hi> and <hi>railing;</hi> and again in
the same place (his <hi>Preface</hi>) he complains of
my Stile as <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>scurrilous:</hi> whereas any
impartial Reader may satisfy himself that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
kept my self close to the matter which
was before me, I attended to the Merits of the
Cause, and made no Reflections but what his
way of Discoursing drew from me. I will not
deny that I labour'd to assert the Truth with
that Concern and Earnestness, that Zeal and
Ardour which so Good a Cause deserves. I
don't love to dally with the Grand Articles
of our Religion, for I look upon Languid and
Timerous Assertors of Evangelical Truths
as a sort of Betrayers of them. There is as
much of <hi>Iudas</hi> as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in such persons.
It is one of the most Ominous Defects and
Miscarriages of this Age that such numbers of
men are Faint and Indifferent in matters of
this nature. I thank God I am not of so
Phlegmatick a Mold, I have not so groveling
and dastardly a spirit as tamely to suffer this
Upstart Adversary to shock Religion, and
pervert the Faith, and not to stand up in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it, and to detect his Errors and
Cheats. Therefore I am now treated as his
Mortal <hi>Enemy, because I tell him the Truth,</hi>
and that without timerous mincing of it. It
is this that hath rais'd in him an Angry and
Malicious Ferment, and hath made him rage
and huff, and fill the world with Clamours.

I did so. It is plain that he would suffer no
body to Rail but himself: He is clearly for
the Monopoly of this Trade. He seems to be
of the Humour of him that would let no body
where he was Swear but himself, Let him
then engross the whole Commodity, I'll not
pretend to be a Sharer or Rival with him.
One that hath spent the greatest part of his
time among Nurses and Gossips and the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious
Fry, is not to seek in the Art of

such a one I am ready to give the Precedence,
because I question whether any of the Sister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

            <p>This Thorow-paced Railer flies to <hi>Personal

and the very naming of an <hi>Use of Exhortation,</hi>

               </gap>. he is so Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical,
that he infers I am no Good <hi>Arguer</hi> or

will grant that a Man may be a <hi>Commissioner
for Trade</hi> to the <hi>Barbado's,</hi> and yet be a Good

then why doth he make use of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
If they be, why doth he vilify them?
Good Mr. <hi>Vindicator,</hi> be perswaded to leave
off these Contradictions and Nonsense. But
any discerning man may see that here (as well
as in several other places of his <hi>Vindication,</hi>
and some of his other Writings) his design
was to ridicule the <hi>Sacred Office of Preaching,</hi>
and to blast the whole <hi>Function.</hi> We may
guess what honourable thoughts he hath of it
when he attempts to apply the term <hi>Post,</hi> in
way of a rascally Quibble, to the <hi>Ministry,</hi>
and the <hi>Persons</hi> concern'd in it, p. 422. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his <hi>Bitter Reflections on the Ministers of the
Gospel and their Office,</hi> are deservedly taken
notice of and censured by a late Writer. <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional
Paper,</hi> Num. 1. and Num. 5. Truly
there should be some care taken of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman;
for the very mentioning of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
though it be from his own mouth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
his blood, renews his Frenzy, and makes
him Rave. This poor crazed <hi>Tutor</hi> should be
look'd after, and soundly dosed with Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,
lest in the fits of his over-heated Brain
he should lash out, and revenge himself on the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57882:17"/>
Wainscot of our Pulpits, and with them of
the <hi>Reading Pews,</hi> for the sake of the <hi>Epistles,</hi>
(of which hereafter:) And it is well if our
whole Bibles escape his fury for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>But our Scolding Tutor falls upon me again
p. 30. and now the Topick is <hi>Preferment,</hi> and
<hi>Admission to Preferment in the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
p. 24. It may be this is done to invite
me to take notice of <hi>his Preferments;</hi> and
therefore though he be so rude as to upbraid
me for my want of <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Dignities,</hi> yet I
shall be so Civil to him as to acknowledge
and recount those which he is Master of. I
own him to be <hi>Censor-General</hi> of the <hi>Logick</hi>
and <hi>Latin</hi> of the Universities, <hi>Corrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
and <hi>Regulator</hi> of all the <hi>Publick Schools</hi>
in Christendom, <hi>Great Master</hi> of the <hi>Anti-Academick
Order, Tutor in Eyre</hi> and <hi>Controller</hi>
to the Youth of Seven Counties, <hi>Curator in

to the <hi>Deists Office, Feoffee in Trust</hi> for

I forgot to mention those Offices and Places
before.</p>
            <p>He is at me again, p. 67. and obliquely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates
(for he is full of his Squinting Hints)
that I am for that Maxim, <hi>The Doctrines in
fashion, and likely to procure Preferments, are
alone to be received,</hi> and so would imply that
I am ready to receive any Doctrines in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be they never so Unreasonable or Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and that Gain will tempt me to this or
any thing else. Why, I tell you, Sir, you
are in the wrong box, I am not the man you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57882:17"/>
take me for, I was never hired to write for
the <hi>lowering of Guineas,</hi> I never sought or held
a Place with the forfeiture of my Honesty,
and therefore I defy your Impotent Raillery
not only against me, but against the Whole
<hi>Clergy,</hi> High and Low, for you look upon
them all as Mercenary, and that <hi>they receive
no Doctrines but what are in fashion, and are
likely to procure Preferment.</hi> Which you have
learnt from your Brethren of <hi>Racovia,</hi> who
tell us that the <hi>Church of England men</hi> are or

            <p>Behold the Insolence of our Libertine, who
hath had the sway among Children, and hath
Lord-Mavor'd it over Nurses and Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women!
He hath been so worship'd and obey'd
by the Striplings, and hath had such an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
command of their Legs and Hats, that he
expects the like submission and obeysance
from all others, and he thinks he may say any
thing, and not be opposed, for he cannot
brook Contradiction. But I shall force him
to it, and seeing he hath thought good to Riot
thus with his Pen, he must not think to go
untouch'd. Seeing he hath taken the liberty
to reflect on my Calling and Function (and
therein hath abus'd all of the same Character
with my self) he must not take it ill if I
sometimes glance upon the Post he is in, and
his Studies and Employments. If I follow so
laudable an Example as his, he is oblig'd to
pardon me, and to remember that he was the
Aggressor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57882:18"/>And though indeed we are forbid to <hi>answer</hi>
such people <hi>according to their folly,</hi> yet in some
Circumstances, <hi>i. e.</hi> when <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Conceit,</hi>
and such like Ingredients are mix'd with their
<hi>Folly,</hi> we are permitted by the Wise Man to
<hi>answer them according</hi> to the merits of their
willful and affected <hi>folly, lest they should be wise
in their own conceit,</hi> lest they should be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their Pride and Arrogance, and think
themselves <hi>Wise</hi> because no body checks and
bridles their <hi>folly.</hi> Indeed it is almost a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to a man to encounter such an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
who hath the second time gull'd the
world with false Stories, and abandoning all
shame and ingenuity, given himself up to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
resolves of maintaining a Cause which
will prove to mischievous to <hi>Christendom:</hi> An
Adversary that hath no sense of what he doth,
but is blinded and infatuated by Prejudice, so
that he hath left himself no power to judge
of his own words or actions. Which renders
him a person not fit to be treated with that
respect and deference which are due to an
Ingenuous and Civil Opponent. To use him
Gently, is to handle a Bear with Ceremony
and Caution. And sometimes he is not worth
a <hi>Serious Reply,</hi> for he Cheats the people, and
then makes Sport of it. But however, though
I shall be somewhat free with him, yet I will
not thrust upon the Reader any thing that is
indecent, rude, spiteful, or entrenching upon
Truth. When we deal with such men, our
<hi>Master</hi>'s Example forbids us to <hi>revile again,</hi>
but the Apostle allows us, nay commands us
to <hi>rebuke them sharply;</hi> I shall not be thought
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57882:18"/>
perhaps to be defective in this, but none can
censure me for Excess if they consider what
the Badness of his design (as well as the Petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy
of his Stile) required. But where he
gives me any scope for <hi>Arguing</hi> and <hi>Reasoning</hi>
the case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have with great seriousness applied
my self to it, and I hope I have establish'd the
Truth upon firm and solid grounds.</p>
            <p>I will begin with his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
where he inserts a very Gracious <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
to Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> his late <hi>Convert,</hi> and now
<hi>Confederate,</hi> and there pretends to tell him the
<hi>Birth</hi> of his <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity.</hi> It
was begot (if you will believe the Father of
it) on <hi>the Controversy of Iustification:</hi> He
might have as well have said on the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
of <hi>Predestination:</hi> for it as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to one as the other: And so you see it
was a mere <hi>By blow,</hi> and worthy of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
But he is extremely fond of this Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Issue, and applauds himself for being
the Author of it. <hi>The first view I had of it,</hi>
saith he, <hi>seem'd mightily to satisfy my mind.
I wonder that every body did not see and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, though Systems of Divinity said nothing
of it. I was pleas'd,</hi> saith our <hi>Narcissus, with
the growing discovery, every day, whilest I was
employ'd in this search.</hi> And more to the same
purpose in the same Epistle. Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to applaud the <hi>Godfather</hi> of this Brat
Mr. <hi>Bold.</hi> Concerning whom he declares,
that <hi>he hath more readily entertain'd, and more
easily enter'd into the meaning of his Book than
most</hi> (he might have said <hi>any) he hath heard
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57882:19"/>
speak of it.</hi> And afterwards, <hi>Mr.</hi> Bold <hi>hath
enter'd into the true sense of my Treatise, and his
notions perfectly agree with mine.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he must needs be (as he stiles him) a
<hi>Calm Christian,</hi> a <hi>Grave Divine,</hi> a <hi>Man of
Parts,</hi> a <hi>Well-bred Man.</hi> And <hi>he hath</hi> (if
you'll credit our Encomiast) <hi>a settled repute,</hi>
&amp;c. Would you know the reason of all this
Coaksing? It is no other than this, that same
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> who was <hi>Sponsor</hi> for the Bastard
brood, had in a late Pamphlet mightily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd
the Dad of it, Mr. <hi>Lock.</hi> He calls him
the <hi>Ingenious Author</hi> of the <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> Rep p. 3. and <hi>that great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Person,</hi> p. 27. (It is a sign so when one
of so <hi>little</hi> sense and discretion votes him to
be such.) He is <hi>no Disparagement to the Cause,</hi>
he saith, p 27. and there is a good reason for
it, I must tell him, for as a Person, so a Cause
that hath nothing of worth in it, is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being disparaged: Poor Creature, he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hinks it a great matter to have One Pen (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his own) wagging on his side. He is
mightily rejoyc'd that he hath got a <hi>Single Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi>
for his <hi>Single Article,</hi> and is over joy'd at
such Fulsom Encomiums thrown upon him,
and therefore he heaps up as many as he can
on the other's head. The sum of all which is
this, CLAW ME, AND I WILL CLAW
THEE.</p>
            <p>It is worth the observing that the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
subscribes himself at the close of his <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> (which in a conceited manner
he claps into the <hi>Preface</hi>) his <hi>most humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
A. B.</hi> Upon which these short Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57882:19"/>
may be made, 1. That he is ashamed
of his <hi>Name,</hi> and that with good reason. 2.
He is ashamed of his <hi>Cause</hi> and dares not
Personally own it, and set his Name to the
defence of it. This and the former may be
reckon'd as the only Instances of <hi>Shamefaced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Modesty,</hi> that the man was ever guilty
of. But 3. We may gather from those two
letters which he hath affixed to the end of his
Epistle <hi>Who</hi> he is, for though he hath only set
down A. B. yet he hath left us to add the
next letter C, and then we know what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is meant, <hi>viz.</hi> a Breeder up of Boys to
learn their First Rudiments, a Learned Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of A B C. concerning which you may find
more p. 272, 273. <hi>Educat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Epistle</hi> I pass to the
Book it self, the first part of which is spent
in the old known way of <hi>Malefactors</hi> at the
Bar: they are always willing to evade the
<hi>Charge,</hi> to insist upon the little Niceties, and
on the Formality of words, and the Exact
Punctilio's of Matter of Fact. This is the
practise of our Criminal, p. 6, 7. and he
thinks thereby to palliate his Guilt. He is
loth to own it, for he knows his demerit, and
the Consequence of it. He is to be excus'd
indeed for this, or rather there is a known
<hi>Proverb</hi> that excuses him: that makes him so
backward to <hi>Confess.</hi> I have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this matter in my <hi>Socinianism Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd</hi>
p. 5, 6. and have also shew'd since that
the Formal Words are agreed to by his late
Proselite. So that his own Gizzard, Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57882:20"/>
comes in Evidence against him, and lets us
know that we have no reason to listen to him
when he waves the Enditement. He will
say and unsay, as it comes into his head, and
will put the Reader off with any shuffling sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,
merely to evade what I had justly
lay'd to his charge. One of his great Cavils
is that <hi>I alledge matter of fact, but do not justify
the Allegation,</hi> p 2 and 7. and undertakes to
prove it from <hi>my pretending</hi> (as he saith) <hi>to
know and deliver his thoughts,</hi> p. 8. <hi>This</hi> (saith
he there) <hi>is an Instance of False Allegations in
matters of Fact, and such as are not capable of a
Negative proof.</hi> Such poor, little, trifling
stuff doth he obtrude upon the Reader; as if
one that had read his Writings could not in a
probable way tell what his <hi>thoughts</hi> of such a
subject were; unless you will say he dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
when he wrote, and this perhaps is it
which he means when he saith there concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, that <hi>that I affirm what I do not know.</hi>
And so you see what he hath got by caviling
against what I alledged, he hath before he
was aware let the world know that he believes
not what he writes, that his Thoughts and his
Pen hold no correspondence, that when he
pleads for <hi>One Article only,</hi> he doth not think
that there is but One, but however he designs
to root out All by reducing all the Articles
of Christianity to One. Who would attend
to any of his <hi>Objections,</hi> when it is plain that
it is not his business to search out Truth, but
to betray it?</p>
            <p>He hath nothing to say to what I replied to
his former <hi>Vindication,</hi> and therefore now to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57882:20"/>
cheat the world, and amuse the Reader, and
to give farther proof of his daring Confidences,
he bids me p. 9, 25, 72, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> go to work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
1. to prove that there are these words
in his Reasonableness of Christianity, <hi>viz.</hi>
that <hi>Nothing is required to be believed by a
Christian, as absolutely necessary to make him such,
but this Proposition, Iesus is the Messias:</hi> 2. to
prove that <hi>he set himself on purpose to find but one
Article of Faith:</hi> 3. to prove that <hi>he contends
for One Article of Faith with exclusion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of all the rest:</hi> 4 to prove that <hi>the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Iesus to be the Messias is not the only Article
sufficient to make a man a Christian.</hi> And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other things he calls upon me to prove,
and the silly Accountant <hi>scores</hi> them up as he
goes along, and sets down the <hi>Figures.</hi> And
he would not have left off where he doth,
but that the Innocent had number'd as far as
he could go. There is not one Particular he
mentions, which I have not proved and evinc'd
in my <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd:</hi> and therefore I
scorn, at the motion of such a Whiffling Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector,
such a Crude Repeater of what he had
said before in his <hi>First Vindication,</hi> but now
hath lately vamp'd up, and sent abroad again,
I scorn (I say) to produce the same Proofs
again, and to affront the Reader with Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Repetitions, which is the guise of this
trifling Writer.</p>
            <p>But seeing our <hi>A B C darian</hi> calls to me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and over again <hi>to prove this,</hi> and <hi>to prove
that,</hi> I will now put <hi>him</hi> upon <hi>Proving,</hi> and
see how he will discharge that part. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this I am to acquaint the Reader that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57882:21"/>
this Gentleman in his <hi>Former Vindication</hi> call'd
for a <hi>List of Fundamental Articles,</hi> i. e. such as
the Holy Scripture represents to us as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to be known and believ'd, that we may
be True Christians. I obey'd the demands of
this pert <hi>Vindicator,</hi> and perform'd the Task
which he was pleas'd to set me: in my first
Chapter of my forenamed Treatise I assign'd
a considerable number of Articles of the
Christian Faith, as absolutely necessary to
be known, <hi>i. e.</hi> so far as they can be known,
for there are Great and Profound <hi>Mysteries</hi>
couch'd in some of them, so that I had reason
to say they were in <hi>some measure</hi> (which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
the <hi>Vindicator</hi> vainly objects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
p. 70.) to be known and understood,
and to be believ'd: and I particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
proved that all of them are of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and consequently no man can be a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
without a competent knowledge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of these Doctrines. I also there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
a <hi>General Rule</hi> whereby all such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
and Doctrines may be discern'd; <hi>i. e.</hi>
they may be known to be such from the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of the things contained in them, for no
Evangelical Truths are absolutely and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably
necessary to be known and to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to in order to the constituting of us
Christians but those that <hi>have Immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Occasion, Author, Way, Means, and
Issue of Mans Redemption and Salvation.</hi> But
our Vindicator attempts not in the least to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate
this Description of <hi>Necessary Articles;</hi>
nay though he mentions it again p. 130. yet he
can't invent any thing to object against it, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57882:21"/>
asks this and the other <hi>Question</hi> nothing
to the purpose. Our bold Reformer in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
scribles on, and shews not himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to disprove what I propounded and
asserted. No: he doth not so much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to it. But he quarrels and shuffles, and
makes a long Harangue about the Set Number
of Fundamental Articles, and enquires p. 69.
whether there be neither <hi>more nor less</hi> then I
have assign'd. Which is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for Christianity consists not, as this
Narrow soul'd Man would suggest, in a Point.
If <hi>he</hi> will make it his business to score them up,
so let him; it is none of mine.</p>
            <p>I have assign'd several Articles of Necessary
Belief, I have particularly Enumerated such
Doctrines as have all the Marks of being <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental.</hi>
Let him prove that they have not
those Marks, or let him take what course he
pleases to prove that they are not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Truths, and such as ought to be known and
asserted to in order to make us Christians: and
when he hath done this particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
I will be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> leisure to tell him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I think there be any more that belong to
the Foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have done my part, I have
proved that <hi>more then One Article</hi> is absolutely
requisite to make a man a Christian, and yet
he is still craving, and <hi>calls</hi> to me, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi>
and <hi>requires,</hi> and <hi>challenges</hi> me to
prove this and that, and yet will not prove
any thing himself. This is a Mad way of
Writing, to boast still of his <hi>One Article,</hi> and
yet not shew that any one of these Articles
which I nam'd ought not to be added to it.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57882:22"/>
This is the business he should have undertaken,
and therefore for the future I expect that he
either allows of those <hi>Articles</hi> as Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
or else particularly shew that they are not.
Pray set your self to this work, and prove
(if you can) that all those Articles which I
have mention'd are not necessary to be believ'd,
to make men Christians: and by that time you
have done this, I shall find you fresh employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which will hinder a mans jaunting to my
<hi>Young Masters</hi> houses, and his going a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>And the Justice and Fairness of my dealing
with him will appear from this, that I hold
him to his own Rule: <hi>The Rule of Fair Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi>
saith he, <hi>is to prove where any thing is
denied: to Evade this is shu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing.</hi> p 451. He
stiffly <hi>denies</hi> that those Propositions which I
assign'd are necessary to be believ'd, for the
constituting a man a Christian: I call upon
him to <hi>prove</hi> it, I have made it evident that
they are all of them Fundamental Articles,
but he will not own them to be such: then I
say, Prove the contrary. I <hi>expect</hi> this of you,
I <hi>demand</hi> and <hi>require</hi> it of you, and <hi>will insist
upon it</hi> (to use your own peremptory stile.)
Your Talk is this, to prove that those doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of the Gospel which I enumerated are
not as necessary to be known and believ'd, to
constitute a man a Christian, as that One Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
which they have nam'd. And when you
have tried what you can do towards a proof
of this, I'll tell you then what I have more to
say to you. But you see I put you upon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
your <hi>own Rule,</hi> and if you do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57882:22"/>
it, you are by your own sentence a
<hi>Shuffler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is observable that this Long-winded
Rambler hath spent above 20 pages (viz. from
p. 48, to p. 71.) in <hi>Little Queries, Evasions,
Shiftings,</hi> Wranglings about words, and yet
with pretences of great <hi>Seriousness.</hi> But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
he is for his <hi>Queries,</hi> he is every
where <hi>Asking,</hi> he hath <hi>more and more Questions</hi>
to put, which verifies a good <hi>Antient Saying</hi>
which we have concerning such a <hi>Foolish</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
as he hath shew'd himself to be. This
strange Impertinent humour abounds so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
in him that one would be curious to
enquire what is the source of it, whence it is
that throughout all these Papers he is ever
starting of idle trifling <hi>Questions.</hi> I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
it into nothing but this, that one whose
Converse hath been always with <hi>Children</hi>
must needs assimilate and ape them, for (as he
observes himself, <hi>Educat.</hi> p. 220) they are
mightily given to this way of <hi>asking of Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
and yet this <hi>Pedantick Tutour</hi> justifies this
childish folly in himself of acting thus, p. 54,

            <p>Well seeing he is such an Intemperate and
Lavish <hi>Asker,</hi> I hope he will not deny me the
liberty of asking him only three or four <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
and I conceive I have as much Authority
to demand an <hi>Answer</hi> as he.</p>
            <p>I. Why doth he pretend sometimes to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
more Articles then one, whereas at other
times he peremptorily contends but for
One, which he calls the <hi>Sole Article</hi> and
the <hi>Only Article?</hi> In two or three other
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57882:23"/>
places he talks of collecting <hi>several Articles,</hi>
but how is that consistent with <hi>One?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that Account of Faith which he offers
to the world he thus speaks p. 232. <hi>No one
Article which the Apostles proposed as necessary
to be receiv'd by unbelievers to make them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
is ommitted in it.</hi> When he saith, <hi>no
one Article is omitted,</hi> it is implied that there
are more Articles then one. If there be <hi>More,</hi>
I demand of him to set down just how many
they are, seeing he demands the like of me.
But with all let him tell the world whether he
talks thus as one that is Crazed, and knows
not whether <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Many</hi> Articles be the
same, or whether his speaking thus be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
to his Recanting his former Doctrine.
Here are several Lesser Questions in the Great
one that I propounded: let us have his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to them all.</p>
            <p>II. What is the Reason that he hath not all
this while undertaken to disprove that <hi>Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of Fundamental Arrticles which I asserted?
Why neither in his <hi>First</hi> nor <hi>Second Vindication</hi>
hath he dared to shew that those Articles are
not to be believ'd in order to the denominating
a man a True Christian, and a Member of
Christ? If he could have done it, no body can
doubt but that he would, and that with
mickle Confidence, for no one will suspect
that it is the want of that that hinders him
from such an enterprize. This Judicious Player
at <hi>Dibstones</hi> finds fault with my Collection of
Fundamentals, and yet meddles with <hi>no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
one</hi> of them: only is so senseless and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
as to deny them to be Fundamental
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57882:23"/>
Doctrines of Christanity, and such as are
necessarily to be received by every one that
lays claim to Christianity. I demand a Reason
of this, I require a particular and full Account
why every one of those Articles is not to be
receiv'd as Fundamental. I shall insist upon it
till he either assigns some Reason, or confesses
he cannot.</p>
            <p>III. How can he expect that I should comply
with <hi>his</hi> demands, which are very numerous,
and particularly with that of assigning a Set
Collection of Fundamentals, when he hath
told me already that he is resolved (like a
<hi>Well bred man</hi> and a <hi>Good Christian of one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>)
to slight whatever I shall offer to him?
If I should propound such doctrines as I verily
believe to be Fundamentals, he before hand
asks <hi>why he should take them from me rather then
from an Anabaptist?</hi> p. 52. And in the same
place he saith <hi>he hath as much reason to believe
an Anabaptist or Quaker, &amp;c. as me.</hi> Which is
as much as to tell me in express terms that he
hath taken up a resolution to attend to no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith that I shall propound. Where
were the Thoughts of our <hi>Pilgrim Tutour</hi>
when his unwary tongue dropt such words as
these? Even when he is soliciting me, yea
challenging me to give him <hi>a List of Articles,</hi>
he proclaims to the world that he will not
accept of any of them: he declares that he
would sooner take a Set of Articles, and
Fundamentals from a <hi>Socinian</hi> or a <hi>Papist</hi> (for
he particularly names them both on this very
occasion, than from me, p. 52. And, Sir, we
will believe you without swearing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:57882:24"/>IV. An other Question I shall put to you,
and require an Answer to it. Seeing you have
taken part with the Follower of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and
have adopted several of their Notions and
Tenents, and interpret some Scriptures which
relate to the <hi>Trinity</hi> in the same way that they
do, and thereby have given occasion to be
thought one of the Party, and yet you pretend
to disown all acquaintance with them p. 222,
223. seeing you appear thus with a double
face, and amuse the world with these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises,
I require of you to return an Answer
to this Query, and the several parts of it,
Whether you verily believe that <hi>Iesus</hi> is so the
<hi>Son of God</hi> that he is really <hi>God,</hi> and that in
the Unity of the Divine Essence there is a
Trinity of Distinct Persons or Subsistencies,
that the Father is God, the Son is God, and
the Holy Ghost is God, and that these Three
are One God, as the Scriptures plainly and
expresly declares. Seeing you are so brisk
in <hi>your demands,</hi> I expect a positive <hi>Answer</hi> to
<hi>mine,</hi> and <hi>hereby shall we know whether you are
a True Man,</hi> or a <hi>Spie.</hi> When I see you have
performed this work, I will still find you more
employment.</p>

2.) that his Opinion of <hi>One Article</hi> was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
among other things, upon this Notion,
that all things in Christanity must be so plain
that they may be easily comprehended, and
that there may be nothing difficult to mens
understandings. This I made clear from the
tenour and coherence of his words, from his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of reasoning, from the scope of his book,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57882:24"/>
and from the plain sense of his expressions.
But our <hi>Vindicator</hi> cannot bear this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
puts himself into a posture of shifting and
evading whatever was brought against him,
and by all imaginable arts he labours to stifle
my Reasonings and Arguings on that Point.
One of his knacks is to frame a <hi>Dialogue</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and him, p. 34, 35, 36. and he is
so silly in the contriving of it that it baffles him
instead of favouring his Cause. Fearing that
the <hi>Dialogue</hi> would not do the feat, he appears
in the shape of a <hi>Syllogizer</hi> p. 39. though the
Inconsiderate Man had derided <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism,</hi>
because they are <hi>University-Learning.</hi>
The next he falls into the old trade of <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Where?</hi> and <hi>When?</hi> and after this is done
he begins his <hi>Dialogue</hi> again. This is one of
the Distracted Scenes of his <hi>Vindication,</hi> and
the Reader may thence form an <hi>idea</hi> of the
Whole Work, and see with amazement what
little Knacks and Conceits he applies himself
to, that he may juggle men out of the Truth.
He hath so accustom'd himself to shewing of
Tricks among his Young Frie whom he hath
had the Tutorage of, that we must never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

handles.</p>
            <p>P. 93, 94. he will not admit of any <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
in Christianity, and therefore opposes
what I had asserted, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>there are some
Doctrines in the Gospel which are not plain and
clear, and yet are of necessity to be believ'd.</hi> If
he had been Master of any Sincerity, he would
have observ'd how I explain'd my self, and
shew'd that all the Doctrines and Articles of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57882:25"/>
the Christian Religion are not alike: some of
them are in themselves Evident and Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
others because of the Transcendency of
their Matter are Obscure and Mysterious, and
not level to our humane understandings, as the
doctrine of the Holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> Christ's <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
&amp;c. but yet are believ'd with a firm
and unshaken Faith. This is so Rational that
none but the hood wink'd <hi>Masker</hi> would have
excepted against it. And he doth it after a
very poor rate: He nibbles at the distinction
I make between the <hi>Certainty</hi> or <hi>Reality</hi> of
some Evangelical Doctrines, and <hi>the exact
manner of the things themselves</hi> contain'd in
those Doctrines: But he fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>However, like the Gentlemen of <hi>Racovia,</hi>
he cannot endure to hear of <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and therefore here he takes occasion
to express his great dislike of those who assert
that in the Christian Religion there are <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>
properly so called, <hi>i. e.</hi> such Truths
and Articles, that as to the Manner of the
things contained in them are not Intelligible,
but exceed humane Reason, and cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be fathom'd by it. The denying of this

Learned Writer (though one of the chiefest
and most Eminent of the <hi>Pulpit Orators</hi>) hath
lately proved against him. Then, that his
Sentiments might prevail, he prescribes a new
way of <hi>Bringing up of Youth,</hi> and seasoning
them betimes in some <hi>Private Nurseries</hi> with
such Principles as he and his Associates shall
dictate; and accordingly all <hi>Publick Schools</hi>
and <hi>Universities,</hi> and their Studies are cried
down by him. Next, there comes forth <hi>a
New Plat form of Religion,</hi> all the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Articles and Doctrines of Christianity are
discarded by him, excepting <hi>One</hi> bare single
Article, which he thinks fit to retain till he
hath a fair opportunity of throwing that off
too. Then he further advances, and every
where very warmly inveighs against <hi>Ministers</hi>
and <hi>Preachers,</hi> partly because of their <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity-Learning,</hi>
but chiefly because they oppose
his groundless notion of <hi>One Article,</hi> and assert
the Fundamentals of Christianity. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to compleat his design, he strikes in with
the <hi>Deists</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> and laughs at the
<hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Christian Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
encourages men to cast off all <hi>Reveal'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
the greatest part of which consists of
Profound and Inexplicable <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and such
as Humane Reason neither found out, nor can
comprehend when reveal'd. These are the
Ways and Methods he hath applyed himself
to, in order to the undermining of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Faith.</p>
            <p>Here I will observe to the Reader how
profoundly skill'd in <hi>Greek</hi> our <hi>University Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
is: He brings in these words (though alien

translated to his hand in our English Bible,

doth not much meddle with the <hi>Epistles</hi> (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s) as we shall hear afterwards.
He thinks, good man, that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is a Verb

indeed that he despairs of <hi>setting up for

in <hi>Criticism and Grammar</hi> we may refer <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnetus,</hi>
a new Name for a <hi>Dictator</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
p. 356. of his <hi>Education.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He plays upon the Sacred Names <hi>Iesus</hi> and
<hi>Messias</hi> p. 107. and would perswade the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to believe that he ought no more attend
to the meaning of the word <hi>Iesus</hi> and the
word <hi>Messias</hi> when the Proposition, <hi>Iesus is
the Messias,</hi> is tender'd to him to believe, than
to the Signification of the Name <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi>
or any other Name whatsoever. But
what is the reason then, I ask the <hi>Vindicator</hi>
why these Names <hi>Iesus</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> (which
latter is the <hi>Greek</hi> for <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssias</hi>) are so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and distinctly explained, and descanted
upon by those Learned and Pious Writers who
have commented upon the <hi>Apostle's Creed?</hi> We
see they spend a considerable time in giving
the true and full Import of these Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
There is mentioned a Man in the same
Creed, under whom our Saviour suffered,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57882:26"/>
but we do not find that his double <hi>Name</hi> is
searched into and sisted by Expositors as those
Blessed Names <hi>Iesus</hi> and <hi>Messias</hi> are. And
the reason is plain, because Christian men are
concerned to know the true meaning and
Sense of <hi>these Titles,</hi> or else they can't know
who it was that was <hi>born, suffered,</hi> and <hi>died</hi>
for them. In the very <hi>Names</hi> themselves
there is included the Nature of this Divine
and Extraordinary Person, and therefore it
was fit that they should not be ignorant of
this. But it is not so with other Names,
they need not any such Explaining and Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
as for example <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> and <hi>Iohn
Lock</hi> are well known to be such Persons,
though the Extraction of the <hi>Names</hi> be not
explained. I hope our Captious and Ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous
<hi>Vindicator</hi> will consider this, and not
ridiculously and impiously undervalue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base
the Names of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them with those of <hi>King Saul</hi> and <hi>Prince
Arthur,</hi> and tell us (as he doth afterwards
<hi>p.</hi> 108.) that this Proposition <hi>Iesus is the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
needs no more Explication than this, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus

subjoyns <hi>p.</hi> 109, 110. that I own the Easiness
of the foresaid Proposition, the <hi>Masker</hi>'s Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is clouded, or else he would not

for any one may see that I intended them to

These are the Contents of that Part of my

this be the <hi>Pulpit-Oratory.</hi> That the Creature

of Nonsense, and the plainest proof of Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
that he could have divulg'd to the world:

<hi>Prophane Spite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I objected to him <hi>his Contempt of the
Epistolary Writings of the Apostles,</hi> which I
evinc'd from his <hi>passing them by</hi> and wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
to gather any Articles of Faith out of
them, he replies, in way of Recrimination,
that I <hi>have pass'd by several Chapters and Verses
in my C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ction of Articles,</hi> and thence infers
my <hi>Contempt</hi> of them, p. 122. It is to be
hoped there are but few men in the world
whose brains are thus disorder'd. Could any
one but this shallow <hi>Vindicator</hi> think that I
should collect the Fundamental Articles of
Christanity out of all the Chapters and Verses
of the New Testament? Or, if I did not so,
and mentioned not some of them, that this was
any Argument of my despising those Writings?
Could any but this poor Dandler of Infants
imagine that there is a parity between these
two, <hi>viz.</hi> my collecting of the Fundamental
Articles out of the <hi>Gospels, Acts,</hi> and <hi>Epistles,</hi>
and his presenting of us with one Article only
out of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Acts,</hi> without so
much as taking notice of the <hi>Apostolical Epistles?</hi>
Could any but this Weak Arguer infer from

               </gap>r and verse in
the New Testament that this is the same with
omitting all the <hi>Epistles?</hi> Could any one that
hath not the like Hardened Front with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
publish to the world that this is a sign of
my <hi>Contemning</hi> the Scriptures? and then upon
this occasion he hath the vanity to vent a silly
paultry Quibble upon <hi>passing by,</hi> which none
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57882:28"/>
but such an abhor'd <hi>Pedant</hi> would stain his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with.</p>
            <p>Then, as if he had discarded all Truth, and
feared his Conscience with a hot iron, he hath
the face to utter such words as these <hi>viz,</hi>
that <hi>I, though a Minister of the Gospel, cannot
bear the Texts of Scripture which he hath produced,
nor his quotations out of the four Evangelists,</hi> p. 152.
whereas any one that pursues what I have writt
may see that I only objected against his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
as not being a Compleat Collection,
and because in several places he distorted the
Evanelists words. Yet according to his
never-failing art of Falsifying he represents
me as one that vilifies the Four Evangelists.
Such another daring Falshood is that, that <hi>I
think the Gospel, the Good News of Salvation,
tedious from the mouth of our Saviour and his
Apostles,</hi> p. 126. For which apparent forgery
I claim the forfeiture of his Ears, if he hath
not (as he hath deserv'd) lost them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And from this you may gather what
Sincerity there is in his objecting to me that <hi>I
make bold with Truth,</hi> and that what I say <hi>is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
false</hi> p. 403. you must not credit one word
of it, for once a Forger, and always so. This is
his master piece of Art to cheat and abuse the
world with downright Falsities, and to betray
Christanity, and yet whilst he is doing this to
accuse others of being False.</p>
            <p>He <hi>grants</hi> p. 127 what I had urged about <hi>the
Four Gospels being writ to and for Believers, as
well as Unbelievers,</hi> and yet immediately after
he revokes his Grant, and sophistically shifts it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57882:28"/>
off, so that no man alive knows where to
have the Gentleman.</p>
            <p>But it is worth our remarking that it hath
pleased God to leave this Man to his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuations,
and to suffer him to produce and
insist upon a protion of Scripture which is an

p. 125. He quotes a great part of the fifth
chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to prove that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

the Apostle in chap. 6. v. 1. particuarly sets
down these <hi>Principles of the doctrine of Christ,</hi>
(as he also stiles them.) Who but this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate

infer (as he strenuously doth) that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
<hi>Epistles,</hi> and this especially, were
not written to teach men the Fundamental

the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that <hi>they have need to be taught
again the First Principles of the Oracles of God,
and of the doctrine of Christ,</hi> and accordingly
the Apostle distinctly tells them what some
of these Principles are, then neither this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
nor any other Epistles of the Apostles
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57882:29"/>
distinctly shew what were those doctrines,
which were absolutely necessary to make
men Christians (I use the Logitian's own
words):</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it is plainly expressed in the Epistle
to the</hi> Hebrews <hi>that</hi> they have need to be

accordingly the Apostle distinctly tells them
what some of those Principles are:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither this Epistle nor any other
Epistles of the Apostles distinctly shew what
were those doctrines which were absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to make a Man a Christian.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Or more briefly he argues thus, <q>This and
other Epistles tell us what are the Necessary
Principles of Christianity; Ergo, they do
not tell us.</q>
            </p>

such Wild Reasonings argue a flaw in his
Skull that uses them. Is this the <hi>Thoughtful</hi>
man? A Creature that goes on all four, if it
could speak, would talk much better Sense.
Here is such a Heap of Contradictions, and
such Impiety in citing the Holy Text to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
them, that I question not but the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reader will hence form such thoughts
of this Gentleman as his great merits require.</p>
            <p>But surely in his next quotations out of an
<hi>Epistle</hi> (though it be a part of Scripture
which he so much dreads) he will take care
to speak tolerable sense, and not to abuse the
Sacred Writ in this palpable manner. Let us
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57882:29"/>
see then how it is with him in his Citation
out of the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> In
order to prove his former wild Conceit, that
the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the Apostles are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
for Fundamentals of Christianity, he
alledges chap. 3. v. 2. <hi>I have fed you with milk,
and not with meat, for hitherto ye were not able
to bear it: neither yet are ye able.</hi> The plain
meaning of which words without doubt is
this, that the Apostle had hitherto taught
them, and continued still to teach them the
Necessary and Indispensable Doctrines of
Christianity, such as were as needful for them
as <hi>Milk</hi> for babes. Because they were not
able to bear any heavy Superstructure, he
made it his chief business to <hi>lay the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and this <hi>Foundation</hi> is <hi>Iesus Christ, v.</hi> 10, 11.
The plain way of Salvation by this JESUS
the Son of God, the Plain and Easy Articles
of the Christian Faith (all of them Plain as
to the Truth and Certainty of them, though
some of them not Plain as to the manner of
the things comprehended in those Articles)
these plain and simple Truths (which are as
Pure and Unsophisticated as <hi>Milk,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are so termed here) are those Doctrines
which the Apostle taught the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
And now then let us see how this Man of
Logick argues from the Apostle's words; and
to give you the better light into his excellent
way of Arguing, we will present it in Mode
and Figure, for Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> saith he,
bid his Adversary <hi>write nothing but Syllogisms,</hi>
p. 228. and besides we find that Good Mr.
<hi>Bold</hi> is for <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> p. 4. of his <hi>Reply:</hi> So
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57882:30"/>
that upon these Weighty Authorities we must
betake our selves to this way of Disputing.
Thus then he argues,</p>
            <q>
               <p>If the Apostle <hi>fed the Corinthians with
milk,</hi> i. e. taught them the Plain and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles of Christianity, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
such in his <hi>Epistles</hi> to them, then we
are not to think that any Fundamental and
Necessary Articles of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
such as are to be received to make a
man a Christian, are to be found in this or
any other of the Epistles:</p>
               <p>But the Apostle <hi>fed the Corinthians with
milk,</hi> i. e. taught them the Plain and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles of Christianity, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
such in his Epistles to them:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are not to think that any Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
and Necessary Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, such as are to be received to
make a man a Christian, are to be found in
this, or any other of the Epistles.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Risum teneatis?</hi> If the <hi>Vindicator</hi> can clear
this from Nonsense, I promise him that the
Reader and I will leave off laughing at him
for his cashiering of <hi>Burgersdicius.</hi> But in the
mean time we see the reason why this <hi>Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Innovator</hi> is so zealous against <hi>Logick,</hi>
and <hi>University-Learning.</hi> He trembles at the
thoughts of Strict Sense and Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these make against him: Yea, he makes
the Blessed Apostle contradict himself, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to contradict me.</p>
            <p>And I would further remark, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after he had quoted those foresaid words
of the Apostle, he adds, THEREFORE <hi>very
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57882:30"/>
little is said in this Epistle for explaining any part
of the Great Mystery of Salvation</hi> (and yet
before he was against all <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity)
<hi>contain'd in the Gospel,</hi> p. 131. And
presently after, <hi>The same holds in all the other
Epistles, and</hi> THEREFORE <hi>the Epistles seem'd
not to me to be the properest part of Scripture</hi> (he
said before they were not at all <hi>proper) to give
us the Foundation,</hi> p. 132. He complains of a
<hi>therefore</hi> of mine, where there is no cause at
all for it, p. III. but here is such a pair of
<hi>Therefores</hi> as never was heard of in any Age,
and be sure never will be, unless it be in his
Writings. It was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way to instruct
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the plain Principles of
Christianity, he took care to settle them in the
Foundation, seeing they were not fit at that
time for any considerable Superstructure, and
<hi>therefore</hi> (saith our <hi>Vindicator</hi>) we must not
expect to meet with any such Principles in
this Epstle, or in any others. There are several
people in that Great Brick House he wots of
at the lower end of <hi>Moorfields,</hi> that never bid
for that place by talking so ravingly. Whether
the <hi>Childrens</hi> Crying and Bawling, or the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Unkindnesses</hi> to him have put him into these
disorders, I shall not determine, but the poor
Animal is certainly much shatter'd, and 'tis to be
fear'd belongs to the Hospital of the <hi>Incurable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he proceeds, p. 138, 139. to mention
my taking notice of his feigned ground of
<hi>Writing the Epistles,</hi> viz. because <hi>the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles are mix'd here with other Truths.</hi>
But having nothing to rejoyn, he falls to <hi>Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
a fault which he imputes to me, but is
peculiar to himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:57882:31"/>And as for what I said of <hi>Mixture,</hi> that
those things which are promicuously put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
are capable of being <hi>distinguish'd</hi> (which
he boggles at) there is an Example of it in
one he knows very well; a <hi>Committee man</hi>
and a <hi>Vindicator</hi> are mix'd together, but there
is a possibility of <hi>distinguishing,</hi> yea of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
the former from the latter, the Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
from the Vile; though 'tis true some
things are so <hi>mix'd</hi> in some persons that they
will never admit of a separation, as a <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Quack</hi>
and an <hi>Abhorrer of Universities;</hi> or
thus, an <hi>Innovator</hi> and a <hi>Creed-Hater.</hi> There
is no parting of these. In the same place he
thinks it Witty to reflect twice on my <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
in the University, as if B. D. were as
Contemptible as A B C, which is his own
Character.</p>
            <p>He jogs on still p. 140, 141, &amp;c. sometimes
coyning matter, and fastning it upon me,
sometimes impertinently asking of <hi>Questions,</hi>
and requiring <hi>Answers,</hi> and every where fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into ridiculous Impertinencies, and weak
reasonings: And what else could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from a Man that had all his days been us'd
to the Tattle of Brats and Nurslings, and
hath thereby perfectly learn'd all their humors,
especially (as I observ'd before) their imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Queries, and troublesome Babblings?
Thus our Old <hi>Tutour</hi> is twice a Child, though
he doats so extremely that he can't see it, but
verily perswades himself that all he hath writ
against me is Strong and Nervous, and, like
what he dictates to his <hi>Young Masters,</hi> must
not be examin'd and censured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:57882:31"/>Only here it is to be noted, that what he
saith p. 145. concerning <hi>Popular Haranguing,</hi>
is a saucy Reflection on the Chiefest and most
Eminent of the <hi>Clergy of our Church,</hi> whose
constant employment hath been that which
he contemptuously calls <hi>Popular Haranguing,</hi>
and in other places <hi>Pulpit-Oratory,</hi> i. e. Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Such is his Spleen against this Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Institution, and the Ministers of it, though
he makes a shew of being a <hi>Christian.</hi> But
he that will bespatter the Universities, and
Academick Learning, and expunge the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Articles of Religion out of the Bible, will
not stop at any thing.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Penny-Post</hi> is upon the hoof still,
p. 146, 147, &amp;c. and his Quill is as Itinerant
as himself, and like its Owner, fixes no where,
hath no Habitation. Sometimes he quotes
what I have said, and misinterprets it, at other
times, to fill up his book, and to make it
bulky, he gives you large shivers out of his
own Writings, for he thinks none are so good
as they, and that's the reason he never quotes
an Author, unless it be to disparage him. He
trifles to a prodigy, and according to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Method, he never fails at the close of a
Paragraph to wind up all with <hi>Railing,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-tongue.</p>
            <p>But wondrous it is to see what work he
makes p. 156. where the Reader will be puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel'd
to tell whether his Falshood or his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be greater: He complains that I call
him a <hi>Betrayer of Christianity and a Contemner
of the Epistles, because he did not out of them
name [Satisfaction:]</hi> Whereas the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>der
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57882:32"/>
will find, if he thinks fit to consult my <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism
Unmask'd,</hi> that I treat of his <hi>Contempt
of the Epistles</hi> in one Chapter, and of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to use the word <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in an other.
And I mention his <hi>not naming of Christ's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
for us</hi> on no other account but this,
that it argues he is a favourer of <hi>Socinianism,</hi>
because when he professedly and designedly
enumerates the <hi>Advantages</hi> of our Saviour's
Coming, he speaks not of his <hi>making Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
for us. This is the true and plain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the matter, whence it is obvious to
take notice of his willful violation of Truth
and Sincerity. He jumps from the Third
Chapter of my Book to the Seventh to form
a Falshood against me. He most untruly and
perversly represents the thing he speaks of, and
there is no shadow of Verity in what he saith:
So that the Reader is sufficiently caution'd
against depending upon his word for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and he must always suppose him to be
an arrant <hi>Masker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he is as Silly as he is False, for, in the
same place, to excuse himself as to his not
mentioning of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> he saith, <hi>there is
not any such word in any one of the Epistles, or
other Books of the New Testament in his Bible
as Satisfying, or Satisfaction made by our Saviour,
and so he could not put it into his Christianity
as delivered in the Scripture.</hi> Very sound and
solid! It being such a Noble Strain of Logick
and Reason, we will form it into a <hi>Syllogism,</hi>
and leave it as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Memorial to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
It is briefly thus:</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57882:32"/>If there be no such word as <hi>Satisfaction</hi>
in any of the books of the New Testament,
it cannot be put into <hi>Christianity</hi> as deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But there is no such word as <hi>Satisfaction</hi>
in any of the Books of the New Testament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> it can't be put into <hi>Christianity</hi> as
delivered in the Scripture.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Get thee gone, for a Cunning Disputant:
thou hast not thy fellow, I verily believe,
within the Compass of the four Seas. By the
same way of Arguing I will prove that the
doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is no part of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
as delivered in the Scripture. And so you
may, saith the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> for I hold there
is no such thing as the <hi>Trinity</hi> in Scripture.</p>
            <p>But I will try again, by the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I will prove that the <hi>Divine Decrees,</hi>
and the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, and his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
are no Part of <hi>Christianity,</hi> because these
words <hi>[Decrees, Attributes, Providence]</hi> (as
it is understood of God) are not in Scripture.
Nor do the <hi>Sacraments</hi> belong to <hi>Christianity,</hi>
because that word occurs no where in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Writings, as <hi>Barclay</hi> (Apol. p. 292.)
profoundly argues. Nay, The word <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
is not to be found in Scripture, why then
doth this man talk of <hi>Christianity as delivered
in the Scripture?</hi> You see by this what strange
and inconsistent things he obtrudes upon the
Reader. He will not allow of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the word is not mention'd in the Bible:
Is there any reason then to own such a thing
as <hi>Christianity,</hi> seeing the word is not found
there? But he will say, the Thing is. And
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57882:33"/>
the same I say of <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> and so the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi>
shews himself to be a sorry contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Wrangler, and lets the World know that
he hath dealt so much with <hi>Children,</hi> that he's
of that number himself.</p>
            <p>But afterwards <hi>p</hi> 157. he pretends to own
the <hi>Thing,</hi> and to say it may be collected out
of his <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity.</hi> Yet still
the <hi>Stubborn</hi> and <hi>Stomachful</hi> Man (which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
he observes reigns much in Children
Educat. p. 121, 122.) will not buckle to the
<hi>Word.</hi> Surely this same word <hi>satisfying</hi> hath
been some way or other very mischievous to
him, that he so starts back at the naming of
it. But to come close to the business, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to any Impartial Man whether it can in
any probability be believ'd that a person own
such or such a <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Gospel,
and yet will not express it by that <hi>Word</hi> or
<hi>Name</hi> which all the Professors of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Faith have agreed to call it by. This is the
Case of the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> he pretends to allow
of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ, and yet he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
refuses to use the Word. But till he
can give us any Reason for this refusal, we
shall believe that the true Cause why he will
not admit of the Word is, because he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believes
the Thing it self.</p>
            <p>P. 159 he would be fastning two Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a <hi>Iesuite</hi> (as he saith) upon me; but
every one saith they are his Own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will not injure him by laying claim to
them. And this I'll tell him moreover, that
he hath an Other Property of one of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which he hath not named, and that is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57882:33"/>
               <hi>Trudging up and down,</hi> and <hi>having no Home.</hi>
And if a man can be of <hi>Loiola</hi>'s Order and a
<hi>Mendicant</hi> too, then I'm sure he may put in
for both.</p>
            <p>What he jabbers p. 163, 164. about <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
not being named at the Admission of
those of Riper Years to Baptism, he might
have seen answer'd, if he had had two eyes,
in my <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi> p. 47.</p>
            <p>P. 168. he comes to make little Whimsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Remarks on what I had said of the <hi>Apostles
Creed,</hi> he raises Trifling Objections; he sets
up a Phantom, a mere Shadow, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
it; he is <hi>wanton</hi> and freakish, and in
brief, the Kitling plays with his own Tail.</p>
            <p>He insists upon the terms <hi>Abstract</hi> and <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
p. 173, 174. and spends a great many
vain words about them, but can't for his heart
disprove what I asserted, <hi>viz.</hi> that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Creed</hi> is an <hi>Abstract</hi> or <hi>Abridgment</hi> of the
Christian Faith, which is more fully express'd
in the Holy Scriptures, not only in the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
but in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> which our <hi>Vindicator</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure to hear of. At last I am to be the
<hi>Iesuite</hi> again, and he is to take Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s
place, and so the <hi>Protestant</hi> is to confute
the <hi>Papist,</hi> and there's an end of that silly Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
Fiction of our <hi>Masker,</hi> not worthy of
one of the poor raw Boys that he hath drag'd
up in his time.</p>
            <p>Further, it is to be noted that after he had
banded as fiercely as he could against my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Abridgment,</hi> and, to thwart me, had
produced <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s sense of the word, he
confesses that he is ignorant <hi>whether what</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57882:34"/>
               <hi>had given, be the nature of an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or no.</hi> p. 177. Which shews how fickle
and restive he is, and that he builds upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
hypotheses, and is not careful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any Ground for what he saith.
This would make one doubt whether this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be in his right mind or no. Hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Thoughtfulness</hi> disorder'd his Brain, that he
thus talks?</p>
            <p>P. 177. he would seem to pay some honour
to the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> and <hi>the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
(though no man believes it, no not
himself) and to vindicate their practise in
admitting persons to Baptism upon the Faith
contain'd in the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> as if no more
were to be believ'd by them than what is in
<hi>express terms</hi> in that Form of Confession. But
the Catechism of our Church may satisfy him
that more is comprehended in that Form of
Faith than is <hi>expresly</hi> there mention'd, else it
would not have been said that <hi>we are chiefly to
learn, in these Articles of our Belief, to believe
in God the Father, in God the Son, and in God
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Holy Ghost.</hi> He may look long enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Creed, and never find there these words,
<hi>God the Son,</hi> and <hi>God the Holy Ghost;</hi> but
Our Church lets us know that these terms are
really contain'd in that Profession of Faith.
Whence it follows that when persons are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into the Faith of the Apostles Creed, they
are baptized into the Faith of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and
consequently into more than is in <hi>express words</hi>
mention'd in this Symbol of our Faith. Which
is the thing that this Quarrelsome Animal
objects against, but is not able after all his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57882:34"/>
fluttering to effect any thing. Besides, it is
evident that our Church thinks not this <hi>Creed</hi>
to be absolutely Perfect and Compleat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she adds other Creeds to it, as the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi>
and <hi>Athanasian.</hi> Which it is probable she
would not have done if every thing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
were in express, direct, and full words
set down in the other Form of Belief. And
again, as to what he saith of the <hi>Primitive
Practise</hi> of admitting persons to Baptism upon
the bare confession of the Apostles Creed, he
betrays his Ignorance, having not learnt from
several Eminent Writers that this Creed is
not exactly the same that it was in the First
Ages of Christianity, but that some Articles
have been added to it. But the heedless <hi>Mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
attends to none of these things, but goes
on Chattering, and loves to hear his Clack
move. But you must pardon him, for he that
is used to the Conversation of Nurses, and
the whole <hi>Posse</hi> of the Chatting Crew, can't
be thought to moderate his Intemperate Organ.</p>
            <p>P. 183, 184. he heaves very hard to take
off a <hi>Blunder</hi> that had been justly imputed to
him, but he runs into a greater and more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
one, and salves it by <hi>Supposition,</hi> for he
would have it <hi>supposed</hi> (and that is a great
word with him, you must note, in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings)
that the Compilers of the Creed who
lived in several Centuries, yet <hi>lived in one
age or time.</hi> This is precious stuff, you will
say. Though some of the Compilers of the
Creed lived at some years distance from one
an other, yet by a <hi>Supposition</hi> they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary,
and live together. Yes, it must
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57882:35"/>
be so by all means, he peremptorily vouches
that <hi>the supposition of their living together is easy,
at what distance so ever they lived, and how
many so ever there were of them.</hi> p. 185. This
is as if he should <hi>suppose</hi> that all the <hi>Pedantick
Tutors</hi> that lived in King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's,
and King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight's reigns should live
at the same time with our <hi>Vindicator</hi> who is of
the same race and kind. One would not think
that a man that talks so much against <hi>Poetry</hi> as
he doth, should have such a fansiful knack of
<hi>Fiction.</hi> The sense of this <hi>Blunder</hi> hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
dampt him, and for some pages together
he is down in the mouth, and only sneakingly
desires me to <hi>shew</hi> him this, and <hi>shew</hi> him
that, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>shew</hi> him his Folly: which I need
not do, he hath sufficiently done it himself.</p>
            <p>Then p. 190, 191, 192, 193, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is at
his old work of <hi>Repetition,</hi> and quoting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
(though he could not quote a worse Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
and filling up whole pages with what
he had said in his <hi>Reasonableness of Christanity,</hi>
and in his former <hi>Vindication.</hi> And truly this
is his employment every where, so that a man
may modestly compute that there are three
parts of his book spent in Reiterating the same
things, and in the very same words. He
that is so much against <hi>Themes</hi> will not permit
himself to <hi>vary the Phrase,</hi> but brings over
his old matter again in the very same indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
terms that he used before, which renders
his Farce very ridiculous and irksom. But
besides the impudent Vanity of the thing,
there is a great deal of Knavery and Dishonesty
in it, which he ought to answer for. None
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57882:35"/>
but he that hath counterfeited his Name would
impose upon the world by offering them a
false number of Pages, to heighten the Price
of them. The Reader is cheated into a book
of above thirty sheets, when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you pare off
his Repetitions, there remain not above eight
or nine. Here is a gross piece of Injustice, to
make the Buyer pay five shillings for a Twelve
penny Cut. This is a New way of Writing,
to insert one book into an other <hi>verbatim,</hi> and
so to chouse the unwary Chapman. Nay, it
might be further observed that whatever he
hath <hi>added</hi> in this last Pamphlet is run over <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain</hi>
in some places of it, as if he studied to
make it more Ridiculous then it seem'd to be
at the first reading. But it appears it was his
business to heap up a Multitude of words, and
to eeke out his poor lank matter: for a Book
was to come out against what I had writ, and
there was a necessity of Stuffing it and Swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and to say Much where Nothing could
be said to the Purpose.</p>
            <p>In his next pages 202, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is stark mad
at me for intimating that he and his Allies
are <hi>Under-hand Factors for Rome.</hi> See how it
pleases the Divine Disposer of all things that
by occasion of a small Hint a man shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to the world his Inward Consciousness,
and together with that his Propensions and
Designs which he with all the art imaginable
labour'd to <hi>mask</hi> and conceal! When I but
mention'd the Tendency of the Party to <hi>Rome,</hi>
he, as a Concern'd and Guilty Criminal, starts
up, and shews himself gall'd and pinch'd, he
flies about and grows furious and outragious.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57882:36"/>
What! saith he, doth this Orthodox Railer
tell us that we are <hi>Factors</hi> for <hi>Rome,</hi> and truck
for <hi>Popery?</hi> What! doth he think that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I hate <hi>Universities,</hi> I am in love with
the <hi>Whore of Babylon?</hi> How can I be of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church that am of none? But this is
easily answer'd by the known Maxim, <hi>One of
no Religion will soon be of any.</hi> Scepticism
makes way for Popery. The doctrine which
the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Vindicator of the Reasonableness
of Christianity</hi> hath spread abroad, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
on purpose to bring men off from the
Received Articles of Christianity, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them to be Scepticks and Infidels. I hope
to give the Reader satisfaction about this and
in a few words to convince the Intelligent
and Serious Considerer that it is the design of
this Writer to <hi>unsettle Religion,</hi> to introduce
<hi>Indifferency</hi> and <hi>Neutrality</hi> into Christianity, to
place all Opinions on a level, to represent all
Doctrines to be alike, that there may be no
contending for any Articles of Faith, that
those which were look'd upon by the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church and by Our Own as Fundamental
Doctrins of Christianity may for the future not
be thought necessary to be known and believ'd
in order to making men True Christians, He
perswades men that <hi>One Article</hi> will do their
business, and that those who pass for <hi>Orthodox
Protestants</hi> confound people with <hi>bundels</hi> of
doctrines, which are useless and unnecessary;
that half the Bible, Yea a quarter of it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that One of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> Writings
contains all the rest (for which he quotes
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>) and therefore if all the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57882:36"/>
rest were lost, we need not concern our selves
about it; as for the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the Apostles,
we need not trouble our heads with looking
into them, for there is only now and then
<hi>dropt</hi> by the bye an Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>And then, this Author under the pretence
of declaring against <hi>Systems of Divinity</hi> (which
is his Common Subject) strikes at all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and Celebrated Doctrines of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, and represents them as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and precarious. Every where he shews
his abhorence of the very word <hi>System</hi> (as
if it were as uneasy to him as <hi>Satisfying</hi>) so
that it is a singular and extraordinary favour
he would quote (as he doth, and that with
Respect) Dr. <hi>Cudworths book</hi> that bears the
Name of <hi>System.</hi> Now, I am only to take
notice of the Ground of his inveighing against
<hi>Systems,</hi> which is his design of bringing an
<hi>odium</hi> on the Settl'd Truths of Christianity,
and to make way for his own Giddy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Accordingly he pronounces concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those Stable Fundamentals of Christianity
that <hi>they were framed and fashioned according to
the humors, interests, or designs of the Heads of
Parties, as if they were things depending on
mens pleasure, and to be suited to their conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
These are his words p. 215, 216. and
speak his heart; and the <hi>Turkish Spye</hi> doth not
express <hi>his mind more fully.</hi> Thus he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposes
his Readers to be of no Church,
of no Religion. Or at least he would
perswade them that one way of Religion is as
good as an other: which is the prevailing
doctrine of these days. Therefore Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57882:37"/>
(one whom I shall afterwards account with)
was much mistaken when he said, <hi>he never
hardly appear'd on a fashionable subject,</hi> Rep. p. 3.
for this Opinion, and that <hi>One religion is as
good as another,</hi> is the <hi>Modish</hi> doctrine every
where. This Country Gentleman is in the
<hi>Fashion,</hi> and doth not know it. (And thence
you may judge of the Truth of what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>
saith of him, that <hi>he takes not up his Opinions
from Fashion. Pref. to his Vindicat.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Now this is a fair step towards <hi>Rome,</hi> for if
one Religion be equivalent to an other, and our
Salvation is not concerned in the belief of the
Necessary Articles of <hi>our Faith,</hi> then we are
at liberty to embrace what Form and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of Articles we please, and those of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will perhaps be thought as
good as any. There is a strange passage in this
Writer, p. 217, 218. which speaks his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
opinion of the <hi>Pontifician</hi> way, <hi>I have
often wondred,</hi> saith he, <hi>to hear men of several
Churches so heartily exclaim against the Implicit
Faith of the Church of Rome, when the same Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Faith is as much practis'd and required in
their own, though not so openly profess'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously
own'd there.</hi> First, he lets us know
that from that Converse which he hath had
with persons of <hi>several Churches,</hi> whether of
the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
or those of the Dissenters, he finds that they
are against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly,
that though they are against the doctrine of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Faith</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they
like it well enough in their <hi>own.</hi> Thirdly,
they not only like it, but <hi>practise</hi> it, yea the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57882:37"/>
very <hi>same</hi> Implicit Faith. Fourthly, they not
only <hi>practise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but <hi>require</hi> it, they command
and enjoyn those of their Communion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all they say with an Implicit Faith. But
fifthly, they do not this with so good a grace
as those of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> do. For those
latter are very <hi>open and ingenuous</hi> in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and practise of implicit Faith, but the
former are not so. <hi>Protestants</hi> have not that
Candor and Fairness which are to be seen in
<hi>Papists;</hi> they neither so <hi>openly profess,</hi> nor so
<hi>ingenuously own</hi> this doctrine, but yet as strictly
<hi>practise</hi> it, and <hi>require the practise</hi> of it as they
do. I leave it with the Reader to determine
from the Premises which of these two, those
of the <hi>Roman</hi> or of the <hi>Reform'd</hi> Churches,
have the happiness to be most in favour with
this Gentleman.</p>
            <p>In the known stile of the <hi>Roman</hi> Priests and
Writers he declares that <hi>the Scripture serves
but like a Nose of Wax,</hi> p 213. And as the
Heads of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> deny the <hi>Bible</hi>
to the Common people, so he is advancing
towards this apace, for he lops off three of the
<hi>Evangelists,</hi> (for one he saith will suffice)
and all the <hi>Epistles.</hi> And further to shew his
good will to the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and to their
Beloved Notion of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> he tells
us p. 408, 409. that <hi>if a man understands those
words of our Saviour's Institution [This is my
body] and [This is my blood] in a Literal sense,
he must believe the Bread and Wine in the Lords
Supper are changed really into his Body and
Blood, though he knows not how.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he saith,, <hi>He is obliged to belive it to be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57882:38"/>
true, and to assent to it.</hi> And presently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<hi>To deny assent to this as true, would be
to deny our Saviour's Veracity, and consequently
his being the Messiah sent from God.</hi> Here he
lets us know that his <hi>One</hi> Article is quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
if <hi>Transubstantition</hi> be not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
You see what his making of <hi>[Iesus is
the Messias]</hi> to be the <hi>Sole</hi> Article of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith, comes to. But this doctrine of
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is so grateful to him that he
brings it over again, p 413, 414. assuring us
that <hi>the Old Gentleman at</hi> Rome, <hi>who hath an
Antient Title to Infallibility, may make Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on
a Fundamental Article necessarily
to be believ'd, as well as I make the Divinity
of Christ and his Satisfaction,</hi> &amp;c. (for these
he means by <hi>the Sense of any Disputed Texts
of Scripture,</hi> because the Texts concerning
these Points are disputable with him) <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Articles necessarily to be believ'd.</hi> It
is brought to this issue it seems, that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi>
is as Fundamental an Article of
the Christian Faith as any that can be nam'd
besides <hi>Iesus</hi>'s <hi>being the Messias.</hi> Thus by the
Over-ruling Providence of Heaven this sort
of Writers discover the inward bent of their
thoughts and inclinations, though they labour
to hide them from the world. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would be thought to have no kindness
for <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet his own words confu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
him. As I observ'd before that he stoutly
<hi>Rails</hi> whilest he is remonstrating against that
practice, so here he stiffly patronizes <hi>Popery,</hi>
even when he had pretended to shew himself
displeas'd at my charging him with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57882:38"/>And I could produce several other passages
out of his Writings which makes it appear
that our <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> is inclined to receive the
<hi>Roman Missionaries;</hi> I could make it evident
that he is Indifferent as to the <hi>Reform'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and the Doctrines professed by the
Owners of it, and that he inspires mens minds
with a dis-esteem of those Articles which the
Christian Churches since the Reformation
have unanimously asserted and vindicated, and
that he represents them as Ridiculous. You
must not, saith he, give ear to what the
<hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Pulpit Orators</hi> of these Churches
tell you about more Articles than One as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be known and believed, in order to
making you Christians. If you assent to this
Single Proposition, <hi>Iesus is the Messias,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you that you are, as to matter of
Faith, as Good Christians as St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St.
<hi>Paul</hi> were. When your Parish-Priests en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
in their <hi>Popular Harangues</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you that this is not the sum Total of
the Christian Faith, but that there are other
Necessary and Fundamental Doctrines which
are of the Essence of Christianity, you must
roundly tell them from me, that the <hi>Catalogue
of Fundamentals every one alone can make for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
no body can collect or prescribe it to an other,
but this is according as God hath dealt to every
one the measure of light and faith, and hath
open'd each mans understanding, that he may
understand the Scripture.</hi> These are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words of our <hi>Vindicator,</hi> p. 85. and
from them it undeniably follows, that though
no body must be a <hi>Creed-maker,</hi> yet every
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57882:39"/>
one may be a <hi>Fundamental-maker.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
was pleased to give this power to the <hi>King</hi>
only, but this Gentleman is more liberal, and
grants it to every Subject: He may make
what <hi>Catalogue of Fundamentals</hi> he pleases, and
put this into it, among the rest, that the <hi>Pope</hi>
is Infallible, and that the Religion of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be prefer'd to that of
the <hi>Reformed.</hi> Fundamentals depend not upon
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but upon mens <hi>Understandings,</hi>
and therefore every man according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
may make as many, and as few
Fundamental Articles as he thinks fit. What
think you now of our <hi>Tutor,</hi> our <hi>Anti-Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian?</hi>
Is not this Man of <hi>One Article</hi> dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to entertain the <hi>Twelve New Articles</hi> of
Faith of the <hi>Council of Trent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impossible to conceive how Great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
that person may do whose Head is stuff'd
with such Notions as these, especially if we
consider he is always <hi>creeping into Houses,</hi> and
insinuating into <hi>Families,</hi> and wheadling the
<hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Mistresses,</hi> and infecting the early
thoughts of <hi>young Ones</hi> with such Principles.
Such a one the Commonwealth is concern'd
to have an eye upon, for the safety of the
Publick. And though all this while I don't
suppose him to be set on work upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of his extraordinary Skill or Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as if I took him either for a Conjurer or
a Jesuite, yet he may be made use of as a
very fit Tool, as a Convenient Machin, and
(as I said before) he may serve to be an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand
Factor. And if the Creature had
not been some such thing, it is impossible he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57882:39"/>
should startle and stare, and fling about (as
the Reader may observe he doth) at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> He conceals the
resentment as well as he can, but the Observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reader may plainly discern it. None
would have been guilty of this but our Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<hi>Masker,</hi> who, in imitation of the
Changling kind, hides his face, and then thinks
no body sees him. But notwithstanding all
his Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifices and Disguises, he bewrays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
As they vulgarly say of the Fiend, that
when he appears in Humane Shape, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dissemble it so well, but he is some way
or other discover'd, there is some mark to
discern him by.</p>
            <p>A little after, p. 229, 230. he returns to
the <hi>One Article</hi> again, and upbraids me for
<hi>many. I have,</hi> he saith, <hi>a reserve of the Lord
knows how many more,</hi> p. 233. which is Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently
and Prophanely spoken, because he
uses the Sacred Name so slightly and vainly.
By this we may guess what manner of <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
his Children and Nurslings have: He
that abuses that Holy Name himself will not
check this fault in others.</p>
            <p>Then in three pages together, 232, 233,
234. he falls into his old Trot of <hi>telling</hi> me,
and desiring to <hi>shew,</hi> and let him <hi>know,</hi> &amp;c.
Without any shame or remorse he continues
to stuff whole pages with Reiterations of his
former Writings. Though he was lately not
for <hi>telling,</hi> but for <hi>weighing of money,</hi> yet he
hath other thoughts with respect to his <hi>Books,</hi>
for he reckons <hi>Number</hi> to be <hi>Weight.</hi> Such
Writers glory in the number of their Lines,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57882:40"/>
and think to be Voluminous is to be Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative.</p>
            <p>Next, p. 238, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he runs back to Object
against the Reason which I assigned why the
believing of <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messias</hi> is so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mention'd in the New Testament
And he busies himself with Wire drawing
every word that I had said, and <hi>scores</hi> up all
along (as he had done before) what I must
<hi>shew</hi> him, and what I must <hi>prove,</hi> and sets them
down in distinct <hi>Figures:</hi> And yet after all
these little devices and pedantick tricks, he
hath not rais'd one Objection against me that
hath any thing more in it than his <hi>Childrens
Rattle.</hi> And indeed it must needs be so, and
can't be otherwise: when men have taken
up false deceitful Notions, and then labour to
Vindicate them, it is presently seen that their
pretences of Arguing are mere Sound, and
are nothing but Childish and Noisy Amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>In no less than 20 pages afterwards he bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
himself in hunting for Objections and
Cavils against what I had said, and at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to admit but of a single Article as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believ'd in order to the making
a man a Christian, But will not that Sermon
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in Acts 2. evidence that there are
<hi>more</hi> Fundamental Points than that one, <hi>Iesus
is the Messias?</hi> Are not our Saviour's <hi>Passion,
Death,</hi> and <hi>Resurrection</hi> particularly mention'd
in ver. 23, 24 and are they not <hi>Fundamental
Articles</hi> of Faith? Can you believe <hi>Iesus</hi> to
be the <hi>Messias,</hi> without believing him to have
<hi>suffer'd, died, and rose again?</hi> To this it is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57882:40"/>
answer'd, p. 268. that <hi>these Articles were not
proposed by St.</hi> Peter <hi>to the unbelieving Iews as
Fundamental ones,</hi> and consequently they are
not to be reckon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d as Fundamental Articles,
for it is certain that the Holy Apostle propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them as they were. I request the Serious
and Judicious Reader to take an estimate of
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> from
this one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> his denying the Articles
of our Saviour's <hi>Suffering, Death,</hi> and <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
to be Articles of the Foundation, <hi>i. e.</hi>
such as are necessarily required to be believ'd,
for the costituting a man a Christian. That
he deni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s this is plain, because he tells us that
St. <hi>Peter</hi> propounded not these Articles as
Fundamental, and because according to him
there is but one Fundamental Article. If
there be but One, then these are no Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Propositions, unless you will say that three

he will scarcely assent to, unless his <hi>Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
be proportionable to his <hi>Christianity.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
in an other place, p 233. he is Positive
as to this matter, for his words are these, <hi>[The
Death and Resurrection of Christ are recorded
by the Spirit of God in Holy Writ, but are no
more necessary to be believed to make a man a
Christian than any other part of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation]</hi>
that is, than any Inferiour Truth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in the New Testament, as that Christ
rid upon as Ass. This he declares to be as
requisite to <hi>make a man a Christian</hi> as that
Christ died and rose again.</p>
            <p>But stay, we must not think the day is our
own, the Adversary begins to rally, and pushes
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57882:41"/>
upon us with his strong Reserves, as thus, p.
268. <hi>Those Articles of the Crucifixion, Death,
and Resurrection of Christ were not propos'd here
as the Fundamental Articles which St.</hi> Peter
<hi>principally aim'd at, and endeavour'd to convince
them of.</hi> And afterwards, <hi>They are not the
Principal thing aim'd at,</hi> p. 269. but only
brought in by the bye. A Wager on it that
he is good at <hi>Push<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> pin.</hi> None but such a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fler
as the Vindicator could have been so
shameless as to offer this to a Reader of any
sense and consideration: for it is evident in
this Sermon that our Saviour's <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> and
<hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Rising again</hi> are equally urged with
his being <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Christ:</hi> And the Apostle
mentions his <hi>Resurrection</hi> again, <hi>v. 32. This
Iesus hath God reised up,</hi> and therefore exhorts
his Country-men and Brethren to imbrace
this <hi>Iesus,</hi> to believe that he suffer'd, and laid
down his life, and took it up again for the
Good of the World. But our New Model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of Christianity tells us that these are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
occasionally brought in here by St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
and only <hi>as Arguments to perswade</hi> the Jews,
but were far from being Fundamental and
Necessary Points of Christian Faith, such as
they must needs believe. And how doth he
prove that these were brought in as <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>
Ay, that is worth our taking notice
of. <hi>That our Saviour's Crucifixion, Death and
Resurrection were us'd here as Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>wade
them into a belief of this Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
that Iesus was the Messias, is evident,</hi>
saith he, <hi>from hence, that they preach'd here to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>w the death and crucifixion of Iesus,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57882:41"/>
as well as</hi> Peter, <hi>and therefore they could not be
propos'd to them as New Articles of Faith to be
believ'd,</hi> p. 269.</p>
            <p>The answer is obvious, that though those
Auditors knew as well as their Speaker that
Christ suffer'd on the cross, and there expir'd,
and rose again, yet they were ignorant of
the Design and End of all this, <hi>viz.</hi> that he
suffer'd, and died and rose from the dead for
the Benefit and Advantage of Mankind.
Thus they were <hi>New Articles of Faith</hi> to them,
and thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> proposed them to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
and receiv'd, as appears from that Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Jews who were converted by
this Sermon, <hi>What shall we do to be saved?</hi>
Which implies that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had told them
Christs Death and Resurrection were in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Salvation of lost mankind: and
therefore they desire to know what Method
they must take to have the Benefit of that
Salvation and Redemption; and accordingly
he exhorts them to <hi>Repent, and to be baptized
every one of them in the name of Iesus Christ, for
the remission of sins,</hi> v. 38. These Jews were
before strangers to this, they had no perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
concerning the Design of Christs Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Dying, and Rising again, <hi>viz.</hi> that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and Pardon of sins were to be obtain'd
by them, and therefore the Apostle preaches
tehse Truths to them. And that they are the
<hi>Principal</hi> Doctrines in this Sermon appears
from their being insisted upon so largely, from
v. 23, to 36. but as for that Other Article,
that <hi>Iesus is the Messias,</hi> it is not expresly
mention'd throughout the whole Sermon,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57882:42"/>
only the substance of it is in ver. 36, after the
other Grand Articles of Christs Passion and
Dying and Rising had been amply discours'd
of and urg'd. And yet our Bold Breeder up
of Small Craft faces it out that that was the
<hi>Sole Proposition and the Sole Truth the Apostle
labour'd to convince them of, and to bring them
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o.</hi> p. 270. and that the Others are no Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles. Our new Theologue is for
a <hi>Messias</hi> that neither <hi>Suffer'd,</hi> nor <hi>died,</hi> nor
<hi>rose again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I leave the Reader to judge of this, whilst
I follow our <hi>Travelling Tutour</hi> to p. 281. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
where we still fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him perverting of St.
<hi>Luke's</hi> Writing. He sets himself to misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
his History both of the <hi>Gospel</hi> and of
the <hi>Acts,</hi> as if he had a particular pike against
that Good Man, that Holy Writer, above
all the rest.</p>
            <p>From p. 209. to p. 299. he undertakes to
set down the Contents of our Saviour's and
the Apostle's Preaching, and thence to prove
that <hi>One Article only</hi> was propounded to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
to make men Christians. But our bold
Undertaker falls very short of what he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as I shall make evident from the Texts he
alledges. First, he quotes <hi>Mat. 4. 23. Iesus
went about all Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ilee, teaching in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom,</hi>
called in the 17th v. <hi>the Kingdom of heaven,</hi>
which is no other than the State of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church under the Gospel, with all the
Great Benefits and Priviledges, as well as the
Duties and Offices which appertain to it. This
is the <hi>Gospel of the Kingdom,</hi> even the <hi>kingdom
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57882:42"/>
of heaven,</hi> for it is that Doctrine and Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
wherein Heaven and Happiness are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offer'd to mankind, and whereby they
may be made actual Partakers of them.
This is that which Christ <hi>taught</hi> and <hi>preach'd,</hi>
and thence our deep Logitian in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers that he
taught and preach'd but <hi>One Article,</hi> as if the
doctrine of the <hi>kingdom of heaven</hi> contain'd in
it no more. Next he quotes <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 7.
where our Lord enjoin'd his Apostles <hi>to preach,
saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> And
he adds <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 9. where our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Seventy Disciples to give and
preach to the Inhabitants of some particular
places in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and <hi>to say unto them, The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is come nigh unto you.</hi> Which is
as much as to say, Go and preach the same
Gospel that I my self have taught, for this is
the Sum of what I have every where pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
and preach'd, <hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom
of heaven is at hand, Mat.</hi> 4. 17. Reform
your lives, and embrace that Doctrine which
approaches nearer and nearer unto you every
day, and is more and more to be discover'd
to the world. It is no less then the doctrine
of the <hi>Kingdom of God, i. e.</hi> Gods spiritual
Government of his Church under the reign
of the <hi>Messias</hi> the Saviour and Redeemer:
wherefore you must be careful to inform your
selves concerning the Laws of this Spiritual
Kingdom, and to know and believe them, as
well as to practise them. If a Man can prove
hence that there is but <hi>One Article</hi> in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
to be assented to, to constitute a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a member of Christ, he hath a faculty
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57882:43"/>
of Proving which none ever heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Well, but why doth he not go on? He had
undertaken to prove the One Article from
the <hi>Commission</hi> given by our Saviour to his
Apostles and his Disciples, and why then doth
he not proceed, and quote <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.
among his other Texts that he produces?
This is worth the Readers taking notice of,
for it will discover to him the Genius and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the man we are now dealing with.
Though he had taken upon him to set down
and rehearse the several particular <hi>Commissions</hi>
our Saviour gave the Apostles and Disciples
when he sent them to preach the Gospel yet
he omits this most Solemn order of all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they and their Successors were enjoyn'd to
<hi>teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost, teaching them to observe all things &amp;c.</hi>
They were to convert all Nations to the Faith
of the Gospel, and to make them Christs <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples</hi>
(for the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
them into the profession of the Holy
<hi>Trinity;</hi> and consequently they were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in this doctrine, in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made Christians: they must know and
believe that in the Eternal Godhead there are
Three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
this is propounded as requisite in order to their
being admitted and constituted <hi>Disciples</hi> of
<hi>Iesus.</hi> If the <hi>Vindicator</hi> had not been consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to himself that this is the True Sense and
Import of the Text, it is certain he would
have produc'd it among the other places: but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57882:43"/>
(which is dismal to consider) he stifles the
inward sentiment of his Conscience, to secure
his One Article; for he saw that the Article
of the <hi>Trinity</hi> was plainly express'd in this
<hi>Commission,</hi> and as plainly enjoin'd to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
as a Necessary Point in order to give a
man the denomination of a <hi>Disciple of Christ,</hi>
or a <hi>True Christian;</hi> and for this reason our
False <hi>Masker</hi> conceals this place, even when
he was pretending to give an account of those
Texts which mentioned our Blessed Saviours
<hi>Commissions</hi> to his Apostles. This shews what
a Perfidious Scribe we have got, one that
makes nothing of wilfully leaving out any
Text of Scripture, to further his design and
purpose and at other times he as wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
plain Texts to the same end. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of which strange behaviour, will I
doubt not, obtain me an Excuse among Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
and Intelligent Readers for my manner
of handling this Adversary, whose obstinate
Hypocrisy and dissimulation call for no other
than the severest Chastisements and Correp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
though I confess it is with no mean
regret and reluctancy that I put my self upon
this way of writing; but t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere is no help for
it in the present case; he must of necessity be
disciplined and <hi>taught,</hi> as <hi>the men of Succoth,
with Thorns and Briars.</hi> I should not have
undertaken this task upon my own private and
personal account, because <hi>Contempt,</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect</hi>
are the best Return in this case: but
when I saw our Holy Religion endanger'd by
his sacrilegious attempts of depriving us of the
greatest part of it, and when I observ'd his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57882:44"/>
Rude encroachments on the Profess'd Schools
of Learning, I found it was a <hi>Publick Cause,</hi>
and that every one, who would, had a right
to engage in it, and to oppose him as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Foe, as a Proclaim'd Rebel, as an Out-Law,
as a Pest of the Community, and to
treat him accordingly.</p>
            <p>I will stay a little to examine one ridiculous
passage p. 304: I had offer'd to prove that
there is more than that One Article, <hi>Iesus is
the Messias,</hi> to be believ'd to make a man a
Christian, by producing that place <hi>Rom. 10. 9.
If thou shalt believe in thy heart that God raised
him</hi> (i. e. Christ Jesus) <hi>from the dead, thou
shalt be saved:</hi> where the belief of <hi>Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
is propounded as absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to salvation: and if so, then <hi>Iesus is the
Messias</hi> is not the Only Article, as he often
inculcates. What is his Answer to this? <hi>To
believe the Resurrection of Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>is
in effect the same as to believe him to be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssias,
and so is put to express it.</hi> And again p.
305. <hi>Believing Christs Resurrection is put for
believing him to be the Messias:</hi> so that these
which seem to be Two Articles are but one
and the same. And if they be so, then why
throughout all his Collection of places out of
the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> did he not mention
all those Texts (which are very many) that
speak of our Saviour's <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and why
did he not reckon them to be the same with
those that speak of <hi>Iesus</hi>'s being the <hi>Messias?</hi>
Why did he not all along tell us that <hi>one is
put to express the other?</hi> The true Reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he thought of no such thing at that time,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57882:44"/>
but hath invented it since, to shift off what I
said.</p>
            <p>This is such an other piece of Invention as
that in his <hi>First Vindication</hi> p. 6. that <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
his Treatise of the Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
chiefly for Infirm Christians, such as disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
or doubted of the Truth of Christianity:</hi>
and again in his <hi>Second Vindication</hi> p. 152. he
saith, <hi>he chiefly design'd his book for Deists.</hi>
(though b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the way we may take notice of his
Contradicting himself, for <hi>Deists</hi> are no <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
and if he design'd his book <hi>chiefly</hi> for
one, he cou'd not design it <hi>chiefly</hi> for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.)
And yet if you consult his whole
Treatise of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi>
you shall not find one syllable that intimates any
such Design, though there, if any where, he
was obliged to discover and declare it, that
the Reader might not mistake the Intention
of his book. This proves that what he hath
since added in both his <hi>Vindications</hi> is mere
Fiction and Sham, and he was forced to fly
to this Asylum when I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d laid open the
mischief of his Papers. This may convince
us that he will first assert and print any thing,
and then afterwards he will (in his Snivel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
way) come and Retract it, or gloss it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with some pitiful Evasion. But where is
the Probity, where is the Integrity of the Man
all this while?</p>
            <p>Nay, (to return to the Present Matter) it
is plain that he designedly omitted those places
which mention our Saviours <hi>Resurrection,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was his perswasion that they belong
not to this Proposition, <hi>Iesus is the Messias.</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:57882:45"/>
He declares (as you lately heard) that in St.
<hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, Christs <hi>Resurrection</hi> (as well
as his Sufferings and Death) was brought in
only by the bye, <hi>and was not a Principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
was not principally aym'd at,</hi> but that this
Proposition <hi>Iesus is the Messias</hi> is the <hi>sole Truth</hi>
the Apostle labour'd to bring them to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of: and lately we were told by him that
the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ is no more to be
believ'd to make a man a Christian, than any
Ordinary Truth or Proposition recorded in
the New Testament.</p>
            <p>Yet after all this, he palpably contradicts
what he hath said, and in plain terms tells us
that <hi>Christ's Resurrection</hi> and <hi>his being the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
are the very same, and <hi>one is put to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the other.</hi> Before he held them to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
and so distinct, that where he found
the one he could not find the other, as in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places of the New Testament that he
consulted. The Resurrection of our Lord
was not taken notice of by him as appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Messiaship.</hi> When St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the
main part of his Sermon preached concerning
Christ's Resurrection, our Expositor told us
that <hi>it was made use of only as an Argument</hi> to
perswade them of this Fundamental Truth,
that <hi>Iesus is the Messias,</hi> p. 269. and yet now
all of a sudden this Proposition is <hi>equivalent,</hi>
nay is the <hi>same</hi> with <hi>Iesus rose from the dead.</hi>
There is no account in the world can be given
of this, but that he will be saying something,
though it be to his own apparent Confutation.
See here the Influence of Company! It is a
Common Topick, but the Reality of it could
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57882:45"/>
never be more evinced than in this Instance.
Here we see how it tinctures mens Manners,
and transforms them into the shapes of those
they associate with. Here is one that hath
spent his days among Talking and Gossiping
people, and they have made him such a one
as themselves: He hath learnt of them the
knack of Perpetual Jabbering, and his Tongue
will wag when the Sexton is covering him
with Moulds. But if this were all, we might
pass it off with a little mirth. But alas it is
dismal and horrid to consider what a Profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
Writer shews his Head in the World,
who is neither ashamed to contradict himself
nor the Holy Writings of the Apostles: And
so he brings a contempt on the things of God
and Religion, and vacates the Authority of
Scripture, only to gratify some of his Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
who with himself have a design to smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Chief Articles of our Religion, and
to stifle the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>P. 344, 345, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is mightily Concern'd
(if you will believe him) that he should be
thought to favour <hi>Socinianism.</hi> What Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
I brought for it he labours to render
invalid, but with little success. He would
maintain forsooth, that though I have proved
him a <hi>Socinian,</hi> yet he is no <hi>Socinian;</hi> and
what if he be both? May not a man be a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi>
and no <hi>Socinian,</hi> as well as a <hi>Physitian</hi>
and no <hi>Physitian?</hi> But he farther complains
that <hi>he is the first man that was ever found out
to be at the same time a Socinian and a Factor for</hi>
Rome, p. 346. No, Sir, you are mistaken
here (as in all your other Points) you are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57882:46"/>
not the <hi>first man,</hi> for there was a <hi>Iesuit</hi> in
the late Reign (as a profess'd Socinian owns,
in his <hi>Exceptions of Mr.</hi> E. <hi>examin'd,</hi> p. 46.)
who publish'd a Paper entituled, <hi>An Address,</hi>
&amp;c. wherein he pretends to shew that the
Scriptures commonly alledged for the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Son of God,</hi> and for the <hi>Trinity,</hi>
admit of an other sense. And this Paper
was read by the Jesuite-Preacher in <hi>Limestreet,</hi>
and zealously urged by him in his Pulpit.
Whence it is evident that <hi>Popish</hi> Priests, when
they see it makes for their Interest, cry up the
<hi>Socinian</hi> Principles and Doctrines. A <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>suite</hi>
can appear in all shapes and figures, as well
as a <hi>Vindicator,</hi> and that is the reason that
our <hi>Vindicator</hi> mention'd not this when he was
enumerating the Properties of a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> for he
knew well enough that he could assume the
guise of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> or a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or any other
Sect; and therefore a <hi>Socinian</hi> and a <hi>Factor for
Rome</hi> are not inconsistent. Which proves
that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> had no cause to complain
of my coupling these Two together, and that
it was as weakly as falsly said of him, that he
was <hi>the first man</hi> in whom both these Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
meet. <hi>Socinianism</hi> was first brought
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and thither it tends.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Runnagate Tutor</hi> being almost out of
breath with Impertinent Nonsense and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions,
begins to sit down, and take up
with Quotations, p. 350: and of whom? Of
<hi>two Orthodox Prelates of our Church.</hi> But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he mentions that word <hi>Orthodox,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it for a Jeer, so that those Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
he gives that Epithet to are much oblig'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57882:46"/>
to him for his Buffoonry. But that is not all,
they <hi>are two Prelates,</hi> he saith, <hi>whom, when
he follows Authorities, he shall prefer to</hi> Slichtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius
<hi>and</hi> Socinus (the good man thinks <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
was after <hi>Slichtingius.</hi>) Here is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that is done to those Eminent Men of
our Church; he can only give them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to two Notorious Corrupters of our
Christian Faith. What an impudent affront
is this to the Ashes of the late Archbishop,
and to the Right Reverend Bishop now living,
from the Pen of this <hi>Episcopus Puerorum,</hi> this
Contemptible Overseer of Hanging-Sleeves?
<hi>When he follows Authorities,</hi> is as much as to
say, <hi>he never will,</hi> for our Puny-Governor is
<hi>Authority</hi> to himself. Thus he quotes those
Excellent Prelates only to abuse them, and to
distort their words, as may be seen in what
he saith of them. And it is very observable
that this man who scorns <hi>Authorities,</hi> yet brags
in an other place that<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter to the Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> p. 69.</note> 
               <hi>he hath Great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to justify him:</hi> And in what? <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Soul of Man is Material. Here our good
Gentleman can depend upon <hi>Authorities,</hi> and
call them <hi>Great</hi> Ones, when they shock the
<hi>Immortality</hi> of Humane Souls, but in a Point
of Orthodox Faith he laughs at <hi>Authorities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Ignorant Writer stands to what he
said before, that <hi>[the Son of God] was a phrase
that among the Iews in our Saviour's time was
used for [the Messias.]</hi> p. 357. Which hath
no foundation at all, and none but the man
that talks of the <hi>Mishna,</hi> and never saw it,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57882:47"/>
would have asserted any such thing. Mr.
<hi>Selden,</hi> who, it is thought, was the better
Antiquary and Judge in this matter, expresly
tells us, that <hi>by [the Son of God] the Iews
meant [the Word of God] (as he is called in
the Chaldee Paraphrast) which was the same as
if he had profess'd himself to be God.</hi> De Jure
Nat. &amp; Gent. l. 2. c. 12. For the Old Jews
belief was (as several Good Authors have
proved) that the Messias was <hi>God,</hi> or the
<hi>Son of God,</hi> for they look'd upon the <hi>Son of
God</hi> as Synonymous with <hi>God,</hi> when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the <hi>Messias. Rittangel,</hi> a Learned
Writer, who had been a Jew, sufficiently
proves this from the Jewish Writings. And
from other Testimonies it might be proved
that <hi>the Son of God</hi> was not a term only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the <hi>Messias,</hi> but that it signified some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jesus is the Proper,
Natural and Eternal Son of God, that he is
One with the Father, as having the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature and Essence. Thus in the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sense he is the <hi>Son of God;</hi> and the Jews
in our Saviour's time understood this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
thus, otherwise they would not have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to stone him for <hi>Blasphemy, when he
said he was the Son of God;</hi> which according
to them was the same with being <hi>One with
the Father, and making himself God,</hi> Joh. 10.
30, 33, 36. Whence it is evident that <hi>the Son
of God</hi> denotes the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ, which
the word Messias doth not, and consequently
<hi>the Son of God</hi> and the <hi>Messias</hi> are not terms
of the very same signification. And that place
Acts 8. 37. <hi>I believe that Iesus Christ is the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57882:47"/>
Son of God,</hi> inefragrably proves it, which I
urged in my former Treatise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when the
<hi>Vindicator</hi> came to repeat what I had alledg'd,
he leaves out the words of the Text, as the
Reader may see, p 370. which is an argument
of his hating the Light. But as being ashamed
(which is prodigious in him) of that Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he afterwards mentions the Text, and
sweats to evade the force of it. My Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ran thus, If the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by <hi>Philip</hi> in the Christian Faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
that he believed <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> or the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> then that word
<hi>Messias</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> is not of the very same signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with the <hi>Son of God,</hi> but imports some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else: But the Eunuch profess'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Therefore the word <hi>Messias</hi> is not of the same
signification with the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is
the Text: The Major is proved from this, that if
the <hi>Son of God</hi> signified no more than the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi>
then the Eunuch's words are a downright
Tautology, for they are as much as if he had
said, I believe that the Messias is the Messias.
A man would think there is some sense and
reason in this way of Arguing. No, saith
our Gentleman, I will not allow that there is
any Sense in this, for the <hi>Tautology will be quite
removed if we take</hi> [Christ] <hi>here for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Name,</hi> p. 374. Say you so, Good Mr.
<hi>Vindicator!</hi> Then why may not your One Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<hi>[Iesus is the Messias]</hi> be reduced to this
[Jesus is he whom we call the Messias, or
whose Proper Name is <hi>Messiah?]</hi> What is
the reason that you did not take the word
<hi>Christ</hi> for a <hi>Proper Name</hi> in all those other
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57882:48"/>
places where you alledge that Name to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
his Office? And what is the reason that
the word <hi>Messias</hi> in your Collection of Texts
may not be thought to be the same? Unless
your Pedantship will say that a <hi>Greek</hi> word,
but not an <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Syriack</hi> one is capable
of being a <hi>Proper Name?</hi> You see the strength
of our Adversary. After so many years plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and booking it he cannot afford any other
then such weak insipid trash as this. Get thee
gone, I say to thee, for a maker of poor thin
<hi>Physick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>P. 399. he thinks it <hi>Prophane</hi> that I say of
him, that <hi>he makes our Saviour a Coward.</hi> But
if I prove that he represents him as such, then
the Prophaneness will lie at his own door.
Though, it is true, our Saviour used great
Caution at the first Preaching of the Gospel,
and did not on all occasions and to all persons
declare himself to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> yet he was
not so Reserv'd and Timerous as this Writer
would have us believe, for he hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to say in his <hi>Reasonableness of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
that Christ <hi>made no other discovery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the beginning of his Ministry but by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and Circumlocutions, and general Discourses,</hi>
p. 59. And in an other place of that Book he
saith he did this lest the <hi>Sanhearim should have
laid hold on what he said, to have got him into
their power, and thereby to take away his life,</hi>
p. 62. And afterwards he saith, our Saviour
would by no means <hi>in express terms profess
himself to be the</hi> Messias, p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 72. and that for
the same reason. Nay, he tells us that out
of this wary and cautious principle he never
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57882:48"/>
               <hi>in the whole course of his Ministry, so much as
to his Disciples, much less to the multitude, or the
Rulers of the Iews, declared himself to be the</hi>
Messias <hi>in express terms,</hi> p. 148. And in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a hundred pages together, <hi>(viz.</hi> from
p. 59. to p. 152.) he labours to instill this
Notion into the minds of his Readers, that
our Blessed Lord had not Courage enough to
own himself to be the Messias, the views of
<hi>Danger</hi> hindred him from letting the world
know Who he was.</p>
            <p>But how contrary is this to what we read
in the Evangelical Writings? When the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Samaria</hi> had mentioned the Messias,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 25. Christ immediately thereupon
said unto her, <hi>I that speak unto thee am he,</hi> i. e.
the <hi>Messias.</hi> Here in plain and direct words
he owns himself to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> and this
was at the very entrance of his Ministry.
Again, we are assured that <hi>he went about all
Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom,</hi>
Mat. 4. 23. i. e. that the <hi>Messias</hi> was come,
and that he himself was that <hi>Messias,</hi> for it
was no more dangerous to proclaim himself to
be the Messias, than to tell the Jews that the
<hi>Messias</hi> was come, for they would soon know
what Particular Person it was. Further,
though our Saviour (as is particularly taken
notice of by the Evangelists) shew'd his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Discretion in not exposing himself
to unnecessary dangers by too great a freedom
of speaking, yet at the beginning of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
we find that he plainly, and without any
reserve told the Jews that <hi>God was his Father,
Iohn</hi> 5. 17. or, which is equivalent, that <hi>he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57882:49"/>
was the Son of God,</hi> which is as much as if he
had said, <hi>he was God;</hi> for so the Jews inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
it in that place, for they said this was
<hi>making himself equal with God,</hi> v. 18. He told
them at the same time that <hi>he had power to
raise the dead,</hi> v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1. and that he is to be <hi>Iudg</hi>
of the world at the last day, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 27. that
<hi>all men ought to honour him as they honour the
Father,</hi> v. 23. that he gives <hi>Eternal Life</hi> to
those that believe on him, <hi>v.</hi> 24. and more
fully and amply in other expressions in that
Chapter he publickly and expressly declares
himself to be the Messias and the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
And it is observable that he made this free,
plain and open profession of himself, and his
Divine Nature, and Messiaship at that very
time when the <hi>Iews persecuted him, and sought
to slay him,</hi> v. 16.</p>
            <p>Judg then of the Truth and Consistency of
what this Dabler in Scripture and Divinity
saith of our Saviour, viz. That <hi>in the whole
course of his Ministry</hi> he never expresly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himself to be the <hi>Messias</hi> Nay, (which
makes it the more unaccountable and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious)
he holds that Christ never all that
time own'd himself to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> although
according to him, there was no other Article
of Faith propounded by Christ and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to be believ'd to make a man a Christian
but this, that <hi>Iesus is the Messias.</hi> Judg of the
truth of what he saith, <hi>viz.</hi> that our Saviour
<hi>always spoke to the</hi> Jews (whether his own
Apostles and Disciples, or others) <hi>concerning
himself in obscure and mystical terms,</hi> p. 99. as
being afraid to speak out, and standing in awe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57882:49"/>
of the <hi>Angry Iews, who sought to kill him,</hi>
p. 85. Is not this clearly confuted by what I
have alledged out of the <hi>Gospels,</hi> and is it not
further confuted by what we read in Mat. 10.
28, 32? where our Saviour dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wades his
Apostles from <hi>fearing them that kill the body,</hi>
and requires it of them as their duty that they
<hi>confess him before men,</hi> i. e. (as is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from comparing <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 22. with 12. 4)
that they <hi>confess him to be the</hi> Messias. And
can we think that they were obliged to do
this unless he had plainly told them that he
was the <hi>Messias?</hi> But, according to this New
Expositor, Christ exacted more of his Apostles
than he dared to do himself; for he was Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and Fearful, and therefore would not
confess himself to be the <hi>Messias;</hi> he had not
Spirit and Valour enough to own that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
<hi>in the whole course of his Ministry,</hi> lest he
should thereby be in <hi>danger of his life,</hi> as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
it. What is this but belying our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour, and <hi>making him a Coward?</hi> And
who but a <hi>Poltron,</hi> a Cowardly Flincher from
the Fundamental Articles of our Faith would
entertain such a vile and impious thought of
our Lord and Master?</p>
            <p>It is pleasant to see p. 222. (which should
indeed have been mention'd before) how this
Imperious Dragger up of Youth handles the
Antient Grave <hi>Citizen</hi> who dedicated a Book
to him, and most submissively crouch'd to
him. In stead of acknowledging his good
will and respect to him, this Supercilious and
Unmannerly <hi>Well bred man</hi> snibs him for his
<hi>forwardness,</hi> and condemns him as a <hi>System-Maker,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:57882:50"/>
though the poor man had rail'd in
three or four places of his Pamphlet against all
<hi>Systems.</hi> What a Magotted <hi>Vindicator</hi> is this?</p>
            <p>Now our <hi>Pilgrim</hi> is approaching towards
his journeys end, and therefore p 403<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

It is the unhappiness of this Gentleman, who
I think means well as to the main, that he hath
espous'd a Groundless and Unscriptural Notion,
and then thinks himself obliged to vindicate
it. Good man, he is easily warped, as his
best Friends complain and lament. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to be serviceable in an honest Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Discourse, but find him not able to

complexion,</hi> p. 24. and he often boasts
himself to be one of <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Mildness.</hi>
But then he must mean it thus, that he comes
sober and gentle to destroy our Religion, and
to shatter Christianity, of which he hath
given us sufficient proof in these as well as in
his former papers.</p>
            <p>Nay, we must not think him to be so <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi>
and <hi>Mild</hi> as he would perswade his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

You see the man disgorges <hi>choler,</hi> in stead of

his new Friendship and League with the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator,</hi>
whose upstart Conceits he is resolv'd
to defend, and especially the <hi>One Article,</hi>
though it be with defiance of all the other
parts of Christianity. Accordingly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
with much confidence that the <hi>belief of
Iesus</hi>'s <hi>being the Messias is the ONLY Article
indispensably necessary to make a man a Christian,</hi>
and (as the Consequence of that) that the
belief of <hi>more</hi> is unnecessary. Pref. p. 4.</p>
            <p>Which is as much as if he should speak thus
to his Auditors, <q>There are a great many
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57882:52"/>
Ministers of the Gospel that hold it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the making a man a <hi>Christian</hi> that
he should believe several Truths and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
recorded in the New Testament, as
that <hi>we are by nature the children of wrath,</hi>
that we are freed from this wrath by the
Meritorious and All-sufficient Undertakings
of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> who is both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi>
that he gave himself a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for us, and
satisfied Divine Justice by paying an Infinite
<hi>Price</hi> for us; that hereby he hath purchased
Justification, Pardon of sins, and Eternal
Life for us; that this Saviour and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
rose from the dead, and is exalted unto
Glory, and will judg the quick and the dead
at his last appearing. But, my Friends, I
must tell you, those that preach these doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
as necessary to be known and believ'd
in order to make men members of Christ
and of his Church, talk idly and impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and are not at all to be attended to. For
it is my opinion, and I have preach'd to you,
and I have thrice printed it, that none of
those foresaid doctrines which either Jesus
Christ or his Apostles deliver'd, are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believ'd to give you a Title to
Christianity. You and I may be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
though we are ignorant of every one
of those Doctrines before rehears'd, though
we know nothing of the nature and intent
of them, nay though we never heard of
them: for there is but <hi>One</hi> Article of Faith,
and no more, that is required to make us
Christians, and that is this, that <hi>Iesus is the
Messias.</hi> If you believe this, take it upon
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57882:52"/>
my word, you need nothing more (I mean
as to matter of <hi>Faith</hi>) to make you True and
Living Members of Christ. This alone is
that which properly deserves the Name of
<hi>Iustifying Faith,</hi> and is that Faith which
God will impute to a man for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I have been blamed by several of my
Brethren in the Ministry for preaching and
printing such doctrines as this, and they have
baffled me (as they think) out of the Holy
Scriptures, and have demonstrated that there
are sundry <hi>other Points of Faith</hi> that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be believ'd in order to the making
a man a Christian; but I can't be brought
to listen to what they say. Neither Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
nor Dissenters shall bring me off from
this perswasion. I will rather stick to Worthy
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> then part with
my Opinion at the sollicitation of Thousands
of Divines and other Christians whom they
call <hi>Orthodox.</hi> I'm chiefly confirm'd in this
Notion by the latter of those Gentlemen
whom I named, who cruises up and down
the Countries to propagate this doctrine,
and I hope will take <hi>Steeple</hi> in his Circuit
very suddenly, and then he will further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy

matters relating to Religion, which no
Christian ear ever heard of before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> had asserted the <hi>Darling
Proposition,</hi> he presents us with an other,
which is no less strange and monstrous, and
from whence we may guess at the Character
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57882:53"/>
of the Man, who is Mr. <hi>L's</hi> humble admirer.
His express words are these, Pref. p. 5. <hi>A
mans knowing that Iesus Christ hath revealed
such a doctrine, brings him not under an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to believe it, but he may, notwithstanding that,
withold his Assent.</hi> This is the maxim of Mr.
<hi>L's New Christian,</hi> but the Mischievous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of it are sufficient to shew the nature
and design of this Writer: for though he will
perhaps say that he delivers that afterwards
which is contrary to the interpretation which
I make of these words, yet the Answer is
plain, that he makes nothing of Contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself, and therefore this is no Plea. He
can say, and unsay, as he thinks fit, of which
I gave several Instances in my <hi>Reflections</hi> on
what he writ before. This then is no excuse
at all, but rather shews his <hi>Weakness,</hi> that he
can't tell when he talks inconsistently; or his
<hi>Insincerity</hi> and <hi>Perverseness,</hi> that he will make
use of Contrarieties to serve his own ends.
I know likewise he will say that he speaks this
of those Doctrines the belief whereof doth
not constitute a man a Christian, but this is a
mere Evasion, and he can't possibly make use
of it with any shadow of Sense; for if you ask
him what those Doctrines are, he will tell
you that they are those which I before speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and reckon'd as <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
But he denies them to be <hi>such,</hi> and
he can't do otherwise; for if there be but <hi>One</hi>
Article of Faith necessarily to be believ'd to
make a man a Christian (which is the thing
he so stiffly maintains) then all the rest are not
necessary to be believ'd to make him so, or to
denominate him to be such.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57882:53"/>Having thus prevented and obviated the
Cavils which he might start, I'll now very
concisely present unto the Reader a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
on that Proposition which I quoted out
of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s last printed Papers, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>I
knowing that Christ hath reveal'd such or such a
Doctrine, brings not a man under an obligation
to believe it, but he may notwithstanding that
with hold his assent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, this baffles the <hi>end</hi> of Christ's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
his doctrines to the Sons of men, for
without doubt they were reveal'd for this
very purpose, that we should yield assent to
them. But this Gentleman tells you that
there is no such thing, <hi>Revelation</hi> hath no
affinity with <hi>Assent,</hi> and therefore this could
not be the End and Design of that. And
herein he follows the Patern sent him by a
late Writer in his <hi>Christianity not mysterious,</hi>
p. 38. <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not a
motive of Assent, nor a ground of our persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or a reason we have to believe a thing, as
if we were to receive it only because reveal'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This separates Knowledg from
Belief, and makes Religion, and even Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
it self a mere Notional Speculative
thing. We may according to this Wise
Shaper of Christianity read the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and see what Christ and the Apostles
deliver'd there as matter of Belief, but we
are not under an obligation to believe what
they delivered. We may, if we please, look
into the <hi>Gospel</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> (but have a care
of peeping into the <hi>Epistles</hi>) and thence stock
our selves with Propositions, and furnish our
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57882:54"/>
Brains with Knowledge, as well as our Tongues
with something to talk of, but we are excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from yielding <hi>Assent</hi> to the truth of them.
Such a monstrous Idea doth this Writer give
us of that Sacred Institution of the Blessed
Jesus.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This is bidding defiance to the
Divine Authority of the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ures, for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
refuses to <hi>believe</hi> those doctrines which
are reveal'd in the Sacred Writings, doth in
effect declare that those Writings are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inspired. And yet Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Disciple as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
his Reader that though Truths and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
be reveal'd in the Writings of the New
Testament, yet we <hi>are not obliged</hi> to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to them, and to profess our belief of
them: which is no other then annulling the
Authority of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This Assertion destroys that very
<hi>One Article</hi> which he contends for, for if the
revealing of a Truth obliges us not to believe
it, then we may with hold our Assent to this
Proposition, <hi>Iesus is the Messias,</hi> as well as to
any Other; for seeing they are all equally
reveal'd in the Scripture, we ought to make
no difference. So that you see the poor <hi>Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Builder</hi> pulls down his own Structure with
his own hands. The Beloved Article which
he so much insists upon is ruined by what he
himself asserts. This is the just Judgment of
God on such audacious Innovators, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravers
of Christianity: Whilest they are
throwing down the Propositions which others
with great reason assert, they demolish their
own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57882:54"/>Fifthly and lastly, This wild Proposition of
the <hi>Replyer</hi> is destructive of all <hi>Reveal'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
Let there be never so many doctrines
reveal'd to us by the Holy Spirit in the Divine
Oracles, a Christian is <hi>under no obligations</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to him to believe them, for all being
alike <hi>reveal'd</hi> they may be equally disbeliev'd.
This is the New Theology of our giddy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper
of that Idol Opinion of <hi>One Article.</hi>
One would scarcely think that he should at
this time of day have the confidence to talk
after this rate, and to impose such dangerous
and pernicious notions upon the world. Or, at
least one would think that this Writer and his
Fellow should not stare, and shew themselves
so extraordinarily concern'd when we tell
them that they are <hi>Betrayers of Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having descanted on his Main Propositions,
and seen what the dismal Contents of them
are, I'll look into some other things which are
most obvious in his <hi>Reply.</hi> I expected he
would have attempted to purge himself of
those <hi>Self-Contradictions</hi> which I laid to his
charge, and proved in the plainest manner
imaginable from his own words, which I
faithfully set down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he, like his brother-Criminal,
deni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, but gives no reason why
he doth so. He follows the example of the
<hi>Vindicator,</hi> and unmercifully <hi>Repeats</hi> what he
had said before: And all the rest is studied
Evasion, Subterfuge, Whiffling. It is in vain
to mention all the Particulars; it shall suffice
to propound to the Reader's view one of them,
and from that let him guess at all the others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:57882:55"/>I had been proving in my <hi>Reflections</hi> on Mr.
<hi>B.</hi> the Absurdity of the Opinion of <hi>One Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
and had shew'd how he contradicted
himself, one Instance whereof was this, that
he had said, that <hi>a True Christian is as much
oblig'd to believe that the Holy Spirit is God, as to
believe that Iesus is the Christ</hi> (which are
his own words) and yet he saith, <hi>There is
but that One Article [Iesus is the Messias] to
be believ'd to make a man a Christian</hi> Whence
I inferr'd (and whether justly or no, let the
Reader judge) that he spoke things repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and contradictory; for if a True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
be <hi>as much oblig'd</hi> to believe one as the
other, then it is certain that a man can't be a
True Christian without believing both, and
if there be a necessity of believing both to
make a man a True Christian, then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of one only is not enough. Now, mind
what the <hi>Replyer</hi> saith to this, and how fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laciously
and sophistically he discourses, p. 19.
<hi>It is as necessary for me,</hi> saith he, <hi>to believe that
Iesus was at</hi> Cana <hi>of</hi> Galilee, <hi>and turn'd Water
into Wine there, as it is that he was crucified
without the Gates of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>because I have
the same evidence for the one that I have for the
other. But I can not say it is of as much Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for a man to know the one, as it is to know
the other; much less can I say that no man can
be a Christian till he knows and believes that
Iesus was at</hi> Cana <hi>in</hi> Galilee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is
so extraneous and foreign, and every ways so
impertinent and inconsistent, that if one did
not know with what Writer this Gentleman
symbolizes, it might create astonishment to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57882:55"/>
hear such a sensless and incoherent application
of these words: for whereas I had asserted
that a man can't be a True Christian unless he
believes other Articles and Doctrines, <hi>(viz.</hi>
such as I have mention'd before) as well as
that <hi>One</hi> of <hi>Iesus's</hi> being the <hi>Christ;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to disprove this he should have
shew'd that <hi>those Articles</hi> are not as necessary
to be believ'd as that <hi>Single one</hi> he mentions,
he (not regarding the matter he was about)
produces some Historical passages out of the
New Testament, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's being at <hi>Cana
of Galilee,</hi> and turning Water into Wine there,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then thinks (though one would think
it is impossible he should) he hath effected
what he undertook. But doth not any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
man see that there is no comparison
between these things which he alledges and
those other before spoken of, between the
belief of some <hi>Historical Circumstances</hi> and
the belief of the <hi>Grand Fundamental Points</hi>
of the Christian Religion? Is there not a vast
difference between these <hi>Inferiour Truths</hi> and
those that are of an <hi>Higher nature,</hi> even such
as are of the Essence of Christianity, and have
Immediate respect to the Salvation of our
Souls? Though the belief of the former be
not absolutely necessary to make a man a
Christian, doth it follow thence that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the latter is not necessarily requisite
for that purpose? Who but the <hi>Replyer</hi> and
the <hi>Vindicator</hi> (for he takes his part as to this
very thing in his <hi>Vindication</hi>) could first ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
any such thing, and then puhlish it to the
world? What Talent of Reasoning Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:57882:56"/>
had before he undertook this Cause of the
<hi>One Article,</hi> I can't tell; but since I am sure
he is a very poor Arguer, and makes out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of what he pretends to, but fills up his
pages with weak, dilute stuff, yea without any
dash of what is sprightly and generous.</p>
            <p>And that he and his Cause run very low,
is evident from what he saith, p. 24. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his One Article. <hi>The Notion,</hi> saith
he, <hi>of One Article may induce those who embrace
it, to esteem more Persons Christians than the other
Notion can allow of. And thus far I fancy</hi> (and
you say right, Good Sir, it is no more than a
<hi>fancy) the advantage is on the former's side, for
I conceive there is no hurt in letting Charity, as
well as Patience, have its perfect work.</hi> Thus he;
and he is pleas'd to confess that <hi>this is the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
that comes from a cold Phlegmatick temper.</hi>
If he means that it is very flat and dull, I
think every body will agree with him. Tho
truly we must grant that here are some foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of <hi>Ingenuity</hi> (such as it is) for here is set
forth the <hi>True Cause</hi> why this doctrine of <hi>One
Single Article</hi> is so vigorously urg'd at this day,
and even upheld by Pensions Old <hi>Reynard</hi>
would not say a syllable of this throughout
his whole Treatise of the <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> and his two <hi>Vindications</hi> of it. He
thought it was too gross and broad, therefore
the Dissembler conceal'd it. But Unwary
Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> who tells all he knows, acquaints
us with the true and proper design of the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of One Article, and the furious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against all the rest. By this means, saith
he, we shall have <hi>more Christians</hi> (such as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57882:56"/>
they are) then ever were before. There
are many that will imbrace One Point of
Christianity, who will refuse to own the rest,
so that we shall have <hi>Christians</hi> in abundance.
But whether they be <hi>True Christians,</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be <hi>esteem'd</hi> to be such (that is his
word) is not material: but we shall have the
<hi>Number</hi> of these latter much increas'd and
that's enough. And besides, saith he, we
shall have more <hi>Charity</hi> (and <hi>there is no hurt</hi>
in that:) when there is but <hi>One Single Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
of Christian Faith, we shall all Agree,
and what a fine world shall we have then?</p>
            <p>Ay but, Sir, would it not be a better world
if there were <hi>no Article at all,</hi> and then besure
there could be no Contention? whereas now
there is occasion for it, for some will not allow
of the <hi>One Article</hi> you speak of. Therefore
according to your own way of Arguing it
were best to throw off that One Article, and
with it all the other Fundamental and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
doctrines of our Christan Faith, and then
it is certain we shall have no Point of Faith
to fall out about, and <hi>Charity</hi> will ride in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and yours and Mr. <hi>L's Christianity</hi>
shall bear it company in the same Triumphal
Seat. This is the force and strength of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Reasoning, whatever he may pretend.
Surely <hi>Steeple</hi> is well taught when such a one
is their instructer. Who would have thought
that there is such a Pious Contriver for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in any part of the Kings dominions?
Who could have thought that All the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Principles of our Faith (except one)
were to be cashier'd to make way for <hi>Charity?</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:57882:57"/>
And who can think that the <hi>One Article</hi> so
much talk'd of will remain long without the
rest? And, in a word, what man of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ense
and sobriety can think that these wild Notions
are not spread abroad on purpose to subvert
the Foundations of Christianity, and to bring
in Infidelity, and to turn us out to the herd
of <hi>Deists</hi> and next to <hi>Atheists?</hi> Let not Mr.
<hi>Bold</hi> say that these are <hi>Guesses</hi> (as in one place
I remember he saith I am a <hi>Guesser,</hi> because
I am a <hi>Critick,</hi> which is as much sense accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his applying of it, as if one should say
he is a <hi>Conjurer</hi> because he is <hi>Rector of Steeple:</hi>)
No, Sir, here is no Conjecture for the thing
that I say is plain and obvious, and depends
upon natural and rational consequences, and
we every day see more and more the truth of it.</p>
            <p>As Dull and <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> as he is, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
is ripe, witness that horrid Fiction
and False Imputation p. 25. line 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
I must not stand upon these things.</p>
            <p>Then he would argue from the use of the
term <hi>Christian</hi> p 25. that there is but <hi>One Article.</hi>
which is so poor and mean that he <hi>deserves</hi> to
(be what he is) Mr. <hi>Locks Second</hi> in the present
Combate. Yet he hath so good an opinion of
this which he suggests, that he saith, <hi>It may
afford some light to this matter.</hi> No, Sir, there
is no such thing as <hi>Light</hi> here only a <hi>Wooden
Candle-stick.</hi> I am loth to suppose any <hi>Brass</hi>
about it, though one would wonder how he
could have that face to offer any such thing as
this to prove that there is but <hi>One Article</hi> to
be believ'd to constitute a Christian man,
which was the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter he undertook.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:57882:57"/>Our Mushrom-Scribe is drawn to the dreggs,
and in his next Paragraphs doth nothing but
Cant, and Hover in Obscure and Ambiguous
terms: but hath not a dram of Reason left,
as the Reader cannot but own, if he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to do but to consult the pages.</p>
            <p>Then he <hi>Catechises</hi> his Friends, p. 29, 30,
31. and makes sorry work of it, but at last
it is observable how this Wild Reasoner, who
had been all along in his <hi>Reply</hi> (as well as in
his former Papers) endeavouring to assert
the necessity of but <hi>One Article</hi> in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and opposing what I had said in behalf of
<hi>More Articles,</hi> it is observable (I say) that
at last he gives up the Cause, and meekly
prostrates himself to what I had offered: <hi>Let
a man believe,</hi> saith he, <hi>never so many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
doctrines taught by Christ and his Apostles,
that belief will prove no more but that he believes
Iesus is the Messias,</hi> p. 32. If the believing of
<hi>many doctrines</hi> taught by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
be the same with believing that <hi>One do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
why then hath he made all this stir?
for if <hi>many will prove no more than one,</hi> then
<hi>vice versa, one will prove to be many;</hi> and if
his <hi>One Article</hi> be thus <hi>multiplied,</hi> than why
doth he quarrel with me for asserting Many
Articles?</p>
            <p>But still there must be (whatever comes
of it) but <hi>One Article,</hi> and he undertakes to
prove it, p. 36. from St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s words, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
believeth that Iesus is the Christ, is born
of God,</hi> 1 John 5. 1. <hi>Which every one,</hi> saith he,
<hi>I suppose will acknowledg to be as much as to say,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Christian.</hi> And thence infers, <hi>If the belief
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57882:58"/>
of more Articles was absolutely necessary to make
a person a Christian, it could not with truth be
said, Whosoever believeth that Iesus is the Christ
is born of God.</hi> Which is a farther proof of
the Shallowness, or (which is worse) of the
willful Obstinacy of this blind Worshiper of
the Idol that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> have
set up: for any one that is moderately vers'd
in this Epistle of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> knows that it is a
Collection of several Marks and Evidences
whereby persons may examine and know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be True Believers, and Christians
indeed; and among several others which he
assigns this is one, that <hi>they believe Iesus to be
the Christ.</hi> Now, can any one that is not
very Weak or perverse infer hence, that the
belief of <hi>no other Article</hi> but this is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to make a man a Christian? Is it
not plain from other places in this Epistle that
<hi>Love to God</hi> and <hi>the brethren, keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
&amp;c. are Signs and Evidences of
Regeneration, as well as <hi>believing Iesus to be
the Messias?</hi> And why then upon the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
of this latter in the place forecited,
must we conclude that none of those are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to make one a Christian or
a Regenerate person? If we should follow
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s way of Interpreting, then, when
it is said in this Epistle, <hi>Every one that doth
righteousness is born of God,</hi> ch. 2. v. 29. we
must infer that <hi>doing of righteousness,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>believing,</hi> gives us a title to <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
And when it is said, <hi>Every one that
loveth</hi> (which refers to <hi>loving one an other</hi>
in the same verse) <hi>is born of God,</hi> ch. 4. v. 7.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57882:58"/>
we must thence gather that <hi>Brotherly Love</hi> of
it self, abstract from all <hi>Believing,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
from <hi>believing that Iesus is the Messias,</hi>
is the only thing necessarily required of us to
make us Christians; and so our Learned and
Profound Arguer baffles himself, and ruines
his own One Article.</p>
            <p>Our Rambling Disputer tells us in the same
place, that <hi>St.</hi> John <hi>the Divine was a more
Reverend Rector than the Rector of</hi> Steeple:
where, besides the Whimsical Conceitedness
of the Stile, he humbly intimates that <hi>he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
is a <hi>Reverend Rector,</hi> for else he could not
say, the other is <hi>more Reverend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What he demands, p. 40 about those terms
<hi>the Son of God</hi> and <hi>the Messias,</hi> I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
in the foregoing Discourse.</p>
            <p>I urged from Acts 8. 37. that <hi>the Son of God</hi>
and <hi>the Messias</hi> are not terms of the same sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
because else the <hi>Eunuch</hi> could not
say that he believ'd <hi>Iesus Christ to be the Son of
God.</hi> To which he returns this fantastick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<hi>I think,</hi> saith he, <hi>they amount to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more,</hi> viz. <hi>that Iesus Christ is The Christ.</hi>
Which hath not the least foundation in the
<hi>Original,</hi> from whence only he can pretend to
borrow it, and therefore we must look upon
it as a mere Shuffle. And indeed afterwards
he doth as good as confess it, for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his <hi>thinking</hi> it to be a good Reply,
he unthinks it, but puts us off with an other
groundless Conceit, (the same that the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi>
had made use of) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Iesus Christ
is used in the New Testament as a Proper Name,</hi>
as if only his <hi>being call'd Iesus</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57882:59"/>
sense of those places where the words <hi>Iesus</hi>
and <hi>Christ</hi> are so often mention'd in Scripture.</p>
            <p>At the conclusion of all, I must own myself
obliged to this <hi>Dorset-shire</hi> Gentleman for any
thing that he hath sai'd of me in some places
of his last Papers that looks Respectfully and

to appear again, and one of them hath
publish'd a Pamphlet which he calls at
a venture <hi>The Agreement of the Unitarians with
the Catholick Church,</hi> &amp;c. And truly I am to own
with great thankfulness the honour he doth
me there of joyning me with Three Learned
<hi>Prelates</hi> of our Church. I am bound to make
some Return for this extraordinary kindness,
and perhaps he may meet with it somewhere
in this Paper. But this I must needs add that
he is <hi>too</hi> lavish and excessive in his favours
when he gives me the <hi>Preference</hi> to those Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Persons both in his <hi>Title</hi> and his <hi>Book:</hi>
for the First part of this Learned Scrible bears
this Inscription, <hi>An Answer to Mr. Edwards,</hi>
wherin the Nameless Author pretends to say
something with relation to a Book which I
lately committed to the publick view, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul'd
<hi>The Socinian Creed:</hi> in which I first gave
a brief, but impartial Account of those Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
and Unsound Principles which are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57882:60"/>
generally espous'd by the <hi>Foreign</hi> and <hi>English
Socinians;</hi> and then I shew'd the proper Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of them to Irreligion and Atheism.</p>
            <p>So that according to this Distribution of my
Work, the <hi>Socinian</hi> Brother who undertook-to
<hi>answer</hi> it was obliged in the first place either
to confess that those Principles and Tenents
were owned by that Party of men both at
home and abroad, or else to prove that they
were not. And then, as to the Other Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of my Task, he was bound either to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that the <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
have a Tendency to Irreligion and Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or else he was under a necessity of shewing
that they have no such thing. Any man of
good reason and sense would expect these
things from him, and accordingly let us see
what this Anonymous Writer hath done, and
thence gather whether he hath acted the part
of an <hi>Answerer,</hi> which he took upon him.</p>
            <p>As to the first Part it is plain before the
Readers e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es that this Pamphleteer is so far
from disowning <hi>most</hi> of those Articles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which I fix'd upon the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and from
charging me with wronging them in asserting
that the <hi>Foreign</hi> and <hi>English Socinians</hi> defend
these very Articles in their Writings, he is
so far (I say) from this that in effect he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
to the world that they are the
very doctrines and sentiments of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and that they are <hi>worded</hi> in that very
manner as I set them down, and that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
whom I quoted deliver'd them in those
very terms, and that I have not misrepresented
any of them. Which undeniably appears from
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57882:60"/>
this, that he undertakes not to invalidate <hi>any
one</hi> of my References or Quotations. If I had in
the least perverted the sense and meaning of
any single <hi>Socinian</hi> Writer that I produced,
if I had in any degree falsified in my Citation
of them, I should most certainly have heard it
from this Gentleman in this his last Effort,
especially when he particularly mentions my
<hi>References</hi> and <hi>Quotations.</hi> p. 3. Out of that
vast number of them which I made use of he
would not have failed to set down one Instance
at least, if he could have met with it, of my
injuring the <hi>Racovian</hi> Authors by falsly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
their Writings.</p>
            <p>But so it is, there is not one single Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Reference, which I brought to prove
and confirm what I avouched concerning the
<hi>Socinians,</hi> that he excepts against; which most
assuredly he would have done, if there had
been the least ground imaginable for it. And
'tis certain that he had <hi>Time</hi> enough to do it,
since I publish'd what I writ, if the thing had
been any ways feasible: and I suppose it will
be granted that he wanted not <hi>Will</hi> to effect
it. So then from his not doing it, nor so
much as attempting it we may conclude his
utter Inability and hereby he doth as good
as grant that the <hi>Socinians</hi> are guilty of All
they stand charg'd with by me in the <hi>Socinian
Creed.</hi> He lets the world know that I have
done them right, and that I have father'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon them falsly. He vouches the
Truth of my Collections, he asserts the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of my Testimonies and Proofs out of
the Original Authors. By all which he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57882:61"/>
and convicts himself, and stabs his own
Cause. And yet this he calls an <hi>Answer to me.</hi>
Let the Reader judg of the Consistency of
these things, and thence form a suitable Idea
of this Wild and Sensles Undertaker.</p>
            <p>Then, as to the <hi>other</hi> Articles of the <hi>Socinian
Creed,</hi> it is observable that he is loath to let
the world know by a formal Confession from
him that he and his Friends allow of those
doctrines, and therefore he betakes himself to
the wonted way of Shuffling, Equivocating
and Dissembling; and indeed he performs
this part to a Wonder, and almost exceeds
the late <hi>Vindicator</hi> in this excellent faculty.
It is pleasant to see how he higgles and dodges.
says and unsays, hath neither regard to the
Truth, nor to what he saith himself. But we
must not think this strange, for that man will
take the liberty to contradict himself who is
Resolved to do so to others. Nay, it cannot
escape the Reader's observation that this Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous
Scribe, merely to avoid the Imputation
of some Articles I fastned on the <hi>Socinians,</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

there are several others:) <hi>He may for our parts,</hi>

others of their Pamphlets they have derided
and exposed the <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of our
Saviour: and yet now they <hi>Anathematize</hi> those
that do so.</p>
            <p>Which, with abundance of other the like
Instances in this last attempt of theirs, shews
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57882:62"/>
a Prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igate sort of Writers they are. They
are not afraid to call down a <hi>Curse</hi> upon their
own heads: and with their <hi>Execrations</hi> they
mix the most palpable and notorious <hi>Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,</hi>
and thereby convince us that they have
abandoned all Faith and Integrity, that they
are under an obstinate resolution to debauch
their Understandings, to abuse their Reasons
and Consciences, and to impose upon the
world.</p>
            <p>We must either say this of them, or else
(which I would be most willing to believe)
that they are disposed to a <hi>Recanta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion,</hi> and
are inclin'd to relinquish several of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
which they stifly mantain'd before. I
hope it will be improv'd into a full sincere
Renuntiation. However, I have gain'd this
Point; that I have brought them to Retract
in words at least, some of the Articles of <hi>their
Creed.</hi> It is worthy of our Remark that
whereas in some of their first Prints they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
very tamely to the name of <hi>Socinians,</hi>
now this Gentleman throws off this Character,
and will no longer bear that Badg: which
shews that they are Changeable, and design
some New model, and have a mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o have
it graced with a New Title. Our Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Trimmer proclaim his <hi>Agreement with
the Catholick Church,</hi> and very orthodoxly he
would seem to talk concerning <hi>the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Christ</hi> and some other Doctrines, p.
25, 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he were inclin'd to tack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and leave the <hi>Socinian</hi> quarters. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he intends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is plain that he confutes
himself and his Party, and then he calls it an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57882:62"/>
to me.</hi> Indeed these are the best sort of
<hi>Answers</hi> a man woud desire: and to say Truth,
the Party cannot afford any other.</p>
            <p>But behold the Inconsistent Folly and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
of the Man! Though he frankly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to my References and Citations, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
throws up some of the Articles of his own
<hi>Creed,</hi> yet he is pleased to charge me with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famations</hi>
in the Title-page of his book. An
Intelligent person would think that those
Great and Undeniable Truths which I had
asserted in my late Treatise are neither <hi>Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi>
nor <hi>Defamations,</hi> they being founded
upon Reason, Antiquity, and Scripture. Nor
could the several members of the Inditement
which I drew up against the <hi>Socinians</hi> deserve
that Name which he uses, because he himself
owns the greatest part of them to be True.
Wherefore all that can be said is that <hi>Infama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
is a dainty term that he is much taken
with, and accordingly he resolv'd that it
should come in some where, right or wrong,
into his Papers; and where better than in the
Front of them, to make up the <hi>Raree Show?</hi>
But if we will attend to the true import and
meaning of the word there, it is this, that the
<hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines are <hi>Infamous,</hi> and that I
had rightly represented them as <hi>such,</hi> and that
this Writer, who dare not shew his head, or
subscribe his Name, is not able to disprove
<hi>either</hi> of these things. Thus it is the deserved
Lot of this sort of men that the more they
write the more they expose themselves, and
discover to world the Incoherence of their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions,
the Vanity of their Pretences, the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57882:63"/>
Weakness of their Judgment, the Strength of
their Prejudice, and above all the Badness of
their Designs and Projects, which all Wise
and good Men see and abhor.</p>
            <p>Next, as to the Second Part of my late
Discourse, it is to be observ'd that he makes
no Reply to the imputation of that <hi>Tendency to
Irreligion and Atheism</hi> which I so often urged,
and as often proved against the men of <hi>Racovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi>
and the very <hi>English Unitarians.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I was not singular in this Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them, for I evinc'd it to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of Others (of Great Judgment and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity)
that sundry of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Opinions
have a natural Vergency to <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,</hi>
and one that hath writ since, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
to the treat the Socinians with <hi>Civility
and Good Temper</hi> (and would be so treated by
them again, as he bespeaks their kindness in his
<hi>Preface</hi>) is not shie of using this very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
but in plain and downright terms tells
us that<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Norr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>the generall Principle on which the body
of Socinianism turns is of that nature that it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
the most Absurd, and withal the most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and Blasphemous Proposition imaginable.</hi>
And in another place, <hi>As from a Socinian it is
easy to commence a Deist, so he that is once a
Deist is in a hopeful way to be an Aiheist when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he pleases.</hi> And afterwards thus, in his
Address to the <hi>Socinians, The Consequence of
your Principle,</hi> (viz. That nothing is to be
believ'd but what they can comprehend) <hi>leads
you not only out of Christianity, but out of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

               </hi> And
again he tells them, that <hi>their Principle of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
nothing but what they can comprehend
directly leads to Atheism.</hi> It seems then that
though <hi>Atheism</hi> be voted by some a <hi>Rude</hi> and
<hi>Unmannerly</hi> word, and though <hi>Atheist</hi> be
thought to be an <hi>Ungenteel</hi> term, (wherefore

not modish and fine enough for some mens
mouths, yet we see that this Gentleman, who
<note n="†" place="bottom">Pref. to the Account of Reason and Faith.</note> remonstrates with some Passion against that
Rudeness of Stile which he espies in some
Writers, and particularly engages before hand
to shew himself <hi>Civil</hi> to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> yet
boggles not in the least at this way of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but with great freedom and boldness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
it to be his Opinion and Belief that these
men are in the next capacity to be <hi>Atheists,</hi> and
that their Principles and Doctrines directly
lead to <hi>Atheism,</hi> as well as to <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</hi>
And that we may know he is in good
earnest, he repeats this over and over again.
This is the very thing which I undertook to
prove in my late Discourse (and I hope to
the satisfaction of every unbiass'd Reader)
by that plentiful Enumeration and Induction
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57882:64"/>
of Particulars which I offer'd, whence I
demonstrated that a great number of the
<hi>Socinian Articles</hi> naturally tend to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of Irreligion and Prophaneness, and
even to the effacing of the Sense of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>
            <p>But what saith our present Author to this,
who hath taken upon him the Office of an
<hi>Answerer?</hi> Why truly he Skulks, and hides
his baffled head, and hath not one syllable to
say for himself, or against me. This is a new
kind of <hi>Answerer,</hi> a Silent one, because he is
conscious to himself that nothing can be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd.
It is not to be doubted that if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Charge could have been evaded any
ways, he would have attempted it.
Had there been any thing said by me
against his Party which he could have
disproved, questionless he would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
it. Had there been any shew of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Truth on his side, he would have let
us known it. Had there been any Excuse to
be invented, he would not have fail'd to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it, and that with open Mouth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all persons of Understanding must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that he acknowledges the Truth and
Reality of what I objected to the <hi>Socinians,
viz.</hi> that most of their Doctrines and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
damp Religion, and nourish Vice, and
foster Atheistical and Licentious Practises:
which is the thing that makes <hi>Socinianism</hi> so
Fashionable at this day, and gains it so many
Proselytes.</p>
            <p>And now from the whole what a Strange
Prospect have we of the Undertaking of this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57882:64"/>
Doughty Champion for the <hi>Socinian</hi> Cause?
I appeal to the Reader whether his Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and Shatter'd Pamphlet can be call'd an
<hi>Answer,</hi> and consequently whether the Men
of <hi>Racovia,</hi> who have much pretended to

               </gap>ignificancy go along with it or no. They

               </gap>d
the Gentlemen before hand that <hi>if any
thing substantial in the way of Reply were offer'd</hi>
by them, I would not be backward to meet
the Answerer with a Rejoynder: but here is
nothing that looks like it, he is so far from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
any thing of <hi>Substance,</hi> that he doth
not so much as pretend to a <hi>Shadow</hi> of any
thing that is of that nature. There is not one
Proposition that I laid down which is shaken
by him, and he hath not so much as started
One Objection against all I writ, and yet he
hath the Confidence and Effrontery to dub
his Pamphlet an <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be this will end well, it seems
to argue that the <hi>Socinians</hi> are drawn to the
very dreggs, and have nothing to alledg in
their behalf. This looks as if their Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries
were inclined to a Treaty of Peace,

with the Arguments I propos'd, neither
doth he produce any of his own. He raises
no Exceptions against me nor takes any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of mine against him. Nay, which is
Wondrous and Astonishing, his Invention is
so barren that he can't coyn any new Cavils
against what I deliver'd, nor rally up any old
ones. Thus when they have no Forces to
bring into the field, the War must needs
cease. When they surrender their Garisons
and Holds (as I have shew'd they do) and
fairly give up the Cause, what can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
but that they are coming over to us?</p>
            <p>And as for my self particularly, whatever
the matter is, they are very Complaisant,
and surely they intend in a short time to take
me into their favour For though this Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Judge is pleas'd to tell the world that I
have writ some <hi>trifling books</hi> (those he means
that I have writ against his Brethren of <hi>Raco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>)
and some <hi>indifferent ones,</hi> those I suppose
which I have writ against a <hi>Friend</hi> of theirs
lately) yet out of abundant grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
he vouchsafes to declare that somebody
<hi>hath been serviceable to the Common Christianity
by some Learned Books,</hi> p. 17. (I wish I could
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57882:65"/>
say as much of our Author): and again, that
<hi>he hath writ divers Good Books, and one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
one,</hi> p. 3. Though one would be loth to
take a Disciple of <hi>Socinus</hi> upon his bare word,
and though it would be immodest and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
to attribute or apply any such thing
to my self, yet as it is the frank Testimony of
an <hi>Adversary,</hi> who would not esteem it as a
singular Mark of Favour? who would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
these Obliging Kindnesses from an <hi>Enemy,</hi>
especially when they are mixed with <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as in the present case? for then it is a
sign that the Approbation forced its way
through Calumnies and Falshoods. In short,
I perceive they have a mind to be Friends
with me, they would have at least a Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Arms, if I would agree to it.</p>
            <p>On which occasion I will take leave to say,
that I am most heartily Glad that I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in this Cause, maugre all the insults of
the Adversaries; I thank the <hi>Father of Lights</hi>
that he was pleas'd to dispose me to this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Service, and in such a Juncture,
when the whole <hi>Posse</hi> of the <hi>Unitarians</hi> and
their <hi>Allies</hi> attack'd the Christian Faith with
such Force and fury. When these <hi>Granadiers</hi>
came on so fiercly, who could but expect an
<hi>Assault?</hi> who was not sensible that Religion
was invaded, and that Christianity it self was
in extreme danger? It is a Comfortable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
to me that I have born up against the
Bold Aggressors, and that I have, according
to my mean powers, asserted and vindicated
the Truth with that warmth and zeal which
become every Christian Breast. And now I
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57882:66"/>
must tell them I scorn to flinch from so good a
Cause as I have undertaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I will never
submit to gratify the humour and genius of
<hi>Deists</hi> and <hi>Scepticks,</hi> or any Well Willers to
<hi>Racovia.</hi> Though I am as great an Admirer
and Lover of <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Good Temper</hi> as any
Man, yet I will never be bribed to a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Relinquishing of the Truth. No: I
will by the Divine Aid, vindicate the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the New Testament, and the Faith of
the Christian Church in all ages, and that
with open face. And particularly, as to
what I last writ and publish'd, I will make it
stand the shock of the most daring <hi>Socinian</hi> in
<hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to let these Gentlemen see that I am
no <hi>Man of Contention,</hi> I declare to them that I
am not averse from complying with their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
if they be Sincere and in Good Earnest,
and if they resolve not to violate their own
Articles of Peace. I will forgive their <hi>Colts
teeth</hi> (as this pleasant Gentleman words it) if
for the future they use not (as they have done
in most of their Writings) <hi>those of the Bear.</hi>
And why indeed should I contend with these
<hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Men? for that is the
Stile now in their last Print. Who will fall
out with those that profess <hi>Agreement with
the Catholick Church?</hi> But especially the Title
of <hi>Orthodox</hi> (which they so abhorr'd) is
much courted by this Author, as the Reader
cannot but observe. Which may be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to us to think that these Persons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to do something to deserve that <hi>Name.</hi>
It is my hearty Prayer and Wish that they may
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57882:66"/>
shew themselves to be of this number. And
I promise them thus far to yield to the Terms
of Peace, that if they renew not the Quarrel,
and assault me not afresh, this shall be our
Last Campagne, and so here is an End to our
Debates and Rencounters.</p>
