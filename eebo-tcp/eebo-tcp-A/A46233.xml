         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have for a long time had an earnest am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to offer something unto you that
might be, in part at least, worthy of your
self; and I hope you will make this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to be so, by your gracious acceptance,
suffering it to wear your livery: The Author
of it was a very learned man, whose works can
be no waies prejudiciall to any person of
Honour. The subject of this Book is seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and of great Importance, I fear no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
but that it may not be judged so suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for your younger thoughts. Yet I presume
you wil not be offended with me, that I should
conceive such ripenesse and maturity of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in you beyond your yeers, as to tender
a Book to your patronage, whose subject may
deservedly imploy, and stumble too, the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the greatest Sages, and learnedst
Rabbies of our times: For my own part I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

of wit, that are commonly bare outsides and


<pb facs="tcp:59673:3"/>
make a crackling noise in the world, having
no solid matter containd in them. Yet I know
such empty vanities can hardly want Patrons;
It were then great pity that such a rare piece
as this should fail of a favourable <hi>Maecenas.</hi>
The question here agitated is, Concerning
<hi>Natures Constancy,</hi> (and not concerning the
Inconstancy of vain mens Manners) which
I wish idle brains would seriously reflect upon,
<hi>viz.</hi> whether this age wherein we live, may
not afford persons (for man is the chief thing
here considerable as famous for their valour,
for skill in all Arts and Sciences, and all other
Noble qualities and endowments, as there
were in former dayes. The Author who
maintains the Affirmative, hath made it
good, as I suppose, beyond all exceptions, and
therein hath paralleld, and I may say, exceeded
by force of Argument, any that have maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the contrary; and that to the vindication
of his own particular, in this excellent Book
of <hi>Natures Constancy.</hi> True it is, that there
were many men formerly of great Honour
and Renown in severall Countreys, and men
of our daies, are reputed generally to be as Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
compared with those Giantlike Heroes
that were before us; and in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
I think it cannot be defended, but they
might surpasse us. Yet in regard we have the


<pb facs="tcp:59673:3"/>
benefit of their labours and our own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
we, though dwarfs, standing on their
shoulders may see farther than they could. For
since the flood, commonly men lived no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than we do now, and they wanted the help
of many things that we enjoy; God hath been
bountifull to every age in some notable disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
never known before. For even in that
very thing that learned <hi>Archimedes,</hi> is so
much magnified for, his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that we have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of such who carped at those that were eminent
for Parts, in the times they lived in, and
would give them no commendation because
they were not Antient.

            <p>We may, nay we shall honour our Ancestours

For the men of <hi>Israel</hi> &amp; <hi>Judah,</hi> had no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paterculus</hi> a singular Historian, seemes to
hold the Negative, but that is meant onely,
as to the rising and falling of particular Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that like to mans life, have their childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
youth, vigour, and olde age. As Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
distribute the times of diseases, wherein


<pb facs="tcp:59673:4"/>
are to be observed, the beginning, augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
state, and declination of them. For even
as a man being to go up a hill, first comes to
the foot of it &amp; so mounts higher by degrees til
he come to the top, and then he must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
go down again, as being able to go no
higher. So there is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> and top-point
in all humane affaires, which being once
gained, they fall back as far as the low rise they
first had. We see this largely verified in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ages, (I will not be tedious to rifle Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to set them down here) wherein we read,
that Learning and Military Arts, and purity of
Religion have flourished wonderfully, yet by
degrees they have all failed and worne away,
and as grosse ignorance and pusillanimity;
blindenesse and superstition have succeeded
them, as can be imagined; like to the seven
yeers of famine in Egypt, wherein the seven
yeers of plenty were forgotten, as if they had
never been. But that this is not so in the
generall course of the world, that hath a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
revolution, and circular motion, is cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seen in the very change of the yeer; For
spring goes on to summer, summer to Autumn,
Autum to Winter, and so comes about again:
No spring so good, but, if not the next, yet
some yeers following, may present us with the
like or better, however the declining Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,


<pb facs="tcp:59673:5"/>
and cold hoary Winters have passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.
I am of opinion that the Author who
maintained this Theorem, not as a paradox,
but as a reall truth, hath obliged our Age to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize
his memorie, for giving us this hint
to exasperate our endeavours, and for chalking
out the way, whereby we may be able to do
more than any Age before us. That they should
not so much reflect on former times, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that God had reserved somthing for them,
if they would not be wanting to themselves.
No <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars are here set up, with a <hi>Non

Poland happy, unto this present time, there
are as many Senatours of the Kingdom, of
your house as you have had Grandfathers, and
great Grandfathers in former ages, and all
of them of so great vertues, that all vertues seem
to be bred in your courts. That there were pios
men amongst them, the founding of Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and their large bounty to the Church can


<pb facs="tcp:59673:6"/>
testifie, that they were Magnanimous persons,
appears by their laying aside the supreme ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and undergoing meaner Offices, for the
publike good. Your Ancestours far before the
<hi>Lepidi,</hi> have out-run their yeers, by the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their wife actions, and were made Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Senatours, at that age that <hi>Scipio</hi>
could not think of being Consul. And why do I
speak of former dayes? Your Grandfather was
for this very thing of most famous memory,
who so raised Piety and Magnanimity to the
height, that were his hereditary vertues, that
he hath the name of the Patron of the True
Religion, and seems to be an example of most
prudent Oratory. To say no more, the most
Illustrious Lord your Father lives, and I wish
he might live alwaies, of whom so many &amp; so
great things may be said, that the slendernes of
my wit cannot comprehend, nor my low style
expresse. The Church calls him, her nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Delight: The Senate their Eye, the
Nobility, the light of the common wealth, the
Muses their Patron; and to say what I would in
brief; Men think that in his brest is bred, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
vertue and prudence can be bred in any
Noble person. But most Illustrious Lords,
what shall I say of you and your two brothers?
I look upon your Illustrious and most Noble
Mother, descended from the <hi>Lesznii,</hi> and the


<pb facs="tcp:59673:6"/>
Dukes of <hi>Sanguscii,</hi> and you proceeding from

follow in the Autum of your yeers. Most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious

much of you, and your most noble family.

               <p>REader, it is the common opinion, and
is in every mans mouth, that this world,
and all things therein contained, do
run towards their end, by a universall and
perpetuall declining to worse and worse; and
that there is nothing now in being, or can
fall out, that may, I say not be prefer'd, but
be compared to the dayes of our Forefathers.
That neither the uniformity of the Heavens,
is the same as it was of elder times, nor the
fruitfulnesse of the Earth, nor the same vigour
is in Plants and Animals, nor is the statute or


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59673:9"/>
age of man so strong. <hi>The excellencies of
Arts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scion. l. 8. c. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>are, by reason of the worlds growing old,
exhausted, and can do but little that is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and but in few things.</hi> Astraea <hi>is gone to
the gods, &amp; there is no man, in common society, that
may be compared with</hi> Aristides <hi>or</hi> Socrates; <hi>in</hi>
Policie with the <hi>Fabii, Scipio's,</hi> or <hi>Marcelli;</hi>
in <hi>Houshold Government,</hi> with <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the
wives of the <hi>Myniae, Manlius,</hi> or <hi>Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
in the Church, with <hi>Ambrose, Hierome, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi>
In the Schools, with <hi>Aristotle, Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
Cicero, Galen.</hi> In brief, All things run down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and they come not back again. But how
true these things are reported, I leave it to
every cordial man to consider, in the fear of the
Lord. As for my own part, and what concerns
those that I follow, I see that hereby the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God is dishonoured, the commendable
indeavours of Men are hindered. For if the
supreme God will not have it, that his Name
should be honoured with as much reverence,
as it was formerly done, why then doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
so much at our hand? And if he will,
wherefore doth he not bestow on us as great
gifts, as he did on our predecessours. It cannot
stand with his Omnipotency, that the treasure
of his power should be exhausted. As for mans
Industry, this is certain, that a preconceived
distrust, will be able to do as much, as Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
can in women great with childe,
that sets marks upon Infants; or the conceits of
Melancholy people, which being strongly
printed in their minde, can torment them
sometimes for many yeers, and sometimes bring
them to their ends. This matter is confirmed
not onely by the example of <hi>Franciscus, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59673:9"/>
of Saluzzium,</hi> who being bewitched by the
predictions that were written in favor of <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifth, degenerated from <hi>Francis</hi> the first,
from whom he received his Marquisdom; but
also, all those Learned Worthies (I say nothing
of others who make such a pretence for their
idlenesse, or ignorance) who think they can
bring nothing into the Exchequer of Learning,
because they think they can say nothing which
hath not been already said.<note place="margin">Quintil. Orat. 12.</note> Wherefore <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi>
speaks the truth; <hi>If men had thought
thus, that no man could exceed him that was the
best, they that are so, had never been the best.</hi> Lest
therefore the truth should be in captivity,
the Majesty of God dishonoured, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of men, and from thence their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
should be shut up in prison; I having
borrowed matter, especially from a large Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
written in <hi>English,</hi> by that reverend man,
<hi>D. George Hackwil, S S T. D.</hi> concerning this
Thesis, yet preserving my own meaning, I
thought fit to bring to publike view the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
things that are objected against it, and to
communicate the same with the learned
world. But while I deny that the world doth
universally and perpetually run to worse and
worse; I understand by the world, the whole
compasse of the Heavens and the Earth, and I
mean an universall ruine to worse and worse,
in respect of all bodies therein contained; and
I intend a perpetuall decaying, in respect of
the duration from the beginning unto the end;
So that the meaning will be this, That this
Frame of Heaven and Earth with all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
therein comprehended, by succession of


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59673:10"/>
time running along from the first to the last,
doth not by nature slide and run to worse and
worse. Yet I grant that the Elements are
changed one into another, that mixt bodies are
subject to alteration and diminution, that the
earth hath lost something by the Fall, and the
Flood; That the Manners of men and Arts do
vary; That there is difference in the length of
mens lives; And that sometimes some Arts are
lost, But because.

The Sea hath formerly taken away some
Islands, and we read in Histories of some new
ones come up in their rooms. <hi>God hath made
Fruitfulnesse, or Barrennesse, neither in all places
certain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Icon. Anim. c. 2</note> 
                  <hi>nor yet perpetually.</hi> They are the words
of Barclay, <hi>Those lands that were most fruitfull
in former times, are now barren wildernesses, and
dry sands; and those countries that were once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
cold and unfruitfull, are not now onely fit
to bear corn, but abound with those things that are
for delight.</hi> Formerly <hi>Ireland</hi> was a Mart for
the Muses, now, unlesse it were adorned by that

esteem it to be almost a Barbarous place. <hi>Greece</hi>
was formerly the famous place for Wisdom,
now it is despised for its idlenesse and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
So all ages have their Genius, that
directs the minds of mortall men to certain
studies:<note place="margin">Barclay l. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                  </note> some ages are chiefly exercised in Wars,
then again all things are peaceable; then peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are in love with Kingdoms, then with
Common-Wealths; sometime they are all born
as it were Barbarous, then again they grow
more milde, and more easie of conditions;
and then again after some ages they return
to their first blockishnesse. So the world hath
often been adorned with the refined manners
of Men; and afterwards, Industry failing, vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as it were in a cloud. Moreover, there are
times in all Countreys, wherein men live either
longer or shorter;<note place="margin">Veridam in Hist. vitae &amp; mortis.</note> longer, most commonly when
the times are Barbarous, and the Diet more
plain, and more given to bodily exercise; short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
when they are more civill, and there is
more Luxury and idlenesse; but these things
have their turns, &amp;c. And this is our opinion:
But since the world is considered either in
sprect of it self, or in respect of its parts
in speciall, and these do contain more bodies
under them, there must be many Propositions
set down in clearing this Thesis; and
these are the propositions that seem to me, to
appertain thereunto.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. That the world in respect of the whole,
doth not alwaies grow worse.</item>
                  <item>II. Nor in regard of the Heavens.</item>
                  <item>III. Nor in regard of the Elements.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59673:11"/>
IV. Nor in regard of mixt bodies both Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and Animate without reason.</item>
                  <item>V. Nor in regard of Man. Wherefore our
discourse shal be employed in the refutation of
the contrary, and confirmation of these propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions;
And thou, Christian Reader, read this
without prejudice, and consider with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>

               <head>Proposition I.</head>
               <head type="sub">The world in respect of it self doth
not alwaies run to worse.</head>
               <p>THis is most true. For the Wisdome of
<hi>Solomon</hi> saith, that the Spirit of the Lord
fills the whole world; That which the
<hi>Platonists</hi> calls the Soul of the world, is nothing
else but the power of God, that manifests it self
no lesse in preserving the Frame of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
than it did in creating it. Whence saith
<hi>Justin Martyr, As that which is, had never been,
unlesse he had commanded, Let it be made: So
would it not continue, unlesse He had given order
to those things that do not perish, that they should
alwaies abide; and to those things that come and
goe, that they should alwaies increase and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi>
And Learned men in Schools, compare
the dependance of things Created upon the
Creatour, partly to Light, which is extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Ayre, by the Suns absence, partly to a
Vessel that contains the water within it, partly
to a Print made in Water. II. There are
two principles that constitute naturall bodies;


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59673:11"/>
Namely, matter and form. That, because it is
not generated, it is not corrupted; for it is without
any contrariety, and therefore cannot naturally
be destroyed: but the nature of This, is, that
when one departs an other succeeds in the same
matter.

                     <l>â€” Nothing born can die,</l>
                     <l>But all things successively,</l>
                     <l>Are changed but formally.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can it be otherwise in Nature; For it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
no annihilation, nor can she do that
more than she can create; nor where there is
any augmentation, can any diminution happen.</p>
               <p>III. But should we grant that some parts of
the world do alwaies decrease; other parts
thereupon will increase, or else diminution or
annihilation must follow, and if this be granted,
an incredible disproportion will fall out between
them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and an infallible ruine must come upon
that. And then for some thousands of yeers the
Influence of the Heavens had faild, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation

the Apostle writes, <hi>That the world is subject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and that it shall be freed from the bondage of
corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the sons of
God.</hi> We cannot deny but these are <hi>Cyprians</hi>
words, <hi>You must know in the first place, that the
world is now grown old, that it stands not so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as it did stand, nor is it so vigorous as formerly it
was, &amp;c. In Winter, there is no such plenty of show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to nourish the seed, nor in Summer is the Sun so
beneficiall to ripen the corn; Nor are plants in the
Spring so prosperous by reason of temperate weather;


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59673:12"/>
nor are Trees so fruitful with fruit in Autumn. There
are fewer Marble stones dug forth of the Mountains
that are worn out; they afford lesse quantity of Silver
and Gold; Metals are exhausted, and the slender
Veines daily grow lesse and decrease. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
failes in the Fields, Concord in friendship,
skilfulnesse in Arts, Discipline in Manners, &amp;c.</hi>
All these things are true, yet this is most certain,
that our Tenent is nothing weakned by this, nor
is the contrary any whit confirmed. First of all
that Book of <hi>Esdras</hi> hath nothing but a false Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and is most injurious. What we found in the
sixth Chapter are mere Fables, concerning <hi>Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth</hi>
and <hi>Leviathan;</hi> and that is false that is
spoken of the consummation of the world. The
Apostle onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ntimates the impuritie and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
that the Creature contracted by the fall of
Man, and also the declining of Individuals, and
the hastening of the species to a totall and finall
dissolution by Fire; Lastly, the abuse of them,
with the dishonour of the Creatour, joyned
with the wrong done to his servants, which are
the things he complains of. It is no wonder
also that <hi>Cyprian</hi> writ such things.<note place="margin">L. 3. Exor, Hist. e. 5.</note> The times
were then so bitter by reason of Wars, Famine
and Pestilence, that the Christians of that age ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the end of the world to be at hand, &amp; <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serus</hi>
writ that the opening of the second and
third Seal hapned in that time. But a few yeers
after, that lamentation was turned into joy. For
not only under <hi>Galienus,</hi> otherwise a most
cruel Persec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sent forth to the Churches; but also under
<hi>Constantine</hi> was that Woman in the Apocalyps
brought back into the clear light, which <hi>Nero</hi>

had driven into the Desert, and which had lain
hidden there for a Time, Times, and Half a time,
or 245. yeers. But also unto this, may be opposed
the <hi>Disciple of Saint Augustine, Orosius,</hi> whose
words are these. <hi>Let them remember with me the
times of their Ancestors, that were most unquiet by
reason of Wars, most hainous for wickednes, most foul
for dissentions, most miserable for a long continuance,
which they may deservedly be afraid of, because they
were, and they have need to beg that they may be no
more; to beg that of God onely, who then suffered
his secret Judgements to break forth, and now
his Mercies are manifest by removing them.</hi> And that
that Axiome is false, appears not only by the state
of things, but also by the effusion of the grace of
God by the Incarnation of Christ, in the yeer
3947. But that it must be understood of violent
motion, is without all doubt.</p>

of the Elements be the same, and that both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of want of action in them both, and for the

matter is joyned to such a form, that satisfieth the

whereby it may become subject to any corruption,
and though it be subject to corruption, (which is
the truth) as we finde it in the Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 102.</note> and thence

do the same again. And should we maintain that
the course of the Starres were changed, how
then could Mathematicians foretell the yeer, day,
hour, nay the very instant of Oppositions, and
Conjunctions, and Ecclipses, so many yeers
before. <hi>Lactantius</hi> concluded from thence that
the Stars are no Gods, because they cannot alter
or exceed their bounds or usuall Motions.<note place="margin">Lactant. l. 2. Insti. c. 5,</note> For
were they Gods they might wander here and there

                  </gap>lls
are free, they go up and down where they please,
and as their mindes lead them, thither they go.
And <hi>Plutarch</hi> wondering at this uniformity, Such a
great magnitude of things (saith he) such dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them, such a constancie in observing
times and orders, could not either formerly be
made without a Provident Artificer; or remain so
many ages, without a Potent Inhabitant; or be
governed for ever, without a Knowing and Skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Ruler, as Reason it self declares it. And
if we would hold that the Heaven's standing still,
is agreeable to the Scriptures, and to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Antient Fathers, and should we assert
that the Starres onely are mooved by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Motions, and that they are in the heavens no
otherwise than living Creatures are upon the
Earth, Fishes in the Water, and birds in the Ayre;
yet would the matter be the same. <hi>Not the light.</hi>
For as at first the waters were dispersed over the
Face of the Earth: So was the Light through the
Firmament. And as the waters were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into one heap; so was the Light bound up in
one body: &amp; as that was called the Sea, so this was


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59673:14"/>
called the Sun. As therefore the Sea loseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
though it water the Earth with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Rivers; so the Sun loseth nothing by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
of his Light. And if it be true, that
at <hi>Padua</hi> tow Pitchers were dug up, inclosed in
one, which <hi>Olybius Maximus</hi> dedicated to <hi>Plato,</hi>
for they were full of a liquor wherein a Light then
burning, was preserved<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for many ages. And if
that be not false also, that is written of another
Candle that was found burning in the Sepulchre
of <hi>Tullia,</hi> what should we doubt of the Heavenly
Light? Especially seeing that the Father, according
the opinion of those who hold the Soul to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>traduce,</hi>
loseth nothing of his own Soul, when he
communicateth a Soul to his Childe, but it is as
Light borrowed from Light. As for the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning Heat, this doth of it self belong to
the stars; yet God hath given this unto them, that
they may be the cause of it, in things capable of
heat. That they do it not by Motion, is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Suns standing still in <hi>Joshua's</hi> dayes, and
the temper of the middle Region of the Ayre, that
declines unto cold: but by their light, the beams
whereof, if they fall Perpendicular, if they be
reverberated, then is it stronger, and this is almost
a certainty. For the Summer, and Winter Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament
of the Ayre, and the effects of the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Glasses of <hi>Archimedes</hi> and of <hi>Proclus,</hi> seem to
confirm as much. When therefore we shew that
the Light is not diminished, every man may
easily know, what to think of the Heat. We need
not much troouble our selves concerning the
Influence. For if the substance remains Entire,
how can these Operations ceose, that flow from

But you will object to the contrary, that in
former times the Torrid Zone was unhabitable,
that the Sun is now neerer to the Earth, and not
so far remote toward either Pole: and
lastly, that the Pole Starre in the Tail of Ursa

that the Sun in Winter is not so far from us

and <hi>Hipparchus;</hi> and not so neer toward
the North in summer. For <hi>Ptolomie</hi> about the
yeer of Christ, 140. discovered the greatest decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Sun, from the Equinoctiall Line, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
either of the Poles, to be 23, degrees, 51.

minutes, 20. seconds, and because he found that
account to agree with the observations of <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
who lived 130. yeers before Christ, and of
<hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> who preceded him, he thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that the Suns greatest declination was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable.
But in the yeer of Christ; one thousand
four hundred and thirty, the most learned Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
of the Arabians, found the same declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be but 23. degrees 35. minuts. To whom
<hi>Albategnius</hi> subscribed, who lived in the yeer, 880.
But in the yeer 1070, <hi>Arzachel</hi> an Ethiopian born
in Spain, took the greatest Declination, which he
found to be 23 degrees, 33 minutes, 30 seconds;
and that he might salve the differences of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
he invented a new Hypothesis. <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
afterward, following him, in the yeer 1520.
concluded that the Suns greatest declination was
mutable, yet never greater then 23 degrees,
52 minutes, nor lesse than 23 degrees, 28 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
and he taught us that in the space of 1 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
seven hundred and seventy yeers, the Sun
would passe from the former to the latter; and
again, in so much space of time, the Sun would
go back again, from the latter to the former.
Therefore out of this Hypothesis of <hi>Copernicus,</hi>
about 65 yeers before the birth of Christ, the
greatest declination of the Sun was 23 degrees, 52
minutes, from which time, calculating backward,
it hath ever grown lesse and lesse, untill about
1782. yeers before Christ, the greatest Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that, counting backward again as before, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
untill in the yeer, 3499 before Christ, it
grew to be 23 degrees, 52 Minutes. Lastly, <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
writes of the Pole Star, in the Tayle of Ursa


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59673:16"/>
Minor, that in the Days of <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> it was 12
degrees distant from the Pole of the World, and
now a dayes it is hardly four degrees from it, and
he supposeth, that when it shall come to stand in
the Poles place, (which may be within 500 or 600
yeers,) the period shall be, which God hath set to
Nature. I willingly grant all these things, yet I
see not what inconvenie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce will happen to our
cause thereby. Since they, that are of a faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this, do defend a universall declining, they
must also of necessity say, that the cold zones by
the cold being increased, are become inhabitable,
and that the forces of men are so worn, that they
can by no means endure it. The suns neerernesse
to us, is either founded upon false principles,
or the Suns declination is uncertain and changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For <hi>Ptolomie</hi> about the yeer of Christ, 140
placeth the distance of the Sun from the Earth,
in 1210 Semidiameters of the Earth, but <hi>Albate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnius,</hi>
about the yeer 880 found it to be 1146

the most learned, Doctor <hi>Banbridge, Astromonie Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59673:16"/>
in the famous university of Oxford,</hi> thinks
that the Suns Declination is immutable, and
that the difference of some minutes, between
us and <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> might arise from some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
amongst the Antients in their Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whence it will follow that the Sun is not
farther removed toward the South, nor is he
come neerer to the North. Yet however, if
we should grant that there were a mutability,
it would follow, that as the Sun was 65
yeers before Christ, farther off toward the
South, than it is now; so in the yeers that went
before those yeers it was not farther off. And
when that the greatest Declination is at the
highest, the Sun in winter wil be farther toward
the South, and neerer in summer toward the
North; But when it is at the lowest, it will be
all contrary. Lastly, if any inconvenience
may fall upon us thereby, that is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
by the convenience, that befalls them
that live toward the South, and so nothing
can be collected thence, for to prove an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
falling of the World from worse to
worse. The opinion of that Rare man is
grounded on a weak foundation, for the
Pole Star wil never remove to be in place of
the Pole of the world, or be so straightned
that it cannot proceed forward. I grant indeed
that after 50 yeers are gone, it will be very
neer to it, but it will go back again, and it will
become more Northerly, as it is now Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and this seems to be most certain; and if
the comming neer, or going farther off from
the Pole, by other Stars, do not shew the end of

the world, what reason will perswade us that

But it is not so in any of these. What
concerns their number; The common opinion
is, that there are four, but Three is the truth:
for the Fire is but the supronie part of the
purer Air, that is more subtile, hot, and free
from exhalations. For since the Scripture doth
no where speak of Fire, no not in <hi>Genesis</hi> where
things created are described, why should we
maintain it? And if that solid Element of
Fire, should differ in subtility and thinnesse,
from the Sky, or the uppermost part of the
Air, a new refraction of the Stars must needs
follow, by reason of the Fire, and we should
be ignorant of their true places, which is false.
Moreover, Nature in the chiefest things hath
observed the number of Three. For to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the supernaturall Mystery of the
Trinity; there is a Trinity in Mans Sex, the
male, the Female, and the Hermaphrodite:
there are three first principles of naturall
things, as Matter, Form, and Privation: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
there are three sensible principles, Salt,
Brimstone, and Mercury. There are three
principall parts in Man, and three kind of
spirits; the Animall, Vitall, and Naturall:
as also they have three Channels, or Vessels,
namely, the Nerves, Arteries, and Veins. There
are three humours in the Blood, as there are
in Milk. The Buttery part of Milk resembles
the Air, and so doth the Cholerick part of the
blood. The wheyish part of the Milk, and the
serene part of the Blood, resembles the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And the Crudly part of Milk resembles the
Earth, as doth the grosser Choler of the

it cast forth stones, after such vast flames, that

it obscured the Suns light. Lastly, it sent forth
such abundance of Ashes, that they covered

they be extinguished by the falling of rain, or by

want of remedy, and for anger at the losse, some
countrey men did cast stones on a far off, and as the
flames gave way, they went neerer, and with
strokes of clubs, and other things, they frighted

succeed after Comets; and the prediction of
evil may be recompensed with this good
successe. Concerning Earth-quakes, we
have heard almost nothing in these days;
if you except that which happened
in Apulia,<note place="margin">Cumanus.</note> 
                     <hi>Anno. 1627,</hi> that devoured 17000
men. Also that was very strange that fell
out in the yeer 1571, about the twelfth of
the Calends of March in Herefordshire in
England. For then at night about six of the
clock, the Earth parted in the East quarter
of that County, and a Mountain put forth
with a Rock that was under it: (First with
a mighty noyse and roaring, that all that
lived neer those parts heard it) as if it had
wakened out of some long sleep, and it riss to
a higher place, leaving its deep den, and
caried with it the trees that grew upon it,
Folds and Flocks of Sheep: Some trees were
swallowed up by the ground, others were
carried along with the earth, and were by
that means so united to it, as if they had
rooted there at first. From the place it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved;
it left a great empty cave, that was
foury foot broad, and eighty ells long: the
whole field was about twenty acres; In the
way it overturned a Chappel. It removed
a Yew-Tree that stood in the Church-yard,
from West to East; and with the same vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
it drove forward, the common wayes,
Sheep Coats, and hedges with the trees
planted in them. Thus when it had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

it stood still. Yet formerly they were more

You shall understand by the bringer of these,
what wonderfull and incredible damage hapned

that Minerals have a power in them, to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply

A vein of Brimstone is repaired in four
yeers. The earth Salt Peter is taken from,

                     <hi>Junius</hi> shews, that must be understood of
the Indian Elephants, that are greater than
the rest of Aethiopia. And they that have

maintain there are some greater than those
we see here. The influence of Eclipses up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these inferiour bodies, and the greater
frequency of them makes nothing to this
matter. For first, since an Eclipse is nothing
but the interposition either of the Moon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and the Sun, or of the shadow of
the Earth between the Sun and Moon; we
have no more need to fear any danger from
an Eclipse, than we should by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition

                     <hi>This order will

wherein the Sun by interposition of the Moon,

is afraid to send forth all his beames.</hi> Also
it is false that Eclipses ate now more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

and Earth have the same substance and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
they had; and Light and shadowes
have the same being, they had formerly,
and the Moons way or Latitude, from
the Eclipticke, is as it alwayes was.
See <hi>Bartholinus</hi> concerning these points,
<hi>Astrolog. Problem. Ultimo.</hi> Also it is false,
that they are greater than they were. For
in the yeer 1133,<note place="margin">In Chron. regum, Mannor. L. Hist. novel.</note> as <hi>Cambden</hi> writes, the Suns
Ecclipse was so great, that day was changed

The Observations of the Learned say,
the same is now done. And although as
in health there are degrees of Latitude, so
here: yet it is sufficient if it be infallible, for
the greatest part, and uniformity hold; the
other things being considered. At this time
we hold the thirty fifth yeer to be the flower
of Mans age, as being the Mean, between
seventy; and the Age our Savior died at,
unto which the Apostle in his Epistle to the
Ephesians,<note place="margin">Plutarch de Oracul. ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssat.</note> seems to allude. So it was in
former ages. For <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,

in mans Age. The same may be
said of Climactericall yeers.<note place="margin">Gell. l. 25.</note> Whereof <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>

For they receive Women at twelve, and
Men at fourteen, for Employments. But
here are two principall Objections, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
against this. Namely, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
before the Flood, lived very long:
and that Men now marry sooner then they
did formerly. I answer briefly to this. I
grant the first; and say, that is most false
that some maintain,<note place="margin">Whence it was the Patriarchs lived so long.</note> 
                     <hi>that their yeers contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely thirty six dayes.</hi> For were that true,
it would follow that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> begat
children at six or seven yeers olde at the
most. For the Scripture saith, This got chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at sixty five,<note place="margin">Whether the yeers they lived were onely of 36 dayes.</note> and the Other at seventy
yeers. Nor had any of the Patriarchs lived
to ninety seven yeers old, and many now
live above a hundred: and that would be


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59673:32"/>
false that the Scripture writes, <hi>that</hi> Abraham
<hi>died ful of dayes, a good old Man.</hi> For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their account he should be but
seventeen yeers old. And should we grant
this to be most true, yet this would evince
nothing for a generall decay of the world.<note place="margin">Joseph l. 1.</note>
For it seems that was done formerly for <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
sake,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Antiquit. c. 4. L. 1.</note>

                        </gap>de.</hi> Hence <hi>Rabbi
Levi</hi> as <hi>Genebrard</hi> quotes him, calls the long
lives of the Patriarchs, <hi>a work of Providence
and not of nature:</hi> or else by reason of their
diet. Hence <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> writes, That as
they had great wisdom, they found out all
Regiment of health, and secret Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereby their old age was retarded,
and by which when it came, it might be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated,
and their children had this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Experiments against old age;
For God gave them all wisdom, and so
they might live long. Moreover we finde
by constant observation almost in all
times, that in some Countreys, there were
some that lived longer than others, <hi>Epime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
of Crere lived a 150 yeers, <hi>Gorgias Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>

she was young she had borne fifteen chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
What shall I say of <hi>Luceia</hi> or <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
Copiola?</hi> She lived not a little more
than a hundred yeers; For it is reported
that for a hundred yeers, she played the

acted the maids part, and at last an old
Wives. <hi>Isra,</hi> the Player and Dancer; was
in her youthfull dayes brought upon the
Stage: how old she was then, is not known,
but after 99 yeers from that time, she
was again brought upon the Theater, not to
act her part, but to be shewed for a Miracle;
when <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great dedicated the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre.
Also she was again shewed at the
sports ordaind for to pray for the health of
<hi>Divus Augustus.</hi> In Scripture, we read that

<hi>Anna</hi> the Prophetesse, lived a hundred

a Fingers breadth, a Hands breadth were

measures were taken from a Man of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

Men are different, in severall Climates and

a certain principle, whence other measures
were made, as from parts that were certain.

his measures, there can be no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Wherefore the mean stature must be
the same now as it was formerly. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
the Jews had holy weights, or of the
Sanctuary that exceeded the ordinary
weights, and the Greeks had Royall Cubits;
yet I affirm that their ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ones did not exceed ours. For if the
Ark were measured by the common measure
it amounted to 540 Cubits, and shewed
that it was capacious enough. And <hi>Agrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
lib. de mensur.</hi> writes that <hi>Phya</hi> the wife
<hi>Pysistratus</hi> was accounted so tall, that they
honoured her as <hi>Minerva:</hi> yet was she not
above four common Cubits high. Also <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taches</hi>
the chief Officer in <hi>Xerxes</hi> Army, was
reported to be very tall, yet was he but four
royall cubits high, abating four fingers
breadth. As for the Romane measure, the
same <hi>Agricola</hi> writes, that a Romane Foot
was lesse than a French Foot, by two fingers;
and it is to be seen yet at Rome, in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Monuments, chiefly in the Gardens of
<hi>Angelus Coloccus.</hi> But <hi>Goropius Becanus,</hi> found
so me that were measured to be shorter by
four hands breadth, &amp; yet he was but a short
man in respect of ordinary Men. Lastly,
<hi>Nero,</hi> witnesse <hi>Suetonius,</hi> mustered a new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

allow <hi>Maximinus,</hi> every meal fourty, and
sometimes sixty pounds of flesh. <hi>Athenaeus</hi>
and <hi>Theodorus Hieropolitanus,</hi> assigne to
<hi>Milo</hi> of Croton, twenty pound, and three
gallons of Wine. In the dayes of <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the first, Emperour, there was a Man
at Auspurg, who eat a whole Calf raw, as
<hi>Surius</hi> writes.</p>
                  <p>And the Ancients allowed as much food.
For the Greeks as <hi>Suidas</hi> reports, allowed a
Chaenix by the meal. Whence <hi>Clearchus</hi> calls
Trophis in <hi>Homer. Herodotus,</hi> saith the
same was observed in <hi>Xerxes</hi> his army, and as
<hi>Polybius</hi> writes,<note place="margin">In Polym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> two thirds of a Medimnus of

with the former. For four Modii contained
thirty two Chaenices. But that which <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi>
writes of the Israelites, that three
Chaenices of Manna, were allowed
every Man in the Wildernesse, that was

long. <hi>Magius</hi> who hath written a Tract for
the contrary opinion, reports that the Tombs
at Pisa in Italy are no longer than ours are,
and he adds that at Pisaurum, in a Magazine
for Armour, he saw the Helmets of the Duke
of urbine dug up in the fields, neer Metaur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
where <hi>Asdrubal</hi> was conquered by the
Romans; his words are these, <hi>They were no
greater than our Souldiers more commonly. D.</hi>
Hawkewill <hi>saw in the Church of the Abbey at
Malmsbury,</hi> a Tomb that was said to be King
<hi>Athelstanes,</hi> and it was not greater then ours.
And in the place for dead bones in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
at Glassenbury,</hi> there could no bone be
found that represented any great stature.
<hi>Sands</hi> in his Travels writes, that entring
the Pyramids he met with such low and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
entrances, that he was forced to stoop
as he went. And he adds that in a spacious
place built of Theban Marble, that he saw
a Sepulchre seven foot long, and scarce four
foot broad. It was reported to be the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Founder, <hi>Charops.</hi> I saw at Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
two dead bodies Embalmed, that were
buried before Christ, one was of a small, the
other of a bigger stature, but neither of
them greater then ours. Those arms that are
sometimes shewed of a vast Magnitude, as
we saw in the Castle of the Earl of Fenton
in Scotland, the Sword of King <hi>Robert,</hi>
they were made to fright Men, or to vaunt
with, as appears by that Alexander did in the
Indies.<note place="margin">Exod. 27. 1</note> Yet the Altar of the Tabernacle
was said to be three cubits high. But if


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59673:37"/>
those Cubits were then taken by the stature
of the men then living, and men were then
four Cubits high, the Priest was but one
Cubit above the Altar, which was a cause
of trouble, certainly, in his Administration.
<hi>Solomons</hi> Altar was ten Cubits high,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 4. 1 Exod. 20. 26.</note> but it
had steps from the ground. And though
God may seem to have forbid men to go up
by them, yet that was onely that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
might not be seen. Against what
we now have said, five things are chiefly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                  <p>I. That ofttimes, Sceletons of vast sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and mighty great bones are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found.</p>
                  <p>II. The Bible speaks much of <hi>Samson</hi> and
others; and the Heathen speak of <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
Ajax, Hector, Hercules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. Physicks were given in greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
formerly, and blood drawn in greater
abundance.</p>
                  <p>IV. The duodenum gut is called so by
<hi>Herophilus,</hi> formerly because it was twelve
fingers broad in length; and now a dayes, it
is hardly four.</p>
                  <p>V. That impurity is contracted in the
seed by propagation in successive generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and, thence must necessarily follow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution

our opinion. As for the first, we
grant it is so. For <hi>Plutarch</hi> out of <hi>Gabinius,</hi>
which <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, is full of Fables, reports,


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59673:37"/>
that in Africa the body of <hi>Antaeus,</hi> was found
of sixty Cubits; <hi>Fazellus</hi> saith, seventy. In

the Second,<note place="margin">Malmes. l. 2. c. 17. de gestis Reg. Angl.</note> the body of <hi>Pallas</hi> was

writes that the body of <hi>Orestes</hi> was seven

not that in</hi> Pliny <hi>concerning</hi> Orion, <hi>though</hi> L.
Flaccus, <hi>and</hi> Metellus, <hi>who said they went to
see it, should swear it by their heads.</hi> We
must so deal with our Ancestours, as we
would have our posterity deal with us: But
what doth all this make against us?</p>
                  <p>I. It is apparent that Many things were
not rightly understood: then, many things
were added, that were Hyperbolically spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
when as the very antient writers did
not beleeve what was reported. There
might be some Money found in the <hi>Indies,</hi>


                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59673:38"/>
was presently added that <hi>Augustus</hi> his image
was upon it.</p>
                  <p>II. These monstrous Figures may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to Naturall or Artificiall causes, or
to both joyntly. Also great Princes
might make these things of ambition, or
Skilfull Artificers of curiosity, or Infernall
Devils of Malice and deceit. Truly that mad
building neer Amsbury, which the Ancients
call the Gyants dance, seems to proceed
originally from thence. What strange bodies
a thousand Artificers do often present us
with,<note place="margin">Delrius in l. 9. Mag.</note> may be collected from the history of
two Maids that were taken away, in whose
places other bodies were layd.</p>
                  <p>III. I know not whether it be wholly
impossible for Nature to make such bodies in
the very bowels of the Earth.<note place="margin">Whether prodigious bodies like Men can be framed in the bowels of the Earth?</note> For it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, that many bodies have been
found that represented the parts of Limbs,
and others that were like entire living
creatures. In the Dioces of Trevirs when
caement was dug forth to repair buildings,
they dug up black stones, like womens privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<hi>Diphyes,</hi> represents the Genitals of both
Sexes,<note place="margin">Agricola.</note> with a line to distinguish them, At
Salfelda in Thuringia, a stone was dug up
out of a Pit that was twenty fathom deep,
that was like a firme brest, a foot a half long,
three hands broad, on the fore part; where
the ribs ended it was six fingers thick, and
three where the whirlebands on the hinder
part were pierced in the middle. The back
bone was empty of that should represent the


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59673:38"/>
marrow; Also <hi>Goropius Becanus,</hi> saw in
England, a Stone cut out of the top of a
Mountain, that was exactly like to a Perch,
and not the least line wanted for its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
I will say nothing now of a Turnep
neer Harlem that was dug up in the yeer
1583. It was like a Mans hand with nails,
and all the distinctions of fingers, and the
lineaments; I saw the picture of it at Lyons,
with <hi>CL. D. Baudarcius</hi> my Patron. I will
say nothing also of that of <hi>Agricola:</hi> we
saw a small stature of a Man, that carried a
Childe on his shouders, made of silver by
nature. And if these things seem onely to
be understood of the outward forms descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and the matter to be wholly different,
let I beseech you Fossill flesh answer that
exception, which was reported to be found
sometimes, and of which in the fifth Classis
of our <hi>Thaumatographia,</hi> we spake some
things out of <hi>Libavius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV Lastly, <hi>D. Hawkwill</hi> thinks that such
vast bodies may be ascribed to the Divels
copulation with women. <hi>And truly, saith</hi> S.
Augustine,<note place="margin">De civit: Dei l. 15. c. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>it is a most frequent report, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

commonly committed wicked actions with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and have desired, and obtained to lie with

and many such men affirm it, that it

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59673:39"/>
writes that of such monstrous copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">In c. 6.</note>

<hi>Valesius</hi> and <hi>Delrio</hi> agree with him.<note place="margin">Gen. q. 6.</note> It is

it happened in the time of Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme
especially,<note place="margin">Delrio in disq.</note> when the Devil had most
power, but not so after Christ was come.
For that the Oracles ceased,<note place="margin">Magic.</note> and great <hi>Pan</hi>
was dead, not onely <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes in a
particular Book, but the History of <hi>Epitersis.</hi>
shewes the Proclaiming of his death about
Paxa. <hi>D. Hawkwell</hi> rests in this opinion,
But to speak truth, and to confesse ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
I scarse dare agree with him. For
though it were granted that the Divels
should lye with Women, yet it followes not
that they should conceive, and that for the
unfitnesse of the prolifique matter. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
are spirits and cannot have it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
First therefore they must be Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubi,
and steal it; and then Incubi and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it. And in the mean while the Seed is
spoiled of its inward heat and spiritall, as
being easily dispersed: whence it is, that
some Witches say they felt it cold. Further,
that seems to be a work of Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For if Gyants exceed so much, in
magnitude, that it hinders any actions, they
are to be called Monsters; And truly, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholinus</hi>
calls him a Monster, whose grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tooth, <hi>Augustine</hi> saith he saw. In the
interim every man may think what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.<note place="margin">Phys. ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 6.</note>
He that desires to know more exactly
of the Divels copulation with Women, let

him read, <hi>Ambrose Pareus,</hi> and <hi>Caspar Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinus</hi>

the second Objection, it is no more forcible
then the former; for neither did the latter
times yeeld to them, nor do our times fall
short of them. <hi>Tribellius Pollio</hi> speaks
the same of C. <hi>Marius, Capitolinus</hi> of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,

differences and names, were they new or old.
He knew perfectly the situation of places,

that we can do as much and more than they
could. For we have many helps the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
wanted. Amongst which the Art of

of Books are eased, which were so high in

Florens for three Books, and the
Books of the Antients are preserved for our
use. Onely this is necessary, that we may
employ lesse time in gaining languages, and
that Controversies in Religion may be
shortened, and that equall diligence may
be used, and the like Patrons may be
found. <hi>Aristole</hi> received from <hi>Alexander,</hi>

that some of them are dangerous to give;
yet this must not be denied, that it is onely
when an unskilfull Physitian useth them,
and they are prepared by an unskilfull Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist.
Otherwise Extracts and Tinctures
are stronger than Syrups, Decoctions, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions.<note place="margin">Senner. in Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paea.</note>
For when the profitable parts are
parted from the unprofitable, strange, grosse
and earthy parts, or as <hi>Schegkius</hi> saith, as
it were from their excrements, and reffuse,
as one may say, it cannot by any reason be
denied, but they must be more effectuall,
pleasing, and durable. To this belong Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick
cures, transplanting of Diseases,

the Antients speak very little, but <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

Spanish Philosophers, <hi>Sanchiez, Suarez,

If <hi>Keckerman</hi> had finished his that he

                     <p>The Doctrine of Angels, which many of

concerning Matter, the World,
Heaven, and other things are false. We
have them now corrected by <hi>Aslachus, Danae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,

age began again to spring up, at length in

that since that time hitherto is very exactly

                     <p>The totall doctrine of Logarithms was
first invented by <hi>John Napier</hi> Baron of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiston,
a Scotchman; whereof none of the

many Problems in Astronomy, Arithmetick
and Geometry are resolved with very little
bour, which otherwise were thought to be
impossible, or else to be exceeding hard, and
not to be unfolded but with much toil and
losse of time. <hi>Thomas Hariottus</hi> a most skilful
Geometrician was the first who taught men
to find out the Arpha of a Sphaericall Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,

of this proposition deceived <hi>Aristotle</hi>

our Reverend Master, seems to outstrip him
in some things. For to speak nothing of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie,
deduction of Histories, and the
Propheticall part of History, in the Exotick
part, he hath bound together the acts of the
four Monarchies, and of things concurrent,
then from the destruction of <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
unto the Reign of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the first,
by certain heads, according to lines drawn
upon the Statue of <hi>Daniel,</hi> besides the Holy
Writ, taken out of profane writers. Also
he hath most accurately deduced Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
History according to the three sold pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of the Church by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Divine</hi> in
his <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> Revealed by Seven Seals,
Trumpets and Viols. He that shall joyn
together these two parts, like to <hi>Castor</hi> and
<hi>Pollux,</hi> I dare promise to him security in the
Ocean of History that otherwise is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.
Commentaries now hot under our
hands, doe promise, if God please, a larger
deduction. Hitherto appertains Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
the Eye of History, which that it is now
more augmented and more polished than it
formerly was, is confimed by the writings of
<hi>Scaliger, Pavellus, Helvicus, Calvisius, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,</hi>
and others. The Calculation of the

Grecians, and though it were first invented
by <hi>Meton, Calippus,</hi> and <hi>Hipparchus;</hi> yet it
was after that mended by <hi>Julius Cesar,</hi> and

The Harmonia linguarum of <hi>Cruciger,</hi> The

for before <hi>Raphelengius, Baptista,</hi> and <hi>Erpeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
no man set forth a Grammer of it.
Now men are excellently skilled therein,
as <hi>Golius</hi> Professour at Leyden, <hi>Brodardus</hi>
with the Cadomenses, <hi>Schikkardus</hi> with the
Tuingenses, and others. To Arts I refer
<hi>Grammer, Logick, Rethorick, Poesy.</hi> I have
now explained the condition of the former.
I adde onely this, that it was an admirable
Artifice that the Irish Fathers observed in
their <hi>Janua Linguarum:</hi> but that is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, that <hi>Johannes Comenius,</hi> my friend,
hath communicated in his. For he hath
not onely in Sentences set down the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
words, but he hath so disposed them, that
it seems as it were a Synopsis of Philosophy.
The Antients had notable skill in <hi>Logick,</hi>
and the Scholiasts have writ many things
concerning the precepts thereof very wittily,
and subtilely; yet we are nothing behinde
them. For since the vertue of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
consists in the use thereof, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Rules are but as it were certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of things, and such as are indivisible;
there is lesse due to that age that was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
in disputes, and neglected the use,
calling the Rules into question; More to
that time, in which the rules are directed to
their use, and the use is diligently and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59673:55"/>
inculcated. But <hi>Keckerman</hi> alone
hath done this: His book of Logick is of so
great Esteem, that in the University at Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,
it is expounded, and it is urged in the
Evangelicall Schools in Hungary, is extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Socinians themselves, and is in

                        <hi>yet Petrus Glaumius</hi> seems to excell them
all, who so taught the Italian Tongue in


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59673:57"/>
half a yeers space in the University Giessena<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
that his Schollers would accurately contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
their Theses, written of any matter in

                     <p>The same did so instruct his Schollers
at Halla in Saxony in the doctrine of Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
in two weeks space, they having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing but the principles of Logick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that they composed Theses of the same
matter and would defend the same miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
without any Helper. I was informed of
this by that famous friend of mine, Master
<hi>Sigismund Evens,</hi> who was as it were the
Rector of the Colledge then, and directed
all that businesse. Also he shewed me
some examples of the Positions, with a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

For the art of Painting was excellent
amongst the Romanes when their Empire
was at the height. Whence <hi>Horace;</hi>
                        <q>
                           <note place="margin">Ep. 1. l. 2.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Graving and Casting were of old in the
greatest perfection, as may also appear by the
<hi>Marmora Arundeliana</hi> at London, set up in
the Garden of the illustrious Earle of Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
that were brought out of Italy and
Greece. We saw, amongst many Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Urnes and Statues, the Statue of C.
<hi>Marius,</hi> VII. Consul, of <hi>Theseus,</hi> and of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi>
when he was young: I saw also the
Faces of <hi>Scipio, Ahricanus, Seneca, Socrates,
Aesop, &amp;c.</hi> carved and cast to the life. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them all, the handsome proportion
of the statue of <hi>Hercules,</hi> is most commended,
and of a certain Feminine body; also the


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59673:58"/>
head of a Macedonian King, cast in brasse,
and it was found in a pit at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> by <hi>Petty</hi>
who lived there five yeers for such purposes.
The English carvers do as it were by rule
direct their chiefest works thereunto. One
of the most excellent workmen of them in
the art of casting, by the judgement of all
the rest, confessed he could not equall the
Lineaments thereof. For that, though the
the head were maimed, the Earle of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brok
offered 300 pound, and it was refused,
as <hi>D. Junius</hi> the son of <hi>Franciscus,</hi> a most
courteous Gentleman reported, who shewed
to me these and many more rarities.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, for Architecture, <hi>Vitruvius</hi> is
chiefly commended, nor are the Pyramids, &amp;
Obeliscks of the Antients things forgotten.
Yet though these things be so: Nothing can
be concluded that can any way prejudice
our opinion. For the art of Painting declined
afterwards,<note place="margin">Epist. 119.</note> whence <hi>Sylvius. I saw pictures
of two hundred yeers standing, polished with
no art.</hi> And again, <hi>If you look upon carved

and <hi>Michael Angelus,</hi> and <hi>Raphael U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were excellent in Italy, <hi>Durerus</hi> in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
whom <hi>Erasmus</hi> so highly extols, that he
thinks, that if <hi>Apelles</hi> had then lived, as he
was free and friendly, he would have yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the bucklers to <hi>Albertus,</hi> Carving and


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59673:59"/>
Casting, if they do not exced in our times,
yet they are scarce behinde the Antients,
and in this is that Axiome verified, <hi>that there
is a certain circle in humane affairs.</hi> It is true
that in Architecture <hi>Vitruvius</hi> is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But that must be understood for his
Rules in Architecture. Otherwise, <hi>Politian</hi>
writes of <hi>Leo Baptista Alberti</hi> a Florentin, that
he so searched out the footsteps of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
that he both comprehended the antient
manner of Architecture, and made it Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary.</p>
                     <p>That others have done as much may be
seen by magnificent structures, which are
found about Castles, Monasteries, Churches
and other buildings, whereof the Itin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Topographicall descriptions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are full.</p>
                     <p>The Pyramids and Obelisks were works
made onely to vaunt by, and not for any
profit. Yet the Obelisk set up by <hi>Sixtus</hi> V.
<hi>Anno. 1586,</hi> is as good as any of them. It
was 107 foot high, and 956148 pound
weight. In the erecting of it from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of May till the end almost of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
900 Men, and 70 Horses were Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the charge came to 37975 Crowns,
as saith <hi>Dominicus Pontanus.</hi> But though
there were nothing that could shew that the
former times in this point come short of
ours; Yet some artificiall Works and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
can shew this, that not very many yeers

by many Arguments, that <hi>Laurentius
Johannis,</hi> surnamed <hi>Edituus,</hi> was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor

of the Chronicle of Colen in their

saith that the first Prints were found in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and that the Inhabitants of Mentzs,<note place="margin">Cap. 26. de papyro in Bibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otheca de communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione linguar. c. de Typis. in Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note>

first of all Printed here. Anno, 1450: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
Johannes Faust, <hi>a Citizen of Ments,
who first invented this art in Copper prints, had
his Instructions from</hi> Donatus <hi>printed before

                        <hi>Munster,</hi> contend for <hi>Guttenbergius:</hi>
If this contest can be decided, we may say,
that at <hi>Harlem</hi> were the first grounds of it
laid; and <hi>Guttenbergius,</hi> whom <hi>Polidor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>

Man, that first used the art as we do now. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
Ramus</hi> had <hi>Tullies</hi> Offices in print, with
this Inscription. <hi>This present most famous

cannot be engrossed by those that went

deprive themselves of wisdome that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

                     <p>HAving saild over the Straits of the

Sea of Manners. Whose chief hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

those that maintain the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
And though all things also at this day
are full of vices, yet since in these last times
almost the greatest part of the known
World is converted to the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there is no reason that we should hold
this to be the worst of all, being compared
with the Former. <hi>Lactantius</hi> himself
breaks forth into these words.<note place="margin">L. 5. Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut. c. 7.</note> God as a
most carefull Parent, when the last times
drew on, sent an Embassadour, that should
bring back again the former age, and banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Justice; lest mankinde should alwaies be
driven on with the greatest and continuall
Errours, wherefore the forme of that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
age is returned. Yet it cannot be said that
alwaies and in all places the Honesty of men
increaseth, but we must grant, that all things


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59673:66"/>
run in a kinde of Circle; and as times, so do
manners change by course.<note place="margin">Tacit. in Annal.</note> There will be
vices so long as there are Men, but these are
neither continuall, and amends is made by
the interposition of better things. Our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
saith <hi>Seneca,</hi> complained so, and
we complain as they did, and our posterity
will do the like; saying, that manners are
decayed, and wickednesse rules, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affaires grow worse, and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all mischief; But these things
stand at the same point, and they
will stand, onely moving a little on this
or that side, as waves that are brought
in further by the tide, which going back
leaves more room on the shore. Now Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
is the chief sin, and Chastity breaks the
bridle; another time men are mad in rioting,
and the kitchin proves the fatall ruine
of Patrimonies; sometime Men take care
for nothing but gay apparell, and to trim
themselves fine, which shewes their minde
to be ugly enough, &amp;c. Vices do not wait all
in one place, but they are moveable, and
at ods one with another, they jar together,
and are driven away one by another. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the contrary part hath taken strong
arguments from this matter, we shall han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
this question something more strictly
and accurately. But since some vices
are committed in Religion, others in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and others in the common society of
men, and, to compare all these severally
with all Nations, would be too tedious for us


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59673:66"/>

                        <head type="sub">The Religion of the Antients was too
sottish.</head>
                        <p>IT may be easily understood that the
Religion of the Antients, was vain, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
wicked, by their Images, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
condition and adoration of their Gods.
That is first cleerly demonstrated out of that
place of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Isay 44. vers. 8.</note> to say nothing of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
and the <hi>Wisdome of Solomon.</hi> For in the
framing of an Idol the folly of man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
even so. The carpenter stretcheth
forth his Line,<note place="margin">Jer. 9. 3.</note> and mark's it out with his
square,<note place="margin">Sapient. 11. v. 13.</note> he fits the corners of it, or he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
it with his Compasse; at length he
makes it of the fashion of a man, and
decks it in mans rayment, that it may be
in the house. He heweth down Cedars,
and taketh the Cypresse and the Oke, which
he strengthneth for himself, among the
Trees of the Forrest; He planteth an Ash
and the rain doth nourish it, then shall it
be for a man, to be burnt, for he will take
thereof and warm himself, yea he kindleth
it, and baketh bread, yea, he maketh a god
and worshippeth it; He maketh it a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Image and falleth down thereto; He
burneth part thereof in the fire, with part
thereof he rosteth flesh, he eateth thereof and


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59673:67"/>
is satisfied, yea he warmeth himself and saith,
ah, ah, I am warm, I have seen the fire;
and the residue thereof he maketh a God,
even his Graven Image; he falleth down
unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth
unto it, and saith, Deliver me for thou art
my God, &amp;c. But what madnesse think you is
this, or to make such things that they should
afterwards be afraid of, or to fear what they
themselves made. If Images could feel or
move, men would voluntarily adore those
they made. Therfore <hi>Seneca</hi> a heathen, speaks
it, though it be in a scoffing way. They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Idols of the Gods, they kneel down
and pray to them, they adore them; and
when they stand in awe of these, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the Workmaster that made them.
The number of the gods was so numberlesse
amongst the Heathen, that there were almost
more gods than men. In <hi>Boccace</hi> they are
almost without number. <hi>Crinitus</hi> hath num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
30000 of them.<note place="margin">Boccac. in geneal. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum.</note> 
                           <hi>Varro</hi> reckoneth <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters</hi>
onely, to have been 300. For there
were gods of the upper house, Tutelary
gods,<note place="margin">Crinitus de honest. disc. l. 3. c. 14.</note> Village gods, Houshold and Closet
Gods so many, that <hi>Pliny</hi> breaks into these
words. <hi>The company of gods is thought to be
more than there are men, when as every man
makes what gods he pleaseth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Plin. l. 2. c. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>and makes</hi> Junos,
<hi>and good angels which they adopt for them
selves.</hi> Of corn only, at divers times differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the maner of it, there were Goddesses
made, called, <hi>Segetia, Tutelina, Proser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,
Nodotus, Volutina, Patilena, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelina,
Flora, Lacturtia, Maluta, Ruricina,</hi>


                           <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59673:68"/>
I do not name them all, for it troubles me
for that they were not ashamed of them. The
condition of their Gods, may make every man
laugh. <hi>Flora,</hi> when she had been a Whore
a long time, and by prost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>tuting her body,
had gained wealth, by making the Common
Wealth of Rome her heir by her Testament,
she gave the name to their Feasts called
<hi>Floralia. Iuno</hi> was both sister and wife of
<hi>Iupiter. Fortune, Fornax, Muta, Fear, Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Feavers, Priapus</hi> and <hi>Cupid,</hi> are not
names of things to be adored, but of
the crimes of such as adored them. But what
shall I say of the crackings of the belly, of
the privy gods, dunghill gods? What of the
Trojans that adored a Mouse? of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that worshipped Onions and Garlick?
<hi>Mephitis</hi> was in great honour amongst the
Heathens.<note place="margin">Tacit. 3.</note> For in the plundering of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,<note place="margin">Hist. c. 6.</note>
all the Temples of the gods and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses
were rifled, but the Souldiers out of
their superstition spared this onely. But this
was the goddesse of stinks. The manner of
Worshipping in many was very cruell, in
others very beastly. They offered men in
sacrifices to the dead, and they fed the fire
with mans blood as with oyl. That was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
amongst the Trojans and Grecians,<note place="margin">Aenead 11. &amp; 2. Silic. l. 4.</note> as
<hi>Virgil</hi> saith; amongst the Carthagenians as
<hi>Silicus;</hi> amongst the French as <hi>Lucan;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Moabites, and Canaanites as the
Scripture writes; amongst the Romanes,
though when <hi>Cornelius Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Crassus</hi> were Consuls, they abrogated


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59673:68"/>
this wicked custome.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, amongst the Jews, as we read in the
books of Kings,<note place="margin">2 Reg. c. 16.</note> it was a custome. <hi>Lactantius</hi>
reports from <hi>Pescenius Festus,</hi> That the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagenians
being overcome by <hi>Agathocles</hi>
King of Sicily,<note place="margin">L. 1. c. 21.</note> fearing left the cause was
because they had intermitted to adore <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi>
they offered unto him two hundred
Noble children for one Offering. <hi>Moloch's</hi>
Statue amongst the Jews was in the Valley
of <hi>Gehennon,</hi> or <hi>Tophet:</hi> Children that
were Sacrificed were shut within the Idol,
and the fire was kindled; and that they
might not be heard to cry, they beat Drums,
and Cymbals. Their beastlinesse <hi>Priapus</hi>
and <hi>Berecinthia</hi> may shew. The Image of the
first, was stark naked.</p>
                        <p>Of their beastly Priests, it is said thus.

                        <p>When the Sacrifice was ended they that
were present fell to promiscuous venery. In

was professed in their adoration, that
will hardly be confessed by torments in the

of <hi>Berecinthia,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">August. de civ. D. l. 2. c. 4.</note> on a Solemn day, there
were washings, and such songs were sung by
the most wicked Players, that I do not say
the mother of the Gods, but the mother of
any Noble persons,<note place="margin">L. 1. c. 21.</note> or any honest men,
nay the mothers of the very comedians
ought to be ashamed to hear.</p>

                           <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59673:69"/>
But the Men of <hi>Lyndus</hi> held those solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to be violated, if by chance at their
times of performing these rites, any good
word had dropt from any of their mouths.
I will say nothing of their South-sayings,
looking into Entralls and other kindes of
Divinations, as also of the fooleries of the
<hi>Thalmudists,</hi> and <hi>Cabalists. Cato</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi>

have described these. Since therefore the
Sacred worship of the Antients was so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">In frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
cruel, and obscene; It is no wonder
that <hi>Seneca</hi> writ, If a man had leasure to see
what they do and suffer superstitiously, he
shall finde them so unseemly for honest
persons, so unworthy of free Men, so unfit for
discreet men, that no man would doubt but
they were mad, if they were mad in fewer
numbers, but now they are so many that they
are defended by their numbers from being
thought to be mad. He that would read

                        <head type="sub">There were many wicked lawes among
the Antients.</head>
                        <p>AS we have shewed the Religion of the
Antients to be daub'd with many vices:
so, since a Law is a sacred Decree, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things honest, and forbidding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
It will be very easie to shew the same
things concerning their Lawes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> are said to have
founded most famous Common-Wealths;
And <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> to have written the
best platforms of them, if we can convince
them of wickednesse and injustice, I think I
shall give satisfaction in this point.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Solons</hi> Common-Wealth, two things
are chiefly observed.</p>
                        <p>First, Wherefore, for ease of the poor, he
abolished all former contracts for debts?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, By what Law he would make
them infamous, that, when there was sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Common-Wealth, held with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side.</p>
                        <p>The first was unjust, because he did not
enjoyne his friends to restore the great sums
of money they had taken up before, upon
trust, being forewarned by him what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
he had in hand; and without Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the reasons of particular debts, he at


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59673:70"/>
once abolished them all. The other was
so, because it takes away the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
sedition in the Common-Wealth.
For it must needs be that reconciliation be
made by those that are mediatours between
them both. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> directed all his Laws
to Valour, and to erect a Warlike Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He published that it was lawfull for
Men to rob for victualls, and he would not
have them punished though they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the act. He decreed that Boyes and
Girles should wrestle naked, in publike; and
that it should be lawfull for old mens young
wives, to make choice of what young man
they pleased, and to lie with them for to
have children by them; and as peace is
not ordained for war, but the contrary way;
so the Common-Wealth should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
for Peace, rather than for War.
They that in their childhood are addicted
to ill things, in their youth, having gained
a custome, they will forbear none how great
soever. That Law that draws men on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in some things, doth invite men to
deceive in all, and as oft as we can: Nor
can robberies be better put in practice than
under the protection of a Law, that doth
not punish a Man for theeving, but for
not doing it with dexterity. Lastly, to
prompt men to Lust, and to permit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
what an impiety this is? <hi>Plato</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the same reward that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did,
by the Law he made for breeding up young
men and Maids in Schools. And by that


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59673:70"/>
law he made, To have all things common,
He decreed that forme of Government that
was contrary to nature. If marriages were
taken away, and men might indifferently
use what women they pleased, all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
love between parents and children
would be lost; and upon quarrells, very
brothers would murther one the other; and
those things sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that are wont to be adjudged hainous &amp; fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
The propriety of things contains matter
both of vertues and vices, but the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them contains nothing but a liberty
of vices.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> seems the most absurd of them
all.</p>

at Malta a woman was condemned to die.
For she was thought to have taken away a
Citizen designed for the Common-Wealth.
Lastly, he commanded those pictures of the
Gods to be kept, in which custome allowed
laciviousnesse, otherwise they were to be


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59673:71"/>
rejected. But men sin more by imitation of
the Gods. <hi>Lucian</hi> confesseth plainly, that
when he heard of the rapes and adulteries
of the Gods, he fell in love with the same.
And <hi>Cherea</hi> in <hi>Terence</hi> saith, that when he
saw the Picture of <hi>Jupiter</hi> descending into
the Lap of <hi>Danae,</hi> in a Golden Showr, he
was provoked thereby to do the like. But
what God? saith he, He that shakes the
Heavens with a Noise, and should not I a
contemptible man do the like? Yea, I
did that, and willingly; For men mark more
what <hi>Jupiter</hi> did, than what <hi>Plato</hi> taught,
or <hi>Cato</hi> decreed. To this purpose are the
Saxon Lawes, that are altogether as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd.
For in doubtfull causes, when there
wanted manifest proofs to confirm the truth,
sometimes they used Duels, sometimes to
make men touch burning iron, or scalding
water, sometimes they cast them into the
bottom of a deep river, or Keel-Haled
them. They that were killed in duels were
guilty; the conquerour was disgraced, if he
did not kill him that was worsted: they that
escaped in the other punishments were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted;
they that were caried to the bottom,
were held to be innocent, they that swam
on the top were guilty, as if the water
rejected them.</p>

                        <p>I will shew the cruelty they used against
themselves, onely in their Civil Wars, the
Reigns of their Emperours, and in their
playings at sharps on the Stage. For should
I mention what is sufficient, my Enchiridion
would become a tedious Volume. For <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
writes,<note place="margin">De iral. 2. c. 8.</note> That wickednesse was grown so
common, and was so prevalent in every mans
brest, that innocence was not to be thought,
to be rare but not to be all. And <hi>Tacitus</hi>
speaks of those times onely. We read
that when <hi>Petus Thrasca</hi> was commended
by <hi>Arulenus Rusticus,</hi> and <hi>Priscus Helvidius</hi>
by <hi>Herennius Senecio,</hi> that it was a capitall
crime, and rage was not onely exercised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Authors, but also upon their books,
the Office being committed to the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri,</hi>
that the Monuments of the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
wits should be burnt in publicke As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
and Market place. For by that fire
they hoped to abolish the voyce of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
people, the Liberty of the Senate, and
the conscience of Man kinde; In the mean
time, they expelled all learned Professours,
and banished every laudable art, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59673:73"/>
that was honest might remain. We
shewed indeed a great proof of our patience:
And, as the old Common-Wealth saw what
was the height of Liberty; So we see what is
the extremity of slavery, the very liberty of
speaking and hearing, being taken from us
by their Inquisitions, that we had lost our
very Memories with our Voice, if we had as
much power to forget, as we have to hold
our peace.<note place="margin">Valer. l. 9. c. 2.</note> What concerns Civil Wars,
<hi>Sylla</hi> most cruelly made the whole City, and
all the parts of Italy to overflow with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Mens blood in Civil-wars. He record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the publike Tables, four thousand
700 that had their throats cut by an Edict
of a cruell Proscription, that the Memory
of so famous a businesse might not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
He would have the heads of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
men that were cut off, brought before
him, whilst their countenance was yet fresh
with spirits, that he might feed on them
with his eyes because he might not eat them
without great wickednesse. He would not
kill <hi>M. Marius</hi> the Praetor, (who was drawn
to the Sepulchre of the Family of <hi>Lutatia</hi>
by the cry of the Common people) before
he had miserably plucked out his eyes, and
broken all the parts of his body. Also he
presently butchered <hi>M. Plaetorius,</hi> because
he swounded at the punishment of <hi>Marius; A
new Tormenter of Mercy, for with him it was
held wickednesse, to be unwilling to behold
wickednesse.</hi> Moreover he commanded four
Legions of the contrary part, that kept their


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59673:74"/>
trust, to be slain in a publike place that was
in Campus Martius, and they did not at all
ask for mercy from his deceitfull hand.
Those whose lamentable cryes were heard
in the City, their bodies were cut with the
sword and cast into Tyber, which was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdned
with the multitudes of them, and
the waters ran like blood. And when the
Senate was amazed at that cry; He added,

fellows are punished by command. This
man was formerly a great Officer under
<hi>C. Marius,</hi> though afterwards he proved to
be his enemy, and caused <hi>Marius</hi> his ashes
to be dug up, and scattered into the River
Anio. The Triumviri did not leave to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his example, for they exposed to the
like Proscription 300 Senators &amp; 2000 Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.
It is no wonder therefore that

Market places, Theatres, Temples were full of
dead bodies; that it was hard to say, when
the Conquerors killed most, either before to get
the victory, or afterwards, because they had
obtained it.</hi> And <hi>Lipsius</hi> useth these words:

so soon as he had seen the execution,
he presently set to a banquet, and used all

sports, till for some dayes together, he made
him be beaten in his sight, as he was bound

pieces; and he would never be satisfied till
he saw his limbs and bowels and joynts
drawn through the streets, and then piled
up upon heaps. He seldom suffered any
man to be punished, but with frequent

A Souldier that was the Heads-man,
cut off all mens heads that he pleased, that
were imprisoned. At Puteoli, when the
bridge was consecrated, after he had called
many men to him from the shore, he sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
caused them all to be cast down
headlong. At a great Banquet he sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fell into a great laughter, the Consuls

                        <p>As for the number of drunkards, and
their love; It is well known that <hi>Tiberius</hi>
gave to <hi>Piso</hi> the Praetorship, for drinking
three nights continually together: and to
<hi>Pomponius Flaccus</hi> the Province of Syria, and
in his Letters he called them the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
friends he had for all times. He also
did prefer a man that was unknown and
sought for the Quaestors Office, before the
most Noble Men, for pledging at a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
an Amp hora of wine, that he drank to
him. And at that time when the <hi>Lex Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
was published, the matter was come so
far, that many of the people of Rome would
come drunk into the Senate house and so
consult of the affaires of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
Also <hi>Seneca</hi> writes thus of women.
<hi>They do not watch lesse,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Natural quaest. 4. c. 13.</note> 
                           <hi>they doe not drink

and they cast it up again by their mouthes, what
they have taken in their entrals, refusing it; and
by Vomit they measure the wine they drank,
and they eat snow as well as men do, to cool
their hot stomacks.</hi> As for their Utensils,
they used not onely great Cups, but, as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi>

were adorned with most pretious Emblems.

And though such stately structures consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

that the Magistrate did prodigally wast in

such kindes of men all their patrimony, that
they might win the peoples liking for an

For though they in <hi>Artimedorus</hi> his

a Colossus stood with his Image, a hundred

the gallery was three miles, and there was
a Pool like to a Sea, set about with build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
like Cities. Also there was the
Countrey diversfyed with Fields, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
Pasture grounds and Woods, with
multitudes of all kinds of cattell and wilde

daubed over with gold, adorned with Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,

Parlours were set with Ivory Tables, that

Unguents might be sprinkled upon them.
The chief of their dining rooms were made

Sails of divers colours, with large Baths,

he would sit at meat, &amp; passe over the shores
of Campania in the day time, with danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Musick. In the buildings of his
Countrey Palaces, and Mannors, he set all
reason aside, striving most to do that which
men though impossible to be done, and
therfore buildings were made in troublesome
and deep Seas, Rocks of the hardest flint
were cut up, and plain fields were raised as
high Mountains,<note place="margin">Plin. l. 33. c. 11.</note> and tops of Mountains were
levelled like plain fields, all done with

their Tormentors, and the fire it self

are renowned in the mouths of Men, none
can be compared with the divine and notable

that were servants to the Emperours.</hi> If
they object their defending of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
we shall presently answer them with
the examples of the men of Callis under
<hi>Philip Valesius:</hi> and with the examples of the
Dutch and others; who devoted themselves
for their Countreys good. Again if we

French,<note place="margin">L. 5. P. l. c. 5. 1.</note> Germans, of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and of the

There shall come Scoffers in the last days,

                        <p>But all this cannot evince so much as to
subvert our Opinion. And I may answer
to those places, both in generall and in
speciall.</p>
                        <p>Generally, I. For though it were true
that about the end of the world, Mens
maners should grow worse, yet it follows


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59673:93"/>
not, that therefore, there was an universall
perpetuall decay.</p>
                        <p>II. It cannot be understood how we shall
expect a conversion of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
and yet mens manners should grow
worse.</p>
                        <p>III. The last dayes seem not to mean
those that are neerest to Christs coming,
but for all that time that is between his
first and second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>

World divided into many periods. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as old age onely may equall all
the other periods past; so may the last times
also.<note place="margin">Job 42. v. 12. 16.</note> Nor may that seem strange, For the
time from <hi>Jobs</hi> restitution untill his death,
is called his last age, though it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
a 140 yeers.</p>
                        <p>IV. The last dayes may be taken for the
latest,<note place="margin">C. 2. v. 28.</note> whence as <hi>Joel</hi> speaks of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,<note place="margin">C. 2. v. 17.</note>
                           <hi>And it shall be after that,</hi> saith he. <hi>Peter</hi>
in the Acts of the Apostles pronounceth the
same by saying, that shall be in the last
times. And that appears most clearly in the
Prophecie of <hi>Jacob</hi> preceding his death.
For he promiseth to certifie unto his sons,


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59673:94"/>
what should happen in the last dayes. Yet
he sets, between those times, the taking
away of the Scepter from Judah, and the
comming of Shiloh; Wherefore the last
times seem not here onely to be meant, but
also as a learned man explains it in his
<hi>Comment upon the Epistle of Jude,</hi> the
Kingdom of Christ; And thus much for the
generall.</p>
                        <p>In speciall,</p>
                        <p>I. The Praediction of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
forbidding to marry, is fulfilled in
<hi>Eustatius, the Tatiani, Marcionists, Manichees
Catharists,</hi> and <hi>Montanists.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The same reason serves for the other. For
he doth not compare his age with ours, but
rather teacheth us what shall be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the kindgom of Christ. Nor is that
increase of wickednesse joyned with the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of time, any thing to a universall and
perpetuall ruine of nature. For as some fall
off to wickednesse, others hold the faster to
what is good. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself saith,
<hi>But they shall proceed no further, but their
folly shall be made manifest unto all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>II. The Prophesie of <hi>Peter</hi> came to passe
then in <hi>Judes</hi> times:<note place="margin">vers. 9.</note> for <hi>Jude</hi> useth almost
the very same words, and the difference is
no more but this, that one foretells it,
and the other shews it fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>III. The predictions of Christ are to


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59673:94"/>
understood, concerning the Persecutions of
the Christian Religion, and the subversion
of the City of Jerusalem, and in this sense,
<hi>Maldonat</hi> and <hi>Aretius</hi> alleadge Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
words, <hi>2 Tim. 4. v. 6.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Those words in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, than that from the time that
Christ asscended into Heaven, untill his
coming again, Men will be alwaies incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Divines interpret them, and <hi>Jansenius</hi>
saith, <hi>They do not onely signifie Paucity, and
want of faith in men, who shall be found alive
in the last day, but also in men of all times.</hi>
Some things also are alleadged for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Antichrist: but of this subject
you may read <hi>Whitaker, Downam,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p>The most certain <hi>Argument;</hi> is the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of that which hindereth, or the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the Romane Empire, which the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

of them all is <hi>Lipsius,</hi> whose most memorable
words are these.<note place="margin">Ital. l. 4.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wonderfull is Gods goodnesse to this
City: When he took away the force of
arms, he gave force to the Lawes: When
he would not let the sword rule, he
granted power to the Church; and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he made it to be the honour, the defence
and the support of things. But they say
that old Senate is not! Not that, but an


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59673:95"/>
other, and behold in that Purple, select
Judges, out of all our World, who are to be
regarded for their Manners, Prudence, and
Arms. Should the old Cynick live again, &amp;
should see this Assembly, he would make no
question, to compare it with Kings or Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
What are the Tributes? Not so great
but they are more innocent also, and more
willingly paid. What are the Embassies,
of Nations? Nor are they wanting, but
they come from the known and unknown
world, so wide doth this Majesty spread it self
and hence they fetch Rights and Lawes of
Sacred things. Kings and Princes come and
how themselves, and submit their obedient
heads to this one head. But as it is no doubt
but that Antichrist is come, and is also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to the world; so, many places of
Scripture, according to some pious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
seem to intimate the neernesse
of his Ruine, upon which they say, will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
such a peace of the Church, as the like
was never before. To this peace some
adjoyne, a more full conversion of Jewes
and Gentiles, to which the noble <hi>D. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovius,</hi>
the Light of his Countrey amongst
strangers, addes their return into the land
of Canaan; The restitution of all things
by <hi>Elias,</hi> the ceasing of all Heresies, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
persecutions, and of all Impiety.
Some adde further to this, the Resurrection
of the Martyrs, and a Reign with Christ
upon the Earth for a thousand yeers. Of
that opinion are, <hi>Carolus Gallus</hi> Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59673:95"/>
formerly of the University at Leyden,
in his <hi>Clavis Prophetica nova Apocalypseos.</hi>
In which work he confesseth that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
twenty five yeers, in reading, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating,
searching, writing, and debating;
And also <hi>George Hawkwell</hi> in his <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia
Providentiae Divinae,</hi> out of which we
have taken a great part of this small Tract:
as also <hi>Mathias Martinus,</hi> My Master, in
his Epistle by way of answer to my letters,
whererein I desired his opinion of this
matter, <hi>Anno,</hi> a thousand six hundred twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
eight. <hi>Alsted</hi> and <hi>Piscator</hi> are of this
minde. But this man makes that kingdom
to be in the Heavens; the other saith,
it is not onely upon the Earth, but makes
the thousand yeers to begin about the
yeer, a thousand six hundred ninety four.
<hi>Carolus Gallus</hi> seems to joyn with them.<note place="margin">In Diatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba &amp; Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nol.</note>
For in his eighth <hi>Observation,</hi> on the 20
Chapter of the Revelations, he writes
thus.</p>
                        <p>The Propheticall Spirit briefly doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
in this Revelation of S. <hi>John,</hi> of
a singular, and wonderfull Resurrection of
the Church, Renovation and restitution
thereof, Namely, that in this last age it
shall be conspicuous, consisting of Jewes
and Gentiles, quick and dead, and it shall
after a wonderfull maner Revive, be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
Restored, and Flowrish again more
Gloriously than ever it did formerly, and
that from those that were dead the very first
death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59673:96"/>
If you enquire of their Arguments, they
are partly taken from the certainty of the
conversion of Jews and Gentiles, partly
out of some places in the Scripture
expresly promising peace, partly out of the
prophecy of a thousand yeers, described in
the twentieth Chapter of the Revelations,
not yet fulfilled. And though that matter,
as Enigmaticall, cannot be decided before
the event; and if it might, it is beyond
my abilityes, nor doth it concern this
place:</p>
                        <p>Yet,<note place="margin">In stella Serpent. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legat. Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos.</note> I. It seems to be most true,
that there shall be a more full conversion
of Jewes and Gentiles, as <hi>Keckerman</hi>
and <hi>Justus Heurnius,</hi> have demonstrated
out of the Scripture. But after the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of Antichrist, not onely that which
shall oppose Idolatry, but the matter it self
doth shew it; to say nothing of the shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of the Devill, which is written of,
after the casting of the false Prophet and
the Beast into the Lake.</p>
                        <p>II. No Article of the Faith should be
violated, though we should maintain the
coming again of <hi>Elias,</hi> and the returning
of the Jews again into the Land of Canaan.
For that which is spoken of <hi>Elias</hi> by the
<hi>Evangelist,</hi> to come again and restore all
things, Christ did not ascribe to <hi>John</hi> the
Baptist. Nor is that in <hi>Micha</hi> spoken of
him, ascribed to this man. To say nothing


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59673:96"/>
that the first coming of Christ was not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but joyful. The promise made to the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
<hi>Deuteronomie</hi> 30 is too glorious; and
that it is not yet fulfilled, is apparent by
the dispersion of the Jewes nor yet resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                        <p>III. <hi>It is very probable that the notable
ruine of Antichrist is hard at hand.</hi> For since
it is evident that the History of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
describes unto us three periods of
the Church, and each of them is bounded
with seventy seven yeers, and from thence
it certainly followes that the Denunciation
of the Ruine of Babylon fel about the Reign
of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and there is nothing
more written of the restitution thereof, but
that those late tumults in that battell, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the nineteenth of the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
seem to be prefigured, and the successe
on that side, sheweth nothing else, than what
appeared in Carthage half destroyed. <hi>Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the bitings of beasts when they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to dy are most violent;</hi> It can hardly be
thought that it can last long. Nor are all
those Prodigies;<note place="margin">What is to be thought of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages.</note> Presages, and Predictions
to be neglected, which are written to have
fallen out both in former times, and in
these last ten yeers.</p>
                        <p>Indeed they are more obscure than that
they may be easily looked into, and too seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be rejected with scoffing prejudice.
And though I finde that ambitious and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59673:97"/>
men challenge this to themselves;
Yet Men of better mindes hold it better to
wait on the event with hope and patience,
than by rash Judgement to accuse the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of falshood, and to make things false
to be true, or to ascribe Divinity to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions; or supernaturall Power to
naturall things. I, though I had rather
be silent, both concerning Divinity and
the Truth, yet I professe that I have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found any thing in Histories, I have
read, that is not foretold either by Divine
or Diabolick, or Humane, or Naturall
predictions, or by them altogether. All the
order of the four Monarchies lies couched
in <hi>Daniels</hi> Images, the brief of all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
History is contained in the
Apocalyptick writings. And out of these the
Divell hath taken some things.</p>
                        <p>The birth of Christ was fore shewed by
the Sybils, Oracles, and Stars, besides the
writings of the Holy Prophets. What Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of mens Nativities, and what all the
rest can do is taught by a work of <hi>Julius
Caesar, Bullinger de Divinatione,</hi> and by the
History of the Duke of <hi>Biron.</hi> Yet there
is a mean to be used in these things; they
must be made use of occasionally, and not
fundamentally.</p>
                        <p>IV. <hi>It is probable that the thousand yeers

were they fulfilled, that must be, either


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59673:97"/>
in the first, second or third period.</p>
                        <p>Not in the first.</p>
                        <p>For then the seven Seals had their event,
nor did then any thing fall out besides, but
what is written of the Womans driving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and the battell with the Dragon: also
then there was an Infinite number of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and a mighty flood of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Not in the second.</p>
                        <p>For under that both Anti-Christianisme
sprang up, and Mahumetisme.</p>
                        <p>Not in the third.</p>
                        <p>For then they say he was let loose. But
then began the Church to rise again, with
the two Witnesses that were slain in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
period; and <hi>Babylon</hi> began to decline.
Of the same opinion is Dr. <hi>Mede, a Divine
of Cambridge</hi> my Honourable friend,<note place="margin">In libro de succesione.</note> who
is the Author of the <hi>Clavis Apoca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fetched out of the innate and imbred characters
of the visions, and demonstrated from them.</hi>
The most reverend Doctor <hi>usher</hi> Primate
of Ireland saith that there is a two fold Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenary.
But <hi>Martinius</hi> takes it for a long time
by <hi>Synccdoche,</hi> and more rightly. But I
will say no more of this matter than I
have said; for I would shew onely what
may be said thereof, and not what may be
certainly said; if you except the first and
second.

In the mean while I desire to be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of two things. Namely, Whether the
Ruine of Antichrist shall be totall? And
whether after that Satan is bound up so,
there must needs follow a cessation of all

in the visible Church? Far be it from me
any farther to favour the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> that
were defended by <hi>Papia, Ireneus, Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who dreamt
of a glorious <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon the earth for
a thousand yeers, after the Resurrection,
The blood of Sacrifices, Rest of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
Circumcision, Marriages, Children,
Education, Delightfull Banquets, the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to them of all Nations, the Moon
to shine as bright as the Sun, and that the
Sun should shine seven fold cleerer than it
doth. Let us rather pray that God would
be pleased to look upon his afflicted Church
with a Gracious Eye, and grant unto it
what is for the good thereof. This is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
if it be not too much. But, Whether
it be so or so, Thanks be given uuto thee,
O Lord Jesus.</p>
