            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY laſt to you was giving you an Account of the ſad unfortunate Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of poor Brother <hi>Paul,</hi> (loſt at Sea:) This is to give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the moſt Diſmal and Tragical Miſchance that ever befel a City in ſo ſhort a time, by ſo unhappy an Accident: The <hi>Long-Tower</hi> at the Key, where lay 250 Barrels of Powder; the Foundation whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt waſhed away by the continual beating of the Water; and being ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome time paſt to fall, Orders were given by the Governour to Captain <hi>Wayt,</hi> who is Store-keeper, to remove the Magazine, and prop the Tower, which ſight occaſion'd a great Number of People to frequent the Key that Morning, (which was yeſterday between Eleven and Twelve a Clock) to view it: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they could get the Beams and other Materials ready, the Tower gave way, and by the knocking of the Stones one againſt another, gave fire to the whole Parcel of Powder, which blew the whole Tower amongſt the City, and killed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 100 and odd Perſons; amongſt which <hi>Abraham Bowman</hi> Sheriff, Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> Land-Waiter, Madam <hi>Butler,</hi> with ſeveral other Dwellers in the Town; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor <hi>Lacy</hi> and <hi>Arthur Lillys</hi> loſt each a Leg, and its believ'd will not live: The Blaſt was ſo great, that there is not one Houſe in the Town, but receiv'd great Damage: The whole Key is blown to admiration; it has made as great a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock as the War. The thing was ſo exceſſive and ſo unexpected it is impoſſible for me, or any elſe, to deſcribe the diſtraction of the whole City, no man well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it was, but ſuppoſing it to be an <hi>Earthquake.</hi> For my part, I have ſeen as terrible ſights, as I thought cou'd be ſeen, and have eſcap'd as many Dangers as any one, <hi>but never ſaw the like</hi>; nor never, the Lord be praiſed, eſcap'd <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower</hi>; I then being in <hi>Key-Lane,</hi> in an Houſe that fell by the prodigious weight of Stones that fell upon it: It blew Stones of 300 weight up to the Gallows, (<hi>which is a Mile</hi>) and the Land againſt it is all as if it were plowed; it killed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons at work in the Field, as <hi>Tom Tingy,</hi> and ſeveral others thereabouts: The Key was not known this <hi>Twelve-months</hi> to be ſo full as it was at that time, for the day being very fair, and every one deſirous to ſee the <hi>Tower</hi> fall, not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Powder would take fire, flock'd down, where many were as unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately loſt. The Governor, the Collector, and ſome others, were at <hi>Dick Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Houſe, but eſcaped with ſmall Wounds. Captain <hi>Wayt</hi> was under the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and perceiving it to fall, made haſte from it, and Luckily fell, which fall ſaved his Life; but he is ſadly Wounded. It ſhook the Country for 12 miles round. Praiſed be God, all our Friends are eſcap'd; and this Deliverance ought never to be forgot, (nor by me never ſhall.) I never yet heard of ſo unlucky a Miſchance. I am ſure you will hear of it from other hands. But for fear you ſhould ſuſpect the loſing any of your Friends, I thought fit to give you this Account at large. There are as many Wounded (and moſt of them mortally) as the Number kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, God make us all who ſurvive, thankful for the Deliverance; and always to acknowledge it as the greateſt of Bleſſings.
