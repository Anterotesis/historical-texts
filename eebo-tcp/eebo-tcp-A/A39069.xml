            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGIE On the DEATH of that late Incomparable POET ROBERT WILD D.D. Who departed this Life <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 12th 1679.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>AH! who can hold! that all men ſilent are,</l>
               <l>When our great loſs in him's beyond compare:</l>
               <l>He was the only Modern Man that Writ</l>
               <l>Rhime and good ſolid Senſe; not flaſhy Wit:</l>
               <l>He was jocoſe and ſerious: No man could</l>
               <l>Write ſo well to pleaſe men and yet ſo good.</l>
               <l>His Aim and great Deſign was by his Verſe</l>
               <l>To bring to life the unwieldy Univerſe,</l>
               <l>If poſſible: He coveted to win</l>
               <l>More Souls to God, than th' Us'rer Bags of Sin.</l>
               <l>His Preaching, when he firſt was National,</l>
               <l>Was ſound and learned, and well pleaſed all;</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>And ſince reſtrain'd he did continue ſtill,</l>
                  <l>Gravely adviſing men againſt all ill</l>
                  <l>And perſevering in his work, God's will</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To make known to his people, whom he deem'd,</l>
                  <l>Himſelf yet bound to ſuccour, though it ſeem'd</l>
                  <l>To ſome as if he thereby diſeſteem'd</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Humane Authority.</l>
               <l>But let ſuch Dons, as thought him thus affected,</l>
               <l>Read all his Poems, which, though now rejected,</l>
               <l>Do plainly ſhew no man more Loyal was;</l>
               <l>Nor more bewray'd the Cheats o' th' Good Old Cauſe,</l>
               <l>Than he, whoſe buſineſs was ſtill to prevent</l>
               <l>Their curſed and unnatural intent</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Againſt their then Supreme and Nat'ral Lord,</l>
                  <l>In whoſe Blood afterwards their hands they gor'd:</l>
                  <l>Ah! how much he this fatal Act deplor'd!</l>
               </lg>
               <l>None more rejoyc'd at our now Kings returning,</l>
               <l>Thgugh he got by't, as <hi>London</hi> did by Burning.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>He bore his Loſſes cheerfully, for that</l>
                  <l>He knew his Duty to his King, and what</l>
                  <l>He could not turn with th' change o' th' times for; Not</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That he was prejudic'd 'gainſt Government,</l>
                  <l>But alway was thereto obedient,</l>
                  <l>As knowing 'twas of God for good to's ſent.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>His Works do illuſtrate his Worth,</l>
               <l>And his true Genius to the World ſet forth;</l>
               <l>That him to praiſe, who 'th ſuch an Advocate</l>
               <l>Were to diminiſh, not ſup'rerogate.</l>
               <l>I dare not ſpeak more of him, having ſaid</l>
               <l>What does but leſſen him, and take from the dead,</l>
               <l>Which is the extremeſt piece of Cruelty</l>
               <l>That e're was done by any man but me:</l>
               <l>But ſince this work was by none undertaken,</l>
               <l>That by his loſs the VVorld could better waken:</l>
               <l>Firſt I herein my Zeal for him expreſs,</l>
               <l>Though in a poor, ſordid, and homely dreſs.</l>
               <l>The Saints cannot add to the Glory above,</l>
               <l>Nor ſet it out to th' full, yet Divine Love</l>
               <l>Accepts their Services, and them repays</l>
               <l>VVith an Eternal Crown of radiant Bays,</l>
               <l>More glorious far than the Suns high-noon Rayes.</l>
               <l>Then the VVorld hereby has Intelligence</l>
               <l>Of 's Fate, which brings them to a deeper ſence</l>
               <l>Of Judgments that are nigh, and may them urge,</l>
               <l>Themſelves in true Repentance to immerge,</l>
               <l>VVhereby impendent Judgments may be ſtay'd,</l>
