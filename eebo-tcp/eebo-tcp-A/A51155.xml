            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
ENQUIRY
INTO THE
New Opinions, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Thought that our Enemies had
made an end of their Libels, but I
ſee that it is not ſo eaſie for them to
forbear the practices that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of. The malignity of Faction is
endleſs, and there is nothing ſo apt to be
oppreſſed and reviled as Truth and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
We muſt (in theſe days of Atheiſm
and Confuſion) arm our ſelves againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
and Contradictions: and if we
are not guarded by Reſolution and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
we muſt deſert (not only the Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Miniſtries of the Prieſthood, but)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100948:8"/>
the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity it ſelf. We are
ſurrounded on all hands by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
and ſpiteful Adverſaries, the open
and ſcandalous Senſualities of ſome, and the
ſpiritual Raveries of others, lay ſiege to the
Foundations of our Faith, and it is with great
difficulty that the publick Worſhip of
God is not quite extinguiſhed, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
deſpiſed and ridicul'd: So grievous
is our preſent Calamity, that the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Parties amongſt us do impute our
Diſaſters to different Cauſes, and therefore
we are the further remov'd from out true
Cure. If we were ſo impartial as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
our Iniquities with Sorrow and
Remorſe, we would quickly find the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of Contrition and Repentance more
proper to remove the marks of God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
than the other Methods that are
moſt pleasing to Fleſh and Blood.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more Eſſential to
Natural Religion than the belief of God's
wiſe and watchful Providence. It inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
in the meaneſt. Accidents of humane
Life, and much more in the remarkable
Ruins and Calamities of publick Societies
and Churches: And if we do not hear
<hi>the Voice of the Rod, and of him that
hath appointed it,</hi> he hath ſtill more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Plaues in reſerve for us than the
ſpoiling of our Goods, or the affronting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100948:8"/>
of our Perſons. Let us therefore draw
near unto him by our fervent Prayers, and
ingenuous Humiliations: for the moſt
Innocent amongſt us may find in the view
of his Life ſeveral Actions and Omiſſions
very diſpleaſing to our Heavenly Father,
as well as unſuitable to our Baptiſmal
Vows and Engagements; therefore the
Hand of God is ſtretched out againſt us,
and he is provoked to let looſe amongſt
us a Spirit of Error and Confuſion: and
though we may be very Innocent as to
the Accuſations of thoſe who have wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
combin'd to defame us, yet <hi>who of
us can underſtand his Errors?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all things without us are in ſuch
diſorder; then is it high time for us to look
within our ſelves, and to fix our Thoughts
on their true Objects: If we are expos'd
to the ſadeſt Toſlings and Uncertainties, we
muſt endeavour to eſtabliſh the Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our mind? If we know not where
to lay our head, if we have no <hi>property</hi>
upon Earth, the natural Concluſion is, to
<hi>ſeek thoſe things that are above.</hi> If here
we are perſecuted and oppreſſed, we muſt
carry our thoughts and deſires to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Sanctuary that yields true Eaſe and
Repoſe under all preſſures and afflictions.</p>
            <p>It is worth our while to enquire why
we, who have been dedicated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100948:9"/>
of the Altar, are more particularly
ſtruck at than others. It is not ſo much
our buſineſs to complain of our Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as to look unto him that ſmites us:
and if he (by the diſcipline of ſo many
croſſes) oblige us to conſider more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
the frame of our Souls, we may
with greater eaſe part with our, former
Conveniencies. Let every one of us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into himſelf, and open up the ſeveral
foldings of his own Conſcience, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
hereafter to regulate our Actions
by true and Chriſtian Principles know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>all things are naked and open to
the Eyes of him with whom we have to
do,</hi> and to whom we are ſhortly to give
an account of our time and talents, and
of <hi>all things that we have done in the body
whether they be good or evil.</hi> If we muſt
ſuffer, let us imitate the Captain of
our Salvation: this is Edifying to the
Church, and it eſtabliſhes the Compoſure
of our own mind. Let us canvaſs and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> for which
we ſuffer, and enquire whether they be not
the Principles of the Catholic and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church in her firſt and pureſt ages.</p>
            <p>We muſt not think that we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
from the peculiar Offices of our
Miniſtry, becauſe we are forc'd from our
Reſidence, and expoſed to all ſorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100948:9"/>
We muſt firmly believe that
<hi>all things work together for good to them
that love God:</hi> and that our Patience and
Meekneſs may be of greater uſe to the
Church than if we had been allow'd to
continue in our former Stations. We ſee
how much holy things are contemn'd in
our days, how triumphantly Atheiſm and
Impiety lift up their Banners every where.
Let us endeavour as much as is poſſible to
preſerve ſome Remains of Religion amongſt
the People. Let us aſſert the ancient
Order and Piety that made the Chriſtian
Church ſo beautiful in former Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtle informs us, that the time
would come when men could not</hi> endure
ſound Doctrine,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 3, 4.</note> but after their own luſt ſhall
they heap to themſelves Teachers having itching
Ears, and they ſhall turn away their Ears from
the truth, and ſhall be turned unto fables.</p>
            <p>The great Founder of our Religion ſent
his Apoſtles by found Doctrine to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the World, and they convey'd
this Spiritual Authority unto others who
ſhould tranſmit it by an orderly Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and as their Miſſion was Heavenly in
its Original, ſo their Doctrine was pure
and holy in all its Tendencies. They
conſidered themſelves as the Ambaſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of Jeſus Chriſt, and Delivered their
Commiſſion without any Mixture or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100948:10"/>
They treated the People with
all Humility and Tenderneſs, but in the
mean time took great care to mortifie
their Luſts and their Paſſions; but
when they grew wanton and headſtrong,
and thought themſelves too wiſe to be
led by their Spiritual Guides and Rulers,
then they would have teachers of their
own, Men choſen by themſelves, ſuch as
were taught to calculate their Doctrines
to popular Fancies and Humours, ſuch
as would proſtitute the Goſpel, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Error and Deluſion, and make
the Kingdom of <hi>Light</hi> ſubſervient to that
of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and inſtead of ſerving our
bleſſed Saviour, they became Slaves to
the People, by whom they were originally
employed: and becauſe they were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
ſucceſsful as to gratifie their Luſts,
they were therefore voted the moſt edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
teachers.</p>
            <p>The Primitive Miniſters of Religion
had their immediate Commiſſion from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
accordingly they endeavoured by all
means to reſtore the Image of God in the
Souls of Men, to raiſe their Thoughts and
Deſigns to that Happineſs and Treaſure
which the World cannot give, which God
truth promiſed and made ſure by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.
The other had their authority from Men,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100948:10"/>
and therefore they muſt needs pleaſe the
People who ſent them. They must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the Rules and Morals of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to the Wicked Practices and deſigns
of the World: they muſt change the
ſtricteſt Maxims of the <hi>Evangel</hi> into
looſer Theorems, and the ſevere Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Ancient Church unto all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and Luxury, the true faith that
works by love unto airy Notions and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.
Thus the People were pleas'd,
and the Goſpel was defeated, the Church
is ruin'd, and God diſhonour'd.</p>
            <p>Every Man in his own ſtation is obliged
<hi>to contend for the Faith once delivered
to the Saints.</hi> When the Foundations
of Eccleſiaſtical Unity are ſhaken looſe,
and the Antient Conſtitutions trampled
upon with great Inſolence and Impiety,
then the hedge of t<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e Religion is not
only Invaded but Demoliſhed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thoſe Sacred Vehicles it muſt Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into Giddineſs and Enthuſiaſm; the
Extravagance of theſe laſt days is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
as it Sceptical, and Chriſtianity it
ſelf is more dangerouſly wounded by the
Deluſions of ſome that are Baptiz'd, than
by the open Blaſphemies of Infidels: The
laſt may be aſſaulted by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> (at leaſt in
their more Lucid Intervals) but the firſt
are altogether inacceſſible: we muſt not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100948:11"/>
preſume to inſtruct them who pretend to
extraordinary Illuminations, their Errors
are made ſtrong by their vanity, they
plead a <hi>Divine Right</hi> to every <hi>New</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and if we approach them in the
ancient Paths of Modeſty and Humility,
they look down upon us with Scorn and
Indignation; Nay, they are inflexible to
the plaineſt and moſt convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>I have frequently, with Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
conſidered the Decays of Religion,
and the Difficulties of our Employment.
We muſt pull down <hi>ſtrong Holds</hi> and <hi>lofty
Imaginations,</hi> and grapple with the rudeſt
Oppoſitions; the Avenues of Mens Souls
are blockaded by paſſion and prejudices
and they are fortified in their Error, not
only by the Corruption of their Nature,
but by the artifice of Seducers, their itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ears are pleaſed, their Luſts are grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
their Paſſions are made more unruly,
their Envy, Hatred, and Malice are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd;
and they are allow'd to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
themſelves from all others by ſpecial
Titles of <hi>Diviſion</hi> and <hi>Singularity,</hi> by which
alone they think to make their <hi>Calling</hi> and
<hi>Election</hi> ſure.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding that we are thus
reſiſted by the Multitude of their Follies
and Deluſions, we muſt not give over by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100948:11"/>
Faintneſs and Deſpondency. We muſt
plead with them, who have left the Unity
of the Church, by the words of Truth and
Soberneſs, and exhort others to continue
in that Doctrine that was reveal'd by our
Saviour, taught by his Apoſtles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by all Churches in the firſt and
beſt Ages, that the preſent Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may not riſe in Judgment againſt
us for our Silence, nor Poſterity cenſure our
Cowardice. We muſt not be aſhamed of
the truth, even when it is contradicted
with all poſſible Violence and Fury.</p>
            <p>I addreſs this ſhort Treatiſe to you,
with a deſign rather to aſſert the Truth,
than to reply to what hath been lately
publiſhed by the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of the Kirk of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt a certain Book, Entituled,
<hi>Apology for the Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. though I think
it neceſſary to make ſome of his Miſtakes
a little more apparent.</p>
            <p>There are certain Practices and Rituals
received by the Chriſtian Church, in all
Ages, which are not determin'd expreſly
in the Holy Scriptures in ſo many Letters
and Syllables, yet by the plaineſt and

            <p>The ſpecial Providence of God hath ſo
watch'd over the Church, that, ſince the
firſt Plantations of Chriſtianity, we have
preſerved to us ſome Records and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of its Doctrine and Practices. The
Books of ſuch as have been learn'd in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
age do plainly demonſtrate that the firſt
Chriſtians were agreed amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the great Articles of Religion,
and in the general Rules of Eccleſiaſtical
Diſcipline and Order, and by this Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Doctrine and Rituals they ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
themſelves againſt Infidels and
Hereticks. There is nothing more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the ſpirit of true Religion than
Stubborneſs and Petulance, and when we
deſpiſe thoſe Conſtitutions that have been
univerſally received amongſt Chriſtians,
we overthrow the Foundations of Peace
and Charity, and conſequently we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
our ſelves from the viſible fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Chriſt's Houſhold and Family.</p>
            <p>When we conſider the Schiſms and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
of particular Churches, the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of ſo many Revolutions, the ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of ſo many Nations, the boldneſs
and activity of Hereticks, we have reaſon
to adore the Goodneſs of God, that ſo
many Monuments of Eccleſiaſtical Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100948:12"/>
are preſerv'd; and whatever is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
determin'd by the Wiſeſt and the
beſt of Chriſtians (their learn'dſt Biſhops
and Presbyters) muſt be received as the
Infallible truth of God, elſe we have no
certain Standard to diſtinguiſh the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Church in former Ages from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
of Hereticks: theſe are new in
their ſeveral Errors and Deluſions, and
upon that very account of their Novelty
were expos'd and refuted by the Ancients:
they neither agreed amongſt themſelves,
nor with the Orthodox. But the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Voice of Chriſtendom in the firſt
and pureſt Ages, is the beſt Key to the
Doctrine and Practice of the Apoſtles and
their Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>If it appear then that the Opinions
which we oppoſe, and are propagated by
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Societies are ſuch as were
never entertain'd in the Chriſtian Church
for fourteen hundred Years after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Incarnation, then I leave it to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſober Chriſtian to conſider, whether he
may ſafely continue in the communion of

Church both Ancient and Modern.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Novelty and Inſufficiency of thoſe
Pleas and Arguments managed
by the Presbyterians in defence
of their New Doctrine of Parity.</head>
               <p>THE firſt Opinion that I charge with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Novelty amongſt our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men,
is this, That they affirm, upon all
Occaſions, that our Saviour hath appointed
his Church, under the New Teſtament (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Provincial, National, or Oecomenic) to
be govern'd by the ſeveral claſſes of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
acting in perfect Parity, and owning
no Subordination to any higher Officer in
the Eccleſiaſtical Senate above a Presbyter
in the modern and current Notion of the
word, Such a Doctrine must be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
conſequence, becauſe it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
new, and never propagated in any part
of the Chriſtian Church until theſe laſt
days of <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Singularity.</hi> In this
Opinion they differ, not only from the
Uniform teſtimony of Antiquity, but alſo
from the firſt Presbyterians amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100948:13"/>
who declare in their Confeſſion of
Faith, that all <hi>Church-Polity</hi> is variable:
ſo far they were at that time from aſſerting
that indiſpenſible, divine, and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>right</hi> of Parity.</p>
               <p>All that the firſt Presbyterians pleaded
was, that their new form was allowable,
and not repugnant to the Oeconomy of
the New Teſtament and Primitive Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that it came very near to the
Original Model of Churches, but they
never thought to advance ſuch a bold and
raſh Aſſertion as to affirm, That the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
Church, by the Original Authority
of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, ought to
be govern'd in all Ages by a Parity of
Presbyters; or that there was no other
Officer in the Church could pretend to
any ſhare of Eccleſiaſtical Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a Presbyter.</p>
               <p>When a Society of Men ſet up for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
Abſolute, and Infallible Right, they
ought to bring plain Proofs for what they
ſay, elſe they muſt needs be look'd upon
as Impoſtors, or at leaſt ſelf-conceited and
deſigning Men. To propagate a Doctrine
under the notion of a probable Opinion
(though it ſhould happen to be an Error)
is conſiſtent with Modeſty, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Learned Men in all Ages; But to
affirm a new Notion to be eſtabliſhed by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100948:14"/>
Divine Right, and to require Obedience
to that Scheme, as a thing that is due to
Supreme and Infallible Authority, is much
worſe than Speculative Enthuſiaſm. If a
man only entertains himſelf with his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Fancies, he alone ſuffers by it:
but if I meet with a company of head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong
Fellows, who muſt needs perſuade
me that they ſee ſo many Armies in the
Air fighting, and with the exacteſt Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of War; nay, their Banners, the
ſhape and colour of their Horſes, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Squadrons, and the whole order of
their Encampment, and will certainly
knock me in the head unleſs I take my
Oath upon it that I ſee all this, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw any ſuch thing in my Life. I think I
have reaſon to complain that my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
are very unlucky, I had certainly
rather fall into the hands of High-way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
than amongſt thoſe Spiritual Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
who diveſt me of my Senſes, and
the exerciſe of my Reaſon.</p>
               <p>If you inform our Country men that
their New Doctrine is thus repreſented,
they will tell you that none but wicked
men oppoſe their Government; that it is
Eſtablish'd upon the expreſs Inſtitution of
our Saviour, that it hath been aſſerted and
prov'd by ſeveral Learned Men of their
Party beyond contradiction. But if you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100948:14"/>
ask by what particular argument you may
be convinc'd of the Truth of their New
Doctrine, then they begin to lead you
into a Labyrinth of dark and intricate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
obſcure and perplext Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
ſeveral Texts of Scripture they will
alledge, but ſadly wreſted and diſtorted
from their genuine Meaning and Deſign,
and the uniform Suffrages of all the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents:
And if you are not ſatisfied with
ſuch proofs as they advance, you muſt be
contented to ſubmit to their Cenſure, and
the New Diſcipline muſt be Obey'd where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their Power is equal to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p>I can give you but a ſhort Hiſtory of
their Arguments by which they endeavour
to Eſtabliſh their Divine Right of Parity.
When you read their Books I think all
their pleas of whatever kind or force may
be reduc'd to theſe three heads. Firſt,
either they pretend that this Parity of
Presbyters is expreſly commanded by our
Saviour; or, ſecondly, They endeavour
to ſupport it by conſequences from ſeveral
Texts of Scripture; or thirdly, from the
Teſtimonies of the ancient Writers of the
Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt I ſay, they pretend that this Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Presbyters (excluſive of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
or Juriſdiction of a Biſhop) is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100948:15"/>
expreſly commanded by our Saviour. This
indeed promiſes veryfair; For if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
hath plainly and poſitively Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that Eccleſiaſtical Affairs ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
in all Churches and Ages <hi>communi
Presbytero'um conſilio,</hi> and by ſuch a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Presbyters as excludes the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Juriſdiction of a Biſhop, then,
without all Controverſie, all Chriſtians are
oblig'd to ſubmit to it. The Conſequence
is plain and undeniable; and becauſe our
Country-men do inſiſt upon this more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
than any of the foreign Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
we ought to hear them calmly and
deliberately; and when they plead the
Authority of our Bleſſed Saviour we muſt
view thoſe Texts with reverence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and ſee if any thing can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from them that may probably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the now Scheme of Presbytery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Parallel Texts of Scripture are,
Matth. 20. 25.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. Dickſon in Matt. and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum, by G. R.</note> But Jeſus called them unto
him and ſaid, ye know that the Princes of
the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them, and
they that are great exerciſe authority upon them.
<hi>v. 26.</hi> But it ſhall not be ſo great among you, but
whoſoever will be great among you, let him
be your Miniſter. <hi>V. 27.</hi> And whoſoever will
be chief among you, let him be your ſervant.
<hi>v.28.</hi> Even as the Son of Man came not to
be miniſtred unto but to miniſter, and to give
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100948:15"/>
his life a ranſom for many. See alſo <hi>Mark</hi>
10. v. 42, 43, 44, 45. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25.
From theſe parallel Places they plead, that
the Officers of Chiriſt's Houſe were by
his own expreſs. Command eſtabliſh'd
in a perfect Equality, even in such a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as excludes the Power and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of any higher Order than that of
a Preſbyter in the modern Notion.</p>
               <p>Let us now examine, whether there
be any Foundation for their Inference
in the Texts laſt mentioned.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, we find that our Bleſſed
Saviour ſuppoſes Degrees of Subordination
amongſt his own Diſciples, as well as all
other Societies, and therefore he directs
the Eccleſiaſticks, who would climb to
the Higheſt Places in the Church, to take
other Methods than thoſe that are moſt
uſual amongſt the Grandees of the
World: He that deſerved Preferment in
the Church was to be the Servant of all,
ſo that this Text refers to the Method of
Promotion, and not to the Extirpation
of their Juriſdiction. They were not to
aſpire to Honour and Dignity by Force
and Violence, or the other Arts that are
ſo faſhionable in Secular Courts, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by all the Acts of Modeſty, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Self-denial.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100948:16"/>
Next, let me ask, whether the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
underſtood this Precept of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the ſenſe of our Adverſaries or
not. If they did, (as it is alledg'd)
how came they to exerciſe Juriſdiction
over all Subordinate Eccleſiaſticks, during
their Life time, in all the Churches they
Planted? Did they go croſs to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Saviour, who perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
his meaning, and to whom the
Precept was Originally delivered.</p>
               <p>But that which Baffles and Expoſes this
Argument to all Intents and Purpoſes, is
this, that <hi>he</hi> did <hi>that</hi> himſelf among them,
which now <hi>he</hi> commanded them to do
to one another, and therefore the doing
of this towards one another in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Command now under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
could not infer a Parity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they Blaſphemouſly infer that Chriſt
and his Apoſtles were equal: for when
you read the Text with attention, you
ſee that our Saviour recommends what
he Enjoyns from his own Conſtant and
Viſible Practice amongſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> that
he himſelf, who was their <hi>Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
was their <hi>Servant,</hi> and therefore it
became the Greateſt among them, in
imitation of him, to be Modeſt, Calm,
and Humble towards all their Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Brethren, and this qualify'd them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100948:16"/>
more than any other thing for Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Promotions.</p>
               <p>It is very ſad that any ſhould be ſo
much Infatuated with their new Schems
of Parity, as to alledge ſuch Texts, which
(if underſtood in their Senſe) Degrades
our Bleſſed Saviour to the Degree of one
of his Diſciples; for what he Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Apoſtles, he Practiſed among
them himſelf. And this is the ſtrongeſt
Motive to engage their Obedience; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may reaſonably infer, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was that our Saviour comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in thoſe places of Scripture, it muſt
of neceſſity be <hi>toto coelo</hi> different from
all Parity and Equality. He Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them, that they ſhould not exerciſe
their Juriſdiction as the Lords of the
Gentiles did, by a Spirit of Pride and
Domination, but rather by the more
Chriſtian and engaging Behaviour of
Charity and Humility. He that was to
be the Greateſt among them, was to be
their Servant, in Imitation of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Patern that was ſet them by our
Bleſſed Lord and Saviour. S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought
himſelf oblig'd to anſwer his Epiſcopal
Character after this manner, when the
Care of all the Churches lay upon him,
when he employ'd his <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Power
to promote the Edification of all Men:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100948:17"/>
and all the Fathers of the Church, who
were advanc'd above their Brethren to
Eccleſiaſtical Power and Juriſdiction,
had this Evangelical Notion of their
Dignity, that they were the Servants of
all others.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid one may
eaſily ſee, that there is no Ground, no
not a Shadow of any Argument for the
New Doctrine in theſe Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
It is true, that <hi>Salmaſius</hi> glances
at this way of Reaſoning in his <hi>Walo
Meſſalinus,</hi> but he lays no great ſtreſs
upon it. That which is moſt to our
purpoſe is,<note place="margin">vid. Bez. in <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that <hi>Beza</hi> himſelf, in his
larger Notes upon the New Teſtament,
aſſerts, that all kind of Juriſdiction is
not forbidden in theſe Texts, but <hi>that</hi>
only which is joyn'd with imperious Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
and Domination.</p>
               <p>Let it be further conſidered, that the
Hierarchy and Subordination of Prieſts
was Eſtabliſhed by Divine Authority in
the lewiſh Church: and if our Saviour
had pull'd down that ancient Polity, and
commanded an Equality amongſt the
Presbyters of the New Teſtament, he
would not have stated the Oppoſition
between his own Diſciples and the Lords
of the Gentiles, but rather between the
Prieſts of the Moſaie Oeconomy and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100948:17"/>
Diſciples of the New Teſtament. When
he reprov'd the corrupt gloſſes that were
introduc'd into the Church by the Scribes
and Phariſees, and taught them Purer
and more Heavenly Strains of Morality,
he ſtates the Oppoſition between the
current Doctrine receiv'd amongſt the
Jews, and that which he himſelf Taught
and Recommended; and there is no
doubt to be made, if he had forbidden
the ſeveral Degrees and Subordinations
of Prieſts, and Eſtabliſhed a perfect E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
he would have ſtated a plain
Oppoſition between the Model of the
Temple, and the other Plat-form that
was to ſucceed in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>As for the other Text that is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cited to ſerve the ſame deſign, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
5.2, 3. It is but the Apostle's Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on our Saviour's Words and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
and it forbids the Spirit of
<hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Inſolence,</hi> as a thing very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable
to all Power and Authority in
the Church. Thus ſuch Texts have been
underſtood from the beginning, and it is
one ſtrong Prejudice againſt the new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that it was never heard of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
theſe latter days.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the Presbyterians cannot
Eſtablish their <hi>Divine Right</hi> upon expreſs
Texts of Scripture, they will ſupport it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100948:18"/>
(as they think) by the Cleareſt and moſt
immediate Conſequence, and this is Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to the moſt Poſitive Command
and Inſtitution.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Smectim.</hi> Jus divin. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Anglican. The Unbiſhoping <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Argument moſt inſiſted on in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their Parity, (excluſive of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Juriſdiction) is built upon the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monomy</hi>
of Biſhop and Presbyter in the
Language of the New Teſtament, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Clergy are <hi>Dichotomiz'd</hi> only
into Biſhops and Deacons in ſome Texts
of Scripture, and in ſome Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Primitive Church. Hence
they exclude the Authority of a Biſhop
above a Presbyter, though the <hi>Offices</hi>
themſelves be as much diſtinguiſhed as
is poſſible in ſeveral Texts of the New
Teſtament. And if this Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
appear Childiſh and Sophiſtical, they
have not another Sanctuary to flee to;
ſo my preſent Buſineſs is to Examine
the force of it.<note place="margin">v. <hi>Cotel.</hi> Not. inpriorem Epiſt S. <hi>Clem.</hi> p. 96. in quibus fuſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100948:18"/>
between <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> in the

that their Argument <hi>a Confuſione Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
againſt the Superiority of a Biſhop
is very Solid and Demonſtrative. To

               <p>Whether a Biſhop be of a Higher Order
than a Presbyter does not now fall under
our Enquiry, nor is it in it ſelf very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.
Sometimes they might be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
of the ſame Order with regard to
the Prieſthood common to either, by
which both Biſhops and Presbyters were
diſtinguiſh'd from the body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and other Subordinate Officers of
the Church, though at other times,
when Authority and Juriſdiction is nam'd,
the Biſhop, (with regard to his Dignity
and Power) is always reckon'd above a
Presbyter.</p>
               <p>Here we are carefully to Obſerve, that
when the Inſpir'd Writers <hi>Dichotomiz'd</hi> the
Clergy into two Orders, they but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Dialect and Example of the
Jews, who thus divided their Miniſters
alſo into Prieſts and Levites, though the
Higheſt Order was again Subdivided
both by the Jews and the Chriſtians,
when the Prieſts were conſider'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100948:19"/>
to that Subordination establiſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Body of the People. This
is very agreeable to the Language of the
Ancient Jews, as well as to the Idiom of
the <hi>Helleniſtical Tribes</hi> of the Apoſtolical
Age: The firſt confounded the name of
the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> with that of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi>
without any other diſtinguiſhing <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſtic</hi>
or Diſcrimination. For Proof of
this ſee <hi>Levit. 1. 7, 8.</hi>

               <p>Here we plainly find that in the firſt
Eſtabliſhment of the Moſaic Oeconomy
(in which the Patriarchal Subordination
of Prieſts was ſtill retain'd) the High
Prieſt is nam'd by the ſame appellative
(without any diſtinction of Order or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction)
that the other Prieſts were
nam'd by: and the Title of a Prieſt was
promiſeuously apply'd, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
or marks of Eminence to the
High Prieſt as well as to the Subordinate.

were extraordinary Privileges and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100948:19"/>
the Jews, though thus plac'd amongſt

name of <hi>Aaron</hi> or <hi>Eleazar</hi> in all the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi>
nor is the word <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> it
ſelf mention'd in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but
either twice or thrice, and <hi>that</hi> only with
regard to the Adminiſtration of after
days. Yet this <hi>Homonomy</hi> of names
could not be reaſonably pleaded <hi>then</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Subordination of other Prieſts
to <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor againſt the Deference due
to his Pontifical Character. Was it
then to be expected that the Apoſtles or
Apoſtolical Men (when they occaſionally
mention'd the Presbyters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
might not make uſe of the currant
Language and Pharaſeology of their own
Country-men, who divided their Clergy
into Prieſts and Levites, as if there were
no more but two <hi>Orders,</hi> even when the
meaneſt of the Jews knew that the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and diſtinguish'd from all Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Prieſts by all marks of Eminence
and Authority?</p>
               <p>It is true, that in the <hi>Hagiographical</hi>
and <hi>Prophetical</hi> Writings, the High Prieſt
is very frequently diſtinguiſh'd by his
Proper and Special Character; yet in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100948:20"/>
beginning of the <hi>Jewish Oeconomy</hi> neither
<hi>Aaron</hi> nor <hi>Eleazar</hi> were called <hi>High-Prieſts</hi>
when they are particularly nam'd,
and if in thoſe days any had been ſo mad
as to have infer'd from this <hi>confuſio No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum</hi>
an Equality between all Prieſts,
he would certainly have been expos'd:
for the Offices themſelves were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
diſtinguiſh'd by thoſe <hi>Special Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries</hi>
and <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> that were peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
appropriated to the one, and deny'd
to the other, ſuch as were viſible to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the meaneſt among the Jews.</p>
               <p>We do not at all deny but that Biſhops
might be call'd Presbyters in the days of
the Apoſtles, and juſtly ſo too, though
they had other Presbyters under their
Government and Inſpection: for the uſe
of the Word <hi>Presbyter</hi> was another
thing <hi>then</hi> than now, if we conſider it
in its full Latitude and Extent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With
us it ſignifies ſuch Prieſts as aſſist the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
in his Eccleſiaſtical Adminiſtrations,
and are accountable to him for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances:
And though all Presbyters
are not Biſhops, yet all Biſhops are Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;
and to infer an Equality of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from the promiſcuous Uſe of Names,
I think, is neither good Logick nor good
Hiſtory.</p>

We do not now Plead, (as ſome Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
People may pretend) that there
ought to be Biſhop above Presbyters
becauſe there was a <hi>High Prieſt</hi> among
the Jews, but rather thus, that the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy</hi>
that obtain'd in the <hi>Patriarchal</hi>

in the New; and though we meet with
the ſame <hi>Dichotomies</hi> of the Clergy in the

in the Old, we ought not to conclude
from thence, that there was an Equality
among them of the Higher Order in that

two <hi>Claſſes</hi> when they ſpoke of them, only
as in Oppoſition to the People, they made
no other diſtinction amongſt them than
that of Prieſts and Levites: But then again,
upon other Occaſions they Subdivided

Was it not then reaſonable, that the
Apoſtles ſhould ſpeak the Language of
the Age in which they lived, and <hi>that</hi>
of their Predeceſſors? Whether then the
Clergy be divided into their ſeveral Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

both is very Agreeable to the Cuſtom of
the Jews. If they compar'd the Prieſts

their <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> and <hi>Subordinations</hi> to
one another, then they were Divided by
a <hi>Tipartite</hi> Diviſion; but if they ſpoke

the <hi>Bipartite</hi> Diviſion was more Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
ſo that the Community of Names
was very obſervable when the <hi>Offices</hi>

And ſince <hi>Clemens Romanus, Origen,</hi> and

to Conclude an Equality amongſt the

               <p>From what hath been ſaid, it is very

               </p>
               <p>The sum of theſe Reaſonings amounts
to this, that when the <hi>Helleniſt</hi> Jews
would diſtinguiſh the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> from
the Levites, they thought the common
Name of a prieſt was ſufficient,<note n="*" place="margin">Apud clariſs. <hi>Dodwell.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertat: Cyprian p. 205</note> as is
evident from ſeveral places in <hi>Phylo</hi> the
Jew. And as it was unreaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clued
from thence that he had not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Authority and Juriſdiction over
ſubordinate Prieſts, ſo now-a-Days an
Argument founded upon the ſame <hi>Topic,</hi>
is equally Impertinent and Sophiſtical.
When the prieſts were compar'd among
themſelves one with another, <hi>then</hi> their
Dignities and Subordinations might be
ſeaſonably mentioned. If we compare
the prieſts of the New Teſtament with
the Deacons, we need ſay no more than
Prieſts and Deacons; but when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Prieſts among themſelves, we
muſt acknowledge their ſeveral <hi>Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prieſts under the Old Teſtament
were only allowed to offer the Sacrifices,
and by their Offering of Sacrifices, were
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100948:24"/>
diſtinguiſh'd from the Levites: So under
the New Teſtament, the Prieſts, both of
the higheſt and ſubordinate Order, offer
the <hi>Euchariſtical</hi> Sacrifice, and by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are ſufficiently diſtinguiſh'd from
Deacons; yet this is no Argument againſt
the Subordination of one Prieſt unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus we ſee there was the ſame
Reaſon for thoſe <hi>Dichotomies</hi> of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
both under the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
ſee that the Jews us'd ſuch <hi>Dichoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
of their Clergy, both under the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic
Oeconomy,</hi> and in the <hi>Apoſtolical Age,</hi>
when the ſuperiority of the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi>
was paſt all Contradiction: And there
can be a very good account given of this
Phraſeology, and way of ſpeaking from
the different Conſiderations that engag'd
both Jewiſh and Chriſtian Writers to uſe
the <hi>Bipartite</hi> or <hi>Tripartite</hi> Diviſion of the
Clergy; for the very ſame Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who only mentioned two Orders,
do in other places reckon up the <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>
of <hi>Biſhop, Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacon,</hi> as
plainly as is poſſible. From theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
I ſay, we may eaſily perceive,
that the Argument pleaded againſt Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
founded upon ſuch <hi>Dichotomies,</hi>
is not only weak, but very Fooliſh and
Extravagant.</p>

Apoſtles and other Presbyters, whether
of the firſt or ſecond Rank is not certain,
but that S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was one of them
is evident from the ſecond Epiſt. to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
1. 6. In the firſt, <hi>Timothy</hi> is exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to neglect the Gift which was given
him with the laying on of the Hands of
the Presbytery. In the laſt he is put in
mind to ſtir up the ſame Gift which he
received by the laying on of St. <hi>Paul's</hi>
Hands. And in the beginning of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
(as S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> Witneſseth) both
Biſhops and Presbyters were ſometimes
call'd <hi>Deacons,</hi> which may be juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 4. 17. and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
themſelves are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and
in the firſt of the Acts, their Apoſtolical
Miniſtry, to which <hi>Matthias</hi> was aſſumed,
is called their <hi>Deaconſhip,</hi> 1 <hi>Act.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100948:26"/>
Now I take it for granted, that if any
Man pretend to infer a Community of
<hi>Offices,</hi> from the Community of <hi>Names,</hi>
which we meet with in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
he muſt needs confound the higheſt
Order of the Church (even the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Dignity) with the loweſt Rank of
Eccleſiaſtical Officers. Yet this is certain
that the ſeveral <hi>Offices</hi> were carefully <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi>
in thoſe Days; thô the Humility
of ſuch as were uppermoſt, taught them
not to be very forward to diſtinguiſh
themſelves from their ſubordinate Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
by Titles of Eminence and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
and the Biſhops in the ſecond
Century tranſcribed the ſame Copy in
their Behaviour, who, thô they were
careful to preſerve the neceſſary Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the Prieſts of the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Order, yet they ſtudied the moſt
modeſt Expreſſions of Humility and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion,
as may be ſeen from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Inſcription of S. <hi>Polycarp's</hi> Epiſtle
to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that Apoſtolic Martyr
and Prince of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>I have conſider'd this Argument the
more carefully, in that I find it over and
over again in all the Writings of our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtic
<hi>Levellers,</hi> as their firſt and laſt
Refuge to which they flee to; and yet
there is not any thing more Frivolous
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100948:26"/>
and Trifling; for the Names of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Officers in the Chriſtian Church, were
frequently aſſum'd by the higheſt, and
diſtinction of <hi>Offices</hi> is rather inferr'd from
their <hi>Practices, Peculiar Miniſtries,</hi> and
<hi>Acts of Juriſdiction,</hi> than from any Names
that we can fix upon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If they cannot eſtabliſh their
New Doctrine of Parity neither upon
the expreſs <hi>Commandment</hi> of our Saviour,
nor upon the <hi>Conſequences</hi> they manage <hi>a
confuſione nominum,</hi> they endeavour to
ſupport it by ſome Teſtimonies of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Fathers. When the Government
and Revenues of the Church were ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly
invaded by <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts</hi>
under <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> the Learned
<hi>Blondel</hi> employed all his skill to make the
Ancients contradict themſelves and all
contemporary Records. When his<note n="*" place="margin">Aplog. proſenten, Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nym. Amſtol. 1646.</note>
Book appeared, the Presbyterians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
(before ever they Read it) that
all was Pure and Undeniable Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and our Country-men think they
need return no other anſwer to any thing
that is written againſt them, than to
ſay that <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and all that may be
ſaid in its defence, is quite Ruin'd and
Deſtroyed by Monſieur <hi>Blondel,</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius.</hi>
And thô there are but very few
of them that ever read them, and that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100948:27"/>
every Line of their Writings, that hath
the leaſt colour of Argument, was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Anſwered and Expos'd, yet ſuch
is the Power of Prejudice and Partiality,
that they ſhut their Eyes againſt the
cleareſt Evidences that are produc'd by
their Adverſaries. It's enough for them
to ſay that <hi>Blondel</hi> hath written a Book
in their Defence, of 549 pages; and this
in their Opinion may bar all Diſputations
of that Nature. When we bid them
name the place that they think proves
their New Doctrine moſt plauſibly, they
refuſe any ſuch cloſe Engagement; they
will tell you that <hi>Jerome</hi> was of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and that their Learned Champion
<hi>Blondel</hi> has ſufficiently prov'd that this
antient Monk was a Presbyterian.</p>
               <p>I muſt not transſcribe the Accurate
and unanſwerable Diſſertations of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Learned Men, who have ſufficiently
expos'd the Writings of <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius</hi>
on this Head, particularly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vind. St. Ignat.</note> yet I may
be allowed to examine ſome of the moſt
remarkable Teſtimonies from Antiquity
that are alleg'd by thoſe Men to ſupport
their Doctrine of Parity, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may have a Sample of their Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Prepoſſeſſions, and if none of
the firſt <hi>Worthies</hi> of the Chriſtian Church
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100948:27"/>
appear for the New Doctrine of Parity,
we may ſafely infer, that there are little
hopes to defend their cauſe by the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of after Ages.</p>
               <p>And in the next place I will particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
examine <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Argument from
the Authority of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
that he miſtakes or (which is much
more probable) hides and miſrepreſents
the Doctrine of that Learned Father; and
if St. <hi>Jerome</hi> be not his Friend, he and his
Aſſociates may deſpair of any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will examine ſome of the moſt
remarkable Teſtimonies from Antiquity,
and the firſt that is nam'd is S. <hi>Clement</hi>
in his famous Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
This is the Celebrated S. <hi>Clement,</hi> ſo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
mentioned by S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">Adverſus Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, lib. 3. cap. 3.</note>
                  <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 3. together with ſome others,
whoſe Names are Written in the Book
of Life, who was fellow Labourer with
the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">V. Doctiſs. Cav. Hiſt. liter. p. 18.</note> and Third Biſhop of Rome
by the Teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſat in the Chair of Rome from the
Year 64, until the Year 81, or 83. He
wrote his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
to compoſe the ſcandalous Diviſions and
Schiſms that had riſen among them
by the Pride and Vanity of ſome
turbulent Brethren, who valu'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon the miraculous Gifts of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100948:28"/>
Spirit, to the Contempt of their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Eccleſiaſtical Governors. It is thought
by ſome, that this Epiſtle was written
towards the end of <hi>Nero's</hi> Perſecution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was advanc'd to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very obſervable that <hi>Blondel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he produces any Teſtimony from
S. <hi>Clement,</hi> acknowledges,<note place="margin">

univerſal conſent of the Ancients this
very S, <hi>Clement</hi> ſucceeded S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the
Government of the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> and thô
they vary as to his Order of Succeſſion,
yet all of them agree as to the thing it
ſelf.</p>
               <p>His firſt Argument for Parity is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on S. <hi>Clement's</hi> Inſcription of his Epiſt.
to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
From this Inſcription he concludes that
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was then Govern'd
by a Colledge of Presbyters, becauſe the
whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wrote to the
whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> not mentioning
the Diſtinction of the Clergy from the
Laity; when the Learned <hi>Blondel</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
at this rate, he deſign'd (it ſeems)
to pleaſe the Independent Party, (who
were then moſt Numerous and Potent in
<hi>England</hi>) rather than the Presbyterians.<note place="margin">Apol. pro ſent Hier. p. 9.</note>
For if his Argument proves any thing, it
proves too much, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Laity
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100948:28"/>
hath an equal ſhare of Juriſdiction in the
Adminiſtration of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs;
with Biſhops and Presbyters? And thus
he might conclude, that when S. <hi>Paul</hi>
wrote an Epiſtle together with <hi>Soſthenes,
Timotheus, Sylvanus,</hi> and all the Brethren
that were with him, that he had no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Authority in the Eccleſiaſtical Senate,
than the meaneſt of the Laity.</p>
               <p>Our Learned Country-man <hi>Junius,</hi>
gives a far more reaſonable Account of
this Ancient Simplicity, of the Writings
of the Apoſtolical Age, than ſuch Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Reaſonings; and he tells us that St.
<hi>Clement</hi> did not prefix his Name, <hi>ut mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtiae
&amp; humilitatis poſteris aetatibus exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar
imitandum proponeret,</hi> and this was
very ſubſervient to his Deſign, that he
might Teach the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (whom he
exhorts to Concord and Humility) by
his own Example, that true and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
Modeſty, which was then ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Practice of the firſt Chriſtians,
when both Clergy and Laity <hi>were of one
Heart, and one Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next attempt that <hi>Blondel</hi> makes
to ſupport his imaginary Parity in the
Primitive Church,<note place="margin">page, 9. 10. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:100948:29"/>
according to the current Phraſeolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
that prevail'd in the Apoſtolical Age.
When they conſidered the Clergy only,
in oppoſition to the body of the People.
I have anſwered this already, when I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
their Argument, founded upon
ſuch <hi>Dichotomies:</hi> But when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this particular place of S. <hi>Clement,</hi>
with regard to that Latitude, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous
uſe of Names, that was very
current in thoſe Days, the Word <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
may be underſtood to comprehend
all thoſe Miniſters of Religion (whether
Presbyters in the modern Notion, or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
who by the firſt Inſtitution, were
obliged to attend upon Tables,) and
then his Argument vaniſhes into nothing;
nay rather it is a ſtrong confirmation of
that which he would moſt willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy;<note place="margin">Vid. doctiſs, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereg. cod. Can. Eccleſ. Prim. lib. 2. p. 314.</note> for by <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> we
may underſtand Apoſtles, Biſhops, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
and Attendants upon Tables; for
the Word <hi>Deacons</hi> in the Language of the
<hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> is taken in the greateſt
Latitude that may be, not only for ſuch
as were appointed by the Apoſtles, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to the Miniſtry of Tables, but
alſo the Apoſtles themſelves, the higheſt
Officers in the Chriſtian Church, are
called Deacons.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 5.</note>

                  </gap>,
&amp;c. And thoſe who were ordain'd
to the ſpecial Miniſtry or Tables, were
Originally conſtituted, that the Apoſtles

And <hi>Tychicus</hi> is called a faithful <hi>Deacon,</hi>
as alſo <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſo likewiſe. <hi>Arthippus</hi> is
commanded to take heed to his <hi>Deacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
thô it be not expreſly determined,
what room he held in the Eccleſiaſtical
Hierarchy, weather he was <hi>Biſhop, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi>
or <hi>Deacons;</hi> nay ſuch was the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Word <hi>Deacon,</hi> in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Age, that it was applyed promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to all the three Order of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
Hierarchy. So that if we underſtand
St. <hi>Clement</hi> according to the current ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Word, we may ſafely judge
him to have meant by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Governors, and by <hi>Deacons,</hi> all
subordinate Miniſters of Religion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch as were promoted the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
or the Deacons who were confin'd
to their Attendance upon Tables. What
advantage then does Monſieur <hi>Blondel</hi>
gain to his cauſe; for though Presbyters
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100948:30"/>
in the modern Notion, are not perhaps
the only Perſons who may be underſtood
by the Word Deacon, yet they may be
comprehended as well as other Miniſters
of a lower Rank.</p>
               <p>Let it be obſerved alſo, that S. <hi>Clement</hi>
ſpeaks not of the Eccleſiaſtical Polity, ſuch
as it was brought to perfection after wards
by the Apoſtles, but rather of the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of the Chriſtian Church, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
after the Reſurrection of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
For thô all the Degrees and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinations
of the Apoſtolical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were founded upon divine Right;
yet they were not in one moment eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in their True and Everlaſting Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
but had their beginning, as the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Church went on from leſſen ſteps to
that more perfect Scheme that was to
continue until the coming of the Meſſiah.
This is certain, that before the Apoſtles
left the World, they eſtabliſhed ſuch an
Eccleſiaſtical Government as ought to
continue in the Church, until the ſecond
coming of our Savioar.</p>
               <p>But let us ſuppoſe that where we meet
with ſuch <hi>Dichetomies</hi> in other Authors,
ſuch a Parity as is intended by the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
may be underſtood; yet when
we view the Text of St. <hi>Clement</hi> more
narrowly, we muſt not preſume to make
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100948:30"/>
any ſuch Inference, for the very ſame
St. <hi>Clement Dichotomizies</hi> the Jewiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
who are known to have had their <hi>High
Prieſt, Chief Prieſts, Prieſts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. (mihi) 40, 41.</note> and <hi>Levites;</hi>
yet he comprehends them all in this ſhort
and <hi>Bipartite</hi> Diviſion. For ſpeaking of
<hi>Jacob</hi> he hath theſe Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
And muſt we from hence conclude
that there was a Parity amongſt the Prieſts
of the Old Teſtament, becauſe they are
thus diſtinguiſh'd from the Laity without
mentioning the ſeveral Gradations of the
Hierarchy amongst themſelves? Nay ſo
little do our Adverſaries gain by ſtraining
the Language of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> contrary to
the Latitude and Simplicity of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Age; that the ſame Author com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
all Miniſters of Religion,<note place="margin">Pag. 10. Edit. Jun.<gap reason="foreign">

one general Word, whether <hi>Prophets,

and not only does he thus ſpeak of the
Prieſts of the true Religion, but alſo of
the * Egyptian Prieſts, who are known
to have had their ſeveral ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>But that which is moſt material to our
purpoſe, is that the ſame St. <hi>Clement,</hi>
when he exhorts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Order and Harmony, ſets before
them the beautiful Subordinations under

Now when we conſider the Primitive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Reaſoning from Jewiſh <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
St. <hi>Clement</hi> had never talked at this

Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> is ſaid to have been

with many who had ſeen our Saviour, and
that he himſelf ſaw him in his younger
Days, and that he knew him to have been
conſtituted Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> by the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100948:32"/>
Apoſtles. This is he who by<note n="*" place="margin">Catalog <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

is called <hi>totius Aſiae princeps:</hi> One would
think that when they name S. <hi>Polycarp,</hi>
they had diſcovered ſome clear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in his Writings to build their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis
upon, but inſtead of this, nothing
but a wretched conſequence founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Bipartite</hi> Diviſion of the Clergy,
mentioned in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
And yet the <hi>Epigraphe</hi> of S. <hi>Polycarp's</hi>
Epiſtle clearly diſtinguiſhes him from
his Presbyters, who were then with him,
which runs thus, <hi>Polycarp and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
that are with him to the Church of
God which is at</hi> Philippi. And if he had
not been veſted with Epiſcopal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and Eminence, amongſt thoſe
Presbyters, how was it agreeable to the
primitive Modeſty and ſelf Denial, to have
named himſelf only in the frontiſpiece of
this Epiſtle, and to mention none of his
Brethern, ſave only by the general name
of Presbyters? This is mighty uneaſie to
<hi>Blondel</hi> and the evidence of Truth forces
from him the following words,<note place="margin">Apol. p. I<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>There are two things that baffle this
ſhadow of an Argument brought from
the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Polycarp.</hi> The firſt is that
<hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who was intimately acquainted
with him, and knew him to have been
taught by S. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, and by
him ordained Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the Hereſies of the <hi>Valentintans,</hi> from
the unanimous Doctrine preſerv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the ſingle ſucceſſors of S. <hi>Polycarp</hi>
downwards to that very Period in which
he wrote. For if the Eccleſiaſtical Power
of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
lodg'd in the College of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
his Argument againſt the Hereticks,
from the Succeſſion of ſingle Perſons, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame Doctrine firſt delivered by
S. <hi>John,</hi> and convey'd by <hi>S. Polycarp</hi> to
the following Biſhops; I ſay ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
ſo manag'd, could have no force,
nor was it poſſible for <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to have us'd
it.</p>
               <p>The next is this, that in the ſame Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of S. <hi>Polycarp</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the
Epiſtles of S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> are zealouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended,
and we need not inform the
Reader how much the Divine Inſtitution,
Power, and Juriſdiction of Biſhops above
Presbyters is aſſerted in thoſe Epiſtles of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100948:33"/>
which I am to ſpeak in due time. The
Queſtion then concerning S. <hi>Polycarp</hi> is,
whether we are to believe S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Lions,</hi> who was fully acquainted with
the manner of his Education, Apoſtolical
Doctrine, and promotion to the See of
<hi>Smyrna,</hi> rather than the dark and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
conjectures of later Ages. And from
this ſingle Inſtance alone, we ſee how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible
and Stubborn the Power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
is, how far it drives Men againſt
Light and Conviction, and darkens all
their Intellectuals in defiance of common
Senſe and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>A third Witneſs alledg'd by <hi>Blondel</hi> is
<hi>Hermas,</hi> (I only name ſome few of thoſe
that are neareſt to the Apoſtles) I do not
now enquire into the Authority of this
Book. It is moſt probable that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
towards the end of the Apoſtolical Age;<note place="margin">Vid. Teſt. Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ad frontem editionis, <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </note>
and ſome of the Ancients of great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
make him to be the ſame that is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by S. <hi>Paul, Rom. 16. 14.</hi> It is
without all Controverſie, a Book of great
Antiquity, as appears by the Citations
out of him, ſtill preſerv'd in ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Monuments, particularly <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian,</hi> and
<hi>Origen.</hi> There are two palpable eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that Epiſcopacy was the Eccleſiaſtical
Government that obtain'd in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100948:33"/>
Church, when this Book was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
The firſt is from the ſecond <hi>Viſion</hi>
of the firſt Book, where the ſending of
the <hi>Encyclical</hi> Epiſtle in <hi>exteras civitates,</hi> is
inſinuated to be the peculiar Priviledge of
S. <hi>Clement,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The
other inſinuation is from the ſecond Book,
and 12th Mandat. Paragr. 2. where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
the prepoſterous Ambition of ſuch
as would thruſt themſelves into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
dignities, contrary to the Evangelical
Methods of Humility and ſelf-denial, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altat
enim ſe, &amp; vult primam Cathedram ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere.</hi>
If there be no Power, there can
be no Abuſe of it, and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
that inſatiable thirſt of Preferment
that puts ſome amongſt them upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and Deſigns, contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of our Saviour who taught us, that
he that deſerv'd the Eccleſiaſtical Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was to be the Servant of all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many of the Primitive Biſhops fled
and hid themſelves upon the firſt Motion
of their being nam'd to the Epiſcopal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
And the other Citation from Book
the third, <hi>Similitud</hi> 8. inſinuates the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſame thing that I intend, <hi>viz., a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatus</hi>
then eſtabliſhed as the fixt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church which ſome were
too too haſty to graſp.</p>
