            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is the Defendant: And this, Gent. is in a ſpecial Action upon the Caſe, wherein the Plaintiff does declare, That whereas the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Februaery</hi> in the <hi>35th</hi> Year of this King, and before and after for ſeveral Months then next enſuing, he was Mayor of the City of <hi>London,</hi> being duly elected and ſworn into the Office of Mayoralty of the ſaid City, and according to the Cuſtom of the ſaid City time out of mind, he ought daily to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſaid Office in the diligent Government of the ſaid City, according to the Duty of his ſaid Office, which he was to execute to the Honour and Dignity belonging thereunto; That the Defendant, <hi>Thomas Papillon,</hi> being one of the Commonalty of the ſaid City, and under the Government of the Plaintiff, by virtue of his Office aforeſaid, not being ignorant of the Premiſes, but contriving, and falſly, and maliciouſly envying the happy Eſtate of the Plaintiff in his ſaid Office; as alſo unjuſtly to diſturb the Plaintiff in the Execution of his ſaid Office, the ſaid <hi>12th</hi> day of <hi>February</hi> in the <hi>35th</hi> Year afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the Defendant for vexation to the Plaintiff, not having any lawful or probable Cauſe of Action againſt the Plaintiff, falſly and maliciouſly did proſecute the King's Writ of <hi>alias Capias</hi> out of the Court of King's Bench againſt the Plaintiff, by the Name of Sir <hi>William Pritchard,</hi> Knight, directed to the then Coroner of the City of <hi>London;</hi> by which Writ it was commanded the ſaid Coroner to take the Plaintiff, if found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid City, and ſafely keep him, ſo as to have his Body before that Court at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> upon Wedneſday next, after 15 days of Eaſter then next following, to anſwer the now Defendant in a Plea of Treſpaſs: And that the Defendant of his further Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the Plaintiff, afterwards and before the return of the Writ, to wit, upon the <hi>24th</hi> day of <hi>April</hi> in the <hi>35th</hi> Year aforeſaid, at <hi>London,</hi> to wit, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> the Virgin, in the <hi>Poultry,</hi> in the Ward of <hi>Cheap, London,</hi> delivered the ſaid Writ of <hi>alias Capias</hi> to one <hi>John Brome,</hi> Gent. then being Coroner of the ſaid City, to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and then and there the Plaintiff, then being Mayor of the ſaid City, by virtue of that Writ, maliciouſly and unjuſtly did procure to be taken, and arreſted, and detained in Priſon under the Cuſtody of the ſaid Coroner for the ſpace of ſix hours, to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Scandal of the Plaintiff and his ſaid Office, as alſo to the manifeſt Damage, Prejudice, and Grievance of the Plaintiff: Whereas in Truth and in Fact the Defendant at the time of the taking, arreſting, and detaining of the Plaintiff in Priſon, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96564:4"/>
had not any juſt or probable Cauſe of Action againſt the Plaintiff in the Premiſes, whereby the Plaintiff ſays he is injured, and which he lays to his Damage 10000 <hi>l.</hi> To this the Defendant has pleaded Not Guilty. If we that are of Counſel for the Plaintiff ſhall prove this matter unto you, Gentlemen, that we have laid in the Declaration that has been opened unto you, you are to find for the Plaintiff, and I hope will repair him in Damages for this Affront and Injury.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Counſel in this Caſe for the Plaintiff; and this Action is brought, Gentlemen, to vindicate the Honour of the Chair from ſuch Affronts as theſe, which in no Age, till of late days, our Times of Faction and Confuſion, it ever met with; That by a Perſon that is a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> and one of the Commonalty, that ought to have paid Submiſſion to the Lord Moyor as his Chief Magiſtrate, and was bound ſo to do by his Oath as a Free-man ſhould, without Cauſe of Suit, arreſt the Lord Mayor of the City. That there was no probable Cauſe, is evident by his not proceeding in the Action that he had thus brought. But, Gentlemen, we ſhall ſhew you in the courſe of our Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that there lay a further Malice in this Caſe, and that there was a Deſign in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government. For we ſhall give you Evidence that this Deſign was laid to carry on the great Plot againſt the Lives of the King and his Brother, and for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Government. For they contrived it ſo, that they would impriſon the Mayor, and then, thought they, the Loyal Citizens will interpoſe to reſcue him, and then the Party ſhould riſe to aſſiſt the Officer, he having the Countenance of Authority, and being in the Execution of the King's Writ (eſpecially if it be conſidered then who was Coroner) and ſo a publick Commotion would be made, a general Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that would be a fit Opportunity in the Confuſion of the City, wanting its Chief Governor, of doing what they deſigned. Gentlemen, we ſhall prove all that is laid in the Declaration; and likewiſe that the End of this Buſineſs was to have had a Commotion for the accompliſhing their great Conſpiracy as has been opened. That Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> was arreſted in his Mayoralty, I ſuppoſe, will be agreed, or elſe we ſhall prove it.</p>

               <p>My Lord, all that I do know of it is this: It was upon the <hi>24th</hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> I have the Warrant here to ſhew, I met with Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> at Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s the Cook in <hi>Ironmonger-Lane,</hi> and ſeveral others were there; and I went away a little while and came again: While I was gone from them, they put my Name into the Warrant, and upon that Warrant I did arreſt Sir <hi>William Pritchard,</hi> who was then Lord Mayor, at the Suit of Mr. <hi>Thomas Papillon,</hi> I ſuppoſe this is the Gentleman (pointing to the Defendant) I had no Order for it from Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> nor ever ſpoke with him about it; but I had Order from the Coroner, who upon the arreſting of him took my Lord Mayor into his Cuſtody.</p>

               <p>There was ſome Diſturbance upon it among the Officers and People there.

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and one <hi>Ferdinando Burley</hi> arreſted him again at the Suit of Mr. <hi>John Dubois.</hi>

I oppoſed it with much vigour a good while, but at laſt he prevailed upon me to go along with the Coroner; and <hi>Frank Goodenough</hi> his Brother ſaid he would go with me, and he did ſo; and we came and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted my Lord Mayor, as I told you before.</p>

               <speaker>Keeling.</speaker>
               <p>They told me, my Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermen, had made an ill Return to the <hi>Mandamus</hi>'s that were ſerved upon them for the ſwearing of Mr. <hi>Papil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> Sheriffs, and therefore Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> had good Cauſe of Action againſt them; and <hi>Goodenough</hi> ſaid, he had order from them to Arreſt my Lord Mayor upon an Action, and deſired me to be concerned.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Keeling.</speaker>
               <p>The particular Argument that he uſed with me to perſwade me to it, was this, That I having a Trade and Dealing among that ſort of People, they would think ill of me I did not do it.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Keeling.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, but that Party of which Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> and I then was, and they were the Diſcontented Party, I think, for they were ſo diſcontented, that they would have killed the King and the Duke.</p>

               <p>My Lord, about four of the Clock in the Afternoon, this Gentleman, and two more, came to me to my own Houſe, and he did arreſt me (I mean, Mr. <hi>Keeling,</hi> that was ſworn here before me) at the Suit of Mr. <hi>Papillon;</hi> and another of them did arreſt me at the Suit of Mr. <hi>Duboys:</hi> Said I to them, I do not know that I owe them, or either of them, a Farthing. But, what muſt I do? He told me, It was only to give an Appearance. Said I, Gentlemen, I ſhall conſider of that. Then, ſays he, you muſt go to my Lord Mayor: Why, where is he, ſaid I? ſaid he, He is in the Cuſtody of the Coroner at his Houſe. Where, ſaid I? He is gone to <hi>Skinners-Hall,</hi> ſaid he. This is well, ſaid I. So I called for my Man to bring my Cloak. Then they told me, If I pleaſed, they would take my word till to morrow morning, if I would promiſe to appear. I told them they might do as they pleaſed. So they left me; and I went firſt to my Lord Mayor's Houſe, but found him not there; ſo I went down to <hi>Skinners-Hall,</hi> and there I found my Lord Mayor all alone, and no Alderman, only the Officers. I asked his Lordſhip how he came there? He told me, he was arreſted by the Coroner. I asked him how long he had been detained? and, he ſaid, but a little time: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I think it could not be long, for I met his Coach coming back from <hi>Skinners-Hall</hi> when I went. After that he was detained there till about Eleven of the Clock, or thereabouts. This is all I know of it.</p>

               <p>There was preſently a great Noiſe all about the City concerning my Lord Mayor's being arreſted, and abundance of People were gathered together about the Door, but there came a Company of Souldiers of the Trained Bands, and they kept all quiet. There were great apprehenſions of an Uproar. I ſaw nothing of hurt done tho. And I asked Mr. <hi>Brome</hi> the Coroner, who was by, Am I a Priſoner too, for I was arreſted to day by a Warrant pretended to be from you? Says he, I have a Writ againſt you, and now you are here, I cannot let you go till you have given an Appearance. So I took my ſelf to be detained there with my Lord Mayor in Cuſtody, and ſtaid as long as he ſtaid, and went away with him.</p>

               <p>I was not in the Hall where my Lord Mayor was, but in another Room by: and the Officers came running in to me, and told me, I muſt come to my Lord Mayor quickly, for he was arreſted by ſome People. When I came, I found there were none of the Sheriffs Officers that uſed to arreſt People; but the Room was full of other Perſons. My Lord Mayor bid me take the Sword and go along with him, for the Sword-bearer was not juſt then at hand. I asked his Lordſhip whither he was going? The Coroner ſaid, he was his Priſoner, and muſt go along with him to his Houſe. My Lord Mayor bid me preſently ſend out the Officers to ſummon a Lieutenancy, which I did. I deſired the Coroner and his Men to be gone, ſaid I, cannot you let my Lord alone, and go about your Buſineſs? No, he ſaid, except my Lord would give an Appearance, he muſt go along with him. I then asked him whither my Lord muſt go? He ſaid he had no place but his own Houſe to carry him to, and thither we went; where when we came, my Lord was put up into a little Room by himſelf, where were none but my ſelf, and the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as I remember. My Lord Mayor bid me go and ſee for Sir <hi>James Edwards</hi> and Sir <hi>Harry Tulſe,</hi> and my Lord Mayor that now is, and ſo I went, but I found they were arreſted too before I came.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Counſel in this Caſe with the Defendant, Mr. <hi>Papillon.</hi> I ſee, Gentlemen, it is a Cauſe of great Expectation, and by that means they would make it greater by far than indeed it is in it ſelf. But, I ſuppoſe, you who are upon your Oaths to try this Iſſue, will duly weigh and conſider what it really is. Gentlemen, the Record tells you what it is, an Action upon the Caſe, wherein the Plaintiff declares that the Defendant did arreſt him, being then Lord Mayor, without any probable Cauſe, and out of Malice. Now as to that, Gentlemen, I conceive and think I may appeal to my Lord Chief Juſtice in it for Direction in point of Law, that my Lord Mayor, if he do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in his Office, and do not do that which belongs to him to do, he is as much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Proceſs of Law and Actions, as any private Perſon in the City of <hi>London.</hi> If he does any Man an Injury, or does that which is not right in his Office by which another Perſon is grieved, he is liable to the Proſecution of any particular Subject the King has that is ſo grieved by him. Then they alledge that this particular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Arreſt thereupon was proſecuted and done out of Malice, and without proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cauſe. Now what have they proved of that? They prove the thing done, that he was arreſted at the Defendant's Suit, and that he was kept in Cuſtody ſix hours. But if we can give you any account of a probable Cauſe for it, that is ſufficient to juſtify as from this Action. Gentlemen, the Queſtion that you are to try is not,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96564:6"/>
Whether this Man or that Man were duly choſen into ſuch an Office, but whether there were any probable Cauſe for the Defendant to conteſt about the Choice. And herein the Caſe will fall out to be thus. There was a difference in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as is very well known to every body, about the Choice of Sheriffs for the City, wherein the Defendant was one of the Competitors; there were upon the Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Election in the Hall, a great many more Voices or Suffrages for one than for the other, which was certified to the Court of Aldermen and Lord Mayor, as is uſual; but ſome Conteſt being, a Poll was demanded and granted, and upon that Poll my Lord Mayor was pleaſed to declare the Election on one ſide againſt Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> who yet was apprehended by the firſt Choice to be one that had moſt Suffrages. But ſeveral Meetings there were, and ſeveral Common-Halls aſſembled, ſo that it was a conteſted matter, and as I ſaid, there had been a Report made on the Defendant's behalf. We inſiſt not upon the Right of Election, that has been otherwiſe determined. But when he is put in Nomination by the Electors in the City, and has many Suffrages, and he conceives himſelf rightly choſen, and they that are the Managers of the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on give ſuch an account, that in their Judgment he was choſen; that ſurely was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Cauſe for him to proceed upon it. And if there be but a probable Cauſe to bring this to a Queſtion, no doubt he might very well take the courſe the Defendant took. Here is no Arreſt without legal Proceſs; nay, their own Witneſſes ſay there was an offer to take an Appearance without putting it on ſo far as an Arreſt: If my Lord Mayor would have but given an Appearance, there had been an end, but he did not think fit to do that, and ſo the Proceſs of Law was executed upon him. Then here is the Caſe in ſhort: A Man thinks himſelf rightly and duly choſen into an Office, and has probable reaſon ſo to think, for the Judges of the Election think ſo too, and deliver that as their Opinion; ſo that tho he is miſtaken, as the Event proves, yet he is not alone in his Miſtake, nor without ground of his Apprehenſion; then if it be, (under favour) ſuch a Man has no other Proceedings to take in the World for ſettling this matter, but to appeal to your Lordſhip, and that great Court where your Lordſhip ſits, to have a Writ to command the Mayor, or other proper Officer to ſwear ſuch a Man into the Office, or ſhew good cauſe why he doth not. If the Mayor upon the Receipt of the Writ thinks fit to obey it, and ſwears the Man, all is well: If not, he muſt make a Return of the Writ, with the Cauſe why the Command of the Writ is not obeyed. Now the Suggeſtion of the Writ is, that he was duly choſen into ſuch an Office, and therefore he had a fair way to put this matter to an end; if he would have returned he was choſen, or not choſen, there had been an end of the buſineſs, which he ought (under favour) to have done in Obedience to the King's Writ. What then follows upon his not doing ſo? the Party that is grieved hereby has no other courſe to take but to bring his Action againſt the Mayor for it. This courſe the Defendant took, by taking out a Writ againſt the Plaintiff: and what was the Effect of that Writ? It is indeed charged here by the Counſel on the other ſide, that there was a Deſign of a diſcontented Party in it, and I know not what, and a great deal of ſtir made, that a Coroner of the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould arreſt my Lord Mayor. It may be it was not ſo reverently done; but yet if he thought he had good Cauſe of Action againſt him, he might do it lawfully. Doth this prove to you, that this was maliciouſly and unreaſonably done. Malice muſt be to the Perſon; Zeal and Earneſtneſs to have Right done to a Man's ſelf or another, in a legal Courſe of Juſtice, is not Malice, nor will make the Proſecution of the Action unreaſonable and groundleſs. Have they proved to you, Gentlemen, any particular Diſcontent and Malice that was between the Plaintiff and Defendant? No truly, I think, by all the Proof that has been offered, the quite contrary does appear. The Defendant took out a <hi>Mandamus,</hi> directed to the Plaintiff, which was not duly returned: What then doth he do next? Doth he moſt violently arreſt him? that, with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he might do, and no Offence in Law: No, but he doth not do it, but only deſired from time to time, as we ſhall prove anon, that he would but give an Appearance, that would have put a Concluſion to this Diſpute. There is no Appearance given: whereupon he is arreſted and detained in Cuſtody ſix hours. If a Man be once in the Officers Hands taken upon legal Proceſs, how long ſoever the Officer keeps him, is not at all to be laid upon the Perſon that brings the Suit, that is to be looked after by the Officer himſelf. Whatſoever was the Uſage in that matter we are not to anſwer for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96564:7"/>
(tho it is plain an Appearance would have done all preſently) we ſhall prove we gave order to uſe all Deference and Reſpect in the World. And beſides (tho I could not ſpeak it to invalidate any of the Evidence given about the Right of Election one way or other, yet) there being a Return of the Defendant's Election by the Sheriffs to the Court of Aldermen; but they being of another Opinion, gave Order, that thoſe that thought themſelves aggrieved ſhould take their Remedy at Law: Which Order we have purſued in that regular courſe that the Law has preſcribed. And I hope it will never come to that, that a Man (tho miſtaken) conceiving himſelf to have a Right of Action, and ſuing out the King's Writ, ſhall ſuffer for ſo doing, unleſs particular Malice be made to appear. Here is a great Noiſe of Damage, and Diſrepute, and Diſgrace to the Plaintiff and his Office, and he has been pleaſed to reckon his own Damages at 10000 <hi>l.</hi> We ſay he has ſuſtained no Damage by any thing we have done, but we are quite not guilty of this unreaſonable and malicious Proſecution laid to our Charge. And that we are not guilty, the matter that has been opened, we think will ſufficiently declare. For if there were a Conteſt about the Election, and the Sheriffs returned it as their Opinion that the Defendant was choſen, tho they and he too were miſtaken, yet that might give a probable Ground for his purſuing the courſe he did take, and the very Court of Aldermen and the Lord Mayor bidding them take their Courſe at Law, we ſure ſhall not be puniſhed for it. We did not proſecute our Queſtion in any malicious way, but in that Courſe that the Law allows, by taking out the King's Writ; and we hope the Law will protect us for it.</p>

               <p>Will your Lordſhip be pleaſed to ſpare me a Word on the ſame ſide with Mr. Serjeant <hi>Maynard.</hi> I am of Counſel, Gentlemen, with Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant in this Action. We do not inſiſt upon it, nor now offer any thing-to aſſert our Election; We did apprehend we were Elected, but that is ruled againſt us, and we reſted ſatisfied with it. But we come here now before you upon this Queſtion; Whether we had any probable Cauſe of Action, upon which we might take out this Proceſs mentioned in the Declaration, which is a <hi>Capias</hi> upon a <hi>Latitat.</hi> And we do inſiſt upon it, that this Action of the Plantiffs muſt fall upon the Iſſue joined, if we can ſatisfy you, and ſhew that is was not malicious, and without probable Cauſe. And though our Cauſe of Action againſt the Plantiff falls out in the Event not to be a good and ſufficient Cauſe; yet if it were probable, it will evade this Action, and that is all we labour for. They do not attempt to prove, at leaſt-wiſe I have not heard any thing of it, that there was any expreſs Malice, any thing either ſaid or done by the Defendant, more than the cauſing him to be arreſted upon this Writ. It is very well known, it was in the City of <hi>London</hi> a very much controverted Queſtion, Whether Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> or Sir <hi>Dudley North,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> were choſen Sheriffs of <hi>London?</hi> I would not run over the Hiſtory of it, it is but too well known and remembred the Diviſions that were in the City about it. Some were ſo much diſſatisfied with the ſwearing Sir <hi>Dudley North,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> Sheriffs, as thinking them not duly Elected, that they would have the Court of <hi>King's Bench</hi> moved, for the Writ of <hi>Mandamus</hi> to ſwear Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois.</hi> This <hi>Mandamus</hi> was moved for, and granted; and to this Writ the Mayor and Aldermen, to whom it was directed, made a Return that we were not Elected Sheriff of <hi>London;</hi> which Return was apprehended to be falſe; and really to try the Truth of this Return, was the Action brought againſt the Plantiff. A Man that is injured by a Falſe Return, hath indeed no other way to right himſelf, but by bringing an Action againſt them that made it. Upon this Action brought, I hope you are ſatisfied, Gentlemen, from the Evidence that has been already given the Defendant, proceeded regularly and orderly, in a decent manner, applying himſelf to get an Appearance to his Action. And we ſhall prove he did ſo; For, firſt, he took out a <hi>Latitat</hi> againſt my Lord Mayor, and by the Attorney gave him notice of it, and deſired an Appearance; ſo that the Queſtion in diſpute might come to ſome deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But he was not pleaſed to give us an Apperance to that Writ; ſo we took out a <hi>Capias,</hi> gave him notice of it, and deſired an Appearance, but could have no Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; whereupon we took out an an <hi>alias Capias,</hi> which is the Writ mentioned in the Declaration; and the Coroner who has been named, was then told, he ſhould be called upon to make ſome return to his Writ; which he acquainted my Lord Mayor with, and deſired him to give an Appearance; which he refuſing to do, the Officer was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to arreſt him, to execute the King's Writ; and you hear how he treated him, with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96564:7"/>
all the reſpect, and carried him to his own Houſe, where he ſtaid ſome hours and then went away. All this time were we ſatisfied with what was done, we expected no more than an appearance, which at laſt was given. Upon that Appearance we did declare, in the beginning of <hi>Hilary</hi> or <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term (83.) But it fell out, that in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Tearm (83) there was an Information for a Riot upon <hi>Midſommer-</hi>day before, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this conteſted Election, came to be tried. And that coming to Trial, 10 <hi>Maii,</hi> and being found to be a Riot, and the Sheriffs ſworn to be duly elected; thereupon we were abundantly ſatisfied that we were miſtaken, and under miſapprehenſions, and that our Cauſe of Action would not hold, and we did diſcontinue it. Indeed, if we had proſecuted our Action after that, it would have been more like an Angry and a Silly Proſecution, and the whole have had a worſe Conſtruction, than the thing in it ſelf would bear. But when we found the Opinion of the Court to be againſt us about our Election, we immediately diſcontiued our Action. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, we ſhall prove theſe to have been our Proceedings, and that, I hope, will ſatisfy you we are not guilty according as we have pleaded.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Ward.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Counſel on the ſame ſide for the Defendant, and deſire to be heard one word as to ſome Things that have been ſaid on the other ſide in this Cauſe. There have been ſome Queſtions asked that do very much reflect upon the Defendant, and which I would take out of this Cauſe. I ſhall take notice, firſt, what the Queſtions were, and then give them that regard and anſwer which they deſerve. That which is urged, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, by way of Crimination in this Caſe againſt the Defendant, and an unjuſt as well as foreign Reflection (not at all concerning the Cauſe) is, as if the Defendant were acquainted with the Inſurrection and Conſpiracy that was intended againſt the King's Life, and for ſubverſion of the Government, and procured the Plaintiff, then Lord Mayor, to be arreſted, to further and promote that Inſurrection. But as that was inſinnated only for Reflection's-ſake, ſo I hope you, Gentlemen, will be pleaſed to take notice, that not one word of any ſuch thing is proved at all, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ever knew of any intended Inſurrection, nor that this was done with any ſuch Deſign: For even their firſt Witneſs, <hi>Keeling,</hi> from whoſe being imployed by the Coroner in the Execution of the Writ upon Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> the Plaintiff, they would argue that ſomewhat elſe was deſigned in it, doth give a poſitive denial of any ſuch thing now upon his Teſtimony here. And Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> the Defendant never knew him in his Life, nor imploy'd him in this Buſineſs, nor ordered that he ſhould be imploy'd in it, nor ever ſaw him; but the Coroner gave him his Warrant to execute. If therefore <hi>Keeling</hi> and <hi>Goodenough</hi> were concerned in any ill Buſineſs, and have taken upon them to do that which they ought not to have done, that doth not ſignify any thing in this Caſe, nor ought to turn to the Defendant's prejudice. Nor if any thing were done by the Officers that were to execute this Proceſs, that were a <hi>Misfeſance,</hi> or a Male-execution of their Office, that ought not to be imputed as a Fault in the Defendant. But for this Matter now before you, the Caſe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this Point chiefly, Whether the now Defendant had a reaſonable Cauſe, or probable Ground, to bring an Action againſt the Plaintiff at the time when it was brought, and this Arreſt made: For there is many a Man that, at the Commencement of his Action, doth conceive in himſelf he has a good probable Cauſe of Action againſt another Man, that in the Event of Things finds he was miſtaken, and hath no ſuch Cauſe; and thereupon deſiſts the Proſecution of it. Therefore the Probability of the Cauſe at the time-when this Fact was done, is the Queſtion you now are to try. For we are not now conſidering, whether that probable Cauſe did continue and prove a good Cauſe; the Event of this Matter has proved it quite otherwiſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Original Queſtion of this whole Cauſe was, Who were only Elected She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs? And that at the time of ſuch Election made, a great number of Votes paſſed for the Defendant, is, I think, very notorious, both upon the lifting up of Hands, and upon the Poll. Theſe things we ſhall offer to you, and ſhall make it out that theſe gave occaſion to the Defendant to conteſt the Election, and conſequently to the bringing of the Action that the Plaintiff was thus arreſted upon. If then there were ſuch things as theſe that we have opened, which gave a colour to controvert the Right, and the Defendant purſued the Method preſcribed by the Law to bring it to a Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96564:8"/>
and there was no particular diſreſpect or incivility offered to my Lord Mayor, then ſure there was no reaſon to bring this Action againſt us. And that there was no indecent behaviour uſed towards the Plaintiff, doth appear from the Evidence that hath been given of the whole Tranſaction. All that was deſired of my Lord Mayor, was but an Appearance. For this was indeed an Action that did not require Bail, but an Appearance; though, I muſt needs ſay, I never knew any one ſo averſe to give an Appearance to an Action as the Plaintiff was; for after a <hi>Latitat</hi> and <hi>Capias</hi> taken out, and being frequently acquainted with it, and at length upon application af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking out of the <hi>Alias Capias,</hi> and many Attendances, with all the deference and reſpect imaginable, both to his Perſon and Office, not ſo much as a bare Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance could be obtained. Upon the opening of the Declaration, and the Cauſe, you have been told of the great Dangers that were in the Caſe, as to the infringement of Publick Peace, and the Government, which has been very much aggravated on the other Side. But had the reaſonable Requeſt of the Defendant by his Attorney, or the Officer, ſo often repeated, been but complied with, it had been but ſending to any Attorney, and ordering an Appearance; and then, I hope, the Peace of the Kingdom had been in no Peril from ſuch a Deſign as this Arreſt. Which I would not have mentioned, nor ſhould have taken to be at all concerned in the Iſſue now before you to be tried, but that I find them to be taken into the Queſtion, when I hope you will conſider they are no way material to the Point in Controverſy. Now, Gentlemen, in our Defence againſt this Suit of the Plaintiffs, we ſhall call our Witneſſes to prove what we have opened. And our Defence will be in theſe Steps: Firſt, To ſhew the inducement to our Action againſt the Plaintiff, which will ſhew there was a probable Cauſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Give an Account of the reverent Carriage and Behaviour towards the Plaintiff in the proſecution; how with reiterated Applications it was only deſired that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff would give an Appearance, which he was not pleaſed to do; and that thereupon, with great civility, the King's Writ was executed, as indeed I ſee no Proof to the contrary. For neither the Coroner, nor thoſe other People that gave their Aſſiſtance to him, were at all rude in their Carriage to my Lord Mayor; but as ſoon as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt was made, they were all turned off, and the Coroner ſtaid alone with my Lord, and went with him, in his Lordſhip's own Coach, to the <hi>Skinners-Hall,</hi> which was the Coroner's Houſe. Neither was there any thing ill done after all this was paſt: For upon the Plaintiffs appearance, the now Defendant declared in his Action, and intended to purſue it; but it happened that afterwards, in a ſhort time, theſe things ſuffered ſome debate in a Trial that was here about a Riot at this Election, where the Queſtion of the Right and Election, was determined on the other ſide, which gave the Plaintiff in that Action, the Defendant in this, ſatisfaction that he was in a miſtake, and ſo he thought fit to diſcontinue that Action, and proceeded no further—</p>

               <p>You are not try Rights by Club-Law, by Riots, by Noiſe, and by Tumults. Therefore you are miſtaken, to ſay, that was the Queſtion upon the Trial of the Riot. No it was not the Queſtion; but the Defendants there were tried for a notorious Offence, and diſorderly tumultuous Aſſembly, an Aſſembly that had like to have ſet us together by the Ears. Therefore you muſt not talk after that rate. If you will ſpeak, apply to the Buſineſs in hand. Do not make ſuch excurſions, <hi>ad cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum Populum,</hi> with your Flouriſhes, for that is all that is deſigned by your long Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ward.</speaker>
               <p>Have you the Writs here? the <hi>Latitat</hi> and the <hi>Capias?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, Sir, I have not, I did not bring them with me, they are at home at my houſe; If you pleaſe I will fetch them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ward.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, can you tell, Sir, when the firſt Writ was returnable?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>In <hi>Hillary</hi> Term.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ward.</speaker>
               <p>When you had that Writ brought to you, Sir, what did you ſay to my Lord Mayor about it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>I went to my Lord Mayor with Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and deſired my Lord that he would appear to it, as Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> told me he had deſired of him himſelf before. But, he ſaid, he would give no Appearance. If I would take him up upon the Writ, I might do as I pleaſed, and he would conſider and do as he ſhould think fit, but he would not give any Appearance. I told him, I had Writs againſt ſeveral of the Aldermen upon the ſame Account, and that I would wait upon them alſo; and I did ſo, and deſired them to appear, and offered to take an Appearance from them, and gave my Lord Mayor and them time to conſider of it, and came again: but they told me, they had conſidered of it, and would give no Appearance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>When was this, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, to the beſt of my remembrance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>What time did you give my Lord Mayor to conſider of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>About a week, or ſome nine or ten days time, as I remember.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ward.</speaker>
               <p>Where was it that you had that Anſwer, that he had Conſidered of it, and would give no Appearance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>It was at the Court of Aldermen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>Were the Writs brought agen to you?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>There was not time to make a Return then, and ſo they let all alone till a little before the beginning of <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term, and then, one day, Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> the Attorney brought me the Writs agen, and threatned to complain to the Court of me, and acquaint them, that I had neglected the Execution of the King's Writs, two of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ward.</speaker>
               <p>Upon your Oath, Sir, did he threaten you, that if you did not make a Return of the Writ, he would complain?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>He ſaid, I had expoſed him to the Complaint of his Client; and if I did not do it, he would complain to the Court of me: if I would make a Return as I ought to do, well and good, if not—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>If not, what then? Did he uſe any other threatnings, pray Sir, but that he would complain to the Court?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>He did threaten to complain of me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay, Sir, he threatned you; what anſwer did you make to him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Brome.</speaker>
               <p>I did not uſe to execute Writs my ſelf, I told him: thereupon he did propoſe two Perſons to me, Mr. <hi>Keeling,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Burleigh;</hi> For he told me the Sheriffs Officers would not do it.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Brome.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>After I had given thoſe Warrants to the Officers he had named, I told him, I was willing to go once more to my Lord Mayor, to ſee if I could get an appearance of him without Arreſting him; ſo I waited on him at his Houſe at <hi>Grocers-Hall,</hi> but found him then at Dinner; ſo I went away, and came again about Four a Clock, and I firſt ſpoke to Mr. <hi>Gibſon,</hi> and intreated him to let my Lord Mayor know, that I deſired to ſpeak with his Lordſhip, at his leiſure: Afterwards when I came up to my Lord Mayor, he asked me what was my buſineſs? I told him the Writs were renewed, at the Suit of Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> and I was preſſed to make a Return; and I deſired his Lordſhip that he would be pleaſed to give an appearance. He told me he was ready to ſubmit to the KING's Writ, but would not give an appearance; thereupon the Officers named in the Warrant, by my command did Arreſt him.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I never keep my Warrants, they that execute them have them.</p>

               <p>But anſwer me, To whom did you make them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Brome.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Then I ask you upon your Oath, did you before this time ever make any Warrants to any other Perſon, till ſuch time as you made theſe Warrants to Arreſt Sir <hi>William Pritchard?</hi>

               <p>How then came you at <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s houſe to diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout who would be fit to execute the Writ, when you uſed to imploy the Sheriffs Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and there were ſo many of them?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Brome.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>When the Attorney came with a Writ, and deſired a Warrant upon it, it is uſual to take whom he nominates, and make him the Officer to execute it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>

               <p>I went away a while, and came again: Mr. <hi>Brome</hi> came in, and I was away an hour and an half, as I remember, or ſome conſiderable time.

therefore it came to me, I thought it not ſo proper to pitch upon the Sheriffs-Officers, nor would they do it, as he told me; and eſpecially it being to Arreſt my Lord Mayor, I did not think proper to imploy any one that lived in the City.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96564:11"/>
of their coming thither I knew not, nor did expect either of them there; I my ſelf came from <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> either from a Court of Aldermen; or from a Committee, and when I came home, I found them there. We had not been many Minutes together, but in comes Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> the Attorney, and he applyed himſelf particularly to Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> to receive their Orders what he ſhould do, for he ſaid the time was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpent, and he had addreſſed himſelf from time to time to my Lord Mayor, and ſome of the Aldermen to get them to appear, but they would not. They told him then they had given him what Orders they had to give him already; that it was fit the matter ſhould be brought to ſome Trial or Iſſue, that there might be an end of it.

               <p>Gentlemen, Men muſt not think to dance in a Net, and blind all the World. As to my one ſelf, I know theſe things very well, without any of their aſſiſtance, and I only ask theſe things by the bye, to let the world be ſatisfied what ſort of men theſe are, that pretend to Saintſhip, and yet, you ſee, one can hardly get one word of truth out of them: Let the Law, in GOD's Name, take place, and let every man proſecute his Legal Actions; but when under the Umbrage and Countenance of Law, men ſhall deſire to put themſelves into Offices, and Places of Truſt, on purpoſe to diſturb the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Do you think the Government will ever ſuffer it ſelf to be ſnivelled at, and overthrown by a Company of ſuch Whining Fellows. Let them hiſs and hum, and make a noiſe, and a-do as they will; thanks be to God, 'tis not that time of day now: Such
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96564:12"/>
things have paſt too much uncontroul'd in the Body of this City heretofore. What, Gentlemen, are you baffling the Law with ſuch pretences as theſe now-a-days, and do you think to ſham People into Offices: No, I tell you, Villainy was the foundation of it, and Knavery the ſuperſtructure; and it is high time it ſhould be told out, ſince I hear people begin to doubt of it as a queſtion.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Serjeant,</hi> will you pleaſe to tell my Lord and the Jury, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections you heard the Defendant, Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> give about the Plaintiff, how they ſhould treat him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Serjeant.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I was in the Counting-houſe at <hi>Mr.</hi> Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s houſe, when <hi>Mr. Papillon</hi> and <hi>Mr. Dubois</hi> were there; I went into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Parlour to them, and <hi>Goodenough</hi> coming in, they fell into a diſcourſe about this Action, that was brought by them againſt Sir <hi>William Pritchard,</hi> then Lord Mayor, and ſome of the Aldermen; And <hi>Goodenough</hi> gave them an account how far he had proceeded in it; he ſaid, he could not get any of them to give an appearance, and the time was near ſpent, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know of them what he ſhould do. Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> both, did declare to him over and over again, that it was their mind only to have the matter brought to a fair Trial; and they charged him to look to it to do nothing but what was Legal, and carry it with all reſpect imaginable to my Lord Mayor, as the Chief Magiſtrate of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that he ſhould by all means get an appearance from him if he could, and get the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner, who was an Officer of the City, to go with him, and carry all things fairly and decently.</p>

               <p>Now my Lord we ſhall ſhew that we proceeded ſo far in the Action, as to declare, but afterwards apprehending our ſelves to be under a miſtake, we diſcontinued our Action.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I believe your Lordſhip doth remember there were many motions made in Court about this matter, on the one ſide and the other, and at length in Court it was comprimiſed, and my Lord Mayor promiſed to give an appearance.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I only offer this as an Evidence of an appearance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>A Record, I know, is a good and fair Evidence, ſhew that if you can.</p>

               <speaker>Ld. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>A Declaration may well be upon an appearance, but becauſe it cannot be good without an appearance, therefore it cannot be a ſufficient Evidence of it.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Baker.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Aſton</hi> told me he appeared for Sir <hi>William Pritchard,</hi> then Lord Mayor, and had a Declaration from the now Defendants Attorney: So I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred up a Diſcontinuance, and paid the Coſts, and have Mr. <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Receipt for them.</p>

               <p>My Lord, it is a thing that hath frequently happened, that after a man has brought an Action againſt another, he finds he was miſtaken, and hath no cauſe of Action, and thereupon relinquiſheth his Suit: But ſure that will not make him liable to a Suit.</p>

               <p>My Lord, we are not now offering to try the right of Election, tho' that really was the Foundation of the Action that we brought, but we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that queſtion to be determined, and we acquieſced in it when that Trial was over. Now, my Lord, we ſhall ſhew that apprehending our ſelves really choſen, we did in a due courſe of Law, Sue forth our <hi>Mandamus,</hi> directed to the Plaintiff and the Aldermen; and there is a Return made.

            </sp>

               <p>Then that which we ſhall next ſhew, is the grounds and reaſons why we thought this Return was falſe, and thereupon brought our Action.

               <p>You ſay the majority was for <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois:</hi> 'Pray' was the Election declared at that time by the Mayor and Aldermen, or was there a Poll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded?</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> firſt the queſtion was put for the perſons; then the Sheriffs declared their opinion, and a Poll was demanded, and a Poll was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Sheriffs went with the Common-Serjeant up to the Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and acquainted them with it, and then they all came down again, and declared that there ſhould be a Poll.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alderman <hi>Pilkington,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Samuel Shute;</hi> and in the Evening after the Poll was cloſed, the Books were numbred up, the Sheriffs came down upon the Huſtings and declared the numbers, and then as I remember, the number declared for Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> was above 2000. and the number declared for the other two, was ſome Hundreds under 2000.</p>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, we have more Evidence to give in anſwer to what they have brought here. My Lord, that which they would excuſe themſelves by, is, that there was a probable Cauſe; but that will fail them, if it be but obſerved what doth appear upon their own Evidence. It is true, where a man hath a probable right, he may Sue. But this matter here contended for, was never ſuch a right as a man may to ſue for. No man can ever ſhew that for the Shrevalty, an Office of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, an Office of Hazard, and an Office of Charge and Expence, any man did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſue; ſo little ground of reaſon had they to bring this Action for this Office. And then for their Title to the Office, that will appear but very weak. They pretend that my Lord Mayor and Aldermen could not try the right who was Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted truly and rightfully; and they bring this Action to try it; and then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome of the men that held up their Hands, and in their Opinions, Gentlemen, they ſay, the Election fell upon <hi>Rapillen</hi> and <hi>Dubois.</hi> But, Gentlemen, that my Lord will tell you is nothing at all of Title, but a Poll was demanded, and by that it muſt be decided. Then one of their VVitneſſes tells you a ſtory of what the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs did upon the Poll: But all that is nothing too. For we tell you, and ſhall prove it, that thoſe Sheriffs did in a riotous manner, aſſume, and take upon themſelves the Supream Government of the City, and would have excluded my Lord Mayor from it. But all their proceedings, and all that they call a Poll, was void, and can make no Title to any thing at all. It was a bare diſpute of a factious Party, to ſubvert the Orderly Government of the City. There was no probability of Title or Right could be gained by it. For the Chief Magiſtrate of the City, for the time being, ever did direct the Poll, and all the Proceedings upon Election of Officers. And when he did ſo in this Caſe, we ſhall prove to you there was not any conſiderable number (that is, not twenty men) to give any pretence of Title to this Gentleman that thus ſued for this Office. But indeed in that moſt riotous aſſembly one of them that ever was, they do pretend to be Elected: But we ſhall ſhew that for that riotous aſſembly they were convicted here as Rioters upon an Information, and fined to the King for it. And I could tell them of a like Caſe of an illegal Title, a man goeth by a falſe Oath to get a Poſſeſſion of goods, takes out a <hi>Capias,</hi> and with others, getting into a Houſe to arreſt the Party, he then carries away all the Goods, and upon this poſſeſſion would ſet up a pretence of Title: But upon an Information for a Riot, he was ſeverely puniſhed for it.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96564:13"/>
Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> if hehad thought he had had a good Title or Cauſe to bring this Action, he would have imployed better Inſtruments to have proceeded in it. The Attorney he makes uſe of, who is it but Mr. <hi>Goodenough?</hi> one who did not live within the City, nor had any thing to do in it, till brought into Office as the great Inſtrument of Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> in his Actions, and a great Plotter in the late horrid and dreadful Conſpiracy. And this Cauſe, how is it managed? Not by any Counſel of worthy Men of the Robe, or grave Citizens; but by a Cabal of thirty or forty Rioters, moſt of them in the Proclamation, proſcribed as Traitors, and run away from Juſtice upon the Diſcovery of the Plot. All this ſpeaks Malice, and the worſt of Malice; the thing it ſelf ſpeaks it to pretend a Title with ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no ground. For you plainly obſerve, there is no Title but this riotous Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ground their pretences upon. In the Proſecution of this Action, there was no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whatſoever they pretend, for to take an Appearance; I mean by thoſe that really were at the bottom of the Deſign. For the forty Men at the Conſult at <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s, did not meet to be ſure to give Order for an Appearance. No, they had other work to do. An Appearance would not do their work: For, as Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> at large could explain it, they took all Opportunities to riſe and make a Mutiny, and take advantage of the <hi>Mobile</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances to bring about their mainPlot. They did not care five-pence for the Appearance: But when the Soldiers were up, then the Plot was ſpolied, and then my Lord Mayor may go home if he will. Gentlemen, we ſhall prove what I have opened to you, tho' I am perſwaded not one of you but know it as well as I.</p>

               <p>Hold Mr. <hi>Sollicitor,</hi> I tell you before Hand, that as I ſtopp'd them from urging the Trial for the Rior, as any Determination of the Right of Election, or as any ways tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Queſtion now before us; So I muſt not let you neither enter into that matter. The buſineſs of the Indictment, Conviction and Sentence upon the Rioters makes nothing either to the Right of Election, or this Right of Action. And therefore, as I ſaid to Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> it was nothing to the Purpoſe to mention it on that ſide: So it is to no Purpoſe, I muſt tell you, to mention it on the other ſide. For it was no Determination of the Point of Right one way or other. And he could not give it in Evidence, that that was a <hi>Litiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Matter in Diſpute, and upon the Deciſion of that Indictment, (till which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended he had a Right) he found it was againſt him, and ſo deſiſted. No, the Right I ſay was not at all effected by that Trial one way or other. For admitting they had a Right, or you had a Right; yet the gaining your Right muſt not be attempted in a wrongful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but they had a lawful Way to come by their Right; and if they purſued that, well and good; if not, then they muſt take what comes of it.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Lord! the thing is as plain, Gentlemen, as any thing can be. You or they may have a good Title, and yet do a thing that is unlawful to bring the Title into Poſſeſſion. But then the puniſhing you for that unlawful Act, is not an Evidence either againſt or for the Title, nor doth determine it for you, or againſt you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Sol. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we ſubmit to your Lordſhip's Directions in it. But then this we ſay to it; the Queſtion now is reduced to this Point: Whether there were any probable Cauſe for the Defendant's Suit againſt the Plaintiff? They have inſiſted upon it that there was, from two grounds. They call Witneſſes, who declare they were of Opinion, that the Defendant had the Right of Election by the holding up of the Hands. That is one of the probable Cauſes of their Suit. Now that is clearly gone by this ſingle Point, whether the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was determined upon that holding up of the Hands, or they went to a Poll to decide it? If they went to a Poll, then it is clear the Right of Election was not determined; and he could have no Right to be Sheriff upon the holding up of the Hands. Then they went a little further, and offered in Evidence the Sheriff's Poll-books, or the Numbers taken out of them; wherein they ſay, the Majority was for Mr. <hi>Papillon;</hi> and ſo thereupon, ſay they, we brought our Action. Now, to that Objection it is proper for us, with Submiſſion, my Lord, to anſwer it, that that can be no manner of Cauſe of Action in the World; becauſe, ſay we, that was no Part of the Election at all, nor was it at all to govern the Queſtion of Right one way nor other; 'twas a Number of Names taken out of the regular Courſe upon Elections
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96564:14"/>
by Perſons that had no legal Authority; nor was it ſuch a Method, as was a Foundation to ground any Opinion upon one way or other; much leſs, ſuch a one as would be a Cauſe of Action. Theſe are all the grounds they went upon. The firſt, by their own ſhewing, was no ground at all; for there was no Determination of the Right upon the View, but a Poll was agreed upon: The other, we ſhall call Witneſſes to prove was irregular, and ſo not legal. Swear Mr. Town-Clerk.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I never knew a Poll about Sheriffs till about five or ſix years ago, and that was the firſt Poll that ever I knew, and it was between Mr. <hi>Jenks</hi> and Sir <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lewis;</hi> and indeed, it was the firſt that ever I did read of in any time within the City of <hi>London.</hi> I think, I have ſeen the Entry of all the Elections of Sheriffs, that are extant in our Books in all times; and I think, I did never ſee in any of thoſe Entries one Poll that was ever taken for Sheriffs; it is only mentioned, Such an one elected by the Mayor by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; and ſuch an one, by the Commonalty. Among other Books of the City's, there is an old Book, that is called by the Name of <hi>Liber Albus,</hi> which ſpeaking of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Common-Hall for Election of Sheriffs, ſays, <hi>Firſt of all the Mayor ſhall chuſe one of the Sheriffs for</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Middleſex, <hi>for whom he will anſwer; and then the Commonalty ſhall chuſe another to join with him, for whom they will anſwer. And if there ariſe any Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, who is elected, or not elected, it ſhall be determined in the ſame manner, as it is in the Common-Council.</hi> This is all the Notice, that I find in any of the City-Books that looks like a deciding the Election, when diſputed by a Poll. Now in another Chapter of that Book where the Common-Council is mentioned; it is ſaid, <hi>If there be any Diviſion of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Common-Council, the Common-Serjeant and the Town-Clerk, ſhall examine every Man ſeverally, what their Opinion is, which is by way of Poll at this day when we had a Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi> But till that time that the Poll was between Mr. <hi>Jenks</hi> and Sir <hi>Simon Lewis,</hi> I never knew any Poll for Sheriffs, and that Poll was taken immediately by telling one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For my Lord Mayor and Aldermen as ſoon as ever they come upon the Huſtings, make Proclamation to have the Liveries attend for ſuch Elections; and then withdraw and leave the Sheriffs and the Common Serjeant.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Not that I know. As to this Poll, my Lord Mayor cauſed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Hall to be Adjourned to ſuch a time; and after that-ſent for the Common Serjeant, and my ſelf, and required us to go get Books, to take the Poll for Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois;</hi> as for Sir <hi>Dudley North</hi> he was not to be Poll'd for, he being Choſen before, by the Prerogative of the Lord Mayor, and my Lord Mayor and Aldermen declared him fully Elected, and upon that he was called out by publick Proclamation upon the Huſtings, to come and take the Office upon him, as is uſual in ſuch Caſes. But we had directions to provide Books to take the Poll for Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois;</hi> and we did ſo, and took the Poll for theſe three Gentlemen, and upon cloſing of the Poll, we all of us ſealed up our Books, and delivered them to my Lord Mayor; and at a Common-Hall afterwards, he did declare Mr. <hi>Box</hi> to be Choſen the other Sheriff, to be joined with Sir <hi>Dudley North:</hi> The Poll was, as it always ought to be, by the direction of my Lord Mayor; and the Sheriffs are but Officers, and not the Judges and Managers of the Poll, without my Lord Mayor's direction.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen, Here has been much ſaid in this Cauſe that is nothing to the purpoſe. As particularly, that which the Plaintiffs Council did laſt inſiſt upon, who took the Poll, and who had right to take the Poll or not, is not any thing to this Queſtion: This Action is not at all concerned in that matter. For whatſoever the diſpute was, and which ſoever had the right, (and becauſe it was a diſpute, ſome it may be could not Poll at the one, and others would not Poll at the other) yet the lifting up of two thouſand Hands, might make him think that he was Choſen Sheriff; and there lies the Cauſe of his Action, his apprehenſion of a Right: Your Lordſhip did Object this to us, Who ever before brought ſuch an Action as ours, and did ſue to be Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> a Place of Charge and Trouble?—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, I did not make it as any Objection. I asked your Witneſs, <hi>Corniſh,</hi> that Queſtion indeed, for ſome Reaſons that I know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>S. Maynard.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>That may be Objected indeed to the Prudence of my Client, Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> to deſire ſuch an Office: But that proves nothing of Malice in him againſt the Plaintiff; for if he were never ſo unwiſe as to deſire it, if he had a Right to it, or thought he had, it is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96564:14"/>
not a malicious thing in the Eye of the Law, for him to take his Legal Courſe for it; and then the Objection that is made of the Inſtruments that were uſed. Our Attorney <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi> is in a Plot: What is that to us? There is not the leaſt ſuſpicion upon us. He is a bad Man: But that doth not make all his Clients bad. But the Queſtion now before you is, Firſt, Whether there were any probability of a Cauſe of Action. Secondly, if there were not a probable Cauſe; yet whether that Action was grounded upon Malice? What Malice I pray is there in this, againſt my Lord Mayor, to deſire an Appearance of him, when it is conceived, though upon miſtake, that there is Cauſe of Action againſt him? We did not preſs him to give us Bail to our Action, or threaten elſe to arreſt him: No, it was a decent rather than an irreverent Application to him. If then there be not both concurring, want of Title, or probable Cauſe and Malice too, this Action of the Plaintiffs is without ground. No Man that has any Senſe, if he knows he has a clear Title againſt him, will bring an Action; but though it ſhould be clear againſt him, yet if he do bring an Action, but not vexatiouſly and maliciouſly, that cannot ſubject him to an Action; that would frighten Men from bringing Actions upon doubtful matters, which certainly is Lawful for any Man to do. Now what Malice is proved in the Defendant againſt the Plaintiff, the Jury here are Judges of. If we were Criminal in the manner of our Proceedings, they might come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Lordſhip in another way; but ſure this is not the way; and if it ſhould be Action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and we likewiſe ſubject to be puniſhed as a Criminal, then we ſhould ſuffer twice for the ſame fault. Now, Gentlemen, upon this Action we are not to be fined; but they, if they can, are to ſhew what damages the Plaintiff ſuſtained by our Action; and if what we have ſaid do not ſatisfie you, that we had probable Reaſon for what we did, then you upon your Oaths, are to give him what damages you in your Conſciences think he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by it.</p>

               <p>I ſpeak, Sir, of any ſort of Poll; for I ſuppoſe you do not call the holding up of Hands, a Poll.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Town-Clerk.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jenks</hi>'s Poll was the Firſt that ever I knew for Sheriffs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>VVilliams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, Was that managed by the Sheriffs, or by my Lord Mayor, or by you, and the Common Serjeant; or who was it by?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Town-Clerk.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Sir, The Mayor and Aldermen withdraw, and leave the Sheriffs to view the Election by the Hands; and the Common Serjeant propounds the Queſtion, <hi>So many of you as will have,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>VVilliams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>By whoſe direction doth he propound the Queſtion, 'Pray'?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Town-Clerk.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>By the direction of the Common-Hall, I take it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>VVilliams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>But if a Queſtion do ariſe upon an Election, ſo that it cannot be decided by the view, but they go to a Poll, Who is to manage that Poll?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Town-Clerk.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The Officers of the City, by direction of the Lord Mayor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>VVilliams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>That Poll you ſpeak of, for <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>Jenks,</hi> Was that managed by any body, but by the Sheriffs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Town-Clerk.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>It was managed by the Sheriffs and the Common Serjeant, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>VVilliams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>How! in the accuſtomed manner, when you ſay that was the firſt that ever you knew?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Town-Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>It was ſo for Sheriffs; but there have been Polls for other Officers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Why, <hi>Mr. VVilliams,</hi> every body knows that well enough, that the Sheriffs are concerned in the management of the Election or the Poll, as all the reſt of the Officers of the City are, under my Lord Mayor; and the Common Serjeant conſults with the Sheriffs Officers and People about him, upon the view.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>'Pray' Sir, do you remember the Election of Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Corniſh.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Town-Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir, There was a Poll there too, that was the Year after.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>Who managed that Poll?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Town-Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>The Sheriffs, and the Common Serjeant, and I, did agree to take it thus in two Books, whereof one was with the one Sheriff, and the other with the other She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, at the two ends of the Hall.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>That was taken in Writing, Sir, Was it not?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Town-Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir, That other of <hi>Jenks</hi> was only by telling.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>Were you concerned in taking that Poll?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Town-Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>I did aſſiſt at it one day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>Who ordered you to take the Poll that day?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Town-Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, I did concern my ſelf as little as I could in thoſe things: What Report was made to the Court of Aldermen, I cannot tell; but one day coming into the Hall, I had no Mind to concern my ſelf in it; but ſome Gentlemen, did pray me to go up to the Poll; and I did go up.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams,</speaker>
               <p>Sir, Upon your Oath, Did the Sheriffs direct you to take it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Town-Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>I really think they did not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>Did my Lord Mayor direct you?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Town-Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>Did the Sheriffs manage it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Common-Serj.</speaker>
               <p>I did it by Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s Order, who was then Lord Mayor.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, all that we ſay to it is this, We are not now proving our Right upon which we brought our Action, that we ſubmit unto, it is againſt us, we muſt agree it: But be the Right one way, or other; yet we might from a ſuppoſed Right, have a probable Cauſe of Action. It ſeems to be a doubtful buſineſs, by all that Mr. Town-Clerk has ſaid, who has the Right, for all he knows of, the Conſtitution is from <hi>Liber Albus,</hi> and that is ſomewhat dark. You, Gentlemen, hear what is ſaid; the thing was a Queſtion of five or ſix days, and a puzzling one it ſeems, and therefore we might be miſled into an apprehenſion, that what the Sheriffs did was right, and ſo notat all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſelves with what my Lord Mayor did.—</p>
            </sp>

               <p>Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> you talk of that you do not underſtand; for my Lord Mayor was not there at that time of <hi>Jenks</hi>'s Poll: I was Common Serjeant my ſelf, and I know the Sheriffs have nothing to do with it.</p>

               <p>It ſhould ſeem by Mr. Town-Clerk to be doubtful, ſometimes one, and ſometimes another, did direct the taking of the Poll.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I muſt lay it here, it was a doubtful thing, and we brought our Action to try the Right; but afterwards conceiving we were out, and had no Right, we diſcontinued and deſiſted.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Baker.</speaker>
               <p>It was by the Advice of Mr. <hi>Thompſon, Mr. Pollixfen</hi> and <hi>Mr. VVallop,</hi> as I have heard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But you hear what <hi>Keeling</hi> ſays, there was a Party that were at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about it, and that were concerned in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We have done on both ſides, I think, and ſubmit to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's direction in it.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. VVilliams.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, we have done, we leave it upon this Evidence to your Lordſhip and the Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We have no more to ſay for the Plaintiff.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen of the Jury, as my Brother <hi>Maynard</hi> ſaid in the beginning of his Defence in this Cauſe; ſo I ſay now to you, to ſet all things ſtrait and right; God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that any heat or tranſport of the times, ſhould bring us into that Condition, but that every Subject of the Kings that hath a right of bringing an Action at Law againſt another, ſhould have free Liberty ſo to do. And the Courts of Juſtice are now, and I hope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will be ſo open, that every one that would take a Remedy preſcribed by the Law for a wrong done him, may be received to bring his Action, which is a Legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:96564:15"/>
And I am to tell you, Gentlemen, that much has been ſaid in this Caſe, (which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is by the Concourſe of People a Cauſe of great Expectation as my Brother likewiſe ſaid) which is not at all to the Caſe. I am ſorry truly at this time of Day, that we ſhould ſtand in need of ſuch Cauſes as theſe, to ſettle and keep People in their due bounds and limits. But tho' many things have been ſaid in the Caſe that are quite beſides the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Queſtion; yet, they having being made Dependancies upon that Queſtion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems to be a Caſe of ſuch Expectation, I think it will become me in the Place wherein I am, to ſay ſomething to you, and according to the beſt of my Underſtanding, tell you what I apprehend to be the legal Part of it, ſtripped of what hath no Relation at all to it. And if I ſhall omit any thing that is material on the one ſide or the other, here are Gentlemen that are Learned in the Law, who are of Council both for the Plaintiff and the Defendant; and I ſhall not think my ſelf under any ſort of Prejudice in the World, if they take the liberty, as they may freely do, to interrupt me and enmind me of what I forget, or wherein I may miſtake.</p>
               <p>For, Gentlemen, I aſſure you for my own Part, I would not have the Law made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to any Purpoſe, but the exact Rule of Juſtice. I would to the beſt of my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in all Caſes <hi>ſervare jus illaeſum,</hi> preſerve the Law and the Right of every Man invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable. I would have the Law of the Land to be the meaſure of my own and all other Men's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And I hope no Man can juſtly (I am ſure I do not know they can) complain of any Breach or Invaſion that is made in the Courts of Juſtice, either upon Law or Right. But all thoſe that have the Adminiſtration of Juſtice committed to them by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do behave themſelves with all Equity and Impartiality towards all the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; And the Law has as full and free a Courſe, and Juſtice doth every where take place as much as can be deſired by any honeſt and good Man.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in this Caſe that you now are to try, I muſt firſt of all tell you, that this Buſineſs of the Right of Election one way and the other, hath been too much inſiſted on on both ſides. And I ſpeak it, becauſe tho' I my ſelf in my own Mind know what of it is true, and what not; yet I conceive it not ſo proper to be mentioned in this Caſe, it being no legal Evidence to the Point in Queſtion. Now it is a Duty incumbent upon you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; and upon the Court to ſuffer nothing to be urged ſo as to have any weight with you, but what is legal Evidence. That you are only to mind, Gentlemen. So that if I mention to you any Point of Fact that hath not been given in Evidence, as having a true Relation to this Iſſue, you are not to mind what I ſay to you about it. On the other ſide, I muſt likewiſe acquaint you, if there be any difficulty in Point of Law in the Caſe; you are to obſerve the Directions of the Court, who will be always ready to aſſiſt and direct you in it. Or the Gentlemen, that are of Council on the one ſide, or the other may have the Matter found; ſpecially, if they think there is Fact enough to be found to ground a Queſtion upon.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Gentlemen, for the Cuſtoms of the City of <hi>London;</hi> as to the manner of Elections, or who hath the right to manage them, they are not at all material to this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and if they were, there is never a one of you but know it as well as we or any Body doth. I my ſelf had the Honour to ſerve the City of <hi>London</hi> in the Places of Common-Serjeant and Recorder ſeveral Years: So long ago, that not above one or two that ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bench in the Court of Aldermen have been longer converſant in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> or know the Cuſtoms of <hi>London</hi> in thoſe matters better than I do.</p>
               <p>It is notoriouſly known to all that have had any Dealing in <hi>London,</hi> or been acquainted with any thing there, that till within theſe ſix or ſeven Years laſt paſt, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and the Common-Hall uſed to go a-birding for Sheriffs, (you very well know what the Phraſe means) and perhaps it was not once in ten times, that thoſe that were choſen Sheriffs, held; but generally every Year there were I know not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Elections upon ſining off, or ſwearing, or ſome reaſon or other; ſo that now and then, there was but one Sheriff choſen for a great while together; and now and then never a one from <hi>Midſummer</hi> day till near <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> And the way was, to conſider ſuch a one hath moſt Money in his Pocket; Oh! then put him up for Sheriff: And then, if he went off, then another would be found out. And there was one old Deputy <hi>Savage,</hi> that uſed to keep a black Book, that would furniſh Names for I know not how many Elections. And who ſhould be Sheriff, ſo as to divide into Parties, and Poll was never a Queſtion, before ſuch time as Mr. <hi>Jenks</hi> that they ſpeak of came to be put up, and there the Diſpute began; then the Faction began to appear.</p>
               <p>Now if any Man offers to tell me, I apprehended always it was the Sheriffs Right to manage the Poll; I would ask him how that can be a Right that never was done before; let them ſhew me any one Inſtance of a Poll for Sheriffs before that time. No, it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96564:16"/>
known when the Polls began, Perſons did not think the Shrevalty ſuch an Office, that it was ſo earneſtly to be coveted and deſired. Polls indeed uſed to be heretofore for the Bridge-Maſters Places, that are Places of Profit and Advantage; and ſo for Ale-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and the like, thoſe have been often in your time and mine, Gentlemen, we may very well remember them. But this Office of Sheriff, People were not heretofore ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of as to poll for it; but the City was glad if they could get any worthy and fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to accept of it.</p>
               <p>And for the management of the Election, we all can tell the manner of it as well as any thing in the World. After my Lord Mayor and the Aldermen were gone off the Huſtings and retired to this Place, the Common-Serjeant ſtaying there with the Sheriffs, uſed to make a Speech to the Common-Hall, a Rehearſal of what had been before ſaid by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder; and then received the Nomination of ſuch Perſons as were to be put to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for Election from the Common-Hall. And upon the putting of the Queſtion, every Man held up his Hand for thoſe that he deſired ſhould be choſen; and if it could be decided by view of the Hands, well and good; and the Common Serjeant conſulting with the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs and thoſe about him, declared their Opinion, that the Election fell ſo and ſo on the one ſide or on the other; but if doubtful, or a Poll demanded by any one; then they uſed to acquaint my Lord Mayor what was done in the Common-Hall; and thereupon, they gave Order for declaring the Election, or granting the Poll, and uſed to come down to the Huſtings for that Purpoſe; and no one ever thought, that either the Common Serjeant or the Sheriffs, or any Body elſe but my Lord Mayor had the Power of thoſe Courts. For the Common-Hall was always ſummoned by Precept from the Lord Mayor, and when the Buſineſs was done, or was to be put off to another day, the Common-Cryer by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the Lord Mayor makes Proclamation, You good Men of the Livery, &amp;c. may depart for this time, and give your Attendance here again ſuch a Day, or upon further Summons. No Body ever talked of ſummoning a Common-Hall by any Body but my Lord Mayor. He did it by Virtue of his Office, and he diſſolved it, or adjourned it by Virtue of his Office. All this is as notoriouſly known to all Men that know any thing of <hi>London,</hi> as the Faces of you of the Jury are to the People here, or to one another. And this never came to be a Queſtion, till the Buſineſs of the Poll between Sir <hi>Simon Lewis</hi> and <hi>Jenks</hi> came about, which you have heard of. Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> himſelf when he was choſen Sheriff before, and fined for it, was choſen in this manner and no other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>he comes and gives Evidence that the Common-Serjeant was reckoned to be the Man that managed the Choice by Command and Direction of the Sheriffs. And ſome of thoſe Gentlemen, that have been produced on the Defendant's ſide; they ſay, they have looked upon it as the Sheriffs Buſineſs. But alas-a-day it belongs to neither of them, they are but Officers to the Lord Mayor. The Common-Serjeant's Buſineſs is but to put the Queſtion into the Mouth of the Common-Cryer. In ſo much, that when I my ſelf was Common-Serjeant, as I uſed to paſs by the Shops in <hi>London,</hi> they uſed to cry there goes, <hi>So many of you as would have.</hi> It was as plain a Road of things, that every Body knew it before theſe things untowardly have come to be imbrangled by our Factions and Diviſions, and the heat of ſome buſie Fellows. Here are a great many ancient Citizens, that I ſee that know, and ſo do you all, Gentlemen, that this is true. So that all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this Matter is but Flouriſh and Garniture, and doth not affect this Caſe at all one way or other.</p>
               <p>Another thing, Gentlemen, hath been mightily talked of, and urged and inſiſted upon both by Plaintiff and Defendant; and that is the Defendant's Right, or not Right of Election to the Office of Sheriff, and that the Majority was on his ſide, ſay his Council: On the other ſide, ſay the Plaintiff's Council. And for the ſetling that Right, he brought his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt the Plaintiff; but it being determined upon the Conviction for the Riot. There is no ſuch thing, Gentlemen, as that it was therein determined: That cannot be a Determination of any Right at all. For tho' I may have a Right to an Office, or any ſuch thing; yet I muſt purſue a legal Method to attain to that Right, and not go irregular Ways to work.</p>
               <p>As if I have a Right to come into your Houſe, becauſe you have not paid me your Rent, (to make my thoughts and meaning intelligible to you by a familiar Inſtance, which will thew what I intend) I muſt not make a Riot, and turn you by Violence out of Poſſeſſion. For I have a legal Courſe to come by my Right; to wit, by bringing an Action and evict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. But if any Man attempt to get a Right in an unjuſt manner, and he be puniſhed for it by an Indictment or Information, that, I ſay, doth not determine the Queſtion of Right one way or other.</p>
               <p>To come then to the Iſſue, that here you are to try the Point of this Action before us,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96564:16"/>
reſolves it ſelf into a narrow compaſs, and is only this in ſhort, which you are to enquire of, Whether or no the Plaintiff was arreſted by the Defendant without probable Cauſe, and maliciouſly?</p>
               <p>Now matters of Malice, are things that remain in a Man's Heart, and it is impoſſible for me to diſcover whether another Man hath a Malice againſt me; if I do not ſee it in his Actions. Malice being a thing that is internal, is not elſe diſcernable.</p>
               <p>Therefore you muſt conſider the Circumſtances that do attend this Action of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, and if ſo be they are malicious, then you are to find for the Plaintiff: But if they for the Defendant, have offered to you any Circumſtances that can prove or convince you, that he had any probability of a Cauſe of Action, and that not attended with a malicious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of that probable Cauſe, then the Iſſue is with the Defendant.</p>
               <p>This is the Right Queſtion, and the Law of this Action; and the Fact to make it out one way or other is now in Judgment before you, upon the Evidence that hath been given on both ſides.</p>
               <p>Now, in point of Law, I am to tell you, and that you muſt obſerve, That though I have a probable conjectural Cauſe of Action againſt another Man; yet if to obtain my End in that, I proſecute him maliciouſly, with a deſign to ruine him, or to put an Indignity upon him, or the Character he bears in the Publick, or put a hardſhip or difficulty upon him (I mean hardſhip and difficulty in point of time) when it is probable the Remedy may be had at another time, and the ſame thing done with leſs injury, and leſs trouble; then an Action will lie againſt me, for bringing my Action in ſuch a manner; though it be true, that I had a conjectural cauſe of Action againſt him.</p>
               <p>As in the Caſe that was here in this Court the other day, of Mr. <hi>Swinnock</hi> againſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, that came to him and told him in his Ear, that he had an Action againſt him, and this was upon the Exchange; thereupon Mr. <hi>Swinnock</hi> brings his Action for this againſt this Man, for whispering this in his Ear: If he had proved any malicious intention to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace him, no doubt the Action would have lien. For though there might be a Cauſe of Action againſt <hi>Swinnock;</hi> yet if that be maliciouſly purſued to get him arreſted, and held to bail, where no bail is required by Law; or with an intent to diſgrace him upon the Exchange, when it might have been done elſewhere, or at another time, this irregular malicious Proceeding will bear an Action. The purſuing malicious ways, to obtain a Right, makes a Man obnoxious to the Action of the Party ſo proſecuted. I deſire to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my ſelf by Words, that may declare my meaning as plainly as can be: And I hope I do ſo.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, taking it thus as the Counſel for the Plaintiff ſay, to ſhew that the Defendant had no probable Cauſe of Action againſt the Plaintiff; they endeavour to anſwer what is alledged on the other ſide, as their probable Cauſe. And therefore, that we muſt conſider firſt what is ſaid by the Defendant.</p>
               <p>They tell you, here was an Election for Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> where thoſe Perſons that they have nominated, were Candidates, and put in nomination for that Office. And upon that nomination, as ſay thoſe three Witneſſes; we were the Perſons that had the Majority of Voices, and thereupon we apprehended our ſelves Choſen, which gave us the right of Action: So the Defendant ſay they ſheweth ſome probability of a Cauſe of Action; and if he have not purſued it with Malice, but in a regular way, the Probability of the Cauſe doth take off from the Malice, that elſe the very bringing of an Action without Cauſe, would imply in it ſelf. And they ſay true, for I muſt repeat it again, If I have <hi>prima facie,</hi> a probable Cauſe, and purſue it legally, no Action will lie againſt me for it.</p>
               <p>But then ſay they on the other ſide for the Plaintiff, That is no probable Cauſe; for you could from thoſe Tranſactions have no ſuch Apprehenſions of a Right; for that is not the meaſure of a Right of Election, or a Rule to gueſs who is elected by: For there being no deciſion of the Election upon the holding up of the Hands, and a Poll being demanded, whereas the uſual method is to have by the Lord Mayors Order and Direction, the Poll taken by ſuch as he ſhall appoint; you went another way to work, you go your ways and take Books to your ſelves, and come not to the fair determination of the Queſtion: And they bring Mr. Town Clerk to prove. You have heard what the Evidence is, and you are Judges of it.</p>
               <p>Now take it that this were in the Caſe of an Office of Profit; as ſuppoſe it were a Queſtion between me and <hi>John a Styles,</hi> for the place of <hi>Bridge-maſter,</hi> for the purpoſe, and a Poll is demanded, and granted; if they that have no Authority ſhall go after the Court is adjourned by him that has Power, and take a number of Names in the way of a Poll by themſelves, and upon that come and ſay, <hi>I. S.</hi> has four and twenty hundred, and I have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96564:17"/>
but ſo many; that ſure is not any probable Cauſe, nor a Right; for you have gone here out of the known and uſual method of ſuch Matters, and depend upon that which can give no foundation of Right at all. This is the Anſwer that is given to that by the Council for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>You may have fifty thouſand Names for you after that rate, and yet not be Elected, nor have probable Cauſe of any ſuch apprehenſion. We all remember Sir <hi>Samuel Sterling</hi>'s Caſe, which was upon the denial of a Poll for a Place of Profit, that is to ſay, the <hi>Bridge-Maſter</hi>'s Place: But this is upon a wrong Poll.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe there had been a Poll granted (as there was) in this Caſe, and upon that Poll thus managed, Sir <hi>Dudley North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Box</hi> had had the majority but by a very few, and there had been an Action brought in ſuch a Caſe; here was a probable Cauſe as good as in this Caſe, as it now ſtands, becauſe ſome of them might happen not to have legal Suffrages; yet the taking the Poll by Perſons of their own heads, after the Court was adjourned, avoids all; ſo that that would have ſignified nothing. You are to conſider of this Anſwer of theirs.</p>
               <p>Then the great thing, Gentlemen; that you are to obſerve, is this: To bring an Action alone, will ſcarce amount to a proof of Malice; therefore Malice being in this Iſſue a great point of Fact, you muſt weigh the Evidence whether the Circumſtances do ſhew it, that there was Malice in Mr. <hi>Papillon.</hi> If the Circumſtances are enough to amount to a proof of Malice, you then are to find for the Plaintiff; and you are the Judges what Damages it is fit to give him for that Injury: He has laid Ten thouſand pounds; but you muſt do what you that are Judges of it think fit in it.</p>
               <p>Come, Gentlemen, it is beſt to be plain; and no Man needs to be thought wanting of an Apprehenſion, what is the meaning of all theſe things. It is commonly and univerſally known to all Mankind,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That no Man ever did purſue ſuch an Action as this is, to be Sheriff, till theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Times wherein we are, and wherein we have loſt that Quiet and Felicity, which I pray God we may be reſtored unto: And though it is true, a Man may lawfully ſue for ſuch an Office, and it is no Offence; yet it looks ſomewhat extraordinary, and that a Man has a mind to do ſomething unuſual in the Place; 'tis for ſome ſtrange purpoſe or other, eſpecially when a Man has Fined for the Office once before, as we all know Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillon</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Again, It is as notoriouſly known, That for ſeveral years laſt paſt, the Government hath been beſet: And that which is a baſer thing than ever was thought of, or acted in the higheſt times of Villainy in theſe Kingdoms, (I mean thoſe of the late Rebellion) the very Methods of Juſtice have been corrupted, and all to ſerve the main Deſign of ſubverting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This is ſo black a Wickedneſs, that no honeſt Man that has any ſenſe of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, Religion, or common Juſtice, but muſt tremble at the very thoughts of it: When we ſee ſuch Fellows as are obnoxious to the Government, known Diſſenters from the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Worſhip, and that never thought of conforming to the Government, or the Làws Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, or complying with the Church, but only to capacitate them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it; nay, when Men that are taken notice of to be common Reproaches to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which they live, ſhall get into Office to make <hi>Ignoramus Juries,</hi> and to enable People to commit and be guilty of all the Falſities and Baſeneſſes, that Humane Nature is capable of; no Man living, that has any Ingenuity or Goodneſs in him, but muſt cry out againſt it.</p>
               <p>When Men begin to take Oaths to ſanctifie Villainy, and enter into Clans and Clubs, and Cabals, to deſtroy the moſt Merciful of Kings, and to diſturb, diſtract, and overthrow the beſt of Governments, What ſhall we ſay? And all this you, all of you, Gentlemen, know to be true. Was it not more ſafe to commit Treaſon in the City, than to ſit upon a Bench of Juſtice to bring the Traitors to Judgment? Was it not more ſafe to conſpire the Death of the King and his Brother, than to give the leaſt Frown or Look of Diſpleaſure againſt one of theſe ſnivelling Saints? Did not we know that Men were ſanctified to be Jury-men, to enquire of Conſpiracies againſt the King's Life and Government, that before that time were never thought ſit to be truſted with the common Diſcourſes or Society of honeſt Men?</p>
               <p>When Men were thought fitteſt for Offices of ſuch high Truſt, according to their being thought capable of, and well-intended to the over-throw of the Government: Do not we all know this to be as true, as that the Sun ſhines at Noon-day? When Traitors at the Bar were in leſs danger of being convicted of their Treaſons, than the Judges were of their Lives?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Papillon</hi> knows all this to be true eminently. When pack'd Juries were grown to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96564:17"/>
that heighth, that though ſeven or eight Witneſſes came and ſwore poſitive down-right Treaſon, the Traitor could not be by theſe Men ſo much as thought fit to be accuſed by an Indictment; to that ſtupidity in Villainy were things brought by theſe Fellows: Nay, ſo far were the Proceedings in Courts of Juſtice tainted, that in no common Action whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that came here to be Tried, but cropp'd Hair, and a demure Look were the beſt ſigns of a good Evidence; and the buſineſs of an Oath ſignified nothing, provided the Party were to be prop'd up, and the Faction to receive an advantage by it.</p>
               <p>For God's ſake, Gentlemen, let any Man but ſeriouſly conſider and believe that there is a GOD in Heaven, and a dreadful Day of Judgment, when every one of us muſt anſwer for every Thought of our Hearts, every Word of our Mouths, and every Action of our Lives; and then tell me what horrid Impieties theſe are, ſuch as any ordinary ingenuous Perſon would bluſh and tremble at.</p>
               <p>And I would have Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> to conſider, whether ever till that time of famous, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infamous Memory, that he and his Fellow-Sheriff Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> came into that Office, there were ever in <hi>London</hi> ſuch things as Tavern-Returns of Juries, or Clans and Cabals how to pack Fellows together for ſuch wicked Purpoſes as theſe.</p>
               <p>Do not moſt of you here know this? And doth not every one of your Hearts and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences agree with me in it; how far unlike the Proceedings of thoſe times, in reference to Juries, were from what they anciently were? I have had the Honour to practice in this Place among you in my Profeſſion, when without any diſturbance or mixture of Faction and Sedition, we were all quiet, and every one knew his Duty; and Juſtice was done in this place ſo regularly, that it was grown to a common Proverb, if there were any Cauſe of any difficulty, they would uſe to ſay to one another, <hi>Come, we will be ſo fair with you, as to try it by a</hi> London<hi>-Jury.</hi> So far was it then from being thought, that in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Juſtice ſhould be corrupted, that the Ordinary Juries of <hi>London</hi> were thought the beſt Judges, and moſt impartial of any in the Kingdom. I appeal to all the Practicers of thoſe times that hear me, if what I ſay be not true.</p>
               <p>But when once they had begun to pick and cull the Men that ſhould be returned for a Purpoſe, and got this <hi>Factious Fellow</hi> out of one corner, and that <hi>pragmatical, prick-ear'd, ſnivelling, whining Raſcal,</hi> out of another corner, to prop up the Cauſe, and ſerve a Turn; then truly Peoples Cauſes were Tried according to the demureneſs of the Looks on the one ſide or the other, not the Juſtice of the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I take my ſelf bound to tell you of theſe things, and I wiſh I had no reaſon for it; and eſpecially in this Caſe I ſhould not do it, it being a private Action between Man and Man, were it not for the Ingredients that are in the Caſe, and that any Man that has any ſenſe may perceive.</p>
               <p>Now then for this Caſe before you, Gentlemen, I deſire if poſſible to be ſatisfied in one thing or two: My <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> it is true, is not, nor no Perſon whatſoever, be he of never ſo great Quality, is exempt from the Law: If he owe any man any thing, he is bound to anſwer it to him, as much as any the meaneſt Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> or pooreſt Subject the King has: But is he to be arreſted juſt at ſuch a time, becauſe he is Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the City, and the Action will ſound the greater? And the Court of Aldermen, are they to be arreſted, becauſe they are his Miniſters, and neceſſary ſubſervient Aſſiſtants to him in his Government, in ſuch a time as this was, when the Government both in the City and elſewhere, was ſurrounded with Difficulties, and in great danger on all ſides? What occaſion was there for ſuch haſte and ſpeed in this Action to be done juſt then? Would <hi>Mr. Papillon</hi> and <hi>Mr. Dubois</hi> have ſtarved, if this Action had been ſuſpended for a while? Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> would have been as anſwerable to this, or any man's Action, when the year of his Office had been out: But it carrieth Vengeance and Malice in the very face of it; it ſpeaks, that therefore they would do it, becauſe he was then <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> the chief Perſon in the City for the time; and thereby they ſhould affront the Government, in Arreſting and Impriſoning the King's Lieutenant, in one of the higheſt Places both of Truſt and Honour. And this would be ſure to make a great noiſe, and the Triumph of the Action would make their Party then to be uppermoſt, having got the chief Governour of the City in their own Clutches.</p>
               <p>Nay, and becauſe they would be ſure their Malice and Revenge ſhould take place, they take the very <hi>Scoundrels</hi> of the Party to be employed in this great Work. For before that time, the Coroner (as he tells you himſelf) uſed to make his Warrants to the Officers, that uſually are verſed in that Buſineſs; but here he muſt have the Direction of the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and who is that but <hi>Goodenough,</hi> a Man we have all heard enough of; and then <hi>Burley</hi> and <hi>Keeling</hi> muſt be employed; and by whoſe Advice, but by the <hi>Goodenough</hi>'s and <hi>Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp's?</hi> And all theſe Raſcals, who now ſtand attainted of Treaſon, muſt be fetched in to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96564:18"/>
about a ſit Man to make an Arreſt. And there, they pitch upon this Man <hi>Keeling</hi> for one, who was one of the principal Conſpirators in that damnable, helliſh Plot againſt the King's Life, and that of his Royal Brother; but by the Bleſſing and Providence of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, was made uſe of as a great Inſtrument of preſerving thoſe precious Lives, and with them our Government and Religion, and all that is dear to us, which by that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy was undermined; and I wiſh we had not Reaſon to ſay, and think the Conſpiracy ſtill to be going on. But I hope in God, the Government, as eſtabliſhed both in Church and State, will always be able to prevail, maugre all Deſigns, and thoſe that are engaged in them for its Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Keeling</hi> tells you he ſcrupled the Imployment; No, ſaid he, I deſired not to have my Name put in, becauſe I was never concerned in any ſuch thing before, and my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was of another ſort. But then, Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> (and Mr. <hi>Brome</hi> the Coroner no doubt had a Hand in it, tho' now he has a very treacherous Memory, and has forgot all that was done) comes and tells him, you muſt concern your ſelf, and do this thing; for you have a Trade with the Party, and it will be ill taken if you do not do it. And being asked whom he meant by the Party? He tells you, the diſcontented Party, and he explains their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be ſuch, that they would have killed the King and the Duke. Now how far he was engaged with that Party is pretty well known; and therefore, if he boggled at ſuch a thing as this, which that Party it ſeems was engaged in, they would ſuſpect him; and ſo, for the Party's ſake he was drawn in.</p>
               <p>But then, when this thing is done; 'Pray', Gentlemen, do but conſider what the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences might have been, and which, perhaps (nay upon what has happened to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, ſince doubtleſs) they did deſign in it. But God be thanked thoſe Conſequences were prevented, and they themſelves have Cauſe to be thankful to God Almighty for it. For here all the Magiſtrates of the City, that had any Care for the good Government of it, were to be taken up; and then, here was a Body without a Head, a Town full of Faction without any Government; and if the heady Rabble had been once up, without thoſe that had Authority to reſtrain them, where then had been your Liberties or Properties, Gentlemen, or any Man's; Nay, theirs that were engaged in this Deſign, if they had any, for thoſe were things much talked of by them? In what danger had you, and all you had, for Life, Eſtate, Relations, and every thing been? But it pleaſed God in his infinite Mercy to ſhowre down upon us, and upon this City and the Government in a mighty Preſervation, putting it into the Hearts of ſome in Power, to bring the City<hi>-Militia</hi> ſome of them together, and prevent this Miſchief; or elſe, God knows, this whole City might have been by this time once more in Aſhes, and moſt of the King's Subjects wallowing in their own and one another's Blood. And their Party too would have felt the ſad Effects of it, no doubt, as well as others. So that the Conſequence of it was to deſtroy the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that appears by the Parties being engaged in it; it could not be to gain a Right, to make this Hubbub, and ado to arreſt the Magiſtrates of the City; and then take Advantage for ſome other wicked Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Another Point of Circumſtance, that is conſiderable in this Caſe is, the particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were to be ſued. The <hi>Mandamus,</hi> that was directed to the Lord Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen; and there is a Return made, not by this, or that, or the other Man, but in the Name of them all, the whole Court. How comes it then to paſs, that my Lord Mayor, Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tulſe,</hi> and thoſe other Gentlemen, muſt be ſued and arreſted; but I warrant you Mr. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> or his Party, were not to be medled with: No, he had ſo much Zeal for Juſtice, and to do the Defendant Right, that if he ſhould have been called upon to appear, he would not have ſtood out an Arreſt; ſo juſt a Man he is, and ſuch a Lover of Right without all doubt; but he was in no danger I dare ſay, they loved one another too well to ſue one another. That I ſay, Gentlemen, is another Circumſtance, that carrieth Malice in it. For I muſt tell you, theſe things cannot be ſmothered, they are as apparent as the Light: And tho' it falls to my turn in this Cauſe, to enmind you of them; yet, they are as well known to you all, as the Paſſages in your own Families.</p>
               <p>No, Gentlemen, there was not a Purſuit of Right in the Caſe; it was a deſigned Piece of Villainy, on Purpoſe to affront the Government; nay, to deſtroy it, and ſet us all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Ears. And if he were ten thouſand times Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> I would and muſt tell him ſo; and if it were not for ſome ſuch deviliſh End and Purpoſe, he would never have been ſo greedy of an Office, he had before declined and fined for; and which he was only called to by a turbulent, ſeditious, factious Party, that had further aims in it. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I know Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi>'s Humour ſo well, that I am confident, he would much rather have been contented to ſit in his Counting-houſe, than in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in a ſcarlet Gown. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack a-day, I know Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> knows how to ſpend his time to better Advantage to himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:96564:18"/>
Ay, but ſay the Council for the Defendant, we did go on very tenderly and civilly, and reſpectfully; for there met at Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s Houſe, who I pray? Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> and <hi>Goodenough,</hi> the prime Attorney in this Cauſe: And there, forſooth, they tell <hi>Goodenough,</hi> be ſure you do nothing, but what is exactly according to Law; and be ſure, you carry it very civilly and reſpectfully to my Lord Mayor, good Mr. <hi>Goodenough.</hi> Alack-a-day, how wonderful pious, and conſiderate theſe People are! If <hi>Mr. Corniſh</hi> had gone to my Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> as it was his Duty to do, being then an Alderman, (we know it full well) and ſaid to my Lord Mayor, there were ſuch Perſons at my Houſe talking of ſuch a matter, and I come to advertize you of it, and deſire you would conſider of it, he had ſhewn his Piety and his Zeal, and Love for Juſtice, much more in that than in admitting ſuch Cabals in his Houſe. But we know very well, as well as if we were in them, that they muſt go Hand in Hand in all theſe ſeditions and factious Buſineſſes.</p>
               <p>It is plain, Gentlemen, what the Deſign was from the Beginning to the End, nothing but to cauſe a Tumult and Confuſion in the City, in Order to put that damned helliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy for the deſtruction of the King and his Brother, and every Man that was honeſt and loyal in Execution. This is certainly known to you all; and that there ſhould be ſuch a Parcel of People untowardly linked together in this matter, not one man of which that they can pretend to be in anywiſe a Well-wiſher to the Government, or to any that have any ſhare in it: No, they are all Perſons that are obnoxious to the Government that had any hand in it; but none of them Church of<hi>-England-</hi>men, or Friends to her Eſtabliſh'd Worſhip; notorious Diſſenters, or profligate Atheiſtical Villains that herd together.</p>
               <p>This, Gentlemen, is plain Engliſh, and neceſſary to be uſed upon all theſe Occaſions: So that it remains now upon your Conſciences, whether upon all theſe Circumſtances that have been mentioned, you think the bare obtaining of a Right in a Legal Courſe, or ſome worſe thing was deſigned.</p>
               <p>We all know Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> to be a wealthy Man, an able Merchant; one that had rather have minded his Affairs abroad, or at the Exchange, than the expenſive, troubleſome Office of Sheriff of <hi>London;</hi> but, that ſomething was to be done to wreak a damned malice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon the Government. And ſure, he muſt think, as his Party it ſeems did, that they would not be ſufficient to ſubvert the Government, unleſs he could get into that Office.</p>
               <p>This I tell him openly, and let him or his Party make their Remarks upon it as they pleaſe. But you are to Judge whether theſe things be a ſufficient Evidence of malice, to ſupport the Plaintiffs Action.</p>
               <p>There was queſtionleſs a <hi>Deviliſh Malice</hi> fixed in his Heart and Mind, and he wanted an opportunity to effect it; and he thought it for his own ſecurity to be beſt to take this Courſe, and nothing elſe was in it. For abundance of People have a Mind to do miſchief, but want opportunity and ſafe ways to do it in: And, Oh they rejoice, if they hit upon a project, that ſhall carry a ſpecious pretence and colour of Law, for then they think they are ſafe enough.</p>
               <p>As in Caſe, I have a Mind to do any particular Man an injury in his reputation and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the buſineſs muſt not be done down-right, by going to every Body, and ſaying, ſuch an one is Poor, or a Beggar, and do not truſt him; but I muſt cunningly and ſlily inſinuate it, I am ſorry for ſuch a Man, I believe he is an honeſt Man, but however he oweth Money; and under this ſort of <hi>Sniveling, Canting, Whining, ſly rate,</hi> do any Man an injury whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: and yet forſooth he ſhall have no advantage againſt me for it: I ſhall ſtrike a Dart into the very Heart of that Mans Credit, and yet he have no Remedy.</p>
               <p>So if I have a Mind to talk againſt the Government, I will not do it aloud, and ſpeak what I mean openly; but I will <hi>Whine,</hi> and <hi>Snivel,</hi> and <hi>Cant,</hi> and make People believe I have dreadful Apprehenſions of what is deſigning, and yet not bring my ſelf in any danger; for I will keep within bounds all the while, though I do more miſchief than if I dealt fairly and above-board. <hi>Alack-a day</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> ſaid) <hi>I am for the Preſervation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Properties of the Subject, and I am for the Law;</hi> but I find the City is ſtrangely run down in their Rights and Privileges, and there are very Arbitrary Proceedings. And I am a Citizen, and have taken my Oath to preſerve the Privileges of the City, and I will rather ſubmit to the inconvenience of a troubleſome Office, than let all run thus: and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he ſets himſelf <hi>Cock-a-hoop,</hi> as if there were no one that took care of the City beſides himſelf, and he were ſuch a Patriot that there were none like him: And he and Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> forſooth, are the only Men of the times, the only good Men; Men that are for the Liberties and Properties of the Subject, and the Rights of the City: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as theſe are the only Men that have made an Invaſion upon them, and done what they could to deſtroy them; and God knows, we might all of us have enjoyed very quietly every
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96564:19"/>
Man his own, if theſe conteſting <hi>Rioters,</hi> and buſie <hi>Factious Fellows</hi> had not come among us. Every Honeſt Man, I tell you, knows this to be true.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, as to the buſineſs concerning the damages, that if you find for the Plaintiff, is left to your Judgments to conſider of, and give what you ſhall think fit, upon ſuch an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. It is very true, it is not ſo eaſie a matter to aſcertain particular damages in ſuch a Caſe; nor is it in an ordinary way, ſo eaſie to prove, that becauſe Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> was in Priſon but five or ſix hours there, he could ſuffer ſo much damage as comes to ten thouſand pounds. As in the Caſe of a Perſon of great Quality and Honour, it is not eaſie to prove his particular damage; nor in the Caſe of any of you, that are wealthy, able, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Citizens, to ſay you are a Bankrupt, when we all know it is impoſſible to be true, and ſo no particular damage doth enſue, that can be proved; yet however, if the thing for which the Action is brought were deſigned with Malice, though the ill deſign be not effected, that is no thanks to the Party, nor is to weigh with you, but the malicious deſign muſt govern you.</p>
               <p>Now, here I have taken notice to you, that the Malice of this deſign here, was not againſt Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> as ſuch a particular Man, but againſt my Lord Mayor, that this Clan that met at <hi>Ruſſell</hi>'s was an overflowing of that <hi>Gall</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> that was in his Heart.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> had brought an Action upon a Bond only, certainly it had been nothing but what he might very well do; or if he had pretended to ſue for a bad Debt, that if he had ſtaid would have been loſt, it had been ſomething: But you ſee what it was, and it is as apparent why it was, in that Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> ſaid to <hi>Keeling,</hi> threatening him with the diſpleaſure of the Party, if he did not do it; and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brome</hi> were ſuch Strangers to one another, that he muſt threaten <hi>Brome</hi> to complain of him, if he did not execute his Writs preſently. Do they think all Mankind are ſo dull or blind, as not to ſee through ſuch thin Artificial ſtuff as this?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this is the matter, The Government is a thing that is infinitely concerned in the Caſe, that makes it ſo popular a Cauſe: The Government of the City, the Honour of your Chief Magiſtrate, and indeed the Honour of the King, whoſe Subſtitute he was, is concerned, and that puts a weight upon your Inquiry into the damages of this Caſe. You are to conſider you give damages to the Plaintiff, not as Sir <hi>William Pritchard,</hi> but as Lord Mayor: And your ſeverity in this Caſe, will deter all People from entring into Clans and Cabals to make diſturbances, and affront the Government.</p>
               <p>It is a thouſand times better to keep within their own bounds, mind their Callings and Imployments, and concern themſelves with their own Affairs, and leave the adminiſtration of the Publick to them to whom it belongs, and is intruſted with. And according as we ſay in the Law, <hi>Maxime;</hi> ſo ſay I to <hi>Mr. Papillon</hi> and all the Party, <hi>Ad Conſilium ne accedas anicquam voceris.</hi> And do not be ſcared with imaginary dangers, and groundleſs Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, into tumultuous and diſorderly Courſes. You had much better keep in your Counting-Houſe, I tell you again, and mind your <hi>Merchandice.</hi> Nay, and I do not doubt but you would much rather have done ſo, if there had not been ſome further fetch in it. It was not, I dare ſay, out of a frank, generous humor to oblige the City, that <hi>Mr. Papillon</hi> would have ſpent his time and money in the Office of Sheriff; no, I know he had better ways to imploy both.</p>
               <p>It was not the Generous mind of <hi>Mr. Bethel,</hi> that called him on to be Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> to entitle him to ſpend his money; but on purpoſe to be one of the firſt that ſhould turn all things upſide down in the City, and diſturb the Government: And they that ſucceeded him, carried on the Project, and they that would have been in, but could not, had a mind no doubt to follow ſo Worſhipful an Example as he laid before them.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the</hi> Jury <hi>withdrew to conſider of their</hi> Verdict, <hi>and after half an hours ſtay, returned, and found for the Plaintiff, and aſſeſſed Damages to</hi> Ten Thouſand Pounds, <hi>and Coſts to four Marks.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, You ſeem to be Perſons that have ſome Senſe upon you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for the Government, and I think have given a good Verdict, and are to be greatly commended for it.</p>

               <hi>The Matters of Fact in</hi> ELECTION <hi>of</hi> SHERIFFS, <hi>in the Year,</hi> 1682. <hi>Faithfully reported, and the Miſcarriages of Sir</hi> JOHN MOORE, <hi>then</hi> LORD MAYOR, <hi>and ſome other Perſons in this Matter, briefly declared.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE open and bold Invaſion made upon the Liberties and Franchiſes of the City, and that attended with a Contempt of the Laws of the Land, as well as the ancient Cuſtoms and Uſages of the Corporation, doth not only ſerve to juſtifie our complaining of the Rape committed upon the Rights and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Free-men of <hi>London;</hi> but invites us to detect and lay open the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, as well as illegal ways and methods, that have been taken for the overthrow of whatſoever we enjoy, either by Law, Preſcription, or Charter. For as the electing of Sheriffs is granted by Charters, and confirmed by divers Laws to the Citizens of <hi>London;</hi> ſo the conducting the Election, and declaring upon whom the choice through the majority of Votes does fall, hath time out of mind appertained unto, and been claimed by the Sheriffs. And tho' the Common-Hall be not properly a Court, ſave for the puniſhing my Lord Mayor and Aldermen, when they tranſgreſs againſt the Duties of their Places, and the Truſts repoſed in them; yet not only the Right of electing Sheriffs is in that Aſſembly and Convention; but the Power of appointing the manner in which they will have the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection managed, does entirely reſide in the Members, who conſtitute that great Convocation: Yea, ſo far is my Lord Mayor from having, either a Negative upon the Hall, or a Right to preſcribe unto the Citizens whom they ſhall chuſe, that he hath not ſo much as Power and Authority to take the Suffrages of the Electors, or to adjourn or diſſolve the Hall, without the leave and conſent of the greater Number of the Free-men, then and there preſent. And as all this hath been declared, and irrefragably demonſtrated in ſeveral Papers already publiſhed; ſo it hath been affirmed under the Hands of as good Lawyers as are in <hi>England;</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of thoſe Gentleman whom the City have thought worthy to be entruſted in the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Charter againſt the <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> put in for the ſeiſure of it.</p>
            <p>But in defiance of all that hath been ſaid, ſuch is the eaſineſs of my Lord Mayor (to ſay no worſe) that he hath ſuffered himſelf to be prevailed upon to deſpiſe Law, violate Charters, and act in direct oppoſition to the Duty of his Place; and all this, for the gratifying of thoſe, who have not only commenced a Suit for the ſubverſion of the Corporation; but openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that they ſeek the Deſtruction of its beſt and moſt honourable Members. And as the recounting the chief Heads of the matter of Fact is indiſpenſably neceſſary for the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent, as well as future Ages; ſo the bare rehearſal of thoſe things, will fill the World with Amazement, as well as proclaim the Guilt of ſome Perſons, both to this and following Generations.</p>
            <p>And that which offereth it ſelf firſt to our notice, is the Acceſſion of ſome <hi>Miniſters</hi> to my Lord Mayor, to procure him to drink to Mr. <hi>North,</hi> which his Lordſhip without the leaſt Conſideration of that Gentleman's fitneſs for the Place, or any attendance to the Deſign in ſubſerviency whereunto that motion was made unto him; Firſt, tamely complied with, and afterwards performed, notwithſtanding the conſequences which would thereupon enſue, were faithfully repreſented unto him.</p>
            <p>The next ſtep which his Lordſhip took in Purſuance of the like Advice, was to run counter, not only to ancient uſage, but to an Act of Common-Council 7 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. in ſending for Mr. <hi>North</hi> and making him ſeal a Bond to hold Sheriff for the Year enſuing, before he was ſo much as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or propoſed to the Common-Hall, that was not till <hi>Midſummer-day,</hi> which was ſome weeks after my Lord Mayor had cauſed him under the for feiture of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to undertake to ſerve.</p>
            <p>The third Advance made by Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> againſt the Duty of his Place, and the Cuſtoms of the Corporation, was his altering the Form of the Precepts for the ſummoning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Hall againſt the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>June.</hi> And it is remarkable, that whereas not only by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96564:20"/>
Charters, the Citizens are to meet to chuſe annually from among themſelves Sheriffs; but that all former Precepts run in a ſtrain, importing their being to aſſemble to elect Sheriffs; the preſent Mayor did by an unpreſidented and arbitrary Power, ſummon them to convene, to confirm one Sheriff whom he had drank unto, and to chuſe another.</p>
            <p>Nor could his Lordſhip ſtop his Irregularities here; but both after a Declaration, upon whom the Election had fallen through the majority of Hands, and after the Poll which had been demanded, and wherein himſelf had acquieſced, was peaceably and fairly carrying on, he came attended with a Company of Men, whereof many were not Free-men, divers were armed with Swords, and ſeveral were known Papiſts; and not only interrupted the Poll, but contrary to Law and Right, aſſumed to himſelf a Power of adjourning the Hall.</p>
            <p>And having thus far embark'd in ſiniſtrous and unjuſtifiable ways, his next Proceeding was partly by himſelf; and partly by Citizens, whom he countenanced to miſinform his Majeſty, and contrary both to Truth and his own Knowledge, to abuſe the King, in cauſing him to believe, that divers peaceable Perſons had been guilty of a Riot; upon which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>report, as the two preſent Sheriffs were committed to the <hi>Tower;</hi> ſo, the principal blame of it muſt be imputed to his Lordſhip. And as it is the firſt inſtance on the File of Hiſtory, of Perſons being indicted of a Riot, when lawfully aſſembled together, and quietly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that which they met about: So, I queſtion whether our Law-Books furniſh one Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Council-boards committing two Officers, whoſe Place and Duty it was to manage the Poll, and govern the Aſſembly, not only without the hearing of any to ſpeak in their behalf; but in a Caſe, the Cogniſance whereof belongs to the Courts of Common-Law.</p>
            <p>But his Lordſhip's Illegalities hitherto had been both aſcribed to the aſcendancy which ſome had gotten over him, and had been eaſily pardoned, had they terminated here, but it ſeems he was too far engaged to retreat; and therefore, his next Step was to take upon him, contrary to Senſe and common Reaſon, as well as Law, to adjourn the Common-Hall, <hi>July 5th.</hi> not only by a Gentleman, who being no Free-man, could not be ſubſtituted his Lordſhip's Deputy, or <hi>locum tenens;</hi> but by Words <hi>ſignifying only a deſire that they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ,</hi> which did not import the adjourning of them; but left it to themſelves, whether they would do ſo, yea, or not. And accordingly the Hall, without whoſe Conſent they cannot be adjourned nor diſſolved by any, till they have finiſhed the buſineſs about which they are aſſembled, not only refuſed to be adjourned, but required the Sheriffs to go on with the Poll. Which as it was managed with all Prudence, and not ſhut up till after more than uſual and due Proclamation; yet his Lordſhip would not reſt ſatisfied with what was then done (meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as is to be ſuppoſed, becauſe the Election fell upon Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois)</hi> and therefore obtained an Order from the King for a new Hall. For miſſing what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, in getting the preſent Sheriffs turned out by a Convention, intended to have been made up of one Party of Men (which would have been called a Common-Hall) had not other Citizens upon ſmelling the Project aſſembled without Warning, he had no other Retreat left; but to apply to his Majeſty for an Order to begin again. And tho' we have nothing to ſay concerning his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Order, ſave that the printing it for <hi>C. R.</hi> by which, Perſons upon the firſt view are apt to think they meant <hi>Charles Rex,</hi> did not expreſs that Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Majeſty</hi> as is fit; yet, we muſt take the liberty to charge my <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſo often interrupted the Election, and broken in upon the freedom of the City's choice, he did at laſt labour, and as much as in him lay, compaſs the diſſolving and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling of an Election that had been duly made.</p>
            <p>To this we may add his Lordſhip's refuſing to hear divers Citizens ſpeak, when the Hall firſt aſſembled on <hi>Friday</hi> morning, and he was upon the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> tho' it be his Duty to hear every man that hath any thing to offer, and it be their Right and Privilege to ſay whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they will, provided it be agreeable to the matter before them, and within the bounds and compaſs of Law.</p>
            <p>Nor can there be a greater Evidence of the unreaſonableneſs both of the Faction whom his Lordſhip hath eſpouſed in this whole matter, and of his Indiſcretion in heading ſuch a violent ſort of men, than their refuſing to ſuffer an <hi>Act of Parliament to be read,</hi> tho' often propoſed ſo to be; and this, after the whole Hall had hearkened to the reading of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Order, with the greateſt Reſpect, and profoundeſt Silence imaginable.</p>
            <p>And in the next place, how can my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> anſwer either to God or his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in keeping ſo many thouſands together from nine in the morning, till paſt ſix in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, when divers contracted ſickneſs, and ſome loſt their lives, by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat, without coming to a reſolve in himſelf, whether he would acquieſce in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection that was declared on Wedneſday before, or whether he would inſiſt either upon a new Poll, or plead his having choſen one Sheriff by drinking to him, and that all which he would allow the Commons, was to elect another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:96564:20"/>
However, as we may underſtand the capacity of the man, by his having his Gown many times on, to come down upon the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> and pretend to adjourn the Hall, and as often off, as willing to reſt contented in the choice of Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> which the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs had declared two days before, with all the wonted ſolemnity; ſo his ſending for Sir <hi>G. Jeffreys,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> known Enemies to the City Rights, and profeſſedly for the overthrow of the Charter, to adviſe him, and his ſubmitting to their Opinions, which they durſt not ſubſcribe, againſt the Judgment, as well as the irrefragable Reaſons of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder, Mr. <hi>Pollixfen,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> who ſignified their readineſs to put their hands to what they ſaid, are things which he will not be able to account for, either before a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at the Bars in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what will the world think of his taking his laſt reſolution from a Letter which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from a Miniſter of State, ſeeing as it is an high offence againſt the Statute of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. to interpoſe in, or diſturb the Election of any Officers; ſo it is a high offence againſt the truſt repoſed in him, and the integrity of a Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> to take any other meaſures, than what are agreeable to the ſafety and welfare of the City.</p>
            <p>And though we want a name whereby to call his Lordſhip's retracting his word, after he had conſented to the having the Poll go on anew, for two to be choſen out of the Four who had been named; yet we queſtion not but to ſee a Judicature in <hi>England,</hi> that will both know by what Title to ſtyle it, and to call him to an account for renouncing all Faith, as well as Juſtice. For it is obſervable, that he had not only agreed on <hi>Friday</hi> night, to have the Poll proceed for the Election of Two out of Four, but he renewed his agreement as to that particular, to divers worthy Citizens, on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning. But what ſhall be ſaid of a man who upon the coming of Sir <hi>L. J.</hi> receded from his Word, as well as from Law and City-Cuſtom. Yea, it is no ſmall aggravation of his Crime, that he re-aſſumed the pretence of his having choſen one Sheriff by vertue of his Prerogative, after he had heard the Secretary affirm, that they muſt take that courſe, though <hi>rueret Coelum,</hi> all things ſhould <hi>run into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi> And ſhould his Lordſhip's memory fail him, either as to the Polls being demanded for all Four, or as to his granting it, there are ſeveral Perſons who are able to remember it, and whoſe words are beyond all ſuſpicion of falſhood.</p>
            <p>The next thing whereof we may juſtly accuſe my <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> is his uſurping the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the Poll, not only againſt Law and Uſage, but when the Common-Hall had devolved it upon, and lodged it in the Sheriffs. For ſuch was the modeſty of thoſe worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they would not undertake it, tho Cuſtom would have juſtified them in doing ſo, till they had conſulted the Hall, and been empowered by them, as thoſe in whom the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority does reſide over all Affairs which come before them. Here is an Arbitrary Power with a witneſs, not only to claim what his Anceſtors never did, and which conſtant uſage directly gainſays, but to do it in oppoſition to the Vote of three parts in Four of the Hall, who entruſted the Sheriffs with the taking the Suffrages, and declaring the Election.</p>
            <p>And as he who engageth once in illegal courſes, knows not where he ſhall ſtop, ſo his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip having advanced thus far without fear in himſelf, or Law to countenance him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded farther in taking the boldneſs to declare Mr. <hi>N.</hi> Sheriff, not only without his being confirmed, but when 2414. Citizens had expreſly declared and polled againſt his Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>Nay, as if this had not been the height of Extravagancy, his Lordſhip pretends to declare Mr. <hi>Box</hi> Sheriff, tho he had not 1400 Hands; whereas <hi>Mr. Papillon,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Dubois</hi> had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 2400 in the Sheriffs Books, beſides ſome hundreds that polled for them in thoſe that were ſtiled his Lordſhips. So that he hath robb'd the Freemen of the Right of chuſing both the Sheriffs; and inſtead of propoſing only one to them, whom they may confirm or not, as they ſee good, he hath by an arbitrary, and illegal power, aſſumed unto himſelf the impoſing two upon them, againſt their Will and Conſent.</p>
            <p>It were needleſs to recount all my Lord Mayor's Miſcarriages in this Affair; ſuch as not only his denying divers worthy Citizens who were for Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> acceſs unto him, when his houſe was free and open to thoſe of the contrary party; but the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeveral of the beſt quality to be affronted and aſſaulted, if not in his very preſence, at leaſt within his gates. And as if it had not been contrary to the duty of his Office as well as the Wiſdom of a Man, to give up himſelf implicitely to the Government and Conduct of Sir <hi>L. J.</hi> he not only permitted that Perſon to be preſent, at his diſcourſe with ſeveral Freemen, that came to him about the Privileges and Franchiſes of the City; but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at and allowed that Miniſter, in checking and rebuking ſome Gentlemen, who had the courage in his hearing, to claim their Rights.</p>
            <p>Surely, as his Lordſhip hath taken no notice of what befel Sir <hi>Samuel Sterling,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bromfield,</hi> for Offences not near ſo heinous as thoſe he is guilty of, ſo he never read of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96564:21"/>
one Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> that was condemn'd to be hang'd in <hi>Richard</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Knighten.</note> the 2d's time, and with much ado upon the King's interceſſion, had the favour to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed; and this for neglecting the duty of his Place, and acting conformably to the <hi>dictates of Court Miniſters,</hi> particularly for undertaking at the pleaſure of the King, to be Mayor without the conſent, and againſt the will of the Citizens. And as this may inſtruct Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> what he may in due time expect; ſeeing the impoſing ſuch Officers as Sheriffs upon the City, not only without the concurrence, but againſt the Declaration of the Free-men, is a much greater Crime than the ſerving Mayor at the Command of the King, without their conſent; ſo it may forewarn Mr. <hi>North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Box</hi> what is likely to befall them, if they take upon them the Office of Sheriffs againſt the Will of the Citizens. For if King <hi>Richard</hi>'s requiring Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember</hi> to hold Mayor without being duly Elected, could not ſave his Head from the Block, much leſs can Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> calling theſe Gentlemen forth to the Office of <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> protect them from the Puniſhment to which by the Law they ſhall be found liable for ſo doing. And as they will be bold Men that will undertake the Office of <hi>Sheriffs</hi> upon the bare Authority of my Lord Mayor's word; ſo I know not how the preſent <hi>Sheriffs</hi> can reſign the Gaols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto ſuch perſons who pretend to the Office of <hi>Sheriffs</hi> by no better Right.</p>
            <p>Nay, I will be bold to ſay, That ſhould my Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen have the confidence to ſwear Mr. <hi>North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> on <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Eve, that the Common-Hall may Vote them out, and chuſe others in their Room on <hi>Michaelmas-</hi>day.</p>
            <p>But it is pleaſant to obſerve how this pretended Election of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Box</hi> for Sheriffs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enſuing Year, works already with the Papiſts and our <hi>Maſquerade Proteſtants:</hi> for they not only begin to talk of blaſting the belief of the Popiſh Plot, but of Hanging Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants by Wholeſale. And whereas Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi> was contented a few days ago, with the Lives of 9 or 10; nothing leſs will now ſerve them, than the deſtroying of Scores, if not Hundreds, and this within the compaſs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, this we have to rely upon, that whereas Mr. <hi>North</hi> had only 107 hands, and <hi>Mr. Box</hi> 1353 in all the Books, <hi>Mr. Papillon</hi> and <hi>Mr. Dubois</hi> had upwards of 2700 Hands a piece, reckoning in my Lord <hi>Mayor</hi>'s Books with thoſe of the Sheriffs, and were Proclaimed to be duly Elected by the proper Officers.</p>
            <p>And as we cannot think that the King will connive at ſo unjuſt a thing, and which ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſubverts all the Laws, by which he hath ſworn to Govern; ſo we are aſſured that the Judges in his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Courts, will eſteem no puniſhments ſevere enough, as well for them that ſhall act as Sheriffs by no better Warrant, as for him that hath taken upon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them for ſuch, againſt all Law, as well as Preſident.</p>
            <p>And as my Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> may be already ſenſible, how his Fellow-Citizens reſent his late illegal carriage and behaviour towards them, by the many Actions entred againſt him, to which they have demanded appearance, ſo he will find, that all that is hitherto done in order to right themſelves, and chaſtiſe his uſurpation upon their Franchiſes, is but like a few drops before a ſtrom, in compariſon of what he muſt afterwards look for.</p>
            <p>Nor muſt Sir <hi>J. E.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P. &amp;c.</hi> think to eſcape being called to an account, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for abetting the <hi>Mayor</hi> in all theſe Invaſions upon the Privileges of the City, but for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing him unto, and hurrying him upon them. And as it is evident what eſteem they have of his Lordſhip, by uſing him as a Tool to do ſuch unjuſtifiable and enormous things; which, were they themſelves in the Chair, they would neither have the boldneſs nor indiſcretion to attempt; ſo their thus managing a Perſon whom they ſtile their Friend, as well as one to whom they are bound by their Oaths to give ſafe and good Advice, rendreth them Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt Truth, Juſtice, and the Rules of Friendſhip, as well as againſt the Rights of the Corporation, and their own Oath.</p>
            <p>And as for other Officers, they ought to reckon themſelves accountable, as for other miſdemeanors in this Affair, ſo for diſobeying their Maſters in refuſing to pronounce and proclaim what the Common-Hall, whoſe ſervants they are, required and commanded them to do. And ſhould the Commons of <hi>London</hi> quietly digeſt, and overlook the diſobedience and obſtinacy of theſe Fellows whom they have raiſed and made, I will ſay that they have not only forgotten their Authority, but that they deſerve to be ridden and trampled upon by their meaneſt Officers.</p>
            <p>P. S. The after Proceedings of making Sir <hi>Pet. Rich</hi> Sheriff, with the method uſed in Swaring him, and Sir <hi>D. North,</hi> into that Office; the Huſtings in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> being guarded by a Company of the City Trained Bands under the Command of Lieutenant-Collonel <hi>Quiney.</hi> This, and much more of that Days Tranſactions is too notorious to be forgotten, or that it needs at large to be again related. Yet the Reader may remember from this illegal Election iſſued the Death of thoſe excellent Perſons, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> &amp;c. and the deſigned Ruine of that worthy Citizen <hi>Tho. Papillon,</hi>
