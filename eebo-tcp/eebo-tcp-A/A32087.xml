            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To My Much Honoured
FRIEND,
The Reverend
Mr. DANIEL WILLIAMS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF the <hi>PRESENT</hi> which I here make
You, should occasion any Renewal of
Your Grief, You know where to Charge
it. Though I should Hope, a repeated Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on Your Deceased Yoke-fellows Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence,
both in Temper and Practise,
with the Instances and Patterns propos'd for
Imitation in the Text, which I (with Your
<pb facs="tcp:46092:3"/>
Approbation) fixt on for the Subject of the
Ensuing Discourse, might administer Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Refreshment.</p>
            <p>FOR it cannot but be very comfortable,
to have so good Grounds to believe, that at
the same Time when withdrawn from You,
She was remov'd out of a troublesome World,
into that <hi>Better Countrey,</hi> which had Her
Heart so long before: Where She hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably
better Friends, and better Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
than this World was ever capable
of affording Her; and that without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or fear of Change.</p>
            <p>IT hath pleas'd GOD (Sir) that in
the midst of a great many signal Mercies, You
have met with a Variety of Difficulties and
Troubles; some of which have been attended
with very uncomfortable Circumstances. I
take this Opportunity to join with You in
heartily Rejoicing, and Blessing Him, who
hath so wonderfully supported You under, and
so comfortably carry'd You through all hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Methinks You had a peculiar Mercy,
<pb facs="tcp:46092:3"/>
under the most Furious Assaults of those enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom'd
Spirits, who combin'd together (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
since) to blast Your Reputation, (of
some of whom 'tis sufficiently evident, that
they aim'd at giving a Wound to the Ministry
in General through Your Sides;) in having
such a Domestick Instance of Exemplary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in Your Dear Consort: Who though
deeply Affected, and not free from just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
of their Inhumanity; (especially
in Charging You with Vnkindness to Her,
who ever retain'd a most thankful Sense of
Your endearing Love and Tenderness;) yet
carried it all along with that evenness of
Temper, that Christian Composure, and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedness;
(being fully satisfi'd from first
to last, of the Groundlessness of their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Insinuations) as seem'd wonderful to all
who knew, and observ'd Her. I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
You then reap'd much Comfort and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
as from the serious Supplications of
Your Loving Flock, and many other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Friends on Your behalf, so also from Hers
Particularly, which were sent Vpwards with
a peculiar Tenderness and Fervour. And
<pb facs="tcp:46092:4"/>
Your Loss of Her Prayers, by Her Removal,
is with me (and I doubt not with You much
more) of considerable Account.</p>
            <p>WOVLD the most Angry and Censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but take the Pains to peruse, and have
the Patience seriously to consider, those Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and Vnaffected Breathings of a gracious
Heart, a Gospel Spirit, and truly Christian
Temper, which I have inserted in the Annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Character of the Deceased, out of Her own
Papers; I could not but Hope, if they had
any remaining Tincture of Sober-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
they would see the Folly of Inveighing
against that sort of Ministry, either as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
or Vn-Evangelical, which GOD so bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and makes use of, to Form Christians
of such a Make, and Spirit, and Temper:
If not, let them go on, and see what they'l
get by it in the Issue. And although, while
they persist in this Course, I am well assur'd
they are doing the Devils Work, yet all the
Hurt I wish them is, that they may not in the
Event fall short of Her, whose Character is
here faithfully though imperfectly given, and
<pb facs="tcp:46092:4"/>
others of the like Stamp, to whom GOD is
pleas'd so remarkably to bless that sort of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
which they with so much bitterness
Censure and Condemn.</p>
            <p>MAY You (Sir,) If it be the Will of
GOD, shine the Brighter the more others
study to Eclipse you: May the Devil (who
is too subtle to Rage most, where his Interest
is least Assaulted) find You through Divine
Assistance, the more effectually supplanting
and undermining his Kingdom, the more
Opposition he raises against You: May You
be more and more fixt out of the reach of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and Bitterness, Rage and Malice: May
the Exemplariness of Your Life and Carriage
silence all the Calumnies of Your Adversaries:
And the Eminent Success of Your Ministerial
Labours, more and more Confirm the Truth
of the Doctrine You deliver: May You still
have fresh Supports afforded, suitable to Your
Tryals and Exigencies: And long remain an
Instance of Publick Spiritedness and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in a wretchedly Selfish Age: May You have
<pb facs="tcp:46092:5"/>
an abundant Reward above; and have Your
Memory (when You are gone to Rest,) blest
here Below:</p>
            <p>This is the Hearty Prayer, Of</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>

SERMON.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>HEB. XI. xvi.</bibl>
               <q>But now they desire a better Countrey,
that is an Heavenly; wherefore
God is not ashamed to be called
their God, for he hath prepared for
them a City.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
under a double Aspect.
Either as particularly relating
to the Old <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> of whom the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
is in this Place discoursing: Or, As
they are equally applicable to any, who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46092:6"/>
tread in their Steps in After-Times:
Either as peculiarly meant of the
Fore-Fathers of the <hi>Iewish Nation;</hi>
Or as generally regarding all who are
acted by a like Faith with them; All
who are heartily Listed in the Service
of the same GOD, and stand in the
same Relation to Him; whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Spirit and Temper, Honour and
Happiness, is here exemplify'd and
illustrated.</p>
            <p>Consider'd the former of these ways,
Three Things in them deserve Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The Character given of those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Worthies, <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi>
and <hi>Iacob;</hi> concerning whom 'tis
asserted, That <hi>they desir'd a better
Countrey, that is an Heavenly.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>A comfortable Inference drawn
from that Character;</hi> Wherefore
GOD was not asham'd to be call'd
their GOD.</item>
               <item>III. The Manifestation of the Truth
of that Inference: GOD shew'd
he was not asham'd of that Name,
in that <hi>he had prepar'd for them a
City.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46092:6"/>
These Three things duly weigh'd
and consider'd, will give a sufficient
insight into the sense of the Words,
according to their Primitive and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Intention; which once settled,
will make way for the Doctrinal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
they afford, with their suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Improvement.</p>
            <p>I. Begin we then with considering
the Character here given of the Old
Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi>
of whom 'tis asserted, That <hi>They
desired a better Countrey, that is an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> upon a Call of GOD, had
forsaken his Native Countrey, his
Kindred, Friends and Paternal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
which are naturally very dear
and valuable, and taken his Progress
towards an unknown Land, which
he upon the Divine Promise, believ'd
would in time, become the Possession
of his Posterity: While there, he
had a Son and Grand-Son born to
him, who were <hi>Heirs of the Promise;</hi>
who Travell'd with him from Place
to Place, having no fixt abode, or
hope of present Settlement, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
GOD whithersoever he would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46092:7"/>
lead them; living and dying in this
Faith, That he would without fail,
make good to a Tittle, All that he
had promised them; especially with
reference to their <hi>Progeny,</hi> and the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> (who was to spring up amongst
them) and their <hi>Future Bliss.</hi> In the
whole Course of their Lives, they all
profest themselves <hi>Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;</hi>
which (as it is here argu'd in the
Context) intimated, that <hi>they sought a
Countrey,</hi> wherein they might be at rest.
This Countrey they sought for, must
be either <hi>Earthly or Heavenly:</hi> Were
it an <hi>Earthly One,</hi> it must be either
that which they had abandon'd; or
that in hope of which they had forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Land of their Nativity: It
could not be the <hi>former,</hi> for they had
no thoughts of returning to it; for
which they could not have wanted
Opportunity had they had an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Neither could it be the <hi>latter,</hi>
because though they were safely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at it, beheld, and travell'd
through it, they yet sought not for a
Settlement in it: they <hi>profest to have
here no continuing City:</hi> they desir'd
therefore <hi>a better Countrey, that is an
Heavenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46092:7"/>
               <hi>A Better Countrey.</hi> This is compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
A Countrey <hi>better than that which
they had forsaken; and better than that
in which they sojourn'd. One better
than that which they had forsaken.</hi> For
they might well expect they should
be no losers, at long run, by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
GOD. How could they imagine
he should have put them upon leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what was better, for that which
was really worse? They might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
upon good Grounds hope, that
when they had trusted to him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for them, he would not leave
them destitute and helpless; would
not leave them worse than he found
them; nay, not till he had made their
listning to him, and following of
him, in the final issue, abundantly
worth their while, both in their own
and others Estimation. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ONE better than that in which they
sojourn'd.</hi> For even in the Land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> they were not at rest. They
did not incorporate with those among
whom they sojourn'd, but kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to themselves, and that by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and so were but a poor solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Family living upon Courtesie: Had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46092:8"/>
they therefore at the present ever such
Ease and Plenty, they knew not how
soon they might be depriv'd of it;
being by some un-foreseen Accident
forc'd to a removal. The Land was
in it self indeed delicious and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
stiled therefore in Holy Writ,
<hi>a Land flowing with Milk and Honey:
i. e.</hi> abounding with the Necessaries
and comfortable Conveniencies of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life; but yet being Strangers
in it, they met with a great many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and un-easinesses, fatigues and
troubles. And had these been much
fewer and smaller than they really
were, they must be suppos'd very
ignorant and thoughtless, if they were
not sensible that this <hi>Earth</hi> was no
Place for a perpetual abode; that
they were but passing through it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Invisible Regions; And in a
little time to be transplanted hence into
another State. Like Persons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
truly devoted to the Most High,
they look'd beyond Earth for an
Home, <hi>they desir'd a better Countrey;</hi>
where there should be perfection of
Life, and Fulness of Bliss; freedom
from all Evil, and an abundance of
all good; and that un-alterably and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46092:8"/>
for ever: And that the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they knew this was no more
than he to whom they had devoted
themselves, and under whose Care
they were, could easily help them to.
<hi>Canaan</hi> was a good Land; but yet it
could not satisfie them; they still
crav'd <hi>a better Countrey:</hi> A Countrey
of a better Nature; where they might
have better Entertainments and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments;
and better Society and
Converse; all free from Mixtures and
Defects; more suitable to their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Refined Powers; liable to no
Changes or Alterations, Disturbances
or Interruptions; a Countrey there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
necessarily of another Kind:
That is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AN Heavenly Countrey.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
desiring a fixed Settlement, how
weak must they have been, had their
Thoughts ultimately fixt in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!
Earth being in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
necessarily mutable; and Heaven
only fixed and stable. No other
than an Heavenly Countrey could suit
Heaven-born Souls; and satisfie their
enlarged Cravings; no other could
answer their spiritual Aims; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46092:9"/>
could be perfect and without
mixtures; safe and of Eternal Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.
Such a Countrey therefore
they desir'd. We may translate it a
<hi>Supercoelestial One; i. e.</hi> seated above
all the visible Heavens; meaning that
which is call'd the <hi>Third Heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SOME are very earnest in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
that the Ancient Patriarchs
neither had any better Promise, nor
higher Thoughts than of a Temporal
Felicity. Whereby they would tempt
one almost to think, that they hardly
ever took Notice of this Passage of
Sacred Writ, where the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is clearly intimated, when it
is asserted, that they desir'd <hi>an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Countrey. Crellius</hi> particularly
in his Comment on the Text, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
that the meaning is, a better
Countrey was <hi>design'd for them,</hi> but
<hi>not explicitely desir'd</hi> by them. He
owns indeed that a State of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
and Glory is here intended;
though not <hi>as look'd for, and desir'd</hi>
by the Patriarchs by Vertue of any
Promise: But as what would ensue
according to the Divine Purpose, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had no ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46092:9"/>
it. Which in short, is a direct level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them with the rest of the World,
notwithstanding that God had thought
fit to separate and distinguish them
out of special Favour. For <hi>Temporal
Blessings</hi> were not a sufficient Mark
of Distinction; nor a suitable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for that celebrated <hi>Covenant
of Peculiarity.</hi> Can it be imagin'd
that God should be call'd <hi>their God,</hi>
so often, and in so pompous a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
above what could be claim'd
and pretended to by the rest of the
World, and after all it should issue
in nothing but his settling on their
Posterity a small Spot of Land,
wherein they themselves all their
Days were Strangers, having no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Habitation? Are these Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
lower Things to be thought
of such account with God? Must
not the Ancient Worthies be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
grossly carnal in their Aims and
Inclinations, if these furnisht with
the principal Motives of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?
What sort of Servants must
God have of those, who had only
Earthly Things in their Eyes? Whose
Hopes and Hearts were not fixt on
Heaven? All their Devotion must
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46092:10"/>
necessarily be mean and flat, and all
their Service spiritless and beggarly.
How could it be possible, that such
Heroical Obedience, as theirs was in
sundry Instances, should arise from
such mean and weak Foundations?
Besides, How could this Supposition
consist with the Apostles present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument?
Who if he doth not prove
that their Faith wrought in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and Expectation of Heavenly
Things, proves nothing at all to his
Purpose: As is evident, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
be duely Consulted. But 'tis to
little Purpose to Argue, where Men
having fixt their Hypothesis, which
they will not alter, will resolve all
Things they meet with into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
with it. To one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
things fairly, a Believer not
eying Heaven, will appear a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
And that of such a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that the difference of the
<hi>Oeconomy</hi> Persons are under, will be
far from satisfactorily Accounting
for it.</p>
            <p>'TIS further observable, that this
<hi>Heavenly Countrey</hi> was much <hi>desir'd</hi>
by them. The Word we so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46092:10"/>
intimates great Earnestness and
vehemence in reaching out after the
Thing aimed at. They did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therefore <hi>faintly wish,</hi> that they
might be admitted into the Coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Mansions, when they had finisht
their Course on Earth: But their
Desire was vigorously active in a way
of endeavour, in Order to their safe
Arrival at them. The Grounds of
their <hi>Desire</hi> of this Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
were mainly these. They were
feelingly sensible of their want of
something higher and more noble,
more solid and more durable, than
this Earth was able to afford them;
they found just ground for dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
in their present flitting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
wandering, and imperfect
State: They were at the same Time
fully satisfied, that if they could but
once reach Heaven, all their Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and Exercises, all their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
and Uneasiness would be at
an End, and that for ever: And
withal, they were not destitute of
Reason to Hope, that that God who
had given them so many Assurances
of his Favour, would not herein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to gratifie them: Which Grounds
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46092:11"/>
were of such a Nature, as that they
might well carry their desire to a
considerable heighth, and make it
very vehement, and earnest, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
very influential on their
whole Conduct and Behaviour. For
<hi>Desire</hi> cannot in any Case but be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
where these three Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur;
a Sense of want; a certain
Prospect of a comfortable Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon its Accomplishment; and a
grounded Hope of that Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
no one of which could be
said to be wanting in the Case of
these Patriarchs.</p>
            <p>THUS much briefly of their <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
which though short, carries in
it a plain Description both <hi>of their
Faith and Conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>OF their Faith;</hi> In that they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doubted but there was a stable,
firm, Heavenly City and Countrey,
built, made and prepar'd by GOD,
for all his sincere Servants; a Place
and State infinitely beyond any that
was to be met with here on Earth;
into which they question'd not, but
that they in time should be receiv'd,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46092:11"/>
if they persisted in an Holy Course of
Obedience to the end of their Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>OF their Conversation;</hi> in that their
firm Belief of the Excellency of that
Heavenly Countrey which they had in
their Eye, made them earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it, and vigorously follow after
it; over-look all discouragements
and difficulties they met with in their
way to it; contemn all Earthly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in comparison of it; and tend
towards it in their whole Course;
and that with such earnestness and
assiduity, as sufficiently intimated to
all that observ'd them, that they
look'd not on themselves as of this
World, but as of another Countrey;
and reckon'd not upon being at home,
till they got safe to Heaven.</p>
            <p>THIS being well consider'd will
abate our Wonder at the seemingly
strange Inference we find drawn from
this their Character; to the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
whereof, I now in the Second
Place proceed.</p>
            <p>STRANGE but comfortable is
the Truth hence inferr'd, <hi>Wherefore</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:46092:12"/>
(saith the Apostle) <hi>GOD is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to be called their GOD:</hi> So
well did he approve of their foresaid
Faith and Desire, that he thought fit
to give Evidence of his special respect
to them. Their Faith being so firm,
and their reliance on the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
so steddy, as its fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
discovered it; they being so free
in despising these lower things, and
so earnest in pursuing higher, upon
the inducements he set before them;
he did not disdain them, or think it
any dishonour to him, to own them
to be his, and himself to be <hi>Theirs.</hi> He
thought it no Disgrace to him to vouch
a special Relation to them. This is
spoken after the manner of Men. The
expression is <hi>Negative,</hi> the meaning
<hi>Positive.</hi> It implies a joyful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of them, as a Father of a
Generous Son: and a much greater
readiness to gratifie their reasonable
Desires, than there could be in the
tenderest Earthly Parent, towards the
most dutiful and respectful Child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable.
And here let's Pause a little,
and make our Remarks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46092:12"/>
GOD was neither asham'd to be
their GOD; nor to be call'd so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was not ashamed to be their GOD.</hi>
If He had, He would never either
have represented Himself as such, or
have suffer'd Himself to have been
so represented by others. <hi>He was
their GOD:</hi> And that not only in a
way of Propriety, Dominion, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
in which Sense He is the
GOD of <hi>all</hi> Men; but in a way of
special Interest, arising from a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Engagement to them; whereby
He stood bound to take Care of and
Provide for them; to Protect and
Bless them; to be their <hi>Shield, and
exceeding great Reward,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 1.</note> as He parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
Promis'd <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now what
an Honour was this! For any of the
degenerate Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> to be
admitted into such a Relation to, to
have such an Interest in, the Infinite
Lord of Heaven and Earth! <hi>Of whom,
and to whom, and through whom are
all Things!</hi> And who really is <hi>all in
all!</hi> Well consider'd, it will appear
amazing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:46092:13"/>
AGAIN; <hi>He was not asham'd to
own and call Himself their GOD;</hi>
which is yet more. For He might
really <hi>be</hi> their GOD, and yet not
be ready to <hi>signifie,</hi> or so willing to
have it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Publisht</hi> that He was so: But
alas, having taken them for his own,
and put such an excellent Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, He thought it no dishonour
to Him to be call'd by their Name.
For thus doth He express Himself to
<hi>Moses.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 6, 15.</note> 
               <hi>I am the GOD of Abraham,
the GOD of Isaac, and the GOD of
Iacob.</hi> And again; <hi>The Lord GOD
of your Fathers, the GOD of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
the GOD of Isaac, the GOD
of Iacob. This is my Name for ever;
this is my Memorial to all Generations.</hi>
Now what an Honour was this to
them, for the great GOD to be
nam'd after them! What were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Isaac, and Iacob,</hi> but Men
who were Dead, and laid in their
Graves, long before this Speech was
addrest to <hi>Moses?</hi> And what were
they while Living, but poor desolate
Strangers, wandring from Place
to Place; naturally infirm; vile thro'
Sin; and every way imperfect; and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46092:13"/>
therefore absolutely speaking, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of any Favour? What an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Thing then is it, that GOD
should as it were be beholden to them
for a Name, and borrow a Title from
them, whereby he should be known to
others! This is an Honour the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
whereof we cannot reach; and
which no Comparisons can help to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate.</p>
            <p>IT deserves however to be observ'd,
that although these Patriarchs were far
from having any thing to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> such an
Honour, yet were they so <hi>qualifi'd,</hi> as
that it was not unbecoming GOD to
confer such an Honour upon them.
<hi>Abraham, Is<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>c and Iacob,</hi> as unworthy
as they were, were yet Persons of a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Faith, and Heavenly Conversation;</hi> as
hath before been hinted: And had
they not been thus <hi>qualifi'd,</hi> we may be
assur'd GOD would never have
own'd them for His. Had they been
prevailingly Terrene and Carnal,
like the rest of the World; govern'd
by the Spirit of it; ingulpht in the
common Pollutions, Sensualities and
Impieties, of the Prophane and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical
Inhabitants of the Land
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46092:14"/>
wherein they Sojourn'd; He would
have been asham'd to have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>their GOD.</hi> He would have rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
it ignominious and a reproach
to Him, to have own'd a peculiar
Relation to them. For this would
have been to have attempted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
such as would not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished;
and to have made a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
difference by Favours and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
where there was no visible
difference in Temper and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that might signifie a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Spirit: Which, how much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it might be to the gust of a
Carnal Mind, could not but appear
a Matter of Shame to an Holy GOD.
But they being by His influence
wrought up to such a Temper and
Carriage, as hath before been brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signifi'd, 'twas consistent with His
Honour, He was <hi>not asham'd</hi> to own
them for His.</p>
            <p>HE is never <hi>asham'd</hi> of Persons,
because Poor and Mean, and of no
Account in the World: But He would
and might justly be so, of those who
wallow'd in Filth, and delighted in
Impurity. 'Twas otherwise with these
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46092:14"/>
Patriarchs. Although they made no
great Figure, yet such was their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and such their Carriage, that He
thought it not a Diminution to Him,
to be stiled <hi>theirs.</hi> It was thought
mean by the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, and a
Matter of Reproach, that He should
stile Himself the GOD of Three
Poor wandring Pilgrims: But let
them Laugh on; He was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
of His Title, nor did He dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
it till He had famisht their <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,</hi>
which they set up in Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Him, and effectually vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Himself from the Reproach of
their Admirers.</p>
            <p>NAY, He was not only <hi>not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd</hi>
of His Title, but He <hi>glory'd</hi>
in it. For He gave Himself this
Name in Confirmation of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
by which He stood engag'd to
these Worthies, whereby he had am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
occasion of glorifying the Holy
Properties of his Nature, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays
of His <hi>Grace, Goodness, Truth,
and Power;</hi> and various other of His
most glorious Perfections, on their
behalf. And the Meaner the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the greater the Glory. Thus
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46092:15"/>
               <hi>GOD was not ashamed to be called
<hi>Their</hi> GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I know not how to dismiss
this Clause, without observing how
it confirms our Saviour's Argument
against the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> in Proof both
of <hi>The Souls Immortality, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys
Resurrection;</hi> to clear which, this
very Passage is Cited out of <hi>Exodus,</hi>
which is here referred to.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Sadducees</hi> deny'd both these
Grand Articles of FAITH; (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Acts 23. 8.)</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to our Blessed Lord
with a Foolish Question, he to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
them (as will appear by consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Places Cited in the Margin)
urges this Declaration of GOD by
<hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 22. 31, 32.</note> of His being the <hi>God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 20. 38.</note>
               <hi>Isaac and Iacob.</hi> Some have
been so petulant, as to call the strength
of his Argument, taken from this
Declaration, into Question; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
with the light my Text gives
it, 'twill, I think, appear suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
cogent. For GOD would
really have bin asham'd of making
any such Declaration, <hi>had not their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46092:15"/>
Souls bin immortal, and were not their
Bodies to rise again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. GOD would have bin asham'd
to have bin called the <hi>God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac and Iacob,</hi> if their <hi>Souls</hi>
had not bin <hi>immortal.</hi> For they were
all Dead a considerable time before
he made that Declaration to <hi>Moses,</hi>
as before was hinted. Now GOD,
(as Our Saviour urged) <hi>is not the GOD
of the dead, but of the living.</hi> He'd
have bin ashamed to have stil'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
their GOD after their Decease,
had they thereupon quite lost their
Being. For what could his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Relation to them have
signified, if it could not have kept
them from returning to Nothing?
In stiling Himself <hi>Theirs,</hi> He certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended some peculiar Blessing and
Advantage to them above others.
This they could not be said to have
had at any time in this World; for
they were continually fatigu'd and
harrass'd, and never at Rest: 'Tis
therefore necessary they should have
it in another; or otherwise this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of His being <hi>Theirs,</hi> would
shamefully have fallen short of what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46092:16"/>
it seemed to import. If (as one well
says) nothing beyond this Life had
bin reserved for them, that saying
of Old <hi>Iacob</hi> towards the end of his
Life, <hi>Few and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uil have the days of
the years of my life been,</hi> would have
bin an Eternal Reflection on the
Truth and Faithfulness of Him, who
had so often called Himself <hi>The GOD
of Iacob:</hi> But supposing Him to make
up in the Happiness of another Life,
what was wanting in this; Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Him to have fixt their Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Spirits in Un-Alterable Bliss;
His Promise and Declaration appears
to have been made Good to the Full;
And He needed not to be <hi>ashamed</hi>
to be <hi>called their GOD.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p>2. HE would have bin asham'd to
have bin called, <hi>The GOD of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac and Iacob,</hi> if their <hi>Bodies</hi>
were not to <hi>rise again.</hi> Which though
it be not so clear and directly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as the foregoing <hi>Proposition;</hi> yet
is it not destitute of sufficient Proof.
For let it be observ'd; Our Souls
and Bodies are so adapted to each
other, That a separate Soul, though
in the midst of Bliss, is in a sort im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46092:16"/>
while without its proper Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
after which, notwithstanding the
greatest surrounding Glory that could
be imagin'd, there yet remains an
hankering inclination. Now would
it not reflect on the Blessed GOD
to make His Servants happy by halves?
To strip them of their Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they should at all taste of the
Provision he had made for them in
the Upper World; and leave them
without all hope of receiving them
anew, notwithstanding a Re-union
to them would be a great Addition
to their Happiness? Withal, it seems
highly equitable, That the same Body
which at the Soul's Command, was
often harrass'd, and bore a great
many Fatigues in the Service of
GOD, should also share in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
following upon it. Further;
Humane Nature, consider'd as fram'd
<hi>entire</hi> by GOD, must necessarily have
some End propounded to it; which
can be no other than the Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Whole Man:</hi> For the End
of <hi>one Part,</hi> cannot be the End of the
<hi>Whole:</hi> But GOD made the <hi>Whole;</hi>
and takes the <hi>Whole</hi> under His Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Care and Patronage when sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46092:17"/>
devoted to Him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must make the <hi>Whole Happy,</hi>
unless he be suppos'd to mock those
whose GOD He professes Himself;
Which to imagine, would be a most
shameful Reflection upon Him. New
this cannot be without a <hi>Resurrection
of the Body;</hi> which therefore, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>Soul's Immortality,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
by Consequence, from His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess't
Relation to these <hi>Patriarchs</hi> as
<hi>their GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. IT now remains, That in the
Third and last place, I a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the manifestation of the Truth
of the foregoing comfortable <hi>Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
which stands thus; GOD
show'd He was not asham'd to be
call'd their GOD, in that <hi>He had
prepar'd for them a City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A CITY.</hi> This is the same with
that <hi>better Heavenly Countrey,</hi> of which
in the fore-going part of the Verse
they are said to be so <hi>desirous. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
is exprest to us in the Sacred
Scriptures, by sundry Metaphorical
Resemblances. Sometimes its call'd a
<hi>Paradise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 4.</note> or <hi>Garden,</hi> because of its
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46092:17"/>
santness and delightfulness. But there
being in a Garden no fixt abode,
'tis called <hi>an House;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 2.</note> which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
for fixing. But an House
may be too strait for the number
of Inhabitants, and therefore 'tis here
called a <hi>City,</hi> and elsewhere in this
Chapter,<note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> and in many other Places.
But least any should think of being
incommoded for want of Room and
Air, 'tis here also call'd <hi>a Countrey.</hi>
And because a <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Countrey</hi> may
be destitute of the Glory that attends
a Court,<note place="margin">Luke 12. 32.</note> 'tis call'd <hi>a Kingdom.</hi> And
the Design of these and all other the
different ways of Representation us'd
in this Case,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 11</note> is to satisfie us that the
Place and State prepar'd by GOD
for the Everlasting Entertainment of
His Faithful Servants, hath all things
in it that can be really needful or
useful, delightful or entertaining,
comfortable or desirable, to Persons
advanc'd to that Degree of Perfection
which they shall be rais'd unto.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>City is prepar'd.</hi> Herein
there is an Allusion to the manner
of disposing <hi>Colonys</hi> into Cities and
Towns: Before the actual settling
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46092:18"/>
of which, all things are usually rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
prepar'd for their Habitation and
Entertainment. Consonantly where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
'tis intimated that in this Case,
GOD was fully provided with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
was requisite to the Eternal
Rest and Blessedness of these His
Servants; That He had made such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for them, as was abundantly
sufficient to answer all the Ends of
His being their GOD, or being so
called.</p>
            <p>BUT wihhal, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
That this Preparation necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
also includes and supposes, the
Interposition of <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Mediator,</hi>
by whom this <hi>City</hi> was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
and purchas'd: And also the
Influence of the <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
these Candidates for that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
Holy State, in which much more
of the Happiness of Heaven lies, than
in the Glorys of the Place: Which
Spirit is supposed to work Faith in
them; and by sanctifying them, to
prepare for Possession and Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>FOR these Blessed Patriarchs was
this <hi>City</hi> prepar'd; <hi>For them,</hi> and not
for others: Not because they <hi>merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46092:18"/>
it, and others not; but because
through the Influence of Divine
Grace, they earnestly minded, desir'd,
and sought it; despis'd all Earthly
Felicity in Comparison of it; and
thought nothing too much to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
in the way to it. For them
was a Blessed Home prepar'd above,
who never thought themselves at
Home while here on Earth. For
them who were all their Days <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi>
and <hi>Strangers</hi> here, was <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Rest</hi> provided in the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
State. For how unequal soever
the present Dispensations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may appear, GOD will at
long run make a mighty difference,
between those who sincerely Love,
and serve Him, and Value His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
and such as neglect and slight
Him, and bid Him defiance.</p>
            <p>NOW how full an Evidence was
GODs thus preparing this City for
these Patriarchs, of his not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
either to <hi>be</hi> their God, or to
be <hi>call'd</hi> so? Hereby He sufficiently
discharg'd the demands of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
and carry'd it as became
that Relation. For had He been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46092:19"/>
weary or asham'd of them,
He'd have cast their Souls into a
deep Sleep, whence they should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have recover'd; He'd have let
their Bodies have for ever lain rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Grave without any Hope of
Resurrection; He'd never have thought
of them more: He'd have let them
sink into their Primitive Nothing;
bury'd them in an Everlasting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion;
and have taken effectual Care,
that neither they themselves should
survive to upbraid him with his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so unsuitably to his profest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to them, in his not having
made answerable Provision for them;
nor any others on their Account.
But on the other side, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
such an Happy Reward, for
all their Pains and Labour in his
Service, as the Blessedness of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, He fully shews that He
is altogether Consistent with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and punctual to the utmost Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to all His Promises; and no way
wanting in any thing which they
could reasonably expect that <hi>a GOD,</hi>
nay, even <hi>their GOD,</hi> should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, or do for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:46092:19"/>
THUS have I as briefly, as well
I could, open'd and clear'd the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Sense of the Words, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their <hi>Reference to the Ancient
Patriarchs:</hi> As to whom they inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
to us in short, That <hi>a most
excellent Spirit was found in them,</hi> and <hi>a
suitable Reward was provided for them.</hi>
But they have an Eye upon <hi>Vs</hi> also
as well as upon <hi>Them,</hi> and may be
of use to all who come after them.
For with good Reason may we up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Reflection conclude, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there is the same <hi>Spirit</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and showing it self, the same
<hi>Reward</hi> in Process or Time will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
GOD will no more be asham'd
to be call'd the GOD of any of us,
as meanly as we may possibly be
thought off either by our selves or
others, than He was to be called the
GOD of <hi>Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob;</hi>
if we are Heavenly in our Temper,
Bent, and Stated Course, as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have been; and we shall find
in the Event, He hath made as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

we have a Building of GOD,

                  <hi>which is but for a
Moment, worketh for us a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
and Eternal weight of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHICH Things taken together,
give us sufficiently to understand that
this Doctrine is true <hi>in Fact,</hi> as to
many of the most remarkable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of GOD, whom we find men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in our Sacred Records: To
whose Experiences in a Point of this
Nature, we may well conclude, those
of others, who are acted by the same
Spirit, how different soever their
particular Circumstances may be,
should be Consonant and Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
But I advance further, and
dare be bold to say, that whosoever
truly belong to GOD, they cannot
but look upon themselves as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
in this Life; and therefore
can do no other than earnestly seek
an Home above, where they may be
at Rest, and that for ever. And if
you'l but a little consider, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Principle</hi> that is in them; the
<hi>Worlds unsuitableness</hi> to them; and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46092:22"/>
the <hi>Prospect Faith</hi> gives them of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turities,</hi>
you'l easily conclude, that
thus it must necessarily be with
them.</p>
               <p>FIRST then, Let us a little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Divine Principle</hi> which is in all
Holy Souls; and which not only is <hi>in
them,</hi> but <hi>acts</hi> and <hi>governs</hi> them.
They are made <hi>partakers of a Divine
Nature;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> which therefore necessarily
prompts to, and issues in a <hi>Divine Life;</hi>
which lies in two things, among others,
<hi>a Love of GOD, and Vniversal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
Both which have a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to alienate them from this
World, and make them Foreigners in
it; and to raise their Hearts towards
a better World, and make them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Seekers of it.</p>
               <p>1. THE <hi>Divine Principle,</hi> which is
implanted in all Holy Souls, naturally
tends to draw forth their utmost ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
in the <hi>Love of GOD,</hi> to whom
it brings them wholly to resign and
sacrifice themselves; desiring above
all things to please Him, and delighting
in nothing so much as in Fellowship
and Communion with Him. It cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46092:23"/>
them to disdain and undervalue all
things below Him, as mean and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:
So that that Strain of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,<note place="margin">Ps. 73. 25.</note>
                  <hi>Whom have we in Heaven but Thee,
and there's none upon Earth we desire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Thee!</hi> becomes their natural
breathing. For He is really their Souls
last End and Rest. Now how can
Persons of this <hi>Make</hi> be fond of <hi>this
present World,</hi> which is a meer Stage
of Vanity and Sin; where, under the
utmost Advantages, they are <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively</hi>
distant from Him whom their
Souls love: <hi>Comparatively,</hi> I say, with
what they desire, and hope to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>THEY well know that <hi>While they
are at Home in the Body, they are absent
from the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 6, 8.</note> How then can they do
any other, than (as the Apostle inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates)
<hi>be rather willing to be absent from
the Body, and present with the Lord.</hi> 'Tis
the nature of Love to excite vehement
desire after the nearest Union that is
possible with its Prime Object, and to
make uneasie under Absence and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from it. Now, what is in
this Life to be found, and felt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
of GOD, is as nothing, to what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46092:23"/>
our Natures are capable of, and what
Grace leads Holy Souls most earnestly
to desire, and what they hereafter
hope for: (on the Account whereof it
is that they are at present said to be
as it were, <hi>absent from him:)</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenseness
therefore of their Love to
Him, necessarily leads them to look
upon themselves, as being in this Life
<hi>abroad,</hi> and in a <hi>strange</hi> Countrey; and
with vehemence to long for that near
Vision, and close and un-interrupted
Enjoyment of Him, which they expect
when they shall come to be at Home:
And, when they act like themselves,
nothing but a sense of Duty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of serving the Purposes of His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
according to their capacity here
on Earth, can enable them to brook
their Absence from Heaven, where their
Hearts and Hopes are fixt.</p>
               <p>2. THAT <hi>Divine Principle</hi> which
resides, rules and governs in all Holy
Souls, most naturally and directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
them to <hi>an Vniversal Purity.</hi>
They are fram'd for Divine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Pleasures; which are unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
Superiour to what Sense can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
afford. The Body, whereto they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46092:24"/>
are at present linkt in its State of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
and Corruption, hath such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseness
to be inveigled by those
light and Airy Gratifications which
Sensual Objects offer for their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
that they are forc't to keep
up a constant Contest with it; and to
be perpetually striving for the Mastery
of it: And when they have done all they
can, they find their success so small, that
they have good reason with the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> to cry out <hi>of their wretchedness.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24</note>
This makes them necessarily very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie;
and the more so, because they
can see no reason to hope it will be
otherwise while this Life lasts. Well
then, and naturally may they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that this is not a Place for them
to be fond of; or wherein they should
desire to settle; that this World is a
place where they must carry it <hi>as
Strangers,</hi> least before they are aware,
they are defil'd and debas'd: They
must needs be induc'd often to long
for their Arrival at that Place and
State, where being free from that toil
and trouble, which is now their daily
Exercise, they shall meet with <hi>Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
every way suitable to their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and refin'd Tempers, and be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46092:24"/>
themselves therewith to all <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
But further,</p>
               <p>2. IF we add hereto the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>the Worlds unsuitableness</hi> to
Holy Souls, we shall meet with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Evidence of the same thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Whatever others think, who judge
by the <hi>Great,</hi> and put all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionals
of a <hi>Freakish Fancy</hi> into the
Scale, together with that small Scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of <hi>Reality</hi> that is here to be met
with; for <hi>their</hi> parts <hi>they</hi> find this
World to be a very unsuitable place
for them to make any long stay in;
and the longer they live in it, the
more do they find it so: And that
because 'tis so very <hi>troublesome,</hi> so <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,</hi>
and <hi>changeable,</hi> and so <hi>ensna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. THEY find this World to be
very <hi>troublesome.</hi> This Life hath a
great many <hi>natural inconveniencies,</hi> which
make it uneasie to Thinking-Persons.
There is no <hi>Age</hi> of it, from first to
last; whether Infancy or Childhood,
Youth or Manhood, or Old Age, but
hath its peculiar Troubles: No <hi>State</hi>
in it, but what hath its special Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Do Persons live solitarily? they are
in danger of being Mopish. Are they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46092:25"/>
much in Conversation? they'll see so
much Vanity and Folly, Ill Humour
and Insincerity, as, if they will give
way to Thought, cannot but disturb
them. They'll find it hard, with the
utmost Caution, to walk inoffensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and meet with so many unkindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
(and that even it may be, where they
have study'd to oblige) as will make
them weary of their Lives. Are they
in a poor and low condition? they'll
find it very hard to rub through the
World with any thing of evenness of
Temper, and content of Mind. Are
they rich and wealthy? the Vexation,
Care and Fear, and the <hi>envy of others,</hi>
that attends their Estates, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
<hi>Losses</hi> and <hi>Disappointments</hi> they
meet with, do often more than over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
the Comfort they afford them.
Are they in Health and Strength? yet
it's an Hundred to One if they are
not afflicted with Losses, or depriv'd
of their Friends, or crost in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
and Designs, or have something
or other, ever and anon, happening to
them, to interrupt their Repose. Are
they sick and crazy, or often in Pain?
How little Relish have they of all
all their Comforts! How burthensome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46092:25"/>
are their Lives! Nay, How often do
we find that even those who have all
that heart could wish for, that have
all the Materials and Ingredients of
a Worldly Felicity at command, yet
<hi>even in their suffciency are in streights;</hi>
and make a shift to create as much
trouble to themselves, by their own
listless, querulous, uneasie Tempers,
as those who have the most real and
substantial Causes of Discontent?</p>
               <p>BUT besides all these, and a great
many other Considerations of the like
Nature, that might be suggested, which
are common to all, the World is <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
troublesome</hi> to Holy Souls. They
for the most part, meet with a great
many Hardships, Contempts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
in it; they are often baited at,
molested and teaz'd by the Men of
the World, who care not for their
Company. For, as our Blessed Lord
hath long since observ'd, <hi>because they
are not of the World,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 19</note> 
                  <hi>therefore the World
hateth them;</hi> and is often speaking evil
of them, and doing evil to them. They
see GOD so much dishonour'd in it,
as grieves them to the heart; and
causes them often with bitterness of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46092:26"/>
Soul to mourn in secret. And all
these troubles, and a Thousand more,
that were as easily nam'd as these, are
great hindrances to them, in that
whereon their hearts are principally
intent; and often create them much
perplexity and uneasiness. How can
they then but be tir'd with this World,
when they have dispatcht the great
Business they have to do in it; and
comfortably settled their Concerns as
to a Future State? How can they take
this for a suitable Place for them to
stay in, where they are like to have
little else but a constant succession of
Disturbances? How can they do any
other than earnestly long to be in their
<hi>Father's House,</hi> where they shall meet
with no sorrow or trouble more for
ever?</p>
               <p>2. HOLY Souls find also this
World very <hi>unsuitable</hi> to them, because
so <hi>uncertain and changeable.</hi> The more
they give way to Thought, the more
necessary do they find it to fly higher
than the Stage of Sense for a Portion.
As for themselves, they perceive by
their <hi>Make,</hi> they are fram'd for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
unless he that made them should
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46092:26"/>
annihilate them; of which they can
discern no just Reason to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.
As for this World they find
the <hi>Fashion of it</hi> is <hi>still passing away;</hi>
and that in all its Parts, and at all
Times 'tis full of Uncertainty and
Unsettlement. How then can they
six upon it? If not better provided,
how certainly may they expect in a
little Time to be left quite destitute?
And how can they take up with
that, which they are every Moment
in danger of being depriv'd of? They
well know that there is nothing here
to be met withal, let it seem ever so
sure, but it may be taken away by
a thousand unforeseen Casualties;
and let ever so great a Degree of
Earthly Felicity be attain'd, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while must die, and in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day all their Enjoyments and
Hopes as to this World perish. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
indeed know these Things as
well as they, but they mind them
not; and you may plainly discover
by their Carriage they hardly ever
think of them. But being important
Matters, they are often seriously
weigh'd, and intently ruminated on,
by Holy Souls: Who deliberately
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46092:27"/>
thence conclude, that it is in vain
to seek for an Happiness here; that
we are only Travelling and Passing
through the State we are in; and
are thereby led to fix their Hearts
on the upper World, where alone it
is that any Thing Solid, Stable, and
Durable, is to be met withal.</p>
               <p>3. THIS World is therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>unsuitable</hi> to Holy Souls, because
<hi>ensnaring.</hi> Often have the best been
here led aside from God and their
Duty; and drawn into Sin to their
unspeakable Damage. Either unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
Temptations have presented
themselves; or they have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and nibbled at the Bait, till
they were caught with the Hook.
Through Heedlessness and Privacy,
was even a <hi>Noah</hi> tempted to Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness
and Incest; and unguarded
Lust, drew a <hi>David</hi> into Murder and
Adultery. And who then can be
Secure? Snares abound every where,
and some that are taking, will not be
wanting; and even those who have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
themselves up to GOD most serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and listed themselves in his Service
most heartily, are not out of Danger:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46092:27"/>
For they have Corruption within, and
a busie Enemy without, who watches
all Opportunities to entrap them; and
he's so subtle and diligent, that unless
they are always watchful, he'll be more
or less too hard for them. And if he
in any remarkable degree prevails up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and foils them, how will he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph!
And how will the wicked of
the World, who are ever at his beck
rejoice! How busily do they, that they
may serve their Master, employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in endeavouring to draw such
aside into some reigning Vices! How
many Artifices will they use for that
purpose! And if they prevail, how
will they scoffingly cry out, and say,
<hi>Even the Godly are as bad as others!</hi> And
when they come to recollect their own
Slips and Miscarriages (especially if
they are any thing notorious) great
is their Concern and Regret; nay
sometimes their bitterness and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
is inexpressible. For time to
come, it may be, they then think to
be more careful. But Alas! after all,
How difficult is it to live where an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
Contagion is diffus'd univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,
and not be tainted? How hard
to be daily conversant in a wicked
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46092:28"/>
World, and not be dampt and deadned
in the Exercises of the Divine Life?
The Generality are not aware of this;
but the more holy any Persons are, the
more lively is their sense of it. This
causes them to live as 'twere in daily
fear: And they'd be quite dishearten'd,
had they not ground to hope, that such
sort of Exercises would not last long;
but that when they had bin try'd for
a time, if they retain'd their integrity,
GOD would take them to Himself,
and make them Happy in His Favour
and Love for ever. Thus its plain,
This Worlds <hi>unsuitableness</hi> tends to
wean Holy Souls from it, and raise
them above it. Again,</p>
               <p>3. THE <hi>Prospect</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> gives
them of <hi>Futurities,</hi> tends also to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the same Effects, <hi>viz.</hi> To make
them weary of this Earth, and to
long for Heaven. Their <hi>Faith</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Promise of GOD, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
them that <hi>He will be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of them that diligently seek
him;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> that <hi>there remaineth a Rest for
His People;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 9.</note> That <hi>He will give Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life to all those who by Patient
continuance in well doing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>seek for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46092:28"/>
and Honour, and Immortality;</hi> and
that <hi>there is an Inheritance incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4.</note>
                  <hi>and undefiled, and that fadeth not
away, reserv'd in Heaven for them;</hi>
and the like. These Things are not
the Fruit of their Fancy; they are
not Perswasions they have unwarily
imbib'd, or taken upon Trust from
others, without just Grounds: But
their Faith herein is bottom'd on the
Word of the Eternal GOD. Now
'tis in the Nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in this Chapter declar'd,<note place="margin">Vers. 1.</note> to be
<hi>the Substance of Things hoped for, and
the Evidence of Things not seen:</hi> Holy
Persons having such a Foundation to
build upon, do as verily believe that
if they persevere in the Course they
are in, they shall certainly find these
Things made good to them; as tho'
they did actually enjoy them alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
They are as really perswaded
of the Truth of these, and the like
Declarations, and give as true an
Assent to them, as if they could see
the Things they make mention off,
or as if they were intuitively, and
demonstratively known to them.
Now their full Satisfaction in the
Grounds they go upon, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46092:29"/>
depretiate this World, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
that to come in their esteem.
Were they left at uncertainties, they
would not be so Positive; But having
such Security given them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but look upon this Earth as a
Foreign Countrey to them; and fix
upon Heaven as their Home.</p>
               <p>THUS much of the first <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
The second follows; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>DOCT. II.</head>
               <p>THAT GOD would be asham'd to
be call'd the GOD of such, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
this World, devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
entirely to his Service, and
ardently aspire Heaven-wards in
the Course of their present Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
if He had not made abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Provision for their Happiness,
in a better State, and Life after
this.</p>
               <p>AND here I'le endeavour briefly
to show these Three Things.</p>
               <p>I. WHAT it implies for <hi>GOD</hi>
to be call'd <hi>any Persons GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:46092:29"/>
II. THAT He really is the GOD
of those, who renouncing this World,
devote themselves heartily to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and fix on Heaven as their
Home and Portion. And,</p>
               <p>III. THAT it would be Matter of
<hi>Shame</hi> to Him, had He not made
suitable Provision for all such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in a better State and Life than
this.</p>
               <p>FIRST then, Let's take Notice
what it implies, for <hi>GOD</hi> to be
call'd <hi>the GOD of any Persons.</hi> He
is the <hi>GOD of all</hi> in a General
Sense (as hath before been intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.)
For He made and sustains
them, and He alone can make them
Happy. But when such a Phrase is
in the Scriptures apply'd to any <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly,</hi>
It denotes a special Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Him in a Covenant way; a
peculiar Propriety in Him, founded
on that Covenant of Grace, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof we have thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to us in short; <hi>I will be their
GOD, and they shall be My People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
It necessarily therefore denotes a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46092:30"/>
transcendent Love and Affection in
GOD to any Persons, for Him to
be stil'd <hi>Theirs.</hi> 'Tis certainly a
great Demonstration of Love, for
Him as it were to give <hi>Himself</hi> to
them: And therefore also this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
must needs imply some
very great and extraordinary Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
'Tis declar'd by GOD,
<hi>That he that overcometh shall inherit
all Things;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 7.</note> but as if this were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
notwithstanding <hi>all Things</hi> are
taken in, 'tis added; <hi>And I will be
his GOD, and he shall be my Son.</hi>
One would have thought nothing
could have been more than <hi>all:</hi> But
however this is added, because all
all things else are as nothing without
it. But alas! who can tell what it is,
and what it implies for <hi>GOD to be
the GOD of any one!</hi> Thus much in
General is plain; that it intimates
He will Act for such a Persons good
as becomes a Being, infinite in all
Manner of Perfections: But come to
Particulars, and we are soon at a
loss. That Man that should pretend
to unfold it, must be able to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
the boundless Excellencies of
the Divine Essence, which are all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46092:30"/>
so far as the good of the
Party to whom GOD hath made
Himself over, is concern'd. Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath GOD for his GOD, His
<hi>Mercy</hi> is his to Pardon him; His
<hi>Wisdom</hi> his to guide him; His <hi>Power</hi>
his to Secure him; His <hi>Faithfulness</hi>
his to fulfil all his Promises to him;
His <hi>Love</hi> to confer Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on him; And in short, <hi>all that is
in God</hi> is his, so far as his Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
can require, and his Capacity can
reach. So that this is most evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the very <hi>Top of our Happiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT let it be observ'd withal,
that in such a Phrase as this, there
is ever imply'd a respect to the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning
Blood of the Mediatour;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Intervention whereof such
degenerate and guilty Creatures as
we, could have had no Hope, should
have remain'd incapable, of any such
Interest: But that, hath laid a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for our Advancement to this
Amazing Honour and Priviledge;
which bespeaks all those who reach
to it inconceiveably Happy; by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that it intimates that GOD
will do all things for them in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46092:31"/>
Manner, and like Himself; all
Things which may further their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Welfare.</p>
               <p>2. GOD certainly is thus the
GOD of all those, who renouncing
this World, do heartily devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to His Service, and fix on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as their Home and Portion. He is the
GOD of none, if not of such.
What is the Language of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
but this,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>I will be to them a
GOD, and they shall be to me a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi>
Of which I think we can make
nothing, were any willing to be His
People, and desirous to be under
His Care, and free to be govern'd by
His Laws, to whom he were back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to be a GOD, and to Act
the Part of a GOD Which is the
more evident from hence; in that
there cannot be such a Consent as
this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a real willingness hereto, in
any Heart that is not of His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing.
For (whatever any in the
Heat of Dispute may have advanc'd)
'tis notoriously evident that none of the
fallen Race of <hi>Adam</hi> would in this
Case move till they were drawn;
none could be free and willing to take
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46092:31"/>
GOD for theirs, as He hath offer'd
Himself to them in Covenant, whom
He had not made so. They might indeed
after a sort, be desirous of the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of the Covenant:</hi> That is to say,
they might desire to be pardon'd
that they might not be damn'd; and
to be so far under the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and Care, as that they might
be sav'd from Ruine, and the like:
But this is all <hi>Selfishness;</hi> and hath
nothing of <hi>Love to GOD</hi> at the
Bottom of it. This there may be,
and GOD still remain estrang'd;
and they after all go without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in him as <hi>theirs.</hi> But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there is a free Consent in any
Heart, to take Him for <hi>Owner, Ruler,</hi>
and <hi>End,</hi> according as He hath
propos'd Himself; and a willingness
to be entirely at His Disposal, and
under His Government and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
we may safely say, there the
Divine Spirit hath been effectually
at Work: For otherwise, this is a
step, had never been taken. Now to
suppose Persons wrought up to this,
and GOD to stand back; to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them willing, and <hi>Him shy;</hi>
were to imagine He mockt us in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46092:32"/>
the Proposal of His Covenant, and
sported himself with our Misery,
when He made us Overtures about
our Recovery.</p>
               <p>NOW I'le leave it to any to
Judge, how impossible it is for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to <hi>renounce this World,</hi> and <hi>fix
on Heaven as their Home and Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and Act correspondently, and this
Consent on their Part be wanting.
For what is it <hi>to renounce the World,</hi>
but to disclaim all Interest in it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Divine Honour; to be
Content with that Portion of it
that is of Divine Allotment; to
use it as not abusing it; to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to improve what is afforded of
it, for the best Purposes; and to sit
loose to it, and be ready to part
with what is most dear and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in it, upon a Divine Call? And
what is it <hi>to fix on Heaven as an
Home and Portion?</hi> But to live in
the believing Hope and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a bettrr State and Life after
this; to long for it, and pant after
it; despise all Things that could be
offer'd in Competition with it; to
be earnest and diligent in preparing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46092:32"/>
for it; fetch Supports from it under
all present uneasinesses; and be often
delightfully ruminating on those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
which GOD in His Word
hath made concerning it? And both
these jointly, do plainly bespeak an
<hi>Heavenly Mind and Heart.</hi> How can
the blessed GOD, then, if He Act
consistently with Himself, do any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than embrace all such with a
tender Affection; become <hi>theirs,</hi> and
Act like a GOD on their behalf?
Now this He could in no respect be
said to do, had He not prepar'd an
an Heaven, that is a State of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
and perfect Bliss, for their Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Entertainment. Which leads
me to the Third and Last Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. TO show that it would really
be a <hi>Matter of Shame</hi> to the Blessed
GOD, had He not made suitable
Provision, for all such Persons as
those foremention'd, in a better State
and Life than this. None need won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at the Phrase I use, when I
speak of its being <hi>a Matter of Shame</hi>
to GOD; for it's borrow'd from
my Text. And indeed strictly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46092:33"/>
it would be really shameful and
a dismal Reflection on the great
GOD, if He had not such a reserve
as Heaven for their Entertainment,
when this frail Life comes to an end.
A few Things will sufficiently clear
this.</p>
               <p>1. UPON this Supposition He'd
have <hi>provided no Satisfaction for ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desires of His own exciting. He</hi>
(saith the Apostle) <hi>that hath wrought
us for the self same thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>is GOD.</hi>
His meaning is, 'tis He who by
his Spirit hath wrought up Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to any Measure of Prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the Blessed and Glorious
State above; 'tis He that hath
kindled earnest Desires after it, and
excited firm Expectations of it. Had
He not then such a State in Store,
had He not an Heaven in reserve,
for the Entertainment of His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ones, at the end of all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Conflicts, it would evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
He did but <hi>Tantalize</hi> them
in making any such Motions
to them; in stirring up any such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
in them. And would not
this be shameful? Might He not be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46092:33"/>
asham'd to be call'd <hi>their GOD,</hi>
whom He lur'd to Himself, and then
impos'd upon, by deceitful Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
and Shadows, instead of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances?
But this we may be assur'd
can never be; <hi>for He hath prepared
for them a City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 HE would upon this Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have made it their Duty, <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
an <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd which could not be reacht.</hi>
For we knowing our Selves capable of
subsisting hereafter, nay of enjoying a
much greater Happiness than this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State can admit off, are hereby laid
under an indispensable Obligation of
intending that Happiness as our End.
For supposing there should be no <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State</hi> of Bliss, there is however
no possibility of being absolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
there is none: Nay the Matter
being impartially consider'd, it will
appear abundantly more likely that
there is. Now the very <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
obliges us to pursue the highest
Good whereof we are capable, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Attainment of it be but
probable: <hi>Revelation</hi> next steps in,
and tells us it is certain. If the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, there should be no Heaven
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46092:34"/>
hereafter, we must not only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that Capacity needless; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
must be suppos'd to be oblig'd to
employ the Principal Endeavours of
our Life, and all our Powers to no
Purpose. And what a shameful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
would this be on GOD, for
Him to have laid us under an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Necessity, if acting Rationally,
of aiming at that which is unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able!
Of Labouring for that which
is not! And constantly tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that which hath no other
Being than in the <hi>Fancy and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation!</hi>
And so we must either live
like Brutes, and be continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the smart Upbraidings and
Reproaches of our own Minds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Relief: Or else following our
Reason, must voluntarily befool our
selves by Building Castles in the Air,
where there is no possibility of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Footing. Might He not
well be <hi>asham'd</hi> to be call'd the
GOD of those whom He held thus
fasten'd in a <hi>fatal Circle,</hi> whence
they could never get loose! We
may therefore conclude, if He Acts
like Himself, there must be an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Store and Reserve. Again,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:46092:34"/>
3. UPON the Supposition fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,
<hi>None would fare so ill as
the Servants of GOD.</hi> Those who
were really the best, would fare the
worst: For,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>PIOVS Persons would have no
reward for all their Pains.</hi> Far be it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
from such as we are, to think of
<hi>meriting</hi> any thing at the hands of
GOD; I abhor the thought: and yet
I am sure 'twould be no credit to
him who hath promis'd to be <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of them that diligently seek him,</hi>
to let People serve him for nought.
There's a great deal of Pain and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
and Sorrow, which many Holy
Souls voluntarily undergo: Their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Consciences</hi> reproach and smite
them for the smallest Neglect and
Transgression; and on that Account,
draw forth many a mournful sigh and
groan. The sense of their great <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
makes them walk in constant Fear.
<hi>Watchings and Fightings</hi> against the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
of <hi>Satan</hi> are their Daily Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
Their <hi>Self-Denial</hi> is Galling; and
their <hi>severity</hi> to the Flesh painful. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
are they groaning under their own
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46092:35"/>
Body of Sin and Death; and <hi>Rivers of
Tears also run down their eyes, at the
sight of the Transgressions of others,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
their GOD is dishonour'd: And
can all this come to nothing at
last? And there be no difference at
long run between those who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
so much for the Sake of GOD;
and those who liv'd in an open E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strangement
from Him, and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Him! Would not this be
shameful?</p>
               <p>SHOULD any Plead, That <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Vertue is its own reward;</hi> I'le
freely grant it in the General: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that were we certain there were
no Life after this, it were more for
our present Interest <hi>in the main,</hi> to be
vertuous than vicious; unless where
there should be apparent hazard of
the Loss of Life or Estate, or of any
other insupportable Detriment, which
a vertuous course might have attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: But yet withal, it is obvious,
that there are sundry Exercises of
Vertue that are very difficult and
painful; in which the Holiest Souls
are most strict and frequent; which
upon that Supposition, would be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46092:35"/>
needless and fruitless, and therefore
better forborn: For such as these
there would be no Reward. Which
would cast such a Reflection on the
Blessed GOD, as were never to be
wip'd off But we may be assur'd 'tis
otherwise, <hi>For He hath prepar'd for
them a City.</hi> Nay,</p>
               <p>2. UPON the Supposition forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>The most Pious</hi> would be so far
from gaining by the Service of GOD,
that <hi>they'd plainly loose by it.</hi> For 'tis
easie to be observ'd, that a great part
of their Lives is employ'd in painful
endeavours after a meetness for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Their great Aim and Scope is,
<hi>to purifie themselves as he is pure,</hi> to
whom they are devoted, and in whom
they hope to be for ever happy.
With great earnestness do they strive
to improve both <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences</hi>
to this purpose. Early and
Late are they tugging at their listless,
sluggish, backward Hearts, that they
may get them into a more lively, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Heavenly Frame. And many
an Hour do they spend in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to mortifie a particular Sin, which
they find themselves most prone to,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46092:36"/>
which yet others, it may be, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe in them. And can all this
at last, prove <hi>labour-in-vain?</hi> shall they
be never the better for all in the issue?
If so, they had done much better to
have spent their time, and their pains,
in more agreeable, pleasant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Exercises, like the rest of the
World. 'Twas better they had deny'd
themselves nothing that their hearts
could crave, which yet had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
visible damage and detriment at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it; 'twere better they had
freely enjoy'd themselves, and what
came within their reach, and not have
so tired their Spirits, or perplext
their Minds, or sower'd their Joys,
by any such needless Labour and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.
They lost all that Pleasure
and Ease, and Freedom and Satisfaction
which others met with, all that while
that they were Grinding at the Mill,
as 'twere, and all to no purpose. Let
none say this is as nothing; For
though it be freely granted it would
appear so, upon a certain Prospect of
a Future State, which unspeakably
over-ballances; Yet, had we no more
to expect than what this Life could
afford, it would be very considerable,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46092:36"/>
and a Stress might be deservedly laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. For Common Sense would teach
us to make the most of our <hi>all.</hi> It
was not without good Reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the Apostle declares, <hi>That
if in this Life only we have hope in Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note>
                  <hi>we are of all Men most miserable.</hi> But
this cannot be, <hi>for he hath prepar'd for
Them a City:</hi> And which is more,
their future Advancement therein shall
be the higher; the more pains they
took in His Service in this Life, and
the more they lost and endur'd for his
Sake. Again,</p>
               <p>4. UPON the foregoing Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>GOD would either leave His
most faithful Ones without any Thing
to support them under their greatest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Troubles, or He'd support them with
a Fallacy.</hi> Holy Souls fetch their
great Consolations from Heaven in
every State. The Thoughts of that
refresh and chear them when their
Sins and Sorrows make them wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
support them under the greatest
Disappointments; and make them
Boast and Triumph in their GOD,
in the midst of all their Afflictions.
This Thought often recurs; <hi>we are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46092:37"/>
not far from Home, and then 'twill be
better.</hi> Were it not for this, their
Spirits would often sink, and their
Hearts faint. Nothing else in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
besides a Prospect of a Future
State of Bliss, can any thing tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
support them. The Thoughts of the
utter unavoidableness of the Troubles
they met with, through the Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a rigid Fate; or of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
liableness of all Mankind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
or of the likelihood of their
ceasing in a little time, upon their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
into a state of Silence and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Everlasting Oblivion, would
give little Relief.</p>
               <p>IF this then prove a Fallacy, he
who pretends to be <hi>their GOD,</hi> hath
most miserably deceiv'd them: And
is not that a Matter of Shame? But
this need not be feared, <hi>for he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for them a City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> WERE there not an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
prepared for Holy Souls hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>A Special Relation to GOD would
signifie just nothing.</hi> Those big Phrases,
<hi>Their GOD, and our GOD,</hi> would
in reality, dwindle to meer Noise and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46092:37"/>
Sound. For what could they be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to import that could amount to
any thing, if yet the Persons concern'd
might be left destitute; if there were
no Provision made for their Eternal
Abode. They had e'en as good have
bin without Him, and had no Concern
with Him, any further than was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all. For they'll be left to the
Full as helpless and miserable, as if
they had slighted and disregarded Him
all their days, and liv'd as much at
Random as any in the World. So
that even GOD Himself must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
be ashamed of any such <hi>Empty
Title,</hi> that hath no significancy in it,
or benefit attending it. But there
being an Heaven, that is unspeakably
more glorious than we can conceive,
<hi>He is not asham'd:</hi> And we, if we are
his Faithful Servants, may have the
Comfort at present, and shall have the
Benefit hereafter.</p>
               <p>I should now expatiate beyond all
Bounds, should I pretend to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
in my Application of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
foregoing; However, I can't
be satisfi'd, without making some Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:46092:38"/>
1. THEN Give me leave to ask
you (My Friends) how you stand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
making this Text the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
as it hath bin open'd to you?
Are you of the same Spirit and
Temper with the Antient Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs?
Deceive not your selves; the
Faithful Servants of GOD in all
Ages, are of one and the same Make,
and acted by one and the same Spirit.
The Period of time, wherein they liv'd,
makes no <hi>essential</hi> difference between
them. Have you then any of that
Faith for which they were so famous?
and doth it work the same way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

Calls? Our Advantages with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

would it not be pleasing and

I doubt that's the Case of many: But
must assure you where-ever 'tis so, 'tis
a Sign there's not the least Tincture
of Saving Grace. Have you fixt on the

you chosen Him, and given your selves

Can you evidence it by your
Heavenly-Mindedness? If so, 'tis hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

is likely to become of such as you in a
little time? Where do you think to
go when your Souls shall take their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46092:42"/>
flight, and leave your Bodies behind?
It may be you may hope you should
be transplanted into this <hi>better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:</hi>
What! and never Mind it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!
Think of it a little and you'l
easily discern that that is an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
and will in the Event prove
a groundless Expectation. No, you
must <hi>desire</hi> it; and that not Lazily,
but Earnestly; you must be diligent
in using all the Means GOD hath
directed you to, in order to the
reaching of it; you must get above the
World while you are in it; you must
get an <hi>Heavenly Mind and Heart;</hi>
otherwise this will be impossible.
And truly you had need Mind this
Matter speedily: For an Heavenly
Temper is not likely to be gotten
in an instant. And should you Die
without it, what would become of
you? GOD hath indeed prepar'd a
<hi>City, a glorious City,</hi> where his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ones, shall have Everlasting Rest,
and Peace, and Joy: But flatter not
your Selves, this is nothing to you;
you have neither Part nor Portion
in this Matter. I beseech you then;
look about you, before it be too
late. You might come there as well
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46092:42"/>
as others; (for whatever you may
weakly imagine, there's no Bar in
your Way, but what is of your own
laying:) 'tis offer'd to you as well
as others; and GOD is Sincere and
Earnest in that offer: Why then
should you befool your Selves? Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
your own endless Happiness,
and throw your Selves into Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>CONSIDER a little where you
must go, if excluded thence. Pray,
whither can you go but to the
Land of Gloominess, and thick Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
where Weeping and Wailing,
and Gnashing of Teeth, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Employment: And there must
you spend an Eternity, in Lamenting
your present Folly. As you would
not have this to be your woful Case,
I beg of you this Day; rid your selves
of Encumbrances, Mind Heaven in
earnest. Break off your Sins by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
Make your Peace with
GOD. Look out for an Interest in
Christ. And think not to make a
neglected GOD and SAVIOUR
your <hi>last Refuge,</hi> which I'm sure
would be little to your Comfort,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46092:43"/>
nay would be likely to Issue in your
Everlasting Confusion. Again,</p>
               <p>3. IF GOD is not asham'd to be
call'd <hi>our GOD,</hi> then let us take
Care, that we be neither <hi>asham'd of
Him,</hi> nor <hi>a shame to Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us not be <hi>asham'd of Him;</hi>
that is asham'd to own Him. Shall
the Men of this World <hi>Glory in
their Shame</hi> (as they often do) and
we be asham'd of our Glory! How
unaccountably strange doth that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear!
Let them Laugh, Ridicule or
Banter; pray what will they get by
it, or we loose? But I am verily
perswaded, would but Pious Persons
put on Courage, and Manage it with
Prudence, your Hectoring Swagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
who Pride themselves in
defying GOD, and pouring
Contempt on whatever belongs to
him, would in most Cases, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much Difficulty, be put out of
Countenance. But be that as it
will, why should we in any Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
be asham'd to own to whom we
belong? Our Service is honourable;
and our Reward will be great; we
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46092:43"/>
have no need therefore to sneak:
Let us leave that to those, who can
give no Account of themselves or
their Actions; their Work or their
Wages. Again,</p>
               <p>LET us also take Care, that we
be not <hi>a shame to GOD.</hi> Lets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of a carnal, drossy, earthly
Spirit.</p>
               <p>LET's beware of narrowness of
Mind and Selfishness: And indeed of
any Thing that might bring a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
on Him whom we serve, or
the way we walk in. Let's remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that the Eyes of GOD, and of
the World too are upon us; and
that there is, and may be a General
Expectation, to find a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and others. Let's <hi>have our
Conversation in Simplicity, and Godly
Sincerity;</hi> keep our Eyes six't upon
our Home; and carry our selves so,
as that others may be able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
what we aim at, and whither
we are tending.</p>
               <p>LASTLY; Since GOD hath
provided a better Life for His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46092:44"/>
after this; <hi>hath prepared for them
a City;</hi> we may groundedly Cry out,
<hi>Blessed are the Dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>which Die in
the Lord.</hi> For they are Transplanted
into that Countrey which they so
much desir'd, and so earnestly sought,
and on which their Hearts were so
much set: And feel the Meaning of
GOD's being their GOD, in a
Degree beyond what we at our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
are capable of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>AND this I doubt not is the
Case of our lately Deceased Friend,
the truly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pious Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth
Williams.</hi> Whom I dare to set
before you as one of the Primitive
Stamp; one of a like Spirit and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with those Worthies whom my
Text speaks off.</p>
               <p>TAKE Her before Her late Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and She had as many Things
to make this World agreeable to
Her, as most can pretend to. She
came of an <hi>Honourable Family;</hi> had
a great many <hi>Noble Relations;</hi> an
<hi>Husband</hi> to Her <hi>Hearts desire;</hi> a
<hi>Considerable Estate;</hi> and a <hi>General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:46092:44"/>
from all that knew her: And
yet all this was as nothing to Her;
She could not bear a thought of
fixing, and taking up her Rest here
below; but lookt upwards; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
Her Self a Poor Pilgrim and
Stranger in the World: She sought
a <hi>better Countrey;</hi> that is <hi>an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
and that with greater Vigour and
Assiduity; with greater Diligence and
Fervour; and with greater Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Constancy, than, is I am
sure, (to say the least) usual and
common.</p>
               <p>SHE began to dislodge from this
Earth, and look Heaven-wards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
She was brought Home to
GOD in Her Younger Years, by
Means of a Sermon of one Mr.
<hi>Baynes,</hi> who was an Eminent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and gain'd many Souls
to Christ in his Day. And setting out
for Heaven so soon, She made a much
greater Advance in the Way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than could otherwise have been
expected. She often reflected on Her
<hi>Early</hi> Dedication of Her Self to
GOD with Comfort and Joy; and
hath many Times been heard to say
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46092:45"/>
with an Holy Triumph, by those who
were intimate with Her; <hi>GOD hath
been my GOD, even from my Youth.</hi>
And She ever after kept as close to
him, and gain'd as much by close
walking with Him, as most can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to.</p>
               <p>I cannot forbear particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
some Things con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erning Her,
which I take to be generally <hi>Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Instructive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SHE was one of <hi>great Faith,</hi> and
<hi>signal</hi> was Her <hi>Trust</hi> in GOD: To
Him She had heartily given Her
Self, and in Him, who She knew
was faithful, She could Conside. There
was a remarkable Instance and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hereof, in Her last Passage
from <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>England</hi> in the Month
of <hi>September,</hi> 1687. She was then in
a Violent Storm; eminent was the
Danger; not only in the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Passengers, but of the
Master, and Seamen; all reckon'd
themselves as Lost. Here was a Time
of Tryal. But She was fearless; and
great was Her Composure and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedness.
She cast Her Self on
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46092:45"/>
GOD, and was freely ready for His
Pleasure. I have seen this Passage
of Providence Recorded by Her own
Hand; with this Remark: That <hi>there
was at that Time an observable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of Prayer, in a sudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Calm immediately following up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their joint Recommendation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lves
to GOD.</hi> And with this short
Petition annext; <hi>Lord make me to
live more to thy Glory, that I may not
be afraid to Die at any Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HER <hi>Love to GOD</hi> was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
She manifestly seem'd to all
who had any Thing of Freedom with
Her, to value His Favour more than
all the World; and to Fear His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
more than any Trouble
whatever. It seems to be the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Sense of Her Soul She vented,
when She put this short Passage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Her Hand; <hi>The Manifestation of
GOD to my Soul, is my highest Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
and Comfort: And the hidings
of His Face, my greatest Loss and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
She appear'd to take Delight
in whatever belong'd to GOD. His
<hi>Word</hi> She counted Her chiefest Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and therewith She converst
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46092:46"/>
daily, with great Earnestness and
Pleasure. His <hi>Sabbaths</hi> She esteem'd
the sweetest Portion of Her Time.
His <hi>Ordinances,</hi> were the greatest
Comfort of Her Life: And it hath
been observ'd by those who knew
Her well, that She would be more
Chearful and Pleasant in Her walks
to the House of GOD, than at any
other Time. She had a mighty Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Value, and Love to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</hi>
She did not (as is common
with many) Love this or that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Minister extravagantly, and
disesteem others: But She honour'd
the Office, and all without Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
who were faithful in it: She
lov'd all, and despis'd none. She
lookt upon all equally as GOD's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
and Representatives; and as
such they were the Objects of Her
singular Esteem and Respect. And
in short, whatever any Way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to GOD, or had any Thing
of Him <hi>in</hi> or <hi>on</hi> it, She discover'd
an high Value for.</p>
               <p>SHE was much taken-up in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Thoughts of our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>
and His <hi>Work of Redemption:</hi> And
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46092:46"/>
often venting the Sense of her Soul,
in ardent Breathings after Him. I'le
give you a few Passages of this kind
out of Her Papers; in Her own
Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN one Place thus:</hi> I'm amaz'd
at the Mysteries of Redemption; the
Incarnation of the Son of GOD; the
Killing the Prince of Life; the Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
of the High and Lofty One;
the Disgrace of the Lord of Glory;
the Curse upon Him who is Blessed for
ever: O the Mysteries of Scripture, of
Love, of Grace, of Providence!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN another Place;</hi> Oh that I may
know Christ as a Prophet instructing
me; a Priest satisfying for me; and a
King ruling spiritually in me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN another thus:</hi> This Wretched
Soul of Mine doth Pine away for
Strength, and even Pant for Breath;
longing to receive Encrease of Life
from the Living Stock Christ Iesus;
which must be thy Work, and thine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Oh work it I humbly pray Thee,
which way thou wilt; Oh Empty my
Self, of my Self, and let all Glory
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46092:47"/>
be given to Thee, and not to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SHE was entirely</hi> Dependent <hi>for
all</hi> on the Blessed Spirit of Grace. <hi>In
one of Her Papers, She hath this
remarkable Passage looking that way:</hi>
There is no Corruption though more
deeply rooted than others, but that in
Time, by walking in the Spirit, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to the Law of Christ, to the Death
of Christ, and to the Love of Christ,
and joining Ones own Endeavours to
the Spirit of Christ, one may get an
Eminent Victory over it, and see it
by Degrees fall down before us. Lord
lend me the powerful Aid of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
I humbly beg it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN another Place thus:</hi> I am
troubled with Temptations, but I Trust
in Thee: I Rest on Thee for Life and
for Salvation: Oh take me into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of thy Love for Christs sake: I
cast my Self into the Arms of Thine
Everlasting Strength; I have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in my Self nor any other.</p>
               <p>BUT in no Grace was She more
eminent than in that of <hi>Humility.</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:46092:47"/>
She silently converst with Her GOD,
and that better World, which Her
Heart was set upon, without Noise
and Ostentation. She was more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of nothing than Spiritual Pride.
Methinks that is an affecting Passage
which dropt from Her Pen a Year
or two ago: <hi>I must</hi> humbly <hi>leave it
on Record, I never found so much of
GOD, I never drew so near Him, I
never experienc'd the Power of His
Word as of Late.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND yet as <hi>Humble</hi> as She was,
and as diffident of Her Self, She did
not think Her Self excus'd from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Christian <hi>Resolutions</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on Divine Strength. Take
some of them, in Her own Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I'LE be ruled by thy Revealed
Will.</q>
               </p>

                  <q>I'LE take thy Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments

                  <q>HEREIN will I Hope, and go
on till Death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I am weak; but Christ is strong.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>AND I Hope for Supplies
from Him.</q>

               <p>To which She subscrib'd Her
Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:46092:48"/>
GREAT was Her <hi>Contentedness,
Resignation, Submission</hi> to the Will of
GOD, and <hi>Heavenly Mindedness.</hi>
Her Papers abound with pregnant
Expressions, and Indications hereof.
In one Place She delivereth Her
Self thus.</p>
               <p>LORD give Me what thou wilt
have Me to do; and then do what
thou wilt to, and with, Me thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Servant.</p>
               <p>IN another, She hath these Two
Remarkable Passages.</p>
               <p>IF Thou wilt have Me poor and
disgrac'd, I am Content to be so.</p>
               <p>IF Thou wilt have Me serve Thee
in the Condition I am in; I will glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do so.</p>
               <p>IT is enough to Me, that Thou
wilt have it so.</p>
               <p>I desire to yield readily, humbly and
chearfully to thy Disposing Providence.</p>
               <p>AMEN, Amen, Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:46092:49"/>
HATH GOD made Me Rich,
that I might maintain my Pride, my
Pomp, and Erutish Pleasures?</p>
               <p>NO; He hath rather Lent than ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given Me what I have; and I must
give an Account to Him for all.</p>
               <p>ALL we are and have, we have

TO use it, to leave it;
TO lay it out, to lay it down;</p>
               <p>VNTO the Honour of our Master,
from whose Bounty we receiv'd it.</p>
               <p>SHE was very <hi>Regular</hi> in Her
<hi>Devotions:</hi> Much in <hi>Prayer;</hi> and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in <hi>Meditation;</hi> and spent more
Time in Converse with GOD in
Her Closet than most. I'l Cite a
few Passages out of Her Papers, which
seem to deliver the very Sense of
Her Soul as to Religious Dutys. In
one Place She expresseth Her Self
thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:46092:49"/>
IN Duty I'd not be satisfi'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

               <p>SHE was much in <hi>Self-Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
And such as these, were some
of the Marks and Signs whereby
She try'd Her Self.</p>
               <list>

5. DO I relish and prize the Things
of GOD?</item>
               </list>
               <p>SHE fram'd various <hi>Maxims,</hi> and
Collected <hi>Rules</hi> for Her Self, both
for Her Temper and Practise; which
those who knew Her best, can bear
Witness She made Conscience of
minding and following. I'le menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a few of them, as I find She hath
set them down for Her Use.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <q>THE End of Christs Doctrine,

               <p>AND yet notwithstanding all
these Instances and Evidences, and a
great many more that might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
of the Fervour of Her Piety,
and the Vigour of Her Grace, She
(as is usual with the best of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
had Her <hi>Complaints.</hi> She thus
expresseth Her Self in one of Her
Papers.</p>
               <p>OH my dark Vnderstanding! Oh my
hard and unbelieving Heart! My Heart
is the worst Part of Me. Coldness and
deadness of Heart is my Fault. I desire
to repent, and to be humbled for it.</p>
               <p>She had a very <hi>tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
which made Her mourn in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
for those Things which others
would have taken little notice off.
But withal She had Her <hi>Comforts,
Hopes,</hi> and <hi>Ioys.</hi> Her Religion did
not lie all in complaining; but in a
<hi>Life of Faith, Self-denial, delight in
GOD, and Preparation for Heaven.</hi>
Her Heart was so set on the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46092:51"/>
Felicity, that She seem'd as it
were out of the World while She
was in it; and hardly any converst
with Her, but they might observe
She lookt upon Her Self as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to another Countrey.</p>
               <p>THE Grounds of my longing for
Heaven <hi>(saith She in one of Her
Papers)</hi> are; those glorious Enjoyments
that are there to be met with; GOD's
Presence; Perfection of Grace; Fulness
of Ioy; Excellency of Glory; Plenty of
best Wealth and Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SHE made no great Stir or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
here below; Her aim seem'd
to be to pass through the World
without much Observation. She was
not indeed fram'd for a Life of
much Action; but was a great Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of Retiredness; I think I may
justly say to a fault: By Reason that
She would in all Probability have
more Consulted Her own Benefit;
and have been more useful to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
had She been more in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
But I pretend not to be
giving an Account of one that was
without Imperfections, and Defects.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46092:52"/>
Though withal 'tis not unworthy
Observation; that She by Her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and retir'd sort of Life, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great many Snares which much
Conversation hath attending it; which
also was no small Inducement to
it.</p>
               <p>THERE is one Thing which in
Justice to Her Memory, I cannot
forbear mentioning as the Matter of
my own Observation; which hath
been Noted also by many others.
<hi>She was a Pattern of a Loving and
Respectful Wife.</hi> A more Reverential
Respect for an Husband, join'd with
a more tender Affection, I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
I never saw, nor ever expect
to meet with: And more than once
hath She intimated to me Her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
well-pleasedness with the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of Providence in fixing Her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the World; assuring me
'twas more to Her Satisfaction and
Content, than if Her Circumstances
upon Marriage, had not only equall'd
but exceeded, what according to
common Course, She from Her Birth
and Estate might have had Reason
to have expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:46092:52"/>
SHE was not without a Variety
of <hi>Difficulties and Trials</hi> in the
Course of Her Life; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
since <hi>all Things</hi> we know <hi>come
alike</hi> to <hi>all</hi> at present, and there's
<hi>no knowing either Love or Hatred by
these Things.</hi> But She under all, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it with a Christian Patience,
and Composure; and often had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to Her smal, Her Everlasting
Home, for Support.</p>
               <p>THOUGH She had met with
many Troubles, yet none ever came
so near Her, as the loss of Her dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloved Sister, The Countess of
<hi>Mountrath,</hi> a few Weeks since; which
did indeed sink Her Spirits, and was
too hard for Her. This may seem
somewhat strange after the foregoing
Account of Her: But the best have
their Weaknesses. Though there is
this to be said in Her Case; She
had before been much indispos'd, and
was not recover'd, when the Tidings
of that Stroke first reacht Her: She
receiv'd the News of it upon a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal,
which encreas'd the Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it made; and then She pent up
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46092:53"/>
Her Grief, and would not give it
vent in the usual way, which was
the occasion of its over-setting Her.
She was fearful of dishonouring
GOD by immoderate Mourning;
and thereupon suffer'd Her Grief to
boil within: Whereas had She let it
run over, it would in all probability
have been much better with Her.
So that there was an Holy Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
observable, even in that which
occasion'd the Distemper, which hath
now laid Her in Her Grave.</p>
               <p>A little before Her Disorder came
upon Her, She express'd Her Self
thus one Morning to Her Husband.
<hi>I know not what I may meet with,
but great Things pass'd between GOD
and Me this Night. He hath with
unusual Power assured Me, and
spoken to my Heart; I will never leave
Thee nor forsake Thee:</hi> And this She
during Her Illness, oft repeated.
And GOD did indeed remarkably
Guard Her; He kept Her from doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Her State; She retain'd Her
Assurance; in Her greatest disorders
She express'd Her desires to Die and
be in Heaven; and the breathings
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46092:53"/>
of Her Soul after GOD, even then,
were such, as discover'd the Pious
bent of Her Heart. Indeed the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Grace in Her Soul was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly
evidenc'd in the heighth of
Her Disease.</p>
               <p>SHE had not Her great Work
then to do: She had indeed been
very unfit for it. But through Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
'twas, I trust, dispatch'd long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
O take Warning all you, who
leave the principal business of Life
to an uncertain <hi>hereafter.</hi> Little do
you know, but you may be surpriz'd
by Death on a sudden; or if not,
may be seiz'd by some such Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as though it may not remove
you immediately, may yet take away
all Capacity of making your Peace
with GOD, or getting ready for
another World. Take warning, I
say; and provide in Time, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
your Health, and neglect not
GOD, least you are deserted, and
abandon'd by Him.</p>
               <p>THE last Seene of our Dear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Friends Life was dark and
gloomy: But the Clouds are now
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46092:54"/>
quite blown over, the Issue was, I
doubt not, glorious. <hi>GOD was Her
GOD still:</hi> He was not asham'd to
own Her, nay helpt Her to own
Him, even the Day before She dy'd:
When She express'd Her Faith and
Trust, of Her being about to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
out of a Troublesome World
into Her Fathers House.</p>
               <p>THERE She now is in that <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Countrey;</hi> on which Her Heart
was so much set: Let us therefore
be <hi>Followers</hi> of Her thither; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Her, <hi>of all</hi> that nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Company, <hi>Who through Faith and
Patience inherit the Promises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND GOD grant that we may.</p>
               <closer>Amen.</closer>
