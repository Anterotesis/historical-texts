            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his proper body, and to ech body contrarywise, his proper qualities and condicions, thereby to obtayne and purchase the truth. The aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Poete <hi>Homere</hi> tooke vppon him liuely to describe that worthy <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi> in comparing his maners and condicions to the notes seene on his body. The lyke also did <hi>Dares Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> in his long Catalogue of noble Piers, where he cunningly applyed their condicions with their formes and lineamentes seene. This <hi>Dares</hi> wrote that the valiant <hi>Aeneas</hi> was well coloured of body, tending vnto a rednesse, in personage square set, hauing cheerefull and smyling eyes, and these somewhat declining to a blacknesse, and therfore <hi>Dares</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him eloquent, gentle, friendlye of behauiour, wittye and politike in his counsels, pleasant at times, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant in his attempts, and vertuous.

Many moe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of antiquity might herebe alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, were it not that I thinke these sufficient for our turne, to note the antiquitie of comparisons, betweene the bodily formes &amp; lineaments, and betwene their dispositions, courage, and wit: Like to these, many may be read &amp; seene in <hi>Aristotle, Suctonius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Seeing this knowledge hath so long time bene obserued and exercised of so excellent and famous men, what shall it let or staye me, not to applye my study and penne thereto, and the rather for that it is lawfull for euery

man to decerne, as farre as he can, the qualitie and condicions of the hart: seeing the secret matters lying deepe in the breast, are many times bewrayde by the outward gestures, what singular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Arte bringeth with it, may euidently appeare in this, that oftentimes men happening into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances and friendshippes, such as they suppose to be most friendly, most sounde, and most faythfull: for the more parte are founde dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, vnfaithfull, turnecotes moste hurtfull, and most peruerse in their doinges.

For this cause most prudently were appoynted in times paste (as some report) in the Courtes of kings, and noble Princes, certain learned men able to discouer the facts and minds of their subiectes, souldiers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conuersant about them. The learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his booke of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, willeth that comely men be chosen in office and made Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and not mishapen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. In another place he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth men to beware of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which are marked by nature, according to the common opinion of men: an euill fauoured and crabbed countenance, doth euermore yeelde vntoward condicions.

               <hi>The Preface to the Reader,</hi> and diligent traueyler, in the Arte of Phisiognomie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeyng it is true (gentle Reader) that the first and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest poynt of wisedome is to know God, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to knowe our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and the thirde to knowe our duties towardes our neighbors: it must néedes then be graunted and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that those meanes which leade vs to the nearest vnderstanding and perceyuing of them, are both good, profitable, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: wherefore great folly ruleth these men, who by their slender and faint arguments, woulde condemne and banish Philosophie. The which after the minde of S. Paule, doth force vs to the vnderstanding and knowledge of the seconde, and also by the agréement and consent of all the learned, doth throughly instruct vs in the last. The people of the world, lifting vp their mindes to the Elementes, beholding the motions, alterations, chaunges, the seuerall courses of the lightes, and Planets, with theyr infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb facs="tcp:4287:10"/>
obseruations: looking downe againe vpon the earth, and there in séeing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, the situation, and magnificence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with the wonderfull working of nature, did acknowledge a God, the maker of them, and therein did confesse his power and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie. The Philosopher <hi>Ariopagita,</hi> being without the swift hearing of thinges, done in Iewrie, when he sawe the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnnaturall darcknesse that sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ranne ouer the face of the earth, durst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the worlde to drawe to an ende, or else the maker and framer of it, to suffer violence. In <hi>Athens</hi> (the mother and nurse of learning) where the Philosophers had their long resting place, by learning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a greater God, then by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature they could attaine vnto: when by the witnesse of S. Paule, they erected an aultar (<hi>ignoto deo</hi>) to the vnknowne God. I haue read of a prowde king of Englande, whome the water (notwithstanding hys fierce, and thundering commaundement) woulde not obey, but still rose higher and higher, to the wetting of his féete, with shame ynough confessed a god, to whom the waters were obedient. By Philosophie we
<pb facs="tcp:4287:11"/>
learne to know our selues, the diuersitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene Mankinde and other Creatures: the excellencie of the one ouer the other, in some pointes, and the excellencie of the other in other poyntes. Reason hath made man, to differ from the brutishe generation, and therefore more excellent, but by his disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and weake ruling of himselfe, the other is his superiour. The beast doth all thinges, by the instinct and prouocation of nature: Man without reason, not able to bridle hys sensualitie, degenerates from that he ought to bée, and becommeth more monstruous with sinne, sensuality, lust, and all other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vices, than any other monster in forme and shape. By Philosophie we learne, what is iust, honest, comely, profitable, decent, vertuous, and Godly: and againe what is dishonest, vnseemoly, vicious, and to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred. To make a perticuler prayse of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie, the treatie woulde not be so long &amp; tedious, as the aduenture great, I should hasard a greater enterprise, than any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore durst take in hande: but generally whatsoeuer procéedeth from reason, it is Philosophie. If reason procéedeth from a naturall disposition or inclination, if it come
<pb facs="tcp:4287:11"/>
by experience, or forced by learned meanes, it is Philosophie. Peraduenture some there be (more curious a great deale, than theyr holye liuing requireth) that doe impugne some part of Philosophie, as a thing or Art not necessarie or méete to be knowne and studied. These men I suppose eyther neuer knewe, or else haue forgotten what maketh a man. Reason telleth, if a whole bodie or substaunce lacketh a part, it is become lame and vnperfite. If a man wanteth a member or ioynt, it cannot be said, there is the whole and perfite forme of a man: no more can Philosophie bée perfite, if anye one part bée plucked away. The Arte of diuination by the Starres, the face and hande, is a percell of Philosophie, and grounded vpon long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and reason: and therefore not so wicked and detestable as some men do take and repute these. Although it be an Arte wherewith many be deceyued (through the gréedie desire of gaine) yet it is no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to say, that the Arte therefore is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous &amp; naught. Diuinitie, being the words of God, perfit and most pure, where lurketh no deceyte nor leasing, suffereth abuse: for the deuill coulde alledge it agaynst Christ:
<pb facs="tcp:4287:12"/>
and Antichrist therewith persecuteth hys members: bicause some men with wine be druncken, is wine therefore naught? Put a knife into a mad mans hande, he knoweth not how to vse it: but a wise, discreate, and sober man, will neuer hurt himselfe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly with it. Though some men do ghesse at randon, as touching the proper conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and qualities of persons, yet the Arte laudable and certaine is not to bée blamed: neyther is it to be condemned, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes he pronounceth cleane agaynst the persons maners, and conuersation. Tullie witnesseth (4. <hi>Tusculanarum</hi>) about the ende, of a certaine Phisiognomer named <hi>Zopirus,</hi> which tooke vpon him to beholde, and iudge the natures and dispositions of many persons, by the formes of their faces, and lineaments of the bodie: among which he was requested to beholde the forme of the learned <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and fayling in hys iudgement, for that he onely pronounced by the lineaments of the bodie, what by nature he was inclined vnto, and not what by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vertue he was become, was of many laughed to scorne: although the wise <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> well allowed and confirmed
<pb facs="tcp:4287:12"/>
his iudgement, saying by nature he was the lyke, that the Phisiognomer had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced of him. Therfore I admonish eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that will rightlye pronounce and iudge in this Art, that they first consider and vew all the partes of man, and not to iudge rashly by any one member alone: so shall they be sure not to be deceyued, I meane to vnderstand and know the truth of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall disposition, and yet may they faile of the mans conditions, which <hi>Socrates</hi> well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in himselfe. For when he on a tyme (as vttereth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) sent two of his scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, with his table or Image liuely drawne and counterfeyted by a cunning workman, to that famous Phisiognomer <hi>Phylemon:</hi> who after he had diligentlye viewed, and considered one member with another, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Socrates</hi> to be a leacherous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, subtill, a deceyuer, couetous, and giuen to wickednesse. This iudgement so much mooued the schollers, that they bitterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the Phisiognomer. And in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, opening this iudgement to <hi>Socrates,</hi> confessed that <hi>Phylemon</hi> had truely repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him in all poyntes, and swarued not one iotte from a truth after nature: but the
<pb facs="tcp:4287:13"/>
studie of Philosophie, and honestie, had so brideled his desires and wicked nature, that he became a new man. By this a man may conclude, that our will to be subicct vnder the gouernement of reason and grace: and that through these we may bridle nature in vs, turning the prouocations of them vnto goodnesse. For the Chollerick or yrefull man may eyther by grace represse his furie and lust, or else alter the same in correcting of vices. The malicious man also may either by grace aswage his lust, or else turne the same agaynst the euill: and so lyke may be done, in all other naturall inclinations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in vs. Experience teacheth how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny giuen to sundrie kind of vices, after they by Gods grace begin to haue a swéete taste of Gods worde, doe shake of their woonted nature, and become altered and chaunged fellowes. <hi>Saule</hi> by Gods spirite, of a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, became a Martyr, of a bloud sucker, an innocent and méeke Lambe. I might here recyte a number of Godly examples, it I wist these were not ynough, to prooue mine intent. It is not to be decyded, what Gods holy spirite can doe. It worketh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, it worketh wonders contrarse to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:13"/>
it turneth olde <hi>Adam</hi> (in vs) into new <hi>Adam,</hi> contrary to all sence and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of man: and then no marueyle, though the Phisiognomer doe faile, where nature fayleth. Much more (gentle Reader) I might say, but that I suppose this is sufficient, to shew vnto thée, the right vse of Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. I will leaue the whole commendation of the Arte, vnto thine owne iudgement, and experience. If by practise thou shalt find anye certaintie in it, then reiect it not as vaine and friuolous, but if thou canst not attaine vnto the certaine knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet let not thine yll fortune, condemne the iudgementes and experiences of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber well learned and practised in this Arte: neyther thinke yll of me, who wisheth vnto thée verie well, and haue taken these paynes altogither for thy sake. Somewhat I haue séene by experience, all that thou hast here, gathered oute of the best wryters: muche more I haue reade, and the best of that, I also giue thée. So many as shall receyue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fruit or commoditie by me, let them giue thankes vnto the worshipfull and high lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, Mayster Dée, by whose helpe and ayde at the beginning, I receyued such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
<pb facs="tcp:4287:14"/>
and principles, as gaue me great light vnto this knowledge, and vnto whome also thou art greatly bound: for that he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth well vnto his Countrie men, and hath taken great paynes to do his Countrie good. Thus leauing (gentle reader) to trouble you any longer: I commit you to God, wishing onely your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, in the furthering of thys my simple worke.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cylatour</hi> agree, that to all lyuing creatures, it is a matter common, as to suffer and doe of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination: which as the same in beastes is named a violence, euen so in men this is by a contrarie maner named an inclination. For as much (as by way of example) in the Chollericke, is knowne an inclination to yre: in the Melancholick, to feare: in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, to mirth: and in the Flegmatick, to slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnesse. All which inclinations, are reported to be the vtterers both of the naturall motions and conditions in men, which by reason and wisedome
<pb facs="tcp:4287:18"/>
be well gouerned. Which well appeared by <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochrates,</hi> who by his face was iudged wicked, yet thorow Philosophie knowne to be well condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. But in beasts for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lack of reason, are these affections and conditions as <hi>Aristotle</hi> vttereth in his booke <hi>de secretis secretorum,</hi> may not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned: in that they liue and perseuer after their sense, and appetite. By which euidently appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that Phisiognomie to be a necessarie and lawdable science, seing by the same a man may so readily pronounce and foretell the naturall apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto the affections, and conditions in men, by the outwarde notes of the bodie. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man may thus foretell the naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and actuall conditions: yet of this, is it not accounted, so perfite and firme a science: seing by the same a man may erre, in sundrie subiects ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace and wisedome. But in that men (for the more part) doe lyue after a sensuall will in themselues, and that none but the wise and godly (which is by an inwarde working of the spirite) doe lyue after reason: For that cause is this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomy accounted and named a science: which instructeth a man by the outwarde notes, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the naturall motions, and actuall conditions, that consist and dwell in many persons, especially in those, which lyue after their affection, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, rather than gouerning themselues by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4287:18"/>
reason. And of this did the learned (<hi>Bias Priaenias</hi>) report, that there lyued and were more of the wicked, than of good persons: in that so manye are ledde, and moued after a sensuall will, than procured by reason: which causeth that man (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth) to swarue and fall from a meane, in many maners: but the same is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto and purchased, by one maner of waye. And two kinds there are of the notes: as certaine, which of the elementarie qualitie conceiued, that vtter and signifie the affections of the minde: as doth the hearinesse of the breast, which is a note of yre, through the hote heart. And certayne are of propertie, as the declyning of the head to the right side in the walking, which is the note of a Cynede as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth: and this lyke is neyther gathered of a hote, nor colde cause, but of the propertie. Yet doe the Perypatetickes (as writeth <hi>Aristotle secundo priorum</hi>) vtter, that not any one affection to consist and be in man, or any condition of nature: but that a like note is outwardly to be séene on the bodye: by which not onely that passion or condition maye be vttered, but the fortune vnto good or euill by the accyden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall notes may be iudged: And although the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite (as vnto vnderstanding) is from the bodye eleuated: yet (as vnto the other partes and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers) is the spirite comprehended of the bodie.
<pb facs="tcp:4287:19"/>
Although the inner affectes of the spirite can not be iudged by the outward notes of the body: yet may the accydences of the spirite &amp; minde, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those which togither alter both spirite and body be iudged, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth in <hi>secundo priorum. Auerro is</hi> vttereth that the accidences not naturall, cause no note but in the spirite: as if any knoweth the Arte of Musick: he hath the note in the spirite, and not in bodie formed of the same. The lookes also of men, although they doe not differ in the essentiall kinde: Yet doe these differ in the kinde accedentall. So that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall difference of lookes in man, doth onely suffice, for the difference of conditions. But if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye shall here obiect, that sentence written in the seuenth chapiter of saint Iohns Gospell: where our Sauiour willeth none to iudge rashely, after the vtter appearaunce of the face or looke, but to pronounce and iudge a righteous iudgement. To this maye thus be aunswered, that the same saying of the Lord was spoken vnto them, which in very deede were wicked persons, of malicious conditions: yet not of the matter and cause doe they procure a iudgement, but through the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of persons, and in the hate or contempt of men: are they so alienated from the truth of the matter in iudging, which otherwise must be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed, and that especiallye where the person is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4287:19"/>
occupied in the celestiall doctrine. Thys is also to be learned and noted, that anye person (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vttered) to iudge alone by the face, mightily to erre and be deceyued, so that necessarie it is, to gather and marke sundrie other notes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, and after to pronounce iudgement; and the same not firmely, but coniecturally: As by thys example may well appeare, that if the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer earnestly beholding and vewing any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie person by nature, doth sée him at that instant tyme (through some hap) verie sadde of counti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and doth of the same iudge hym to be sad by nature, where he contrariewise is of nature merrie: or otherwise appearing then merrie; shal iudge him of the same to be of nature merrie, where perhaps, by nature he is giuen to be sadde: must néedes (through these lyke) greatly erre, and be deceyued in iudgement. Here also note, that there are two maner of passions, as the one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and the other accidentall. The accidentall are those, which consist of the spirite, and for the same, that they consist of the spirite, no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in body is caused: as of the Arte, and science: and these by notes in the bodye are not indicated. But the naturall, which for that they consist in vs, as afore taught: for that cause doth some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration appeare in the bodye: as yre, feare, and such like, of which hereafter (in this worke) shall
<pb facs="tcp:4287:20"/>
be intreated. To be briefe, this Phisiognomie is aknowledge which leadeth a man to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and knowing both of the naturall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conditions of the spirite: and the good or euill fortune, by the outwarde notes and lines of the face and body. Yea by the pases many times is the heart bewrayed, and the voyces (as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> reporteth) are notes and vtterers of the inner thoughtes: all which vnder the Phisiognomicall science are contayned. <hi>Lucius Scylla,</hi> and <hi>Cesare dictatoure</hi> by the helpe of this science founde out and iudged the wylie craftes and disceites of their aduersaries manye times: that secretly conered their malicious mindes, by their fayre shewes. The most singular and prudent <hi>Plato</hi> in his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomie vttereth these wordes: that the man which hath members like to any beast insueth his nature: as he which hath an Aquiline or hauked nose, vseth and exercyseth Aquiline conditions, as magnanimitie, cruelnesse, and gréedie catching. The common sort at this day, without any reason and learning, doe pronounce and iudge certayne matters verie straunge of men: as when he sayth of anye fowle looke, this person pleaseth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They also say, God defend and kéepe me from the fellowship of that person marked: as are the bunch backed, and gogle eyed persons. By which euydently appeareth, that the bodily notes
<pb facs="tcp:4287:20"/>
of Phisiognomating by the naturall conditions of men doe procure and cause a great probable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, although no necessitie. To conclude, all the workings and passions of the spirite, appeare to be matched and ioyned with the bodie: which es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially appeareth in the passions of the concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible or desirefull spirite: as are yre, méekenesse, feare, pittifulnesse, mercie, and such lyke: which are not caused, without the locall motion of the heart dilating, and drawing togither. Of thys, the bodies of diuers men, are diuersly disposed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dyuers dispositions of spirites: in that mens spirites through dyuers members, are diuersly disposed in their passions. To ende, the conditions and naturall affections, that consist in the sensytiue part: is reported of the Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to be the sense gyuer, being common both to men and beastes.</p>

The woman ought to haue a contrarie composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a small head, a long face, a small necke, a large throte, and somewhat eminent, the breast narrowe, the shoulder pointes flatte lying, the flanckes and ribbes slender, the back lyke: but the hips and buttockes, bigger than the mans: the legges in a maner of one bignesse throughout, the féete small, the héeles flat, short armes, the hands and fingers small, the lippes thinne, and the chin round, with a certaine pit or denting in, whether the same be of length or bredth, the fleshe soft in féeling, and long comely heares on the head: yet little and small heares on the breast, belly, hands, and féete, through hir cold complexion: and of the same weaker of strength and courage, and lesse bolde through hir narrow breast which shée hath, yet coupled she is to man to yéelde (by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents)

vices, and luxurie: but this luxurie, doth the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher here meane to be the immoderate appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of the thankfull matter, in causing euil works vnto others hurt and lesse, and not of the coeating alone: in that coldnesse, is a contrarie vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lust: seing the lust is caused, of hotenesse and moyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For the wanne, and yellow colour, doth here rather argue coldnesse. Further, the wanne colour, is the way &amp; beginning of the mortifying of natural heate, and extinction of the same: by which reason appeareth, that the wanne colour doth no otherwise differ from the black, but as to the remission of the mortifying. And by thys wanne colour, is to be vnderstanded the leadie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The learned <hi>Auicen</hi> wryteth, that the whytenesse of colour is a note of the depriuing of bloude, or the scarcitie of it with a coldnesse, for if this colour should procéede of a whotnesse, and that with the Cholerick humour, then shoulde it tende vnto a cytrinesse. Further <hi>Auicen</hi> writeth, that the ruddie colour, doth signifie the plentie of bloude: the red and somewhat red colour, doth declare the hotenesse of qualitie: yet more doth the somewhat red colour, declare the red choller: and the red colour, the sanguine choller. Here further is to be noted, that the colour somewhat red, doth signifie the depriuing of bloud: although there appeareth not the red choller, as the lyke
<pb facs="tcp:4287:33"/>
hapneth in the helthfull bodies. But a very swart colour, as betwéene the black and yellow appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, doth rather signifie coldenesse, throughe which, the bloud then is deminished &amp; congealed: and that little so congealed, is through the same turned into a blacknesse, which chaungeth the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the skinne. And this we name a wanne or yellow colour, according to the intensine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missiue dominion. The honie colour, signifieth a coldnesse and drienesse: for as much as the colour is the same which insueth a pure blacke choller. So that the whytenesse of colour, foloweth the condition of flewme, and qualitie of the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: but the gréenenesse of colour doth rather argue the bloud congealed, which then tendeth to a blacknesse: so that the same commixed to the flewme, is made gréene: yet doth the whytishe graye colour, rather signifie a flewmatick cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, mixed with a little red choller. And after the opinion of many Phisitions, the colour is for the more part chaunged, through the lyuer: vnto a reddishnesse and whytenesse: and through the milt, into a swartnesse. Further <hi>Auicen</hi> writeth, that the swart yellow colour, doth argue the redde choller: but the darck browne colour, doth signifie the black choller. And the like in (a maner to this) affirmeth <hi>Auerrois,</hi> which wryteth that in an equall climate, the swart yellow colour,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4287:33"/>
doth declare that the redde choller, to gouerne the chollerick: but the darcke browne colour doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie in the same climate, the dominion of the blacke choller. <hi>Auicen</hi> also wryteth, that the body commeth red, through the dominion of bloud, and whyte in colour (as the Iuorie) of the flewmatick humour. Besides these, the complexion hauing a mixte colour, both of the whyte and red, is after the estimation, a meane temperated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rasis</hi> also reporteth, that the qualitie of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die through the colour, and habitude of the same: of the féeling and operations, and of the matters yssuing from the bodie, is so knowne. For the whyte and swartishe colour, and of a whyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and graynesse mixed: and the wanne and leadie colour, doe innuate a colde complexion: But the red, reddish, the high red, and bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ake red, all these demonstrate a hotenesse of complexion: and if a cléerenesse and thinnesse be conioyned to the colour: the cléerenesse and thinnesse of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, are then declared. But if a troublednesse and grosenesse be mixed to it, the grosenesse of humours is then signified. The whyte colour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to which a rednesse, with the thinnesse and cléerenesse is admixed, doth demonstrate an equallitie of the complexion. That if a rednesse shall abounde, and the cléerenesse shall be lesser, the dominion of bloud is there signified. But if the
<pb facs="tcp:4287:34"/>
rednesse shall so muche be diminished, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth to the colour of yuorie, doth innuate the paucitie of bloude. Which if the same shall yet be more diminished, in such maner, that of the same appeareth in a maner nothing at all, the darke wanne colour procéedeth: which portendeth the paucitie both of choller and bloud, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of flewme in that body. But if this colour approcheth to a whytenesse, to which a gréene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is admixed, then insueth the same, which of the Phisitions is named a leadie colour: which declareth a diminution of the bloud and red chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and indicateth the dominion of the black chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and flewme. The swartish colour, if the same shall approch to a rednesse, or that to it this admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth demonstrate a grosse bloud to beare sway, according to the quantitie, which to it is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or if a rednesse to it be admixed. And the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour perfitely swartishe, which is approched to a gréenesse, doth declare the dominion of the black choller. But bodies coloured with a redde cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which is found to drawe néerer to a whyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are of a colde complexion. If the colour, shall appéere néerer to a gréenenesse or gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, shall be of a hote complexion. But the other are cytrine bodies, which to a whitenesse pertake a néere subtilnesse: which colour in the helthfull, or in whome the multitude of bloude consisteth,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:34"/>
and not for the dominion of choller. So that these bodies are not cytrine, but accydentally or by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydence. Yet the other bodies perfitly cytrine, are somewhat cléere, which like perseuer at any time. And these are, chollericke bodies. There are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides of these certayne, which with a cytrinesse, approch to a gréenenesse and swartish colour, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking a small fayrenesse: in which either choller beareth swaye: whose complexion is prooued and knowne to be worser than all others. The Lyuer and Mylt, hauing the like qualitie and condition, are for the more part diseased: and the health of these bodies, is not firme, nor permanent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynuing. But the bodies hauing a darcke colour, which are néerer to a cytrynesse, are of a hote complexion: and néere to the redde choller.

<pb facs="tcp:4287:38"/>
matter is applyed, as well vnto a necessitie, as vnto the reason of a helpe and succour. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie it was that the heares should be, both for the moysture of the braine, and seames of the scull: for where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most quantitie of humours and heate is, there of necessity must y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great plenty of heares growe, for the reason &amp; cause of a defence, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daylie increasing &amp; growing of the heares, couering the head, may so defende and succour it from the extreme colde, and mightie heate. Seing mans brayne in proportion, is greatest and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stest, for that cause it néedeth especiallye a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Isydore</hi> reporteth, that the heares of the heade were ordayned of nature, to couer and beséeme the head: &amp; that these might so defende the braine from the colde, and heate of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albertus in lib. de animalibus. cap. 3.</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the heares procéede of the grosser va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours issuing by the poores of the skinne of the heade, sent forth by heate, through the narrowe holes of the skinne, which dryed and hardned in the comming forth, through the outward colde of the ayre. And the heares of the head which slowly increase (through the lacke of bloud) is a note, that the complexion to be verye moyst. That if these spéedily increase, is a note that the body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyneth vnto a drynesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4287:38"/>But to come to the matter, the heares of the head doe naturally declare, the qualities &amp; quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humours, and the conditions of the spirite or minde.</p>
               <p>The Phylosopher also (in. 5. <hi>de generatione animalium, cap. 3.</hi>) vttereth, that the cause of the bignesse and smalnesse of the heares of the head, is most chiefely caused, and growe out of the skin, and not out of the flesh: when the humour in them is euaporated, and breatheth forth: seing we sée that the grosse heares doe spring out of a thick and grosse skinne, and the small heares out of a thinne and soft skinne, these hytherto <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that when hotenesse and drinesse be conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the heares of the head doe much sooner grow, &amp; waxe many &amp; thick. For as much, as the much quantity, signifieth a hotenesse: and the bignesse of them, a much fumositie. And for that cause in yong men, there is a more quantitie, than in children: for as much, as the matter of children is vaperous, and not humerous. And the contraries of these, doe folow their contraries. Further, the signification by the part of the figure, is that the crispednesse declareth a hotenesse, and drinesse: for the same is caused, when it findeth a tortuousnesse both of the holes and powers: but this doubt is not here resolued, when as the complexion is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, although the two first matters be chaunged.
<pb facs="tcp:4287:39"/>
The playnnesse and flat lying of the heares of the head doth signifie a contrarie, that is, coldnesse and moystnesse, as euidently appeareth. As touching the part of the colour, the blacknesse signifieth a hotenesse: which blacknesse is here ment like to the cléere horne: with a roughnesse, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tortuous. The whitishnesse signifieth a cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: but the citrinnesse and rednesse, signifieth an equalitie: and the whitishnesse doth eyther ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a vehement coldenesse, as the horinesse: or a strong and mightie drinesse, which like hapneth in the vegetalles, when they are dried: which from their blacknesse, or gréenesse, passe into a whyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and this like hapneth not to men, but in the ende of drying sicknesses. <hi>Auerroys (quarto col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligit capitulo)</hi> of the notes of the complexion of the whole bodye reporteth, that the signification of the colour of the heares of the head, is not veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (for the more part) but in temperate climates: although in euery climate, may be somewhat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, in comparing the men of that climate dwelling there vnder. As for example in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes and Moores, of which the Moores are black, and their heares are crisped, with an vttermost tortuousnesse: yet not for this, is their complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hote, but rather these notes ought to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the outwarde heate, seing they are knowne rather to be colde, through the heate va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4287:39"/>
But the Germanes, Wendenland peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and those which dwell in the colde countries, are white of body, their heares yellow and plaine: yet not for this, is it generally to be sayde, that they be colde: but rather that their complexion is very hote, in that the heate is included in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde partes of their bodies: as the like hapneth, in the winter time. <hi>Gallen</hi> vttreth, that the white heares of the head, doe declare a cold complexion: and the quality of a deminished coldnesse, hath the heares of the heade yellow to Gold: and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of a diminished hotnesse, hath the heares of the heade redde in colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auerroys</hi> wryteth, that in whome coldnesse is lesser than hotnesse, hath golden or yellow heares on the heade, in that the yellownesse, doth signifie the complextion of a diminished coldenesse. And the rednesse of heares on the head, doe declare a complextion of lesser hotenesse, than is the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie hauing black heares: and this (for a truth) is true, in that the rednesse is néere, and a neighbour vnto blacknesse: &amp; like the yellownesse, and whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The golden colour of the heares, hath an equall and temperate qualitie, of the yellow, and red, mixt and compound togyther, these hytherto <hi>Auerroys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ayres and Countries, haue an operation, in the cause of the heares of the heade, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
<pb facs="tcp:4287:40"/>
is to be obserued and noted: seing it is not to be doubted at, that so well in the blacke heares, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yellow, is the equality of a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion declared: here we apply <hi>Iupiter,</hi> seing it hath an ayreall nature. Nor in the heares of the <hi>Illirian,</hi> the blacknesse, which of his qualitie, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a hotenesse, when as their kinde hath the same.</p>
               <p>The ages also doe worke, in the matter of the heares of the head: for that yong men, be like to the Meridionals, children like to the Septentrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals: and olde age, as a meane betwéene both.</p>
               <p>The heares of the heade much in a childe, doe argue that his qualitie (as he groweth) turneth into the Melancholie: and in an old man the like, signifieth that he is presently Melancholick.</p>
               <p>By these we vnderstand, that the heares of the head lying playne, doe denote a coldnesse of the braine, especially when they are soft in the féeling: for these doe then declare a fearefulnesse, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimitie: applyed to the Indians, and shéepe: for as much as this is a moyst complexion, as the learned <hi>Albertus</hi> vttereth.</p>
               <p>Those which haue the heares of the heade so much crisped, that these be in condition like to the dried Pepper, as the Indians are: which dwell vnder such hote places, that doe make blacke and crisped the heares so much, euen like to the dried

For such which dwell in those Countries, become olde at. xxx. yeares, and their heartes are fearsfull, and weake of courage: which well declareth that the kindes in them, be much resolued:</p>
               <p>The bodies dwelling in hote Countries, are lighter than others: as the same wytnesseth <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle in Methaphoricis:</hi> where he putteth a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Countries, in Phisiognomating.</p>

For which cause (in Phisiognomating) it behoueth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider many matters, and notes.</p>
               <p>The colour of the heares of the head yellowish, like to honny: doe declare the dominion of cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, through the heate couered in the moysture as the like are in children: yet the persons dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:4287:41"/>
Northerly, haue the like condition, through the region: which much beguileth in Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating vpon the like subiect. And such persons to <hi>Venus</hi> are attributed, so that the same be eyther of nature or by Arte. The heares of the heade grosse and black are applyed to <hi>Saturne:</hi> yet is not the same to be like considered of them, as of the Spaniards: for this declareth them to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, to the earthly, and shadowye moysture.</p>
               <p>The heares verie blacke and rough, and not plaine lying, doe signifie a hotnesse in that person: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> white heares, doe indicate a cold complexion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ionnitius in hysagogis</hi> vttereth, that there are foure maner of colours of the heares of the head: that is to say, the black, the red, the gray or flax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and the hoarie. The black colour procéedeth through the great &amp; much quantitie of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led choller: or by the much combustion of the bloude: but the red colour, through the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heate, not adust: of which the heares are alwaies caused red: the flaxine colour, procéedeth of the aboundance of Melancholie: but the hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie white, is caused of the ouermuch lack of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate, and through the effect of rotten flewme: &amp; this for the most part is caused in olde persons. And these somtimes declare, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> veneral conditions.</p>
               <p>The colour of the heares, like to the cléere horne, are attributed to the nature of <hi>Mars:</hi> So that the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4287:41"/>
heares be not grosse, but somewhat small, and this through the subtilnesse of the humours. And that they also be black through an intensed heate which like appeareth in the bred baked on coles, from which the moysture flyeth, so that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> long lying on coales the same is made black. When in the other partes of the bodie, there is an ouer much hearinesse séene, there doe the starres of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> worke their vertue, and suche are noted to be robbers, or lurckers by the highe waye, especially when the eye browes be verye thicke, ioyning ouer the nose, and that the eie liddes be hearie: but when the breast shall be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearie, doth declare a hote, and stoute person.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The whole bodie couered with heare, both thicke and rough: doth denote such a person to be of a more brutish will and nature, than manly.
<pb facs="tcp:4287:42"/>
When the nape of the neck from the heade, shall be hearie: doth denote that person to be strong, and couragious: and such, applied to the Lion.</p>
               <p>When the Phisiognomer, (by anye oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation procured) came either to Princes courtes, or Noble mens houses, would at the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, and thorowly consider on euery syde, the Officers, and seruauntes about the Prince, or Lorde: but especially, their faces. As touching these, did on a time (at request mooued) vew and earnestly marke the faces both of the Officers, and other seruaunts, continually attendant on the person, of a noble Prince, named <hi>Astorgius Fauentnus:</hi> but among these, hée especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the Secretarie of this prince, whose perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and forme, was on this wise. This Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie (by report of the Phisiognomer) was small of stature, in bodye slender; the colour of skinne and face wanne, a little necke &amp; somewhat short, <hi>Mercuries</hi> line in the forheade, conditioned in a retrograde maner, the other positures of the face and bodie, in a maner aunswerable to the figure here demonstrated: as touching the iesture of body, he went vpright, making short paces, and troade very fast on the grounde. And the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer in further considering the others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Noble man, perceyued sundrie of them to be both subtill, and craftie deceiuers: through
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4287:42"/>
which their Lorde by them, he throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, to be greatly abused and indamaged: but specially through the occasion and meanes, of that notable deceyuer (the Secretarie) aboue described. All which the Phisiognomer well wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did (by a similitude, framed to the Prince) vtter these wordes: that he as an Angelicall rose, was in a maner suffocated and choked by the wicked thornes daily conuersant about him.</p>

               <p>Thus by manye outwarde signes, maye a man finde out the qualities of the minde and courage.

Phisiognomer) mans apparell: and would vpon a brauerye manye times, arme hir selfe at all poynts to iust, and runne sundrie times so armed at the ring. The forme of which woman (by the earnest vew of the Phisiognomer) was on this wise: shée had a small heade, and Pineapple like, a necke comely formed, large breasted, séemelye armes, aunswering to the body: but in hir other partes, as in the hippes, buttockes, thighes, and legges, nere agréeing to mans. This manlye woman also walked vpright in bodie, treading light on the grounde, and bearing hir head play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like to the Hart. The other notes of this woman, did the Phisiognomer for breuitie sake here omitte. Yet he thus concluded, that by the sundrie notes, which he vewed, shée was prone, to come to a violent death.</p>

The Phisiognomer also reporteth, that manye
<pb facs="tcp:4287:44"/>
women like delighted to garnishe and decke vp themselues, carrie the heade after the maner of the Hart, with the eies rolling, and turning here and there: still turning the head, one whils on the right side, an other whiles on the left, yea vpwarde and downewarde: which argueth an especiall vnstablenesse, and an vnsatiable luxury in that creature. In so much that if they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely possesse or haue these, then suche be for the more part <hi>ercmeriti:</hi> and of experience (sayth the Phisiognomer) doe I report this.</p>
               <p>Where sundrie men are named to be Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynate, is vnderstanded and ment two wayes: the one, when as such be delighted to go in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and decked with ornaments like to women: the other, to appéere laciuious, and weake both of will, and courage. The qualitie of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently declareth, that the minde (for the more part) doth like ensue and aunswere, to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bodie. For such be noted of experience to be vnfaythfull, and euill reporters, and lyars, in that they thus through their counterfayting, aunswere in partes, to the kinde fraudelent and wylie.</p>
               <p>Further, the youthfull delightes in men, is séene vnto twentie yeares, or néere vpon: for that the naturall heate, is all that time couered, and hinde of the moysture. The knowledge of which,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4287:44"/>
is well discerned, through their members then being soft: that suffer in a maner as the women.</p>
               <p>The wearing of heauie garments customably doth perfitly argue a heauie braine: but the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments light, doe witnesse, a light braine: which rule and note, much furthereth the person min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Phisiognomate on any subiect.</p>
               <p>The heares of the heade, blackish in colour, if they be meanely thinne, (as writeth <hi>Palemon</hi>) and the like <hi>Albertus, Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Consilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore:</hi> doe then denote honest condicions, and both a good disposition, iudgement, and nature in that person.</p>
               <p>The heares of the head yellowish and meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinne, doe denote that the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> to beare sway, in the qualities and nature of that person, after the minde of the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which I thereto agrée.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Consiliatore</hi> writeth, that he which hath the heares of the heade, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes of the body standing vpright is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by iudgement fearefull: for that such persons in great feare appeare the like: which for that applyed to the condition of the passion. A lyke reason of the same vttereth <hi>Albertus,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that the windie moysture, is cause of such an vprightnesse and staring of the heares.

                  <pb facs="tcp:4287:49"/>That heade is commended, which in bignesse is a meane, hauing a comly roundenesse: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent eminencie both behind, &amp; afore: &amp; hath from both the eares a little flatnesse: this <hi>Almansor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that mans heade (among all other beastes) hath proportionally much braynes. The males (of knowledge vttered) haue more braines, than the females: although the effect may sometimes shew a contrarie to this. But of these which are seldome caused, or rather by accidence, is neyther Arte, nor science vttered. Mans heade (of the diligent search) is knowne to haue more ioyntes, than all other beastes. The man also is founde to haue more ioyntes, than the woman. The heade of a comely and due forme, is fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned lyke a hammer, in which the fore and hinder part beare out: for otherwise can this not make a due direction and gouernement: the reason of which is, for that the ventricles haue a due forme to receyue the quantities of spirites in euery place: as that the forepart to imagine and iudge, the hinder especiallye to remember. But the midle ventricle, when the forme of it is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compressed and flatted, then is the bethincking part so much the nobler, and worthyer: for that in the same small place, is the best vnitie, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the congruent, from the incongruent, of the obiect consisting in the forepart. When
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4287:49"/>
the forme of the heade afore is depressed, and den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, then faileth the iudgement of the creature: when the hinder part lacketh in the emmencie, or is depressed, then lyke fayleth the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. There consisteth also a weakenesse in moouing of the sinewes, and by the consequent of the whole bodye: in that by the strength of the braine, is the strength like vttered of the necke, and sinewes. And as the largenesse of the shoulderpoynts, euen so of the breste, stanckes, and bones. <hi>Consiliator</hi> writeth, that the heade of a seemely forme and maner, doth encrease both sense, and vertue: and denoteth in that person both magnificencie, and a grauitie of witte. The head small &amp; not in due proportion formed, doth argue the contrarie to these afore. So that when the heade shall be great, then will the braine be like bigge: in that the braine is the beginner and worker of all the senses. Againe, if the heade be great, then are the senses many: &amp; <hi>econtra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To haue a most bigge heade (as <hi>Tarreus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) and that in due forme: doth denote a comly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of manners, and good conditions in that person.</p>
               <p>The heade great, with a diuers forme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, and the sinewes small, with a comely forme of the necke: notwithstanding small, and the bones small: is a note of an euill composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>Such hauing a bigge head without due forme (are for the more part) Nidiots and fooles, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to learne, or to be taught: which signe and note is accidentally gathered of the Asse, hauing a big head.

               <p>The heade bigge, and the necke small, is an euill signe: for that the vertue forming, lacketh in that creature, and the matter also is inobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: of which ensueth a simplysitie of witte, and the lacke of discretion, in that person.</p>
               <p>The heade great, proportioned agréeablye to the bodye, or rather to the necke, so that the necke be strong and meanely bigge, with strong and bigge sinewes: not without good reason, and deserte, is the same laudable and comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.</p>

The forme of this man, as the Phisiognomer, did diligentlye note him, was after this maner: he had a sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall or very rounde heade, a narrow forehead, slender necke, thinne and narrowe shoulder pointes, loynes, and hippes, with the other parts, of the bodye weake and ill formed, and to these the breast narrow, and <hi>Marses</hi> line in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade weake, and euill fashioned: sundrie other

               <p>The heade small must of necessitie be euill, in that such a person lightly falleth sicke, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the braine little, with a straightnesse or narrownesse of the ventricles: in which, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites drawne narrow, are so letted, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not orderly worke a due vse and effect: and these pressed togither are in such maner inflamed, and choked, that they neyther maye duelye imagine, dispose, nor remember. So that such persons like formed, are knowne to be fearefull, yea, irefull, and retayning ire long: through the intensed drienesse of the braine, and the distempered heate.

               <p>The length of the foreheade is vnderstanded and ment, after the breadth of the bodye, which way the hearie sinewes are séene to stretch and runne. As the like maner and forme, manye of the best learned, the Phisiognomer obserued to haue. And at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> he behelde the ymage of that learned <hi>Dante,</hi> who had the like forme. Here note, that a man must consider all other partes, with the condicioned forme of the heade, and the agréement of the countinaunce or face, for otherwise is not this verified and true.</p>
               <p>By the rounde foreheade, shall you conceyue &amp; vnderstand a certaine sphericall or very round eminencie, &amp; bearing outwards: such a forme of necessity, must be graunted to lacke in the length of the foreheade. The cause of this is, for that the spirites in the same emptie place, are reuerbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inflamed, and that the inflamation long continueth: Which reason and saying is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, when such haue a shorte necke and chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:55"/>
in that the inflamation of bloude is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caused and abiding.</p>
               <p>The forhead is an vtterer of heauinesse, mirth, clemencie, and crueltie: of which the prouerbe ariseth, that the flattering person, sheweth a smooth and smiling foreheade: the irefull man a gathered, knitting, and clowdie forehead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth, the forhead to be the seate or place of modestie, and honour: and the same for the néerenesse of the imaginatiue vertue, which with the common sence in the foreparte of the braine, is placed as principall of the heade, by force of whose vertue, either heauinesse or mirth, comelinesse or vncomelinesse, are sodenly caried vnto the iudgement of reason, &amp; by the same iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Of this we name such to haue a shamelesse and brasen forehead, which put away or set aside all bashfulnesse and shame.</p>
               <p>The foreheade through the discending of all the sinewes from the brayne, to performe the sence, is as it were a certaine tower &amp; fortresse, vnto whose hollownesse doe the fiue sensitiue si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes concurre of the outwarde sences, through whose helpe, from all the obiectes of the sences, at the seate of reason, is iudgement caused.</p>
               <p>The skinne of the foreheade, which with a certaine musculous, and thinne substaunce fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it, is vnited or ioyned togither: that the

inner partes of the hands, and soales of the féete, with the tendons, doe agrée and worke togither.</p>
               <p>The foreheade, distinguished or deuided of the bones, lying vnder the vtter skinne, doth onely consist of two mouable skinnes: and briefly, the whole is lose in it selfe: and of the same, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly mooued, by a voluntarie motion.</p>
               <p>The skinne of the foreheade, doth mooue togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the eie liddes, by certaine muscles and sinewes: at the opening, and shutting togither of the eyes.</p>
               <p>The musculous thickenesse, lying vnder the skinne of the foreheade, by which the eye browes are drawne vp, and the motion of the foreheade caused, hath his hearie fastnings tending downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde: which cut ouertwhart, by an vnskilfull Chirurgian, doth after cause, that the whole skin of the foreheade, doth slyde or fall downe to the eyes.</p>
               <p>The plaine and euen forheade without anye wrincles, is the same which doth beare or bosse nothing outwardes: but contayneth or hath a certayne euennesse thorow out. And suche per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are noted (of the Phisiognomer) to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and full of variances: the reason is, for that the same signifieth a grosse skinne of the foreheade, and of the consequent, a like witte: and the hardenesse of flesh, which cannot be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:56"/>
of which the rudenesse of vnderstanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth, through the Organ not due proportioned. And such also be hote and drye persons, which is the cause of the tention of the foreheade: so that through the paucitie of vnderstanding, they be caused brawlers and contentious.</p>
               <p>In all matters, is their a certaine outwarde note, by which we finde those that are not answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the eyes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, the inward notes not séene. Of this appereth that the nature of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per matter hath his, and Philosophie naturall hath his, which it skilfully noteth.</p>
               <p>The person that hath a bigge foreheade, is slow, and dull witted, compared vnto the Oxe, in that the Oxe is a slowe beast, which hath a bigge foreheade. But the foreheade small, doth denote an vnstable person.</p>
               <p>The foreheade large, doth indicate such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be inclined often to chaunge both minde and purpose: but if the foreheade be very large, then such a person (for the more parte) is noted to be a foole, of small discretion, and dull witted: as both <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Auicen</hi> write. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade to be large (after the agréement of writers) is ment to be formed with a due quantitie, both in the length, and breadth.</p>
               <p>The foreheade rounde and fleshie, doth argue such a person to be irefull: if the same especially
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4287:56"/>
be bearing or bossing out, and with this lacking discretion, dull and slowe: who of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, aptly applyed to the Asse.</p>
               <p>The forehead ouermuch standing forth, that the same séemeth bossed out in the middle: doth signifie the excesse of choller, and such (for the more parte) are disposed and inclyned vnto the Chollericke and hastye passions: as vnto the fransinesse, and furious hastinesse. A like to this that if the foreheade hath (as it were) a proper bearing forth, or knobbe bossing out, and certaine dentings in, or little furrowes to be séene: doth (by practise of the Phisiognomer) signifie such a person to be rashe, wylie, and false of promise: yea, this like (by the reporte of <hi>Adamantius</hi>) doth denote sometimes foolishnesse, and fransinesse or madnesse in that creature: so that the other signes and notes of the partes, aunswere and agrée.</p>
               <p>The foreheade little and narrowe, doth indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate such a person to be foolish, and a small likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode in him to be taught, or to conceyue anye learning to purpose: yea nastie, sluggish, and a gluttinous féeder: applyed for these to the grun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sowe. But the foreheade small, that is thinne of skinne, and very narrowe, in a swarte person: doth denote him to be lasciuious, soone mooued to ire, ouer liberall, séeking desirouslye

               <p>The foreheade very great, rounde in forme (by the bearing out) and bare of heare: doth not only argue (by the agréement of all writers) such a person to be hardie, and stoute, of will hardlye to be brideled, but a dissembler and lyare: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if the other partes aunswere.</p>

               <p>The foreheade narrow, to be foolishe: and the same long in forme, vnapt to learne. This high swolen or bolned out, and rounde: to be a decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner subtill, and wilye. The foreheade wrineled, to haue déepe cogitations, and burdened with cares. The same rounde in the bossing out, to be not onely enuious, but craftie. The foreheade large (after breadth) doth denote suche a person, not onelye honest condicioned, but frée of expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and liberall in giftes: as <hi>Loxius, Philemon, Palemon,</hi> and sundrie other writers reporte.</p>
               <p>Certaine reporte, and rightly in the same, that the foreheade ouermuch wrincled, doth argue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamefastnesse in that persone: the reason is, when the vertue apprehensiue and conceyuing is weakened, the same then cannot orderly discerne the congruent, from the incongruent: of which insueth those that are wrought without shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse. The cause of this is, in that the forepart of the braine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is very moyst, and of the ouer much
<pb facs="tcp:4287:61"/>
moysture is this great wrinckling caused of the forheade.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Yet note, that the wrinckling of the foreheade may like be procured of two causes, as of drinesse and moysture: sauing the difference is, that the same which procéedeth of drinesse, doth not occupy the whole foreheade: so that this signifieth ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in that creature: and anger in the other person of a moyster qualitie. The reason is, for that the person discerneth not the same, which causeth and retayneth both the ire, and hatred, without due cause: and suche also are knowne (for the more part) to be full of variaunces, and strife, yea couetous, and euill tongued. Oh how many vaine Phisitians be there (sayth the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomer)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4287:61"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Conciliatour</hi> thus writeth, that the person
<pb facs="tcp:4287:62"/>
which hath an euen stretched, and smoth forhead, with a certaine shining in the same, is denoted to be not onely a flatterer, but deceytfull, so that hardly to be trusted. And manye like were the <hi>Bononians</hi> which <hi>Conciliatore</hi> obserued and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his time. The cause of this tention and euennesse of the foreheade, doth the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer suppose to procéede, through the chollericke qualitie, for that by his drinesse the skinne stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth out plaine: but the cléerenesse or shining, doth denote the subtilenesse of skinne, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: and by the consequent, of the spirites: so that the like foreheade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth argue a readie wit: but such be fayre spoken, vsing myrth and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wordes, to the ende of purchasing somewhat: for which cause aptly named worldly flatterers, and deceitfull through the moouing of the spirits.</p>
               <p>Such hauing wrincles playted or gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, in the foreheade right vp retching, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vnto the angle of the nostrelles: are denoted to be persons full of care, and déepe thoughtes, bethinking waightie &amp; serious matters, through the sadde humoure melancholie.</p>

The same skill when he desired of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iew (by earnest suite to learne) he vtterly refused, and denied this request of his: so that forced hée was to vse sundrie que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and disputations with him: by which at the length he perceiued and founde, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was wholy ignoraunt of phisiognomy, so well Metaphoricall, as of the members, and planets: sauing onely by certaine lynes, which at the last through his industrie and labour conceyued.

               <p>Of which the first, and neathermost towards the nose, is named <hi>Mercuries</hi> line, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth the first age: for that in such an age and time, all persons then be aptest to conceyue and attaine both learning, sciences, &amp; handie craftes: yea, this is named of most men, the floorishing age, although the same somewhat wanton, and vnconstant.</p>
               <p>The seconde line vpwarde (named <hi>Iupiters</hi>) representeth the second age, which the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer nameth, the time of veneration, and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for that in the same age are the large
<pb facs="tcp:4287:66"/>
showe of decent condicions, &amp; liberallitie vttered: yea both the stabilitie in religion, &amp; discretions in men, and their laudable actions. Further, where vertues are embraced, vices left and detested. Where also is (in men) a fruitefull and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable witte vttered: where besides is the mother of honestie indicated: all which by <hi>Iupiters</hi> lyne are (after the agréement of sundrie writers) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, and expressed.</p>
               <p>The thirde line (after the minde of the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomer) representeth a thirde age: which of all men is knowne, to be the time of sadnesse, and couetousnesse: yea the wearing out of pleasurs, and the ende of naturall life. If this line be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, the same then doth indicate an increase by husbandry, lande, howses, and all such matters which appertaine vnto the office of olde age: so that to such a thyrde lyne, are all these agréeable, which are attributed to <hi>Saturne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some perhaps will argue and say to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer, that this is the age of deuotion: to which I thus aunswere, that olde men, in verye déede be then more inclined and bent to serue God séeing that age is then dissolued, and become impotent vnto the wanton pleasure, &amp; luxuries: through which these are the more prone, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vnto prayer, and the faythfull seruing of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>So that in the same place, where this line is broken, there the infortune is: as eyther sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, impouerishment, or any other hinderance.</p>
               <p>If the two neather lynes (next the nose) be whole, and that these, forme as it were an angle and cone aboue: doe then denote (as the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomer hath many times experienced) that such persons to haue a notable fortune vnto the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and purchasing both of riches, and promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Although few such there be, which possesse and enioye the lyke note.</p>
               <p>Further, the sayde two neather lines, vnder the thrée principall, are thus applyed: that is, the right line vnto the planet <hi>Saturne,</hi> and the left line, vnto the <hi>Moone.</hi> The right line also is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the father, but the left line to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>But when the sayde two lines, doe retch and méete into the forme of a triangle, and that there appéereth an ouerthwart line stretched and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing aboue the nose: yet in such maner, that the same formeth not with the others, a perfite try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle:
<pb facs="tcp:4287:67"/>
doth then denote a competent fortune vnto suche a person, and this according to the strength of the lynes there séene. For where these lines are broken of, lacking, or crooked: there they wytnesse and signifie the infortune to succéede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The Philosopher <hi>Ptholomeus paruus</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that if one lyne, reacheth along the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as from the right side vnto the left, doth then promise such a person (after nature) to liue thrée score yeres.</p>
               <p>If two lynes shall the lyke stretch a long the foreheade: doe then promise such a person to lyue vnto the age of thrée score and ten yeres.</p>
               <p>If thrée lynes the lyke, then vnto foure score yeares.</p>
               <p>If fower lynes the lyke stretched a long the foreheade, doe then signifie foure score and ten yeres. And if fiue lynes the lyke stretched a long, doe then declare a hundred yeres: as the learned <hi>Ptholomeus</hi> wryteth.</p>
               <p>If the thrée lynes aboue described, are crossed of other lynes, doe then denote hatred, troubles, and persecutions, for the more part.</p>
               <p>If the sayde crossings of the lynes, shall make

an angle, and that one lyne be bigger then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: in such maner that the same stretcheth ouer the angle aboue the nose: doth then signifie that such a person hath enimies, but they shall not greatly harme him. But further of this forme, of the angle crossed, maye a man learne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, in any worke of Paulmestrie: that vttereth matter of the quadrangle of the hande: as touching friends and enimyes: And euen the same is wytnessed, by the signes of the forehead.</p>
               <p>If neyther angle, crosse, or ouerthwart lyne, shall appeare on the forehead, doth then signifie a luckie continuaunce and glorie in workes, and a most happie estate, vnto the ende of lyfe.</p>
               <p>The sharpe crossing of lynes, to the maner and forme of a pinnacle: doth then demonstrate both housholde, and familiar enimies, or enimies of the owne kindred: as <hi>Morbeth</hi> the Cardinall wryteth.</p>
               <p>If any two lynes of the forhead, are néere ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning togither, in any part: doe then demonstrate discorde, and contention, with many persons.</p>
               <p>The comlinesse and good proportion of the thrée princypall lynes of the forehead: doth denote a worthy fame, and singuler wyt, as sundrie Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors wryte, and the same affirmeth the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer.</p>
               <p>If many lynes are discerned in the foreheade,

then (so appearing) those are named the sisters of the three principall lynes: as wryteth the former <hi>Morbeth.</hi> If but one line only, is séene or doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péere in the forehead, then according to the maner and forme of the same, &amp; place where that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, with the age of the person, and dominion of the Planet, must a man like iudge.</p>
               <p>If no lyne at all shal appeare in the forhead: then by reason, no iudgement at all can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</p>
               <p>When in the breaking, those lynes appeare crooked in this maner, as the example here vnder of the one playner expresseth: doth then signifie the greater infortune to that person. As the lyke by obseruation was noted, in a certaine Italian, and sundrie others.</p>

               <p>THe learned Phylosopher named <hi>Nuncius naturae,</hi> writeth in the second booke (<hi>de par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus Animalium</hi>) that the ouerbroowes, and eie lyddes were ordayned for speciall helps to the face, as to ornate, and beséeme the same, with the auoyding of other inconueniences.</p>
               <p>The place of the ouerbroowes (as writeth <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>) is a part of the foreheade, and formed of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that seate, where the bones knit &amp; ioyne togither.

               </p>
               <p>The ouerbroowes (as reporteth <hi>Cocles</hi>) were appoynted by God and Nature, in the knitting and ioyning of the bones: for that in many olde persons they grow and waxe so long, that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, and for comelynesse sake, they must be clypped.</p>
               <p>The causes of the heares (as writeth the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) are noted to be fower: as the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the materiall, the formall, and finall. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cause of the heares, is procured two waies: the one is naturall heate, which eleuateth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from the moysture of the bodye, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or carieth them foorth vnto the skinny parts. The other is the colde ayre, which both thickneth and coagulateth those humours, and reduceth them into the forme of heares. The materiall cause, is two wayes, the first is farre off, and is the corporall moysture: the second cause is neere, and is the earthly vapour or humour, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaporated from the moysture. The formal cause, is the forme of the heares, as the length and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4287:70"/>
roundenesse of them. The finall cause, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of heares, as to the decking and beséeming of the bodie, like as are the heares of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broowes, of which out intent is to write fully and at large in this chapter.</p>
               <p>The ouerbroowes haue a hidde vertue, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the affections of the minde: of which this prouerbe that the person rayseth or lifteth vp the ouerbrowe: ment by the same, that such a one to be arrogant, and prowde. And suche appearing lyke, doth the learned <hi>Thaddaeus,</hi> rightly name hawty, and sowre of countinaunce.</p>
               <p>The right ouerbroowe is more raysed, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, than the left: in that all the partes throughe the cause of moouing, doe decline and leane, vnto the vpper sight. The right kidney in lyke maner is knowne to be higher placed, than is the left: as the abouesayde <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> writeth.</p>

Thys person, (to come to the matter) was figured, on thys wise: he was of a meane stature, leane and slender of body, &amp; proportioned in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> members and partes of the same.

The face was long, the nose meane, as the same protensed vnto the mouth, and chollerick of forme, the part vnder the nose foucated: the mouth small, the lyppes thinne, and the neather (as the same were down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) folded. The chinne extending to a sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or in a maner sharpe downeward, &amp; on the top foucated, and rounde, the bearde small and thinne.

His stature after nature, was rather vpright, than stouping or crooked: yet crookedly did this person walke by hymselfe, as one mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by the waye. His legges were slender, the féete small and fine, the héeles little and very flat:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4287:74"/>
he went verie séemely, and neate in apparell. The shoulder poyntes behinde, were somewhat bigge, and a little crooked. The handes fayre and comely, with the fingers long, and paulmes long. He was a person (by report of the Physiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) of fewe wordes, yet quick of spéeche: and his actions for the more part, were done with much expedition, through a passing wyt, great boldnesse and courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In as much as vnto the Physiognomy of the Planets, the Phisiognomer affirmeth, that the blacknesse of the heares of the heade, and thinnesse of them, and cryspidnesse, and quicknesse of spéeche, and motion of the body, and nose protensed and chollerick or hooked, these indicated that <hi>Marses</hi> vertue to beare swaye in him: for as much as in the respect of bodye, he had the breast large, and shoulder pointes bigge: which togither were a note of hotenesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that person. The thinnesse of the heares, signified a drynesse to be in him. His pase musingly, or as one full of thought, with the eye liddes drawne or gathered togither, and ouerbrowes ioyning, through the thicknesse of heares ouer the cone of the nose: the eyes hollow or déepe standing, and Peacockes pase. The eyes thus lowe situated did denote a Saturnine disposition in him: and thys especiallye the fewnesse of wordes, and hardnesse in vttering them. The longnesse of
<pb facs="tcp:4287:75"/>
face, with the chéekes like figured, as aboue vf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: the lippes thinne, and colour of the face wanne, indicated a Mercuriall disposition, the forhead especially square. The ouerbrowes arcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, the lippes small, the sharpnesse of chinne, and the Fossils of them: the decking or euen dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the heares, and fine apparelling of the whole bodye: fine féete, with the héeles small and flatte, indicated a veneriall disposition. The glys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering eyes and spottie, were by reason of the dryeth of the Animall spirites consisting in the brayne: For that the same fyrinesse and adustion procureth men (without the great grace of God) vnto theftes &amp; robberies. Saturne also increaseth drynesse in that person: of the Sunne, the Moone and <hi>Iupiter</hi> I wryte not, in that I remembred not the notes agréeable, at the wryting of this.</p>

               <p>The heares of the ouerbroowes thicke, and so long stretched out, that they séeme in a maner to shadowe the sight: doe denote in that person, the excesse of heate.

in the middle: the chéekes bonie, and somewhat flat: the mouth great, the lips thicke, and folded or turned outwarde: the téeth bigge: the chinne sharpe, and longe: the face long: the neck grosse, and shorte: small was the distaunce, betwéene the heart, and braine: by which appeareth, that the skill of the Anothomye, is very necessarie in this Arte. The shoulder poyntes were great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuated, with a largenesse of the breast: the part afore (named <hi>Methaphrenon</hi>) was eminent and fleshie, the <hi>Hipocondria</hi> great: the legges shorte and musculous: the armes long, and grose or bigge, the féete bigge, and articulated: the héeles great: the soales of the féete holowe: a swiftnesse in pace, and treading short.

                  <hi>ISydore</hi> writeth, that nature ordayned the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the eies, or eie liddes, to defende the eies from outwarde harmes: as from flyes, moths dust, strawes, and such like, that might otherwise fall into them. The eie liddes also be the couers, with which the eies are couered: and (of <hi>Isydore</hi> named) the eie liddes, in that these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath the Phisiognomer diligently gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither, the sayings of the learned <hi>Concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atore,</hi> and others, although but a fewe notes of them were to be founde.</p>
               <p>The eie liddes, which on the eie aproched nigh the angle, in the lacrimall part, if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The thinnesse of the heares, doth argue the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilnesse of matter, that is, of the humours, and the dominion of choller. Such are knowne to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, vicious &amp; wicked: yet consider diligently, all the other passions of choller. When that place shalbe fleshier, like to the Rites eien, then doth the same denote craftinesse, and an euill hotnesse, and
<pb facs="tcp:4287:83"/>
                  <figure/>
is also a chollericke foole. For which cause (sayth the Phisiognomer) beware of the chollericke, not regenerated of the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>The lacrymall or inner corner of the eie, when the same is little and narrowe: doth signifie a craftie person, as <hi>Auicen</hi> reporteth, <hi>primo de Animalibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vpper eie lidde bearing out, rather blowne vp: then full appearing, and somewhat declining ouer the eie: doth argue that person to be hawne and disdainfull.</p>
               <p>If the eie lyddes doe doeline downewards, full and very thicke, especially when they be couered with a rednesse: doth indicate such a person to be a ruinous and wastefull drunkarde. The reason is, for that these signifie a weakenesse of the eies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:4287:83"/>
and by the consequent, of the braine. So that
<figure/>
through such a weakelsesse, the like persons feare the drinking of wine. As the same, Phisiognomer obserued and noted in many, haunting tauernes, and such ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drinking Maulmesie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: of which one, the like was a certaine Countryman of his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an exceeding quarter and drinker of Wines.</p>
               <p>That if the neather eye lidde shall be small, a narrow drawne togyther, in such maner, that it couereth but the whyte of the eye: doth denote the body to be gouerned of a drinesse of humours. If this like hapneth in any cause; of verte sharpe passions vnlesse nature hath so wrought the same (as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> wytnesseth) doth then pronounte death at hande.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The auncient <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that when the heares of the eye liddes (so named of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them) doe crooke downewards, or be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally wrythed vnto one part: doe indicate such a person to be craftie, and a lyar.</p>
               <p>Why the liddes are placed on the eyes, doth <hi>Gulielmus Nurice</hi> thus define: that by them the condition and qualitie of the eyes, might the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and better be defended and preserued from the outwards matters: euen as the sheath; on a sworde: for that cause, such a person which hath a grosser or thicker eie lidde, doth further sée from him: for as much as these preserue the light of the eyes, from the outwarde heate, and cold. And of this, manye beastes sée further off, than men:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4287:84"/>
and this caused, through the grossenesse or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the eye liddes.</p>
               <p>The corners of the eyes, when they be dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, doe then argue a sicknesse or disease, of the eyes. And if these haue anye fleshie bearing out, doe denote dronkennesse: especially when the eies are bearing out, and the eye liddes be drye: as in many the like, the Physiognomer hath obserued and noted.</p>
               <p>The vpper eye liddes, couering the neather: doe argue (by the report of <hi>Conciliatore, Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and others) long lyfe.</p>
               <p>The corners of the eyes dylated and large, through the cause of a smyling eye: doth indicate a leacherous person: and this note, applyed (of the Philosopher) to <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The often beating, or panting of the eye lids, doth argue such a person to be feareful, and vexed often with a frensinesse: as <hi>Palemon, Loxius,</hi> and sundry others report.</p>
               <p>The eye liddes thinne (and in health) are best commended: For these declare, a lawdable minde, nighest approching to God, through an vpright behauiour.</p>

               <p>THe Phisiognomers confirme their sayings, by the signes and notes of the eyes: in that the notes which are discerned in the eyes, be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and vtterers of the affections of the heart.</p>
               <p>The eye is the instrumentall member of sight, whose qualitie is moyste, in a rounde forme figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with a certayne playnesse: and formed with seauen coates, and three humours, as wryteth the learned <hi>Sillanús (super nono Almansoris.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The passions of the minde, as trouble, mirth, loue, hatred, and such like: are especially decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and vttered by the eyes: after the agréement of all wryters.</p>
               <p>The especiall colours of the eyes, are knowne to be foure: as the black, whytishe, variable, and
<pb facs="tcp:4287:86"/>
gray: as the worthy <hi>Canamusalis (in libro ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, cap. tertio)</hi> reporteth, and the like <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suhalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rounde forme of the eyes, is better mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, perfiter, and vncorruptibler, through the lacking of corners: as al the learned agrée in the same.</p>
               <p>The cornered eyes, haue very often superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moysture standing in them: as wryteth the singular <hi>Constantine, in libro oculorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A perfite forme and condition of the eyes, doth denote an honest person: as wryteth <hi>Guli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmus Nurice, Conciliatore, Albertus</hi> &amp; others.</p>

               <p>The eyes bigge &amp; emynent, doe argue weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and a feeble courage: in that these be so cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4287:86"/>
bigge, through the much aboundance of moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the brayne: in which is coldnesse, that sheadeth a long by the members, and extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the bloud. So that such a brayne is colder, and moyster, than it ought to be: and in such a body should be the lack both of naturall bloude, and courage. And as the spirit and store of bloud, procureth boldnesse in men, euen so doth the cold and moyst qualitie, contrarie worke and cause fearefulnesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth that the eyes emynent &amp; bigge: doe argue such a creature to be fearefull: and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Hare, Cunny, and Frogge.</p>
               <p>The eyes outward extended, doe denote (after the minde of <hi>Rasis</hi>) such a person to be foolishe: but the eies déepe standing, doe denote such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be subtill, and of euill condicions, through the part of the wicked qualitie: yet such be of a good and sharpe sight, and sée further, than the emynent eyes doe: in that the visible spirite is more gathered in the déepe eyes, and the seing vertue stronger, yea the light is receiued in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantitie: as by experience is knowne in the Gunner, which minding to shoote strayt, winketh with the one eye: and like the Carpenter, in the laying of his lyne right: these hytherto <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys.</hi> But through the contrarie cause, such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the eyes emynent be weake of sight, and sée
<pb facs="tcp:4287:87"/>
nothing so farre off. The large eyes tending into a breeth of the bodye, like vnto the eyes of the Parthians, doe indicate the moysture of body, in that creature.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Such hauing the eies eleuated, and standing highe out, doe sée from them (as aboue vttered) but a little way: the cause is, in that when the eie is eminenter, it is then further distaunt from the braine: which is noted, the well spring of the eyes. So that through the farre distaunce from their spring, that is the braine, such eies are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to sée farre: where otherwise the eies stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding déepe, doe see sooner and further, yet such are noted to be of euill condicions. Further, conceiue that through the eminencie of the eies, diuers matters visible are represented: so that such in a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4287:87"/>
shorte time, can discerne and iudge matters. Such also are bablers wythout iudgement, through the forepart moyst: as afore vttered, of the forehead. And for that cause, are noted vnshamefast, and foolish: the selfe same (in a maner) doth the learned <hi>Asculanus</hi> (in his mother tongue) write in <hi>libro Cerbae,</hi> on this wise.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>By which he concludeth, that such are without dyscretion, through the small discourse, and pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cytie of vnderstanding. He also vttereth an other kinde in these, as the eies moouing fast and quick, whych are a note of hotenesse: and argueth ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, luxurie, and boldenesse: applyed to the Hawke, and Fawcon.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4287:88"/>The slow moouing of the eyes, is a note of cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and declareth sadnesse, and fearefulnesse in that creature. Such which with the eies, mooue the eie lids togither, are weake, &amp; of a feeble mind, as <hi>Palemon,</hi> wryteth. The eyes whych shut, and open togither: doe indicate a wicked &amp; trayterous person. If water shall stand in them, doth then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a studious person, and an earnest searcher of Arts: as writeth <hi>Aristotle, Albertus, &amp; Phylemo.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Conciliatore</hi> wryteth, when the eyes are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formally mooued, as that one whiles they runne, and an otherwhiles cease running (although by these as yet) no wicked facte or michiefe be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and done: in cogitation notwithstanding the minde is knowne, to be occupied with the like. And such generally, the Phisiognomer hath noted to be of wicked condicions: &amp; prone through such a conioyning to come to a violent or euill death. Yea such a lyke note, hath the Phisiognomer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obserued, in many robbers by the high waye.</p>
               <p>The Philosopher <hi>Ptholomie</hi> writeth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the eyes yellow (so that the same procéedeth of no sicknesse) doe signifie such a person to be a deceyuer, and cruell: as the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued and noted, in sundrie Bawdes, and Murderers. Further such a colour, doth indicate the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon of choller, wyth a most great adustion: of which occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cannot otherwise be caused, but the

               <figure/>
               <p>The eyes which swiftly mooue, with a sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sight, are noted théeues, vnfaythfull, and deceyuers: yea such a note, hath the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experienced, and iudged many, which after were hanged. Of these one the lyke, was the sonne of M. <hi>Iulianus de Pontremulo,</hi> brought vp, and frayned couragiouslye (from childe age) vnder a valyaunt and pollitike Captayne, named <hi>Francesco Rouerso:</hi> on whome he pronounced iudgement, in the yere of mans redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1492.

fréende of the Phisiognomers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as this <hi>Cocles</hi> hadde afore pronounced and iudged of the yolig man, euen so came it to passe (through the lacke of grace) that he was hanged, in the yeare of our Lorde. 1496.</p>
               <p>And this Physiognomer on an other, named <hi>Tadeus Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dottus,</hi> pronounced a lyke iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which also for theft (as he reporteth) was hanged, by sentence of the lawe. For these are well knowne to haue a subtill wyt, and the same proner or readier vnto the euill. The like confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that worthie <hi>Conciliatore,</hi> where he wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the eyes swiftly moouing, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sharpe of looke, are noted craftie, vnfayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Theeues: as of nature, these are vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The cause is, in that through the subtilnesse of wit, theft proceedeth, and the straunge decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. For the subtill wyt proceedeth, through the subtilnesse of humours, of which insueth the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of complexion, as aboue vttered. And the moouing, proceedeth through a hotnesse: so that when the hotnesse is great, then is the swiftnesse intensed.</p>
               <p>The looke fired, is not caused but of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, and fired thought, and of the often desire to deceaue. By which reason, for two causes, are the like in suche a subiect, that is, the moouing; which the intensed hotnesse signifieth: the other
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4287:89"/>
                  <figure/>
is, the sharpnesse of wyt, to the déepe cogitation and thought, to worke euill. The selfe same <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, where he wryteth, that whose eyes mooue fast, and be sharpe of looke, is a deceauer, craftie, and a théefe. Yet may here some argue, that Théeues are Melancholick: in that Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, procéedeth of a colde, and drye humour: for which cause, the contrarie of this is, as afore vttered. To the same, doth the Phisiognomer thus aunswere, that this is not alwayes certaine or true: in that there hath béene seene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (sayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles)</hi> that Martiall persons were Théeues, and robbers by the highe waye: and that those were founde Chollericke and Melancholick: as shall after appeare, in the Phisiognomie of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and great worke of Chyromancie (to come
<pb facs="tcp:4287:90"/>
forth) of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> yet maye it be, through the accydences of the minde, that these are caused Melancholike adust: which like, that the same is by accydence, the Phisiognomer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and knewe of experience, in sundrie Bawdes, common Dysars, and robbers by the highe way, which applyed their mindes &amp; wyttes in these.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The wanne and yellow colour, both some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indicate the complexion or qualitie of chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler adust: yet the same tending vnto Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If to a whytenesse, to which a gréenisse is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, heate inseweth, which of the Phisitions, is properly named a leadie colour, as wryteth <hi>Almansore, lib. secundo. capit. 1.</hi> So that this is a swartishe colour, if the same appeareth nighe so
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4287:90"/>
a rednesse (or a rednesse mixed to it) which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrateth that the grosse bloud to beare sway, euen as the quantitie which approcheth to it, or as the rednesse which is mixed to it. This colour (by the agréement of the Phisitions) is as the colour of the lunges, when the same is newlye drawne forth of a beast, that is properly named wanne of colour. The same (of the lunges) which after the drawing forth, beginneth to putrifie, and swell vp, and a wanne or leadie colour appeareth in the same. Here note, that the Phisiognomer wylleth a man, to beware and take héede of the like coloured persons, in that these are verie euil, &amp; wicked: if so be these in habitude (as <hi>Cocles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth) be not laudable or comely. Such a colour the Phisiognomer noted, in sundrie Cardinals, that were verie wicked in their déedes. Yea these of like colour he noted to be drunkards, luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and practisers of false and wicked matters, without anye shame: as the like of experience, the Phisiognomer reporteth to haue knowne. He further wryteth, that the Melancholicke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duste, are leacherous, vnlearned, and exercyse swynishe condicions: when as their heades be spericall, or Pineaple lyke, and hauing fatte chéekes. Yea when the adustion is ouermuch, then such incurre and fall into a frensinesse. The Phisiognomer noted, yea he iudged (before the
<pb facs="tcp:4287:91"/>
learned) sundrie of a like complexion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came foolishe: and of these, two were Students at that time, who after the increase of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, became foolishe, according to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Phisiognomer.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The eies small, doe argue such a person to bée peruerse, foolish, and faynt hearted, applyed of the Philosopher to the Ape: the reason is, in that when the creature is hotte and drye, he is then malycious of the humours and spyrites: and is a betrayer through the hotenesse and drinesse, proceeding of the Chollericke adustyon. For which cause, such are deceyuers, and partake of the Melancholye humours: of which feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and foolishnesse ensueth through a drynesse. The déepenesse of the eies procéedeth through a drinesse, which dryeth vp the moysture of the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4287:91"/>
and lygamentes. Of which insueth a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing togither into the inner partes, and the braine to be exhausted. And the paucitie of the matter of the eyes, doth signifie in the moysture propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the dominion of drinesse and melancholye adust, or a drinesse adustyue: and for this, are fearefull, and deceyuers, lyke to the Ape: as the same experience demonstrateth.</p>
               <p>When the eyes are situated after length of the bodie (for that these naturally in mankinde, are situated according to the breadth of the same) this is then named monstrous, that is, not agréeable to nature: the cause of which is the great hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as afore sufficiently vttered.

               <figure/>
               <p>The looke of the eyes like to the woman, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the same disposition, as of such a complexion: and is the same in conditions as the woman, as luxurious, and inuericundious: for which cause such men of like nature, be luxurious, and inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricundious. Of which <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that when the looke is like to a childes, and that his whole face and eyes séeme or appeare as he smyled, this is a light hearted person, and giuen to mirth, without taking care of the affayres of the world. The eyes appearing wholy smyling (as one laughing) with therest of the face in like maner,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4287:94"/>
be flatterers, luxurious, &amp; yll reporters or slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers. Some of this alledge a cause, and report that the mirch, and length of lyfe, to procéede of a good complexion: whose cause are the lawdable humours, and purenesse of them, through his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement. So that the cause of lyfe is hotnesse, and moystnesse: but of death, coldnesse and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The complexion of yong men, is hote and moyst: but of olde men colde and drye: and the note of the same is, that such which coeate much, doe liue a short time: and the gelded after nature longer, than those not gelded: and the aged men which haue much fleshe, doe lyue longer, in that the causes of much flesh, is a hotnesse and moyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. By which reason children, that are hote and moyst, be among other ages merrie, and ioy through their complexion: and be without cares of the minde. So that such, like to children in countinaunce, are the like in complexion: not be thincking earnest, or waightie matters.</p>
               <p>When the eyes appeare in rednesse to the burning coale, such a person is noted to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and obstinate: the reason is, in that the fyrie colour, doth indicate a most intensed choller, by reason of the hotnesse: and he is vicious, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, as appeareth in the verses in the first place.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Whose eyes be in colour lyke to the Gotes eine, is argued foolish: the reason is, that when a creature resembleth to anye beast, such a person is of the like nature, complexion, and condicions as in many places afore like vttered. So that such Gotes eine doe indicate foolyshnesse, &amp; great sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. The Phisiognomer many times looked on such a beast &amp; found the eyes somewhat variable, with a certaine troubled matter about the ring &amp; sight of the eie, which declared (after his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) a complexion very fiegmaticke, and watry, of which fearefulnesse, and foolishnesse insueth.</p>
               <p>The eyes which are like to the Cowes eyne, doe portende a madnesse to succéede in that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: séeing the eies lyke to Cowes eyne in men, do argue a like complexion. For the complexion of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4287:95"/>
such a beast, is colde and moyst, of which the eyes are great: so that through a coldnesse and moyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is the slownesse and dulnesse of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding caused, of which a madnesse and simplicitie ensueth.</p>
               <p>The eyes gray of colour (to the skie) drie sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and dimmie: such a person (willeth the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher) that a man to eschue, so nigh as he may: for that this gray colour in drie eyes, is a note of wicked persons. The colour of the eyes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colour of Dile, doth witnesse a stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g person. The yelowishe colour of the eyes, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a strong, and stoute person. The eyes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing much blacke of colour, is denoted to bée of a harde nature, and fraudulent. The déepenesse of the eies, is through a drinesse, drying the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and ligaments: of which ensueth a gathering into the inner partes (as afore vttered) and the brain exhausted. The eminencie of the eies repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth many obiects, of which a péeuish discourse ensueth, through a confusion of the obiects.</p>
               <p>If the eyes shall be small &amp; prominent out, like to the Creauis eyne: doe denote the lewdnesse of conditions and foolishnesse. The reason is, in that the smalenesse of the eyes, doth wytnesse the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie or littlenesse of matter: but the emynencie of them, doth indicate the ouermuch moysture in the fore ventricle, where the spirites are let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:96"/>
and of this lacketh iudgement. The emynen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie also of the eyes, is the cause of the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of many obiects, insomuch that such a one, can not discerne the congruent, from the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent: of which doth the pieuishe and beastly discourse insue, through the confusion of the obiectes.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The eyes tending vpwarde, as the Oxe eyne, which (and with this) appeare redde, and are most great: doe indicate a most wicked person, lewde of conditions, a foole, a bibber, and a drunkard. The reason of this effect is, in that the same sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the weakenesse of braine: for as much as such a forme, procéedeth of a moyst brayne. And of the weakenesse of brayne, is the dronkennesse
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4287:96"/>
caused, through the vapours ascending, which togither disturbe the braine. The same eleuation of the eyes, procéedeth by accidence: in that thys is caused through the ouermuch hotnesse, whose note is the red colour, or the red colour indicateth. For of an ouermuch hotnesse, is the disturbance (of the rationall spirite) caused: as the lyke we daylie sée, in the fyrie yrefulnesse of men. Such eyes the Phisiognomer noted, in the Citie of <hi>Viteberge,</hi> by one Nicholas a Barbier: which in a maner, was customably or daylie dronke.</p>
               <p>The eyes directed with the looke vpwarde, quy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, and with a palenesse of countinaunce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, doe denote such a person to be of a fierce and an inhumaine wytte, of an enuious nature, and sometimes a murderer.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4287:97"/>If anye by nature, hath the eyes appearing turned vpwarde: such a one of nature, is Lybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous: applyed to the maner appearing, in the dead bodies. And in persons at the instaunt coea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as wryteth <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his Problemes. For the eleuating of the eyes, is by accydence: in that the same is caused, through the ouermuch hotnesse, whose note is, the rednesse of colour: of which is a troubling, of the rationall spirite caused: as we daylie sée, in the intensed yreful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of men.</p>
               <p>The eyes appearing retorte, if they tende to the right side: doe denote foolishnesse: but if these tende to the left side, then they pronounce incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie: as the learned <hi>Palemone,</hi> in his Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy vttereth.</p>
               <p>The extensed eyes, with the extension of the count inaunce, doe denote such persons to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, and wicked: the reason is, for that the same extension is procured of a drynesse, and hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, through which the hote spirite is caused euill.</p>
               <p>He which hath the eyes like to the Asse, is noted foolishe, and dull of nature: the reason is, in that they be of a colde and drie qualitie, of which the impression of kindes is harde to enter: so that by the same reason, such are foolishe: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred after the maner, to the slowe Asse.</p>

               <p>The woorser eyes are they, which haue ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whyte, blacke, redde, or any other coloured spottes in them: in that such a person, is lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunt, then any others: yea so hardly to be trus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that rather to be shunned: except grace, and godly education helpe herein. And such a note, the Phisiognomer many times obserued and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in diuers Princes, Noble men, and iolye Lawyers, in authoritie. Here might a man que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion and demaunde, how it hapneth, that such a varietie of colours, appeareth in the eyes: to which the Phisiognomer thus aunswereth, that seing the eyes are verie cléere, and of a thinne substaunce, which is caused of the waterie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours consisting in them, of which the eyes are

Of which <hi>Ecclesiasticus. xiij.</hi> reporteth, that mans heart altereth the face, eyther to the good, or euill.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iacob</hi> by the face of <hi>Laban,</hi> found out the hatred towards him, hée turned then vnto his wiues, and sayde: I knew by the face of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4287:111"/>
that he is no more like in friendship towards me that he was yesterday. For euen his counti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, is a silent vtterer to me of his minde, the contrarie.</p>
               <p>The gladsomnesse or myrth of the face, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of a merry heart: but the heauinesse or sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of looke, is caused of a heauy heart.</p>
               <p>The face is often taken, and that simplie, for the naturall looke of any: but the countinaunce signifieth, the qualities of the minde: so that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed looke, is of a rare felicitie: as the learned <hi>Isidorus (ethimologiarum. xj.</hi>) vttereth.</p>
               <p>Whose face appeareth fleshie, is lightly coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and applyed vnto the Oxe, as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Aristotle</hi> vttereth in <hi>Methaphoricis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whose face by nature appéereth red, is shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast and mery: but whose face appeereth pale of colour, the same by nature is knowne to be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: as the Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>The face appéering leane, doth argue a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full person, and sometimes a betrayer: as the learned <hi>Albertus,</hi> and <hi>Conciliatore</hi> vtter.</p>
               <p>The face seene fleshie, doth indicate suche a person to be fearefull, applyed for the qualitie to the Hart and Asse: as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the learned <hi>Palemon</hi> wryte.</p>
               <p>The face that appeareth small, doth witnesse such a creature to be faint hearted, and fearefull:
<pb facs="tcp:4287:112"/>
applied for the qualitie, to the Ape, and Cocke: as the learned <hi>Conciliatore</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>The worthie <hi>Conciliatore</hi> writeth, that whose face appeareth verie bigge, is noted (by the agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other wryters) to be slow and sluggish in the proper actions: for the same denoteth a much matter, and flewmaficke, not regulated: applied for the qualitie vnto the Oxe, and sluggish Asse.</p>
               <p>The face appearing very bony, doth witnesse such a creature to be laborious, fearefull, and of a colde nature, after the minde of the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Palemon</hi> wryteth, that a meane forme of the face, as neyther to bigge, nor to small, is perfite good, and signifieth an honest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: by the agréement of <hi>Auicen, Albertus, Conciliatore,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Whose face is iudged small in forme, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be a person vngentle in conditions, and a niggarde: applyed after the maner, vnto the apparauncie knowne.</p>
               <p>The face séene very fleshie, doth indicate a slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnesse of actions, foolishnesse, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great desire of coeating to consist in that creature: through the matter abounding of the fleshe, &amp; grosse humors, not so flegmaticke, as afore hath beene vttered: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hotnesse there beareth sway, after the minde of the Phisiognomer. For which cause, such desire
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4287:112"/>
                  <figure/>
vayne and impossible things: yea the lyke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by the report of <hi>Phylemon,</hi> are light of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and dayly studie or exercise them in eating, drinking, &amp; in the wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> desire of coeating. If the others correspondent, shall be connexed, that is, the greatnesse of the two ventricles.</p>
               <p>The Philosopher <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his treatise of Phisiognomie (of the members) vttereth: that he which hath a fleshie face, is indicated to be lesse sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient, importunate, a lyare, and glutton.</p>
               <p>The person which hath a slender or leane face, is noted (after the minde of the Philosopher <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>) to be circumspect in his doings, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a subtill vnderstanding, as the <hi>Mercurians,</hi> possesse and haue. That creature which hath a
<pb facs="tcp:4287:113"/>
long face, is knowne of experience, to be froward, and iniurious.</p>
               <p>The worthie Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> vttereth, that both of horses and men, the same is knowne: that whose face is wrinckled of nature, and not by accidence, is begotten of féeble parents: for that the strength of the heart, where as the same is féebled, draweth the skinne togither. And is a note of the weakenesse of the principal members.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Palemon,</hi> and <hi>Ptholomeus Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus</hi> write, that a leane or thinne face, doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse such a person, to be full of thought, &amp; cares.</p>
               <p>The auncient <hi>Rasis</hi> vttereth, that such a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> face like to one drunken: is lightly ouertaken with strong drinke, &amp; procured drunck, as the Phisiognomer reporteth of experience.</p>
               <p>The creature, after the mynde of the learned <hi>Rasis,</hi> hauing a modest, and shamefast face, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted to haue the like conditions, and to be gentle.</p>
               <p>An yrefull face (after <hi>Rasis</hi>) doth indicate yre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse; which lyke happeneth to be found, both in other vices, and vertues: for that the face of like nature, to the lyke passion, is euen subiect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to the same.</p>
               <p>The face marueylous rounde, doth innuate such a creature, to be foolish, but the same appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring very bigge, is indicated to be slugguish in the proper actions, and of a dull capacitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:4287:113"/>

               </p>
               <p>A verye small face séene, doth argue such a person to be euill, craftie, a flatterer, a niggarde (for the more part) and fearefull. The reason sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be, in that the smalnesse of the heade, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth of the matter of the humor, and subtill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, with a drinesse: and through the euill compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, of which flattery is caused, and feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which is a sister of tenacitie: as afore taught, in sundrie places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conciliatore</hi> instructeth, that a deformed face, doth seldome argue good, and honest conditions. Nor a wrie countenaunce (of nature) can vtter (after the opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi>) laudable actions, and conditions: nor such a creature (of experience knowne) is greatly fortunate. And this note, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appéereth, of the congruent apparancie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4287:114"/>Whose face appeareth long, is noted vnshame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, and iniurious: and this caused through the mightie hotenesse (after the opinion of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> which is cause of the length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the same, that such through this, are so inuericundious.

               <p>The face fleshie, if with an euill fauourednesse formed: doth indicate such a creature to be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and franticke at times: after the opinion of <hi>Palemon,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The face grosse, with a bignesse of the iawes, and rusticall looke, doth denote a dull capacitie, and rude nature, as the Philosopher reporteth.</p>
               <p>The face reddish of it selfe, doth witnesse such person to be rough or sturdie, and cruell. And if the cheekes be onely red, then iudge such a person to be often drunke, or at the least, often ouerséene with drinke.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Conciliatore</hi> wryteth, that the face small, and couered with a yealow colour, doth indicate such a creature to bée vicious, a deceyuer, and dronkard: as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth, that the same séemeth to declare. This verie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hath bene experienced, in the Phisiognomers time, especially in sundrie Princes, head Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4287:114"/>
of armies, Secretaries, and Imbassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, which (at that day) were supposed among them, both sapient and skilfull: that knewe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to deceaue, and finde out a deceite.</p>
               <p>Whiles <hi>Cocles</hi> remayned at Rome, he there noted a most wicked person &amp; leacherous: whose habitude in this place (by the way of an example) he mindeth to vtter &amp; descrybe, after this maner.</p>

               <p>The countinaunce appearing sowre, through the forme and condition of the lippes, chéekes, forehead, and grinning: doth indicate such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to be a foole, and frantick at tymes: by the report of the Phisiognomer.</p>
               <p>A cheerefull and smyling countinaunce séene, doth innuate suche a creature to be gyuen vnto
<pb facs="tcp:4287:118"/>
myrth, and to be lybidinous after nature.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The face often sweating, and that of a light or small stirring: doth argue hotnesse, or a hote condition to consist in that person. And suche a creature is knowne of experience, to be leache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, gluttonous, and a great féeder. Of which insueth indygestion, and a siknesse to come: as the Phisiognomer hath sundrie times noted.</p>
               <p>The face appearing valled or dented in, and rather more leane than fatte, doth innuate such a creature to be iniurious, enuious, a lyar, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, cruell, yea a murderer: if the same espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially be annexed vnto adustion, and that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour be eyther wanne, or yellowe appearing: as the same (the Physiognomer sundrie times) hath

               <p>And euerye countenaunce, when the same ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth full of fleshe, and fatte: doth denote (by the agréement of most wryters) such a creature to be sluggish, and giuen vnto pleasure and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton actions.</p>
               <p>The face appearing verie much awrye, leane, and long: procureth after the mince of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) a rude creature in condition, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and enuious: and the same, affirmeth lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Rasis.</hi>

               <p>The face well proportioned, both in the forme of the fleshe, colour, and in the partes connexed: doth argue a lawdable lyfe or disposition, and flowing in vertues. Yet many men hath the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued and noted, which were néere vnto an infortune: whose looke or countenaunce afore (although it were, or séemed hid vnto the same time) yet their countenance after became difformable: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their faces were caused more difformable, then these to fore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: and their eyes were drawne awrye, that

they séemed léering, with their eye liddes gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and eye browes shed downewarde: and had the other notes to these aunswering.

               <p>Take héede (sayth <hi>Cocles</hi>) that you be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, in the iudgement of the leaprous: for as much as their eyes are round, &amp; the veynes emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or bearing outward, &amp; a cytrinesse of colour mixed vnto the rednesse: and such are caused ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quicke of styrring, and possesseth a straitnesse the Nosethrilles, with a most vehement or migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie horcenesse: in such maner, that the like crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is knowne to speake, as it were in the nose.

The experience of which, the Phisiognomer had many times, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in sundrie Princes: and of these, one was an Italian king, whose fame was sufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgated, and knowne to all Italy. But here ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a doubtfull question, worthie to be knowne: and the same is, which the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> graunteth vnto, that there be two chollerick
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4287:123"/>
subiects founde, hauing both Aquyline or hawked noses: and of these, the one knowne and founde to be, of a chollerick complexion, and the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude chollerick: the colour also of that creature, séene to be Cytryne or wanne aduste. But the habitude of the other person, knowne to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and of a good complexion, that is Sanguine: yet the same tending vnto choller.</p>
               <p>Of the first (in aunswering vnto this doubt) I say (sayth the Phisiognomer) that he is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensed malignitie, by reason of the corroboration, throughe the same spirite, which is conioyned wholly in the Chollerick subiect, both of nature, and by accidence. By accydence (sayth <hi>Cocles</hi>) I speake, through the wanne colour, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a colde complexion, and Melancholick adust: which that colour properly causeth. As the like, the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued and noted, in a certaine Italian Prince, which altogither was a wicked person, and causer of the destruction of much people, and a sower of discorde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among many. But the ende of this creature was detestable, vnto the vtter infamie both of him and his lynage. But of the seconde and other person I saye, that when the habitude is Sanguine, it is possible, that of the Chollerick, to be made or caused Sanguine, and of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Chollerick by accydence, when the ages
<pb facs="tcp:4287:124"/>
alter these. So that a man maye conclude, that when this in a Sanguine body, the same is then of a remissyue or qualified malignitie. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, for that the bloude is a snaffle or brydle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the choller, by which the malice of it is depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And one (of like condition (sayth the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomer, was that famous Chyromancer <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius nigrisolus Carpensis:</hi> For as much as his complexion was knowne to be Sanguine, and a little flewmaticke: and verie effeminate he was: yet from the shoulders vpwarde, tending vnto the Chollerick qualitie: so that not frée he was, from the vices aboue noted. And sometimes is the same depressed, through the part of the complexion and composition, as afore vttered.</p>
               <p>The Aquyline or hawked nose (after the minde of <hi>Conciliatore</hi>) seene in a body verie Chollerick, that is, Cytrine or wanne aduste, is noted the wickedder conditioned: by the wordes aboue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered of the Phisiognomer.</p>
               <p>The Aquyline or Hawked nose, decerned in a Sanguine body, or of such a like qualitie, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto Choller: is of <hi>Auicen</hi> iudged, not so euill.</p>
               <p>The Aquyline nose in ioynt maner ioyned to the foreheade, doth indicate suche a person to be stowte, and hardie: applyed after forme vnto the Eagle. This maner of ioynting or to be ioynted

vnto the forehead, is vnderstanded and ment of him which hath the emynencie or bearing out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the forhead, and such are named to be grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die catchers, of the heate and dryeth caused: and signifieth also such to be yrefull, violent in wrath and chollerick.</p>
               <p>Here the Phisiognomer taketh in hande, to describe Charles the French king, whose figure or picture naturally, and lyuely counterfayted with colours, by a singuler Paynter in a Table: was brought and shewed vnto the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for him diligently to beholde: which at the earnest request, and intreatie so did: &amp; he further, learned, of a religious Hermit, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of this kings body, which was on thys wise. He had a bigge heade, the Nose excéeding hawked, and great, the lippes somewhat thinne, the chinne rounde, and pitted or dented in, the eyes bigge, and somewhat bearing out, the neck shorte, and not sufficient strong in the compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the breast and back large: the loynes &amp; flancks sufficient great: the belly fleshie: the buttockes reasonable large: the haunches and legges, slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: yet sufficient bigge vnto the length: of the séete doth the Phisiognomer here nothing vtter. Thus in proportioning al the members togither, the Phisiognomer pronounced, that this mighti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> king, was short lyued: and that his death procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

by a Catherrall and féeble matter, fuming from the stomacke, and like discending againe from the heade to the stomacke, and of such cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses aunswerable. &amp;c. Althoughe some there be which report, that he dyed of poysoning.</p>
               <p>The Phisiognomers reason of this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, in that his heade, nose, and breast, &amp;c. were bigge, and indicated the multitude of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the same inobedient consisting in him: through which the vertue ruling, could not direct the whole bodye, for his euill composition. Of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4287:125"/>
which is to be learned, that euery signe is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenter of his proper note: for as much as the same slendernesse in the hippes, signified the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and strength of the braine, to be féeble and weake: and caused an euill qualitie, or condition of the sinewes: and disorder of the royall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: without whose good agréement, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that life coulde be long in that creature. He was also knowne to be luxurious, and the reason agréeable (is aboue vttred of the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer) which confirmeth that the nourishment, which ought by due nature to be conuerted and runne vnto the haunches, and legs, was by that maner of life, otherwise conuerted into Sperme. So that this king was of like nature and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, as aboue described of the Phisiognomer: yet the qualitie (as it should séeme) of lesser ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in the members, contrarie working vnto a hotenesse of the heart: and he was wanne of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which by accydence signified the dominion of coldnesse and Melancholye to consist in him.

                  </gap> the Aquv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line or hawked nose, did somewhat depresse. But the emynencie or bearing out of the eyes signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the fore ventricle of the braine, was flewmatick: which to conclude, fortified (as he sayth) the shortnesse of lyfe: and according as the Phisiognomer had iudged on this king, euen

the eyes appearing bigge, and emynent: the face shewed leane, the heares of the heade, séemed of nature short: the Nosethrils appeared large, and bearing vp, the lips shewed thicke, but the chinne appeared sharpe: the neck short, and slender for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: the shoulders shewed leane and narrowe: the armes and handes were decerned slender and long in forme: the <hi>epiglotis</hi> emynent: the furcle of the breast appeared narrowe, and the breast like narrowe in forme: the stature of this king, appeared rather crooked or stooping, then vpright: the body of this creature, was founde Cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick: the mouing of the eyes decerned, &amp; knowne to be swifte, and rolled or tourned vpwarde in the motion: the legges (to be briefe) were séene slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in composition. As touching the laudable prayses of this king, the Phisiognomer founde not any iustly to report: in that his vices, were is knowne vnto many, and diuulgated (in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) euery where.</p>
               <p>But in returning vnto the purpose, there was an other Aquyline nose, which coulde not so well put in practise or exercise his gouernement, as the other aboue vttered: whose name was <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> (a man knowne) to be a singular learned Poet in the Latine tongue, and had the fame and segnyoritie for the Gréeke tongue: whose corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature and personage was on this wise: he had

                  <figure/>
the heade congruently formed: the forehead was playne, and of a meane bignesse: the eyes stoode sufficient hollowe: and in colour like vnto the gray skie, not shyning or glistering: the nose for med like vnto the Eagles bill: the face founde long: the lippes séene reasonably formed, as these somewhat thinne: the chinne appeared dented in: the neck founde long: the <hi>Epyglottis</hi> emy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: the shoulder poyntes large, and somewhat bearing out: the breast and haunches found slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and narrow: the thighes, and shanckes séene small: yet these agréeable vnto the other partes,

of the bodye: the héeles founde flatte: the féete were long and slender.</p>
               <p>Of which notes <hi>Almansor secundus</hi> vttereth, that the sharpnesse of the nose, the long neck, the voyce sharpe, or small, and the comlynesse of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, demonstrated togither a drynesse in that creature, through the part of the chollerick qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. But his composition of bodye, was founde small: and the place of the stomacke, decerned narrow: his digestion also of meate, was knowne to be both weake and small, through the little and narrow stomack: his hart was founde to be cold, through the length of his neck: hée was besides conetous and fearefull, which is contrarie vnto magnanimitie or boldnesse: in that the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of a hote qualitie.

               <p>The nose séene flatte, doth signifie such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be luxurious, hastie in wrath, and faynt hearted: for the dominion of the moysture, and flowme in that creature: as the learned <hi>Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatore</hi> reporteth.</p>

that when the nose appeareth flatte, then is a hotnesse and moysture indicated in that person: for as much as the hotnesse of the Aquyline or hawked nose, is caused with a drynesse.

               <p>The person which hath a short nose, and the same flatte: is iudged (after the minde of the Phisiognomer) to be lasciuious: and as some wryte, to be a théefe.</p>
               <p>The nose séene short, the mouth formed small, and the teeth founde short and bigge: doe denote (after the minde of the worthie <hi>Conciliatore</hi>) a moyst and colde complexion.</p>
               <p>The sharpenesse of the nose séene, the necke founde long, the voyce heard small and comely: are apparaunt notes of a temperate chollerick qualitie: as the learned <hi>Rasis,</hi> the worthy <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus, Ptolomeus paruus,</hi> and other report, and <hi>Cocles</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>Here conceaue, that the nose formed broads in the middle, and appearing bended vnto the top: doth indicate such a creature, to be full of words, a lyar, and yrefull. The reason is, in that the same eleuation or rysing of the nose, and hollownesse vnto the middle: is procured of the chollericke qualitie, and paucitie of the Cartylage: For as much as Choller hath consumed that persons heate, and caused a drawing togyther of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4287:129"/>

skinne in that part, as aboue vttered (of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyline nose) so that the partes, which shall not be impouerished or lessened (by the same) of flesh: is bicause the fleshy part hath a viscous and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie moysture, through which, the same is not so soone &amp; lightly resolued. The cause of the yreful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in that creature procéedeth of choller, and through the passages hyndered, as shall after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the proper place.</p>
               <p>The Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> reporteth, that hée hath many tymes noted of experience in infinite subiects: &amp; in all his life time, he neuer sawe any, which were not possessed with a heape of vices, especially for lying, or for theyr ymagining lyes: and this caused, by the Chollericknesse consisting
<pb facs="tcp:4287:130"/>
in them: for which cause, this <hi>Cocles</hi> willeth a man to beware, and take héede, of the felowship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with such: as of all which (sayth he) experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in short time, will instruct thée perfite.</p>
               <p>The Nose formed sharpe at the ende, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate such a person to be a lyar, contentious, and yrefull: the reason is (as the Phisiognomer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth) in that such are of a chollericke qualitie, for as much as the leannesse, and sharpenesse of the Nose, doth for the more part happen, through the abundaunce of choller. The same ende also hath, narrow passages, in which the ayre can not passe nor enter, to coole the heart: so that of this, it long remayneth inflamed: which is cause of the contending, and quarrelling of that person.</p>

               <p>

               <p>The lyke of this, the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued and noted sundrie tymes, especiallye in one of the Senate house, of the noble citie of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonie:</hi> which for reuerence vnto the noble house, &amp; honesty sake, he refuseth to name. The cause is, forasmuch as such are of a moyst, and sanguine qualitie, tending vnto choller: and these vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally (by report of the Phisiognomer) are luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in both the kindes, euen as the same through the pricking forwarde of choller, which dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameth the bloud.</p>
               <p>And the regitine nature of the whole bodye, mooueth or stirreth forward the expulsiue vertue, vnto the sending forth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noyous matter super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and expelleth the same vnto the congruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apparaunt notes of these persons are, that such haue the nose bigge and blunt especially at the ende: and the nostrils wide and large, through the grosenesse or bignesse of the nose.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The singuler <hi>Aristotle (in Methaphoricis)</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, that such hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nose bigge at the ende, are of an earnest and readie minde, vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence of the desired act: such also are knowne to be base, and of no reputation, applyed for the

               <p>The selfe same note vttereth <hi>Rasis</hi> vnder these wordes: that whose nosethrilles are founde to be large, is argued to he a person luxurious.</p>
               <p>Such which haue the nose formed bigge and brode, are vnsesible, vnshamefast, vnapt to learne, and sluggish, applyed after the forme vnto the Sowe, hauing the like nose. The reason of this is, for as much as such hauing the nose grosser or bigger at the ende than in anye other part, and that large, are inuericundious, vnapt to learne, and vnsensible. That is, rude: for which cause, such are applyed vnto the Sowe, hauing the lyke nose, and the like conditions in a maner.</p>
               <p>The nose sharpe at the ende, doth denote such a person to be yrefull, applyed after the kinde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dogge: as <hi>Conciliatore</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>He which hath a meruaylous short nose, doth argue such a person to be an accuser, and a pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanke: as the skilfull <hi>Phylemon</hi> and <hi>Palemon</hi> report.</p>

               <p>The nose formed sharpe at the ende, and the same thinne, yet vpwarde towarde the foreheade more grosse: doth denote (of experience knowne) that such a person hardly to remitte hys yre: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed for the kinde (after the minde of <hi>Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore</hi>) vnto the yrefull Dogge.</p>
               <p>The nose formed bloont at the ende, and round withall: doth indicate such a creature to be stowt of courage: applyed of the Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> for the kinde, vnto the hardie Lyon. The same note by relation, sufficiently appeareth to moste men at this day.</p>
               <p>The ende of the nose séene small and sharpe, like to the forme of the birdes becke or bill, and generally long: doth declare such a person to be
<pb facs="tcp:4287:133"/>
hastie, foolish, and like stirring to and fro: as the learned <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, and of him compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the birde. And the same like, doth the long, and thinne nose signifie.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The nose verye retort, or the same turning backe or vpwarde, doth (for the more part) denote, the like peruerse minde, and conditions, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in that creature.</p>
               <p>The nose formed from the forehead vnto the mouth a long crooking, and hard or verye stiffe: doth denote such a person to be vnshamefast, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for the forme (of <hi>Aristotle</hi>) vnto the Rauen. And such were knowne naturally to be theeues, as <hi>Gulielmus Nurice</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>The lyke vttereth the Phisiognomer, that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4287:133"/>
suche a person is knowne manye tymes to be a théefe, and by the consequent vnshamefast: foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this exposition, is aptly aunswering or agréeth: and it appeareth lyke by the relation which he here vttereth, in that such (after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme) are applied vnto the Rauen. For the Rauen is well knowne, to be a wily and deceytfull Byrde, purchasing manye things by stealth, and hyding those in priuie places.</p>
               <p>The Nose founde rysing, and copping vp, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the foreheade, like vnto the Eagles beake: are noted to be stowt, bolde, and gréedie catchers: applyed of <hi>Aristotle</hi> (after the kinde) vnto the Eagle: and as the same in manye, hath of the Phisiognomer béene diligently noted.</p>
               <p>The Nose appearing hollowe, with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade formed rounde, and eminent vpward, doth indicate such a person, to be luxurious: applyed after the kinde, vnto the Cocke: and this note sufficiently appeareth, by the relation.</p>
               <p>The nose formed great, yet in a comely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner throughout: doth argue such a person to be honest, and gentle conditioned, after the minde of <hi>Conciliatore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nose great, and at the ende appearing with an vnséemely bignesse: doth the like declare (as aboue vttered) that such a person, to be vnsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, vnapt to learne. &amp;c. applyed for the forme,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:134"/>
vnto the Sowe.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Nose séene in the vpper part depressed, or flat formed: doth argue the féeblenesse of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and foolishnesse in that creature: and this besides is a note, of womanly lightnesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in him: after <hi>Rasis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nose on such wise formed, that the same from the foreheade immediately crooketh: such a person (after the mind of learned) <hi>Plato, Albertus,</hi> and <hi>Conciliatore</hi>) is iudged impudent, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie filcher: applyed for the forme, vnto the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Rauen.</p>
               <p>The Nose in comely forme crooking, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate an honest minde, and singuler witte: as the worthie <hi>Conciliatore</hi> reporteth, in his Rubricke of Phisiognomie, and <hi>Cocles</hi> the lyke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:4287:134"/>Here conceyue (sayth the Phisiognomer) that the declyning of the Nose, on the laterall partes of man: as if vnto one side onely of the position, it shall decline: doth denote a hurt to happen, from the Girdle stéede, vnto the lowest part. But if the nose downewarde shall be deuided, on ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, of the position: doth then indicate a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or a stripe to happen: and this eyther of the primitiue, or antecedent cause.</p>
               <p>The nose at the ende, formed somewhat flatte: doth declare such a person to be bolde, and liberal: applyed for the forme, vnto the Lyon.</p>
               <p>The nose appearing red, with the roote and hole within, and bréedeth drawing vnto a swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, lyke to the Strawberry: doth argue such a person, to be a great drinker of wine, and often druncke: and such for the more part, are moyst of qualitie, and luxurious: especially if such a note be founde, in bodyes of a small stature: and this was a practise, first founde by the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nosethrilles formed wide, doe denote such a creature to be yrefull: and this note pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, of the ouermuch hotenesse of the heart: for how much the more open &amp; wide these are, so much the greater yre they signifie. The singuler <hi>Conciliatore</hi> (in his Rubriek of Phisiognomy) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that such hauing the nosethrilles stopped,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:135"/>
                  <figure/>
are noted foolish, and of a small vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>The Nosethrilles (after nature) thinne, and verye large open: doe denote after the minde of the Phisiognomer) such a person to bée yrefull, cruell, and of a disdaynfull minde.</p>
               <p>The Nosethrilles formed thinne, and long retching, are by nature nere vnto birdes: but the same proportionally agréeing vnto men, is a note of lightnesse, and an vnstablenesse of mynde, as <hi>Conciliatore</hi> learnedly vttereth.</p>
               <p>The Nosethrilles appearing thinne and sharpe, doe witnesse such a person (after the minde of the Phisiognomer) to be full of complaintes.</p>
               <p>The part of the Nosethrilles, ioyning vnto the foreheade, if from the forehead extending, the same be with a comely composition, and that well

ioyning togither: in such maner, as this be ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to high, nor to lowe fixed of nature: but euen direct (as a line or creast) discendeth: doth then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate (by the report of the Phisiognomer) a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note, and courage in that creature, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie, and wisedome: applyed of <hi>Aristotle</hi> for the forme, vnto the hardie Lyon. But if the part of the Nosetrilles be lower or flatter, and that déeper than the abouesayde, doth argue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreatnesse of minde, &amp; weakenesse of strength, and courage: séeing the same is knowne to bée the note of a femenine lightnesse.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>If the Nosetrilles in the toppe directly eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, extende whole: doe indicate an euill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and distemperaunce in that creature.
<pb facs="tcp:4287:136"/>
And such are those, which in the inwarde ende of the gristle be raysed vp vnto the creast, and doe so discende to the Nose: which when these be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, doe (after the opinion of the Phisiognomer) procure, the disorder of the tongue, in the vttering of speach and sounding wordes.</p>
               <p>The greater and wyder Nosethrilles simplie, are (of all the <hi>Metoposcopers</hi>) better allowed and commended, than the lesser forme of them.</p>
               <p>The lesser Nosethrilles, by the agréement of <hi>Plato, Phylemon,</hi> and <hi>Ptholomeus paruus,</hi> are naturallye ascribed vnto seruile wittes, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwarters, wranglers, and to théeues.</p>
               <p>The Nosethrilles formed large open, do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse such a creature to be addicted or giuen vnto myrth, and strong in the composition of bodie.</p>

               <p>The auncient <hi>Rasis,</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi> report, that the largenesse of the Nosethrilles, and the muche quantitie of flesh on the Iawes, and the little qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Such hauing the eares ouer great in respect of the quantitie of body, are Asses, that is, fooles, and of a dull vnderstanding: as the former <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth, <hi>primo de Animalibus.</hi>

               <p>The eares flexible or bending, doe demonstrate the proportion of heate and moysture: and the moysture is cause of the bending: as the like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in a skinne and woode, which when they are crooked or winded inwarde, are moyst, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise are their partes broken, if we sée their matter to be drie.

And through that coueting, such are luxurious: &amp; vnderstanded perhaps of the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate appetites, and not of the power or force of the matter.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Palemon</hi> vttereth, that when the eares shall be promynent and verie great, foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and garrulitie is signified in that creature: and such are knowne to bée couetous. But the eares which are as they were cut, and verie short and parted, doth <hi>Loxius</hi> report, to attempt and commit a deceyte.</p>
               <p>The eares formed semicircularly, and creasts connexed, in the middle somewhat flatte toward the centre, and of a meane bignesse, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently stande to the heade, doe wytnesse a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of nature. But the eares ouer rounde, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie suche a person to be vnapt to learne. The eares long and narrowe, are reported to be the notes of enuie.</p>
               <p>The eares lying or standing close with the heade, are reported to signifie dulnesse and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnesse, as <hi>Albertus</hi> vttereth: the reason and cause of the signification, is for that the hertue formatiue, when the Organes are directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4287:140"/>
or that the instrument of heate and the kinde quayleth or wanteth, causeth that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the matter doth so inlarge the eares out of measure: or through the drynesse or scarcitie of the same, causeth them to drawe togither, and be narrowe, in respect of the due proportion: and of this can not gouerne the works of the spirite: but that the eares like insue, according to the plentie and scarcitie of matter, for as much as they thus proceede of the indiuisions of nature, these hitherto <hi>Albertus:</hi> I (sayth the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) haue noted many olde men, and found them to haue great eares, and not small in that age.</p>
               <p>So that the small eares (after the agréement of most wryters) doe denote short lyfe: in thys agréeth <hi>Ptholomie</hi> the Philosopher, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that the eares small, be a note of shorte lyfe: and if the eares be hearie, doe indicate long lyfe. The reason is, that the smalnesse vttereth the paucitie of matter: and when these be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, doe denote the matter to be sufficient strong in vertue, to heate the braine with a lawdable heating: in that the heares are caused through the vapours eleuated of the hotnesse of the heart, and all the other members.</p>
               <p>The eares hearie, doe pronounce a good and readie hearing, which is a note of the kinde and heate: and for that cause, I report the same. But

disposition: so that among these two, a meane of all the kindes which hitherto hath béene vttered, doe signifie a goodnesse of nature.</p>
               <p>Some report, that the eares gristly, doe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate such a person to be Melancholike, or of a Melancholike qualitie. But the eares great, doe denote the dominion of the Melancholike hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: as the like appeareth in the Hare, and Asse, which haue great eares, and are foolishe. So that such hauing the like eares, are of a lyke nature: and the Melancholike humours doe not

               <p>To come vnto the matter, in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath béene sufficiently vttered, that the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of members procéedeth through heate, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the mouth, which representeth the naturall and spirituall members: as of these, especiallye the stomacke. For howe much, the proportion of the stomacke is vnto the mouth, so much is the

Of which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, how much the intentiuer the heate is, so much the greater will the resolution of partes be. For where a great resolution consisteth, there of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie must insue, that a restauration aptlye be procured: which otherwise can not be caused, but through the benefite and helpe of meates, that ought to be in a sufficient quantitie: of which the spirites are actiuely ingendred, and these in great quantitie, which properly cause in that creature yre, boldenesse, yea quarrelling, and fighting. Of which it succéedeth, that the worthie <hi>Philemon, Palemon, Albertus,</hi> and <hi>Conciliatore</hi> report: that the creature which hath à great and wyde mouth, is a gluttonous féeder; yet hardie; and prone to fight.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>AT the ende of the Iawes, are the lippes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: which are compowned of a soft fleshe:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4287:148"/>
in that these by a double motion, are aptly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: as in the one, by a proper maner vpwarde, and in the other by the motion downewarde: and these caused, by motion of the lawes, from one to the other, both in the closing and opening: which is the cause, why the lippes are named to haue a good, and perfite motion. The vtilitie of them (by the agréement of all the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers) is and serueth for the furthering and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of spéeche: and that these may (through the helpe of the lawes) aptly and well close togither, for the better beseeming of the countenaunce.</p>
               <p>The colour of the lippes, towarde the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the mouthe is redde, thorowe manye veynes of bloude deryued vnto that place: the note of which is, in that these often, and much inquantitie bleede: and are of a light cause bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and quickly or verie soone cut. The common hurtes there hapning, are especially cured (after the minde of the Phisiognomer) with the same, named of the practioners <hi>Mel Rosatum:</hi> for he reporteth, that he hath often experienced the same in many subiects.</p>
               <p>There maye notes also be gathered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, by the colours of the lippes: for that the naturall colour, in the edges of the lippes (after the minde of <hi>Constantine</hi>) ought to be redde: through the thinnesse of skinne, which lightly of
<pb facs="tcp:4287:149"/>
the heate or colour of the bloud, receyueth a Rosie qualitie. Of which, as this worthy <hi>Constantine</hi> reporteth: that the rednesse of the lippes indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the purenesse of complexion, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myxing togither of troubled bloud: and the note both of the good, &amp; strong vertue in that creature.</p>
               <p>The wannesse of the lippes, argueth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the same aboue: in that the vertue of bloud, and naturall heat are lacking in that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: so that such hauing the like lippes, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be sicke: as the worthie <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>When the lippes are formed bigge, these doe represent the multitude of matter, drawne vnto them through heate: and the grosenesse or big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them, is caused through the grosse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and spirites, of which the dulnesse of wit ensueth, and foolishnesse: procured by reason of the hotnesse, except the neather lippe be decerned loose hanging, and waterie running.</p>
               <p>But if the lippe be decerned vpright, and thick in forme, that is, compact or stiffe: in such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, doth the Phisiognomer (of experience) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply there the Planet <hi>Marse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A like reason the Phisiognomer vttereth, that when the mouth is formed great, if the lippes appeare loose and hanging: in that parte of the creature, is the Moone of him, and others aptly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The neather lippe decerned loose hanging, and folding downewarde, and that the same ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth verie redde in colour: doth argue (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the woman) to be a most sure note, of the great desire vnto the veneriall acte, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shame fastnesse in that creature: as the same, the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued and noted, in a famous Curtysane of Rome, named <hi>Isabella di <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and the creature growne vnto a ripe age: as the same the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> reporteth, that he noted in a certaine noble man, of the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>Briefely to wryte, all the other members according to the nature and propertie of them, are eache attrybuted vnto his proper Planet: as shall after appeare more at large, in the thirde booke of the Physiognomers to come forth, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled the Phisiognomie of the Planets.</p>
               <p>The worthie <hi>Loxius, Phylemon, Plato, Aristotle, Albertus, &amp; Conciliatore report:</hi> that the lips decerned chéerefull, and somewhat smy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hapning with a merrie countenaunce: doe argue such a creature to be wantonly disposed, and lybidinous: yea such sometimes are knowne to be craftie, deceyuers, and théeues: of which one the like, was that wicked Chyrurgian (a countryman of the Phisiognomers) named <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphinus de pisis,</hi> that he diligently noted.</p>
               <p>The lippes of the mouth formed verie grosse, loose hanging, or ouermuch folding out: doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate such a creature to be simple, lightly or soone credyting, &amp; of a dull capacitie: these also denote a flewmatick humour moystening, to consist in that person: compared of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> for the forme vnto the aged Asse, hauing the like lippes.</p>
               <p>If the lippe within be séene not lyuely, or not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4287:150"/>
a fayre red in colour: doth argue a matter not regulated, and grosse humours to consist in that creature: of which a dull capacitie, and bellume vnderstanding ensueth: yea the same sometimes denoteth a sicknesse present, or that shall shortly folowe.</p>
               <p>The Philosopher <hi>Aristotle (in Methapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric is)</hi> vttereth, that such which haue the lippes formed thinne, and in the edges appearing to hang loose out: in such maner, that the vpper lippe is séene stretched ouer the neather, at the closing and ioyning of the lippes: are denoted to be bolde, stowte, and of great courage: applyed for the forme, vnto the couragious Lyon. The like condition of these, may a man sée in the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Dogges of our Realme: which haue such hanging lippes, as to all men knowne.</p>
               <p>Such which haue the lippes harde, and thinne formed, and a bearing out decerned about the Canyne or sharpe téeth: doe indicate a rude vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in that creature, vnapt to learne, and furious in actions: applyed for the forme, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grunting Hogge. The cause of these (as the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> supposeth) is the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of matter, and the dominion of dryth: in that the same consumeth the moysture of the lips, but thys about the Canyne téeth, it can not so wast or consume: for as much as the moysture
<pb facs="tcp:4287:151"/>
consisting in such a place, is knowne to be viscous and clammy. Such also by reason of the dryeth (sayth the Phisiognomer) multiplyed in the braine, are noted to be foolishe, and deceytfull: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed after the maner, vnto the Swyne. So that whose lippes are decerned thinne and harde, and about the Canyne téeth bearing vp: such persons séene the like, are referred vnto the Swyne.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The neather lippe decerned greater, than the vpper: doth denote such a creature to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to learne, simple, of a small vnderstanding, and foolishe.</p>
               <p>The heather lip séene swelled, vnto the sharpe or Canyne téeth: doth indicate such a person to be full of rancour, and malice, and contentious.</p>
               <p>Such which haue the lippes formed grosse, and the vpper hanging ouer the neather lippe: are denoted (by report of the Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi>)
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4287:151"/>
to be of a simple vnderstanding, of a dull capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and foolishe: applyed for the forme, vnto the slowe and dull Asse.</p>
               <p>Whose vpper lip shall appeare promynent or bearing out with the gummes, doth wytnesse such a creature to be a louer of discord, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying or busying himselfe in strifes, and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies: applyed for the forme vnto the Dogge: these hitherto, borowed out of the Phisiognomy of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such hauing the vpper lip so eleuated, that the gummes, that is, the fleshe on the téeth, and the téeth themselues are decerned: are knowne (as the Phisiognomer reporteth of experience) to be full of variaunce, and contumelious, yea often rebuking: applied for the similitude vnto the Dogge, especially, and the same, according to the apparaunt congruencie séene. For the Dogge when he purposeth to bite, sheweth then the téeth by the gathering vp of the lippes.</p>
               <p>The lippes formed small and thinne, and the mouth decerned little: doe indicate the imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of minde, and craftinesse to dwell or consist in that person.</p>
               <p>The auncient <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that whose lips are decerned great: is denoted foolish, of a dull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, and vnapt to learne. The selfe same doth the worthie Philosopher. <hi>Aristotle</hi> vtter, in hys

Phisiognomie of the members that such a person which hath thicke lippes, is knowne to be foolishe, and of a simple capacitie.</p>
               <p>The much bearing out of the lippes, doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse such a person (after the minde of the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomer) to be foolish, ful of wordes, contentious, and hardie.</p>
               <p>Certaine report, that whose lippes shall be formed congruently thinne, and not much folded or turned outwarde: doth denote such a person to be secrete in all matters, warie, of a good perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet yrefull at tymes, and of a singulare or readie witte. The cause is, for that the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth a congruent matter, vnto the subtilnesse of the humors, and spirites, which is the reason and cause of the witte. But the yrefulnesse consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in that creature, procéedeth through the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilnesse of the spirits, prone and apt vnto the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it.</p>
               <p>Such hauing the lippes with the gummes, formed on the téeth prominent or bearing out: doe indicate an euill tongued person, a wrangler, yre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and inclined to worke iniuries: for these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly referred vnto the Dogge: as the singuler <hi>Palemon</hi> vttereth.</p>
               <p>Whose lippes shall be séene well coloured, and these rather thinne, then grosse or thicke: doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie such a person to be well conditioned in all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4287:152"/>
                  <figure/>
matters, and lightly chaunged, eyther to the good, or euill, but rather prone vnto vertues, then vnto vices: as <hi>Michael Scotus</hi> vttereth: and there (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the minde of the Phisiognomer) is the planet <hi>Iupiter</hi> represented.</p>
               <p>Whose lips are decerned not sufficient equal or a like throughout, in such maner, that the one be grosser or thicker, than the other: doth witnesse such a person, to be more simple, than wise: and of a variable fortune, as certaine report.</p>
               <p>The Philosopher <hi>Ptholomeus paruus,</hi> vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the outwarde lippes formed small, and somewhat folded or turned outwarde, doe denote such a person to be full of wordes, verie enuious, and an accuser. The reason is, for that the pauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:4287:153"/>
or smalnesse of the lippes, doth witnesse the small quantitie of matter, and the dominion of coldnesse: but the folding or turning outwarde of them, doth declare a drinesse, drawing togither the hearie sinewes: of which ensueth that the animall spirites are incongruent, vnto the decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of whatsoeuer is spoken: and the enuie through the same, procéedeth, and is like caused.</p>
               <p>The worthie <hi>Ptholomeus Paruus</hi> vttereth, that the vpper lippe folding or turning vpwarde, and the neather downeward: doe signifie a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or wretchednesse of life, and vncomely condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions. Of this the Phisiognomer saw, and found a singuler experience, especially in the poore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and néedie people. For the weakenesse of the animall spirits (sayth he) is signified, to consist in them: of which the witte properlye hath not place or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The lippes formed thinne, if the vpper be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and folding outwarde, and the same lose han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: doe denote such a creature, to be a decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, subtile, and a théefe for the more part.</p>
               <p>The lippes decerned grose or thicke, like to the Dogges: doe indicate such a person to be a deceyuer, an accuser, and wicked in conditions: these hitherto borrowed out of the Phisiognomie of <hi>Ptholomeus paruus.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The cause I suppose (sayth the Phisiognomer) through the aboundance of the radicall moysture,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:154"/>
or spermaticall matter, which declareth a most great dominion of heate, and strength in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall members, of which a hasty dissoluing of the substaunciall moysture ensueth, that cannot be restored, but through the much eating of meate, whose plentifull substaunce this greatly néedeth: for which cause, such are inordinate as afore vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: and as the same appeareth by relation, in the Dogge and Boare.</p>
               <p>And such the Phisiognomer hath knowne of experience, to be wasters of their owne substance great drinckers, disceyuers, whorehunters, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayners of harlottes, and murtherers, especiallye if anye other proportion aydeth and confirmeth the same.</p>
               <p>The auncient <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that whose téeth are discerned weake, thinne sette, and small: doe argue the whole bodye to be weake: and both féeblenesse in that creature, and the shortnesse of life. The selfe same vttereth the sayde <hi>Rasis,</hi> in the buying of seruaunts: and the Philosopher <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> vseth the same words, in his Problemes.</p>
               <p>The worthie <hi>Aristotle also</hi> reporteth (<hi>in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundo de Animalibus</hi>) that such hauing the téeth thinne sette, are noted to be short lyued.

               <figure/>
               <p>The téeth formed bigge and broade, whether these stande inwarde, or are séene outwarde: doe argue a vaine person, lasciuious, simple, of a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der capacitie, and hauing a bouine witte: for that the same witnesseth grosse spirites to consist in that person, proceeding of grosse humors.</p>
               <p>The téeth most drie, without anye moysture

               <p>The téeth séene full of rewme, or a distilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the head appearing in them: doe signifie a disease of the heade or stomacke, through the participation and occasion of the head, and lungs: causing this distillation from the heade into the nose and eyes, the Catharre, the Cough, the Squincie in the throte, and the impostume of the Iawes. But any of these, this procureth eyther more or lesse, according to the contrarie working of the members: as vnto the beholder, may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare.

               <p>The téeth decerned weake, fewe in number, thinne set, and small: doe indicate (after <hi>M.

               <p>THe tongue is a member which is extended out of whyte fleshe, both harde and well mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and this the colour and vse of it declareth: the rednesse which consisteth in it, is caused of many small veynes and little arteries, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede and come vnto it, especially vnto the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the same, through which this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the neather part redder, than in the vpper: and this is knowne to be a spungie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, full of powers: For experience instructeth vs, that the same is bloudie, in consideration that the solution of the continuitie of the same, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye cured in shorte tyme, with the simple Rosed Hony.</p>
               <p>The tongue not onely serueth for the cleane
<pb facs="tcp:4287:157"/>
and perfite vttering of wordes in smyting the teeth to cause the sounde of them, in the issuing forth: but the same also helpeth to distinguishe all maner of tastes, yea the letters perfitely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, as the learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> vttereth.</p>
               <p>The tongue folded or turned downewarde, and stutting or stammering: doth argue an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morall laske of the belly: as the worthie <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> reporteth, in. 32. <hi>Aphoris. sextae secto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such encombred with this humorall laske, become stutters or stammerers, through the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter descending from the head, which entreth and is drunke into the Spungynesse, and lacertes of the tongue: and of this ingrossed or caused thick, through which enlarging, the same of necessitie must be shortned. So that of the same cause, such stut or stammer: yea <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that the stammering, dothannuate the moystnesse of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Somethere be, which are caused to stut of nature: of which that noble Phisition <hi>Aetius</hi> wryteth.</p>
               <p>Such hauing the tongue tyed before, cannot perfitly vtter or pronounce the letter S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but sound the same like God: and such of the singuler <hi>Aetius,</hi> are named proper stammerers.</p>
               <p>The tongue tyed behinde, cannot pronounce the letters. R and T. as <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth: but breaking the letter R. sounde the same lyke to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4287:157"/>
the letter L. and such of him, are aptly named lyspers.</p>
               <p>The flixe named <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> is a flixe or laske of the belly, with the onely shedding of humour, without an inflamation or exulceration: when the humours especially discende from the heade. So that when any vttereth the wordes with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, it is then a note of <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> to molest that creature. With which disease, the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer reporteth hymselfe to haue bene encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in childe age: for as much as in many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, this sicknesse much molesteth and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in that age: but growne vnto ryper yeares, the same then seaseth.</p>
               <p>The stammerers (sayth the Phisiognomer) doe manye tymes feare, to drinke anye headdy Wine, in that these are so soone dronke, through the weakenesse of braine. Hereof it is, that the dronkarde so stammereth, and maffleth in the mouth, that he readily can not bring forth thys common worde or number, as (thirtie thrée) in no maner. For as much as the vapours of the Wine, are dronke into the Spungynesse of the tongue: of which this is enlarged, and hindered of the naturall site.</p>
               <p>The auncient <hi>Hyppocrates in suis Secretis</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, that the heauinesse of the tongue, hapning in a yong man: pronounceth after the lightnesse
<pb facs="tcp:4287:158"/>
                  <figure/>
of the same sodayne death: the lyke witnesseth, the learned <hi>Galen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the tongue is discerned grosse, bigge, and large: doth argue a rude wit: as the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomer manye times noted: this also doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present flewmatike humours, to consist in the braine of that creature, or in the other partes of his bodye.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Conciliatore</hi> reporteth, that the stammering, and often repeating of the fore silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worde, before the full vttering and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the worde, doth denote such a creature, to be prepared and prone vnto the Melancholie qualitie.</p>
               <p>The tongue by a swift motion drawne togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4287:158"/>
and through the corrupting and breaking of the wordes, causing a repiticion: doth witnesse such a person to be foolishe, hastie in wrath, and yrefull. This especially caused, through the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uablenesse, and hotnesse of the spirites, hastening forwarde, the vtteraunce and pronouncing of wordes, without consideration.</p>
               <p>When the tongue shall be discerned so heauie as a stone, and in a maner appearing immoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: doth denote (after the minde of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher) a sluggishe person, slowe in actions, and of a dull capacitie.</p>
               <p>The tongue discerned thinne, doth represent a subtill wyt, through the decent matter, both of the humour and spirite: although the same may declare a hote, and peraduenture a Chollericke qualitie, after the minde of the Phisiognomer.</p>

                  <hi>Ptholomie</hi> the Philosopher vttereth, that the tongue decerned long, and red: to signifie wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for as much as the same witnesseth law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable humours, to consist in that creature.</p>
               <p>In kysses (by report of the Phisiognomer) may much be knowne and found: For a certaine creature I sawe (sayth he) which thrust forth the tongue, nigh a paulme bredth: and the same sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times experienced in my sight, as a matter of admyration, and worthie to be noted.

               <p>The learned <hi>Conciliatore</hi> wryteth, that the tongue decerned, as the same infected of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall colour: doth denote a weake estate &amp; euill condition, to consist in that person: especially of the breast and belly.</p>
               <p>The person which hath such a long, grosse, and rounde tongue, that with the same thrust forth, he may easily licke the Nose: doth witnesse suche a person (after nature) to imitate the Oxe, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: as the same (the Phisiognomer diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted) in a neighbour of his.</p>

               <p>The tongue ouerfast speaking (as reporteth <hi>Michael Scotus</hi>) doth denote such a person to bée more simple than wyse, of a dull witte and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, lightly crediting, and conuertible, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto the good or euill.</p>
               <p>The tongue that stutteth in the vttering of wordes (sayth <hi>Michael Scotus</hi>) doth indicate such a person to be verie simple, vaine, vnconstant, yrefull: yet from his yre easily brought and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>The nature, formes, and iudgement of voyces. The. xxix. chapter.</head>
               <figure/>
               <p>THe cause why in some persons, the voyce is heard bigge: in some vttered small: in some decerned bigge and small togither: and in some after a horce, and aspere maner: is for that (as the Philosopher vttereth) there are thrée principall conditions, that concurre vnto the voyce. The one is, the vertue of the lungs in forcing or procuring forwarde the breath, in reuerberating vnto the roote of the tongue, or vnto the pype of the lunges. The other and second is, through the ayre expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againe, to reuerberate the same. The third is,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4287:160"/>
the pype of the lungs, vnto the roote of the tongue, where the ayre and breath is reuerberated. Of which, howe much the sounding vertue consisteth strong, to expell much breath, and the pype of the longes formed large, that the same receyueth great plentie of ayre: so much the greater and lesser, appeareth the voyce: but howe much the vertue appeareth weake, and the weason or pype of the lunges consisteth weake, so much the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and shrilnesse of voyce procéedeth: and the same insueth, according to the vertue moouing, and swiftnesse of the breath.</p>
               <p>The grosnesse of the voyce, procéedeth through the slownesse of moouing, in that creature: of which, howe much the vertue doth lesser mooue the ayre or breath, so much the more subtilnesse or smalnesse, and shrilnesse hath the voyce: through which, this procéedeth and is caused (after the minde of the Phisiognomer) the swifter.</p>
               <p>Howe much the more ayre or breath (sayth he) shall be gathered and receyued into the subiect, so much the grosser or bigger will the voice succéede and be, and the same procured through the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of moouing.</p>
               <p>The asper or rough voyce, procéedeth through a drynesse, of the pype of the lungs. But the horce voyce is caused, through a superfluous moysture, which descendeth from the heade, vnto the pype of
<pb facs="tcp:4287:161"/>
the lunges, which (as it shoulde séeme) so hindreth and letteth the breath to passe in that creature.</p>
               <p>The equalitie and swéetenesse of the voice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth and is caused through a temperament of the pype of the lunges: when the same consisteth and is neither to drie, nor moist. For this is a note that the qualitie of the heart not to be resisting or letting, but that a proportion of all liuing thinges, may be founde and knowne: and in these, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males are decerned to be of a weaker and shriller voyce, than the males: except the Cowe, as the Philosopher (<hi>in quinto de Animalibus</hi>) vttereth.</p>
               <p>The person which hath a bigge voyce, is noted to be very iniurious: applyed for the forme vnto the Asse, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth, in <hi>Metha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricis.</hi>

               <p>Such which vtter the wordes now bigge, now lowe, and vnperfitely: are indicated to be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, applied for the same condition, vnto women, and vnto the comlinesse of the voyce.</p>
               <p>The persons which séeme to call and speake bigge, and the voyce not chaunged into a dyuers maner: are applyed of the Philosopher for the forme, vnto our great Mastie, and vnto the seme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of the voyce.</p>
               <p>The creature which is hearde to speake softly, without a retching of the voyce, are noted to bee gentill, and simple: applyed for the forme vnto the shéepe.</p>
               <p>Such which call or vtter the wordes shrillye, are noted to be irefull: applyed for the kinde and forme vnto the Goate: these hytherto out of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> the like <hi>Albertus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Conciliatore</hi> report, and <hi>Hieronimus de Manfredis,</hi> a countrie man of the Phisiognomers.</p>
               <p>The voyce vttered bigge, and distensed in the kinde, doth indicat a strong person: forasmuch as the same procedeth, through the plentie of heate. This grosse or bigge voyce, doth the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:4287:162"/>
here meane, to be like to the base Organe pype.</p>
               <p>The person which vttereth a slowe, and bigge sounde of the voyce, is iudged to be quiet, tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, gentle, &amp; merie: of these, certaine are knowne to be verye iust, and vpright creatures, in theyr dealings, after the minde of the Phisiognomer.</p>
               <p>The voyce decerned bigge, yet the sounde of wordes perceyued very corrupt: is an apparant note of a franticke creature, iniurious, and a glutton.</p>
               <p>The strength of the voyce, ensueth the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of vaynes, and multitude of the spirites, which altogither are caused of heate: as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>The persons possessing a bigge voyce, and that heauily or bassely calling: are indicated to be apt persons, to beare iniuryes and wrongs: applyed for the forme, vnto the asse.</p>
               <p>Such creatures which call or beginne bigge, and ende in their wordes with a small voyce, are denoted to be both yrefull, and pitifull at tymes: yea soone pleased, and tractable: applyed vnto the Oxe, for the forme of the crie: the reason of thys, is often taught afore.</p>
               <p>Such a person which hath a grosse, high, and sounding voyce: is reported to be eloquent, bold, fierce, and valiant in armes, or a warriour.</p>
               <p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The voyce decerned small and lowe, doth indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate such a creature to be fearefull, and enuious. By this low voyce, is here ment (sayth the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) the small and faint voyce: and not the bigge, in any maner.</p>
               <p>Here conceyue, that the voyce is diuers of sounde, forasmuch as the voyce is a sounde with an ymagination, by the mouth of the creature, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terod to demonstrate any effect. But the sounde is any kinde, procéeding of the sounding, which vnto the hearing procureth a passion. And the speach is a thirde kinde, hauing a diuersitie, vnto either of these.</p>
               <p>The voyce decerned small, soft in the hearing, and in a broken maner: doth witnesse a woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:4287:163"/>
fearefulnesse to consist in that creature, and to be effeminate.</p>
               <p>The voyce heard slowe, doth indicate (after the mind of the Philosopher) such a person to be slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishe in actions, rashe at tymes, and impudent.</p>
               <p>The voyce decerned weake, doth argue a straightnesse of the arteries, and paucitie of the spirits, which are especially caused by the meanes of colde.</p>
               <p>The voyce decerned soft, without retching, doth indicate such a person to be gentle, and trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: applyed vnto the shéepe, for the similitude of the voyce: euen as the others, applyed vnto Beastes of lyke condition.</p>
               <p>The voyce hearde grosse and highe, doth indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a hotenesse of the heart and lunges, and a largenesse of the wesand, that both fréely draweth and expelleth the ayre or breath, without impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for which cause, the voyce heard lowde, doth denote such a creature to be talkatiue, bolde, and contencious.</p>
               <p>The Philosopher <hi>Aristotle (in de secretis secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum)</hi> vttereth, that whose voyce appeareth a meane, betwéene a smalnesse, and bignesse: is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a person sapient, a foreséer, true, and iust, and these through the contrary cause.</p>
               <p>Such a person which is decerned quicke of spéeche, especially if he hath a shrill voyce, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:4287:163"/>
to be a creature yrefull, obstinate, foolishe, importunate, a lyar, and euermore euill conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
               <p>But if the voyce shall be perceyued or decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned grosse, or rather bigge: doth signifie such a creature to be yrefull, hastie, of an euill nature and condition.</p>
               <p>The creature which hath a swéete and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt voyce, is iudged (of the Philosopher <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>) to be enuious, yrefull at tymes, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous suspecting.</p>
               <p>The delectablenesse of voyce, decerned in a proper subiect (as the worthy <hi>Palemon</hi>) vttereth, doth indicate a dull capacitie and foolishnesse: yet a stowtnesse of courage, to consist in him.</p>
               <p>The quicknesse and hastinesse of wordes or spéeche decerned, as the (learned <hi>Albertus</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, doth argue a hote complexion, to consist in that creature. The like do <hi>Phylemon, Loxius, Palemon,</hi> and <hi>Conciliatore</hi> vtter, vnder these words: that whose voyce is heard, grosse, &amp; bigge vttered, is reported to be yrefull, rash, and hastie in his actions, and supposed to be of an euill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the reason of these (is reported of them to be) through the vntemperate hotnesse.</p>
               <p>The person hastie in spéeche, especially when he hath a small voyce, is reported to be wicked, a foole, importunate, a lyar, yrefull, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb facs="tcp:4287:164"/>
of euill conditions.</p>
               <p>Whose voyce shall be decerned pleasaunt, (as afore vttered) is iudged enuious, and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: the reason hath bene opened in another place, for as much as the same is effeminate. Further the delectablenesse of voyce, doth denote small wisedome or simplenesse, and veneriall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>The auncient <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that the voyce decerned bigge, doth indicate the whotnesse of complexion, but the small voyce, doth witnesse the coldnesse of complexion in that creature.</p>
               <p>The voyce perceyued rough or horse, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cranes: doth testifie an enuious person, and one that retayneth a mischiefe or grudge, secretly in the heart: the same person also is by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Philosopher Melancholik in qualitie.</p>
               <p>Whose voyce shall be decerned, not fully vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered or spoken with a long breath: is noted to be a vile person, through the coldnesse of the heart, and peraduenture with moystnesse applyed.</p>
               <p>The creature which hath a verie bigge voice, is noted to be a seruaunt, vnto his owne belly. The reason of this is, for as much as the graue or bigge voyce, procéedeth through the debillitie of vertue, which cannot breath out the sufficient plentie of ayre, to moue the muscles of the breast: of which insueth sluggishnesse, that such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4287:164"/>
                  <figure/>
of the same, can neither apply his wyt to any studie, nor frame or exercise his bodye with anye corporall or painefull labor.</p>
               <p>They which vtter the voyce, in cutting of tha breath: doe promise liberally, but performe little, and such are knowne to be deceyuers.</p>
               <p>They which are decerned to vtter the voyce (as it were) by a moouement of the breast, stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily bigge: are denoted to be manly, yet vnapt to learne, and stowte of courage: applyed for the forme, vnto the Lyon.</p>
               <p>They which haue a slowe, and bigge voyce, are denoted to be quiet, and merrie: such also for the more part are knowne to be iust persons, and gentle conditioned.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:4287:165"/>They which are heard to sounde the voyce shrill like vnto byrdes, are noted to be prone vnto the veneriall acte, vnstable and vaine.</p>
               <p>A breathing decerned small and faint in voice, doth innuate such a creature to be sadde for the more part, frowarde and suspicious.</p>
               <p>The creature which mooueth often himselfe, and speaketh with the moouing of handes, is thought vncleanly: yet of a readie wytte, and quick vtteraunce, and sometimes knowne to be a deceyuer.

               <p>The person which speaketh and soundeth the voyce through the nosethrilles, is affirmed to be full of wordes, a lyar, malicious, enuious, and ioyeth in the harmes of another: and such a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth imitate the nature of the Ducke.

               <p>THe minde, after the opinion of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, is much delighted with laughter: yet the ouermuch laughter, is named of most men, a laughter out of course, and argueth besides a small vnderstanding and simple wyt.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Of which, the common Prouerbe ryfe, and often divulgated of the wise is, that in the mouth of a foole, much laughter consisteth: the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth

Catullus, that singuler Poet, in thys Sentence.</p>
               <lg>

                  <l>in iesture and grace.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Here conceaue, that through the Milte for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med bigge: such a creature is procured to laugh much: &amp; otherwise is it, when in the contrary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as some report. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> learned <hi>Isidore (in. xi. ethymolagiarum)</hi> vttereth, that the Mylt to be so named of the supplying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same: which properly lyeth on the contrary part of the liuer, to the ende the same should not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist or remaine emptie. The Gaule is knowne to be an apt receptacle &amp; blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the creature, which by due worke of nature sendeth or receaueth into it the choller. The Mylt also some suppose to be the procurer and moouer of laughter, seing by it we are especially caused to laughe. By the Gaule (if we may credite <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p>So that the persons which sufficiently laughe, are denoted (after the agréement of wryters) to be beninge and gentle, quyet, beloued (for their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4287:166"/>
curteous behauiour) of all persons, yet lightly endamaged or harmed, although such are smally carefull for any: and these besides are of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunt comlynesse (sayth the Phisiognomer) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto the Sanguine, and Iouiall persons.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The creature which reasonably laugheth, is argued to be giuen to myrth, and one of a good qualitie, and that ioyeth much in the veneriall acte: especially, if the eyes appeare smyling.</p>
               <p>The ouermuch laughter exercised (as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> vttereth vnto king <hi>Alexander</hi>) remoueth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and hasteth olde age in that creature: for trouth, with such willingly (sayth the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer) is no societie or felowship to be vsed: in that these lack wytte, and are nothing at all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret:
<pb facs="tcp:4287:167"/>
yet these (after some wryters) are reported to be seruiceable, and painefull in their doings.</p>
               <p>Such persons which are séene sildome to laugh, are indicated to be of a déepe vnderstanding, and knowne faythfull as certayne report: and this of the Phisiognomer obserued, and noted in sundrie honest and vertuous persons: which he knewe to be searchers, of déepe and hid secrets. The cause euidently appeareth, and is knowne to be a déepe thinking and reatch, which consisteth in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that remoueth the laughter. Of which, such a creature that much and often laugheth (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue vttered) bethinketh or museth on no seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and déepe matter, nor maketh anye solemne, or wittie discourse with himselfe.</p>
               <p>Certayne of the auncient report, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is hardly procured to laugh, is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be wittie, a foreséer of matters vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, nyggardly: and verie studious in the Arte, which he daylie exerciseth: yet suche a creature (sayth the Phisiognomer) is prone to be a surmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and yrefull.</p>
               <p>The person which is heard to laugh lowde or a highe, with a certaine noyse decerned in the laughter, is indicated, by the report of some wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to be inuericundious: and rashe in actions.</p>
               <p>Such a creature, that (without cause pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured) laugheth, and in his laughing, séemeth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4287:167"/>
to coughe, or gape, or to draw the head awry: is indicated to be variable of purpose and minde, enuious, lightly or soone credyting, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible eyther vnto the good or euill, as <hi>Loxius,</hi> and <hi>Phylemon</hi> report.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Conciliatore</hi> in his Rubricke of of Phisiognomie vttereth, that the creature coughing when he laugheth, or is at the instaunt encumbred with the hardnesse and shortnesse of breath: is iudged to be inuericundious, fierce, and a Tyraunt: as the like, the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued and noted, in a certaine Prince of Lumbardie.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Certaine of the worthie Phisiognomers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that whose chéekes are discerned often is
<pb facs="tcp:4287:168"/>
smyle, is denoted to be of an euill minde, of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse cogitation, and a lyar: and such persons generally, or for the more part, are malicious, &amp; dissemblers: so that these are not friendly to be trusted, but rather to be doubted, if we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the Phisiognomer: when the like especially is matched, and ioyned with other accydences of the minde: and that their eye lids appeare wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled togither, with the eye browes ioyned, or in a clowdie forme gathered: such are then shedders of bloud, murderers, robbers, or théeues by Sea, and lande: as the Phisiognomer often obserued and noted in many, which were the like.</p>
               <p>The creature that smyleth vnto himselfe when he talketh: is indicated to be foolish, and of a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnderstanding, as the like the Phisiognomer obserued in a certaine Italian: and such are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to abounde, in the Melancholick qualitie.</p>
               <p>The chéekes decerned wrything in the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as they were so procured in the derision of an other: doe witnesse such a person to be arrogant, deceytfull, couetous, a lyar, yrefull, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer or vtterer of secrets.</p>
               <p>The person that lightly laugheth (sayth <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Scotus</hi>) is denoted to be simple of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, vnstable, vaine, lightly credyting, of a dull wyt, grosse in féeding, and seruicable, yet in factes or actions not secret.</p>

               <p>The breath decerned lowde, cut betwéene, and the sighe appearing the like, doth witnesse sorow, and heauinesse, for some losses happened to that creature.</p>

               <p>If the chinne shapeth or be formed into a round maner, doth indicate effeminate conditions, and a féeble courage: in that this is, a feminine note: as vttereth the auncient <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> For the mans chinne (after nature) ought to be formed, in a square maner, and not round.</p>
               <p>If the vnder chinne be séene so fatte, that the same retcheth downe to the throte, doth indicate most great luxurie, to consist in that creature: if a pitte or hole, be especiallye decerned in eyther chéeke.</p>
               <p>The chinne formed of a decent or comely big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, doth denote such a person to be prone vnto the veneriall act: yet iudge him, to be much bound vnto God, for the giftes lent him.

               <p>THe bearde in man (after the agréement of the auncient wryters) beginneth to appeare in the neather Iawe, which so ascendeth towarde the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4287:174"/>
Temples, through the heate and moysture, caried vnto the same, from the forepart of the heade, drawne from the genitours: which draw to them especially, the sperme from those places: whose note is, by reason the spermaticall veynes do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vnto the same place: as the lyke appeareth in them, which ouermuch exercise coeating, whose faces by the meanes, are after mightily crazed and altered. As touching the womans testicles, in that these are but weake, for the same cause are they knowne not to be bearded. And suche women which are found to haue these hoter than the common sort, haue also somewhat of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexed matter, from the same place: whence the Sperme most chiefely commeth. This reflexed heate (sayth the wise <hi>Conciliatore</hi>) draweth with it the moysture, of which in them are engendred the thinne and small heares of the Bearde: and thys especiallye verified in them, which vse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and verye much coeating. For which cause the Sanguine bodyes, that haue a thinne Beard, and meane of length: are indicated to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which often and greatly desire to coeate, through the dominion of the heate and moysture, consisting in them.</p>
               <p>The bearde in man, after the minde of the Philosopher, beginneth to spring out and appéere, after .xiiij. yeares of age: these by little and little,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:175"/>
                  <figure/>
appearing from day to day: and then beginneth the heares to appeare and growe on the 23u3rp s2cilp, of both the kinds.</p>
               <p>Here conceyue (sayth the Phisiognomer) that such heares doe procéede and appeare through the superfluousnesse of meates, and the fumosities of them, which dayly ascende on high vnto the partes of the Iawes: much lyke to the smoke of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen heated, that passeth so long through the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:4287:175"/>
thincks of the same, vntill those passages, through the heate are wholy stopped, that no more smoke can after passe through them. Euen the like, doe the fumosities of man issue forth, into the maner of heares: which are properly named the heares of the Bearde.</p>
               <p>The colour of the Beard, doth sometymes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the qualities &amp; quantityes of the humors: yet hitherto hath not the same béene heard of, that any man saw, a flaxen white bearde: for as much as the flegmaticke humor, is not founde so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as to engender heares of the lyke colour, through the depriuing and lack of naturall heate, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leuate the sufficient matter vnto the engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the lyke coloured heares.</p>
               <p>Here perhaps some will argue and affirme (sayth the Phisiognomer) that there is sundrie tymes séene women bearded, yet these are not founde of a flegmaticke qualitie, but rather the same doth happen in that the humors are so subtil, that of nature such are procured to be hote. For out of these creatures doe heares spring, yea they sometymes appeare on their Iawes: but proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these appeare about the mouth, where the more heate doth abounde: and such a woman (séene the lyke) is named of all men bearded: here conceyue (sayth <hi>Cocles</hi>) that the like woman founde, is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be verie luxurious through hir hote, and
<pb facs="tcp:4287:176"/>
moyst qualitie: of which the lyke creature séene, is not onely noted strong of nature, but to be of a stowte courage, and manly in hir factes.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The persite woman, is knowne to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently naked of heares, especially about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth: such a creature after Phisiognomie, is reported and iudged to be of a good qualitie: that is to say, bashefull, fearefull, honest, weake of courage, gentle of behauiour, and obedient.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:4287:176"/>Here (sayth the Phisiognomer) doth a solemne doubt arise, and the same is, why men are séene bearded, &amp; not women for the more part: which doubt séemeth to be put forth, by the learned <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lielmus Nurice:</hi> to which <hi>Cocles</hi> aunswereth in this maner, that the same maye be gathered to procéede, of the efficient, the materiall, and finall cause: for as much as these properly serue vnto an ornament, and comely bewtifying of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and in euerye kinde, the Males are séene comelyer bewtisted with the same, than the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males. Which condition of the heares, properly serueth vnto a defence of the iawes in man, that the woman (for the like defence and necessitie) nothing néedeth: at the least so much as the man: through which, the sense of féeling, is knowne to be of greater force in man. So that the man by this reason, may better indure to go barehea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and naked in other partes, in the bitter colde weather, than the woman: and suffer greater stormes on the bodye, than she maye, without harme to insue. A strenger reason maye be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and giuen of the effecient, and materiall cause, seing the Males in generall, are knowne to be whoter than the Females. For which cause, the fume in men, that is the matter precuring the heares, is founde both more, and mightier, than in women: which seing the same is knowne
<pb facs="tcp:4287:177"/>
not able to be consumed: for that cause (God and nature togither) ordayned two apt places in man, for the passages of them: as the one by the head, &amp; other fitly by the chinne &amp; iawes: which forme the beard of man. Which maner fumes consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the woman, for as much as they appeare not to be so many and mightie, as well knowne they are, to rest in the man: for this cause, are these properly and naturallye sent forth, by the heade. And a note of the like effect, we sundrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> times knowe and sée by women founde of a hote and moyste complexion, that appeare bearded: we sée contrariwise, that in the colde and dry men these (for the more part) haue verie little or no beardes. By which reason we gather (sayth the Phisiognomer) that the séemely beard, waxeth not in the gelded person: for as much as those partes haue then loste the benefite of their hotter qualitie, through which, these shoulde engender the hote humours and fumes, that properly are the matter of the heares in them. And by a like reason, of the former wordes it appeareth: that the thicknesse of the beard, and great hearinesse in generall, is an euidente note and iudgement of the substantiall heate and moysture, and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall strength consisting in that creature.</p>
               <p>Here may this argument also be propowned, that seing children are knowne to be hote and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4287:177"/>
moyst, why they waxe not bearded as men: to which doubt the Phisiognomer thus answereth, that the smokie superfluousnesse, which is the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall matter of the heares, that issueth forth of the heade, and other partes of the bodye doth in them passe, and serue to their increase, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment: the like wordes in a maner, appeare afore vttered by the singular <hi>Constantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conceaue (sayth the Phisiognomer) that how much the plentie and force of heate consisteth, so much the more store and quantitie of heares suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth in that creature. For which cause, a man must carefully beware of those persons, which ouermuch abounde in the most great store, and plentie of heares on the bodie: when the complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such, is especially founde adust.</p>
               <p>The Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> wylleth a man to beware of those persons, which haue a red beard: in that the same coloured bearde, indyeateth a heape &amp; an abundance of adustion, and a mightie hotenesse to consist in these creatures: through which, such are knowne to be luxurious, decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and lyars: and in them (by report of the Physiognomer) doe the principall heape of vices rest: vnlesse that grace &amp; godly education, séeme otherwise to contrarie the abouesayde.</p>
               <p>The bearde decerned comely, and well fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: doth innuate such a creature to be of a good
<pb facs="tcp:4287:178"/>
nature, of reasonable conditions, congruent to all thinges, and manered after his bringing vp. Contrariwise iudge of them, which haue the beard not séemely formed, or euill fashioned in the length: as appeare thin the gelded persons, which after these are depryued of their genytours, be then greatly chaunged, from the nature of men, into the condition of women: as reporteth <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, in libro de Animalibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The singuler Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles,</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and noted in sundrie subiects, which hauing long and séemely beardes: came after certaine yeares vnto a frensinesse, and some of them to be starcke foolishe.</p>
               <p>The Phisiognomer also reporteth, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and knewe sundrie creatures, which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing and hauing verie long beardes, fell from their estate, and were oppressed with myseries, and these in his time: yea he knewe and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode of certaine noble persons, which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled their proper country, and of these especially in the precincts of <hi>Italie.</hi> The like iudgement (sayth the Phisiognomer) may in a maner be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, of the beard decerned soone hoarie: as afore was taught, in the chapiter of the heares in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: for as muche as their nature then is knowne, to drawe néere vnto the womans.</p>
               <p>Of which, the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> willeth
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4287:178"/>
                  <figure/>
and warneth the Princes, &amp; noble persons with him, to beware and take héede of such persons wearing verie thicke and long beardes: in that their faces then can not bewray or open the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the minde, nor the chaunging or altering of colours, can perfitly be decerned in these: so that their deceytes, and coloured pretenses, may be couered and lye hid by that meanes. Yet doe I not disalowe the wearing of long and thicke beards altogither, but that the same may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dablie, and verie well be worne, without anye such cryme to be founde, and lying hidde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnder. For well knowne it is, that sundrie Realmes alowe, and customablye weare long beardes, as the <hi>Medians,</hi> the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> and sundrie other Countries, through

the general influences of the heauens, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure or cause newe condicions, and alterations of apparayle: as the Phisiognomer like obserued and noted, of the force and effect of the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, that hapned of the vpper Planets <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in his time: which thus met togyther in the yeare of our Lorde. 1484. and in the last degrée of that signe <hi>Scorpio:</hi> whose mightie effect in generall contynued, vnto the yeare of our redemption. 1504. and to the tenth daye of Iune.

               <head>The condition and iudgement of the necke. The. xxxv. Chapter.</head>
               <p>COnceyue (sayth the Phisiognomer) that the necke is sometymes taken and vsed for the whole, conioyned to the head, in the forepart, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4287:180"/>
                  <figure/>
like in the hinder part. But this sometymes vsed and taken for the hinder part, in the diameter or space, where the cares are scituated: and this part of him is deuided into two partes. So that the part néerer to the heade, is named the nape or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the neck: that is, the toppe of the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cke behinde, where the beginning of the sinewes is placed. Yea the nape or hinder part of the necke, is vsed or taken with some practicioners, for the whole necke, as hereafter a lyke matter shall bée alleaged and vsed of the Phisiognomers.</p>
               <p>But the Phisiognomers in their iudgements, doe distinguish the necke, and nape in the hinder part: for in the fore part, they take and vse the wea<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ande, the throte bole, and whole throte vnto
<pb facs="tcp:4287:181"/>
the roote of the conioyned, according to the minde of the Philosopher. The lyke wordes vttereth <hi>Isidore, in libro. 11. cap. 1.</hi> This named the necke, in that the same is formed stiffe, and rounde as a piller, to beare vp the heade: whose forepart (of him) named, aptly the throte: and the hinder part not without good reason, the necke.</p>
               <p>This singuler <hi>Isidore</hi> reporteth, that such a person hauing the necke formed bigge, not by reason of the fleshinesse, but through cause of the bignesse of bones, &amp; the sinewes: is denoted strong of bodie, applyed for the same, vnto the male kind, and according to the condicions of the spirite: in that the male after the kinde, is knowne to haue a bigge and liuely neck: the same neyther short nor formed to long: which (by agréement of the most Phisiognomers) indicateth a hote qualitie, and boldenesse to consist in that creature.</p>
               <p>The seconde note séemeth to be, that such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the necke formed long and slender, are iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be feminine in condicions and weake of courage. The necke decerned bigge and liuely, as aboue vttered: doth denote the strength of the Braine: and by the consequent, a hotenesse of the heart: as all men are lyke knowne, in their kind.</p>
               <p>The necke séene long and slender, doth signifie the contrarye, vnto the abouesayde: that is, the weakenesse of body, and to be faint hearted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:4287:181"/>

               </p>
               <p>Such hauing the necke formed bigge, through a fleshinesse, and not by reason of the bignesse of the sinewes, and bones (and as <hi>Rasis</hi> addeth) found hard and strong: are knowne to be yrefull, applyed for the same vnto the apparant congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, of the yrefull Bulles prouoked or styrred to yre, which then haue such a forme and condition of the necke: and as <hi>Rasis</hi> addeth, such also are knowne to be rashe, and hastie in their déedes.</p>
               <p>The neck decerned sufficient bigge, not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the fleshinesse, but through cause of the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, and bones, and sufficient long séene: are reported to be bolde, and stowte of courage: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed for the forme, vnto the stowte Lyon. This especially is verified, when the heade, and necke,
<pb facs="tcp:4287:182"/>
is orderly proportioned, in such maner, that the same be of a meane bignesse, as the learned <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliatore,</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> write.</p>
               <p>The forme of the heade, if the same shall be of a meane bignesse, and the neck formed somewhat bigge: doth indicate a goodnesse of the qualitie, and disposition.</p>
               <p>If the heade shall be decerned small, and the necke seene bigge, doth denote the abundaunce of matter, and the superfluousnesse of the same: the lacke also of the vertue performing, in the due proportion. Such a heade (as certaine report) is many tymes grieued with much paine, and the Cephalicke passion.</p>
               <p>The necke decerned verie long, and slender (as aboue vttered) is iudged fearefull, applyed for the forme vnto the Hart: in that the Hart is knowne to be a beast very fearefull, and hath a very long neck, and small formed, in the respect of his body, and greatnesse.</p>
               <p>Yet the necke formed slender, and long, and that he beareth the same vpright in his going, doth indicate not so much fearefulnesse to consist in that creature, as aboue reported of the Hart.</p>
               <p>The necke séene very short, doth innuate such a person to be a deceiuer, and very craftie, applied for the forme vnto the Woolfe. And this note here taken of the apparant maner séene, both in men
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4287:182"/>
and beastes: in that a person, minding subtiltie to set vpon an other, whether the same be his emmie or otherwise attempting vpon pleasure: doth then wylily drawe and shrincke in the necke, for the more shortning of the same, that he maye not so soone be espyed in the stealing vpon: as by a lyke we dayly see in the Catte, when the (wyth the necke shruncke in) stealeth by little, and little, on the Mouse.</p>
               <p>Certaine report, that the necke formed long, signifieth the féete to be long: and the necke séene slender, doth indicate the feete to be slender.</p>
               <p>The neck formed behinde hollow, &amp; depressed or déepe in: doth denote a weakenesse of the sinewes, and sicknesses to ensue, according to the knitting of it in that creature.</p>
               <p>The necke formed very fleshie, doth witnesse such a creature to be a lyar, and vsing filthie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: and a meane necke séene, doth indicate the goodnesse of nature, to consist in that creature.</p>
               <p>The nape of the necke, next vnto the heade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, if the same be founde hearie: doth innuate such a person to be strong, and stowte of courage: in that this note appeareth to be a hotenesse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in that person.</p>
               <p>The neck formed long, and hauing a meanesse in the proportion: doth indicate malice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to consist in that person. And certayne
<pb facs="tcp:4287:183"/>
report, that such a creature to be a foole, weake of strength, fearefull, and full of wordes.</p>
               <p>The necke decerned verye bigge, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine length, yet the same not seene very fleshie: doth denote a strong person, stowte of courage, a boaster, and prowde: as <hi>Conciliatore</hi> reporteth, in his Rubricke of Phisiognomie.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The neck formed stiffe and strong, doth argue such a creature to be yrefull, hastie, and vnapt to learne. The good disposition also of the mynde, and humanitie: they say negatiuely to concurre, vnto such an operation.</p>
               <p>The necke with apparant sinewes, and euill formed, doth witnesse (by the report of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) a foolish person, and vnapt to learne.</p>
               <p>The necke decerned so louse, that the same sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to leane vnto the one side: doth innuate such
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4287:183"/>
a creature to harme those, that are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, wilfull, and deceytfull: as the learned <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliatore</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>Such that aboute the ioynt of the necke aboue, are séene ouer fleshie, be those which haue the knot bearing out, and the neck hardly moouing: and be also without féeling, to exercise the same orderly: yea such are knowne to be dull, &amp; vnapt to exercise good workes: yet these in the euill or wicked, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; to do iniuries, very prone and forward: as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in another place, the Phisiognomer obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And certaine Apostates and Princes, this <hi>Cocles</hi> sawe and noted, that mooued their neckes, neuer vnto the right, nor left side, without the moouing of the whole bodye togither: and such were knowne to be double tongued, dissemblers, and very wicked. But such which haue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this, shall you iudge (sayth he) to be of a contrary disposition, that is, honest conditioned, and gentle of behauiour.</p>
               <p>The necke formed long, with a largenesse in the positure: doth denote such a person to be yre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and vnapt to learne: applyed for the forme vnto the grunting Sowe.</p>

               <p>When a certaine bearing out shalbe betwéene
<pb facs="tcp:4287:184"/>
the knytting of the shoulder pointes, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the neck, that the growing out of the knottes be sharpe: doth inoicate such a creature (for the more part) to be prowde, and arregant: as the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued and noted many the like.</p>
               <p>The neck declyning or leaning vnto one side, doth innuate such a creature, to be of a dull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, and vnapt to learne.</p>
               <p>The neck bearing to much vpright, doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that creature, not only to be vnapt to learne, but high minded, and selfe willed: and one that will not be admonished, of nothing he doth.</p>
               <p>The neck decerned stiffe, and as the same were immoueable: doth like declare such a person, to be vnapt to learne, and vndiscréete in his doings, by which note (for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more part) such are knowne to be fooles.</p>
               <p>The difference betwéene the moouing, and not moouing of the neck, is easily decerned: so that the necke appearing fast or stiffe, or quick moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, doth witnesse the more foolishnesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in that creature: but if the same appeare stiffe, and in a maner fixed: doth demonstrate, dull capacitie, and the vnaptnesse to learne.</p>
               <p>That you may not much erre, the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doth here discouer and open, that there be some (which minding to hyde this note) in them
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4287:184"/>
the rather to beguile the iudger: doe vse custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably and oftentymes in the daye to rubbe, and chafe well their neckes with a warme lynnen cloth: whereby these maye moue and turne the heade hyther and thither, somewhat the easier in couering by such meanes their foolishnesse. As the like note the Phisiognomer obserued in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Citizen of <hi>Bononia,</hi> in <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> which creature besides as he talked, manye times smy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to hymselfe. So that by this appeareth, that the stiffe turning of the necke: is a note, of the proper foolishnesse to consist in that creature: by the report of the Physiognomer.</p>

               <p>The neck decerned bending toward the breast: doth innuate such a person to be much encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with cares, and thoughts: yea this creature sometimes occupied with niggardship, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moued (with that euill vice) of malignity.</p>

               <p>The neck decerned leaning vnto the right side, doth denote such a person to be wyttie, of séemely maners and conditions, and circumspect in the actions that he attempteth or goeth about. But the neck séene leaning vnto the left side, doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue such a creature to be currishe or churlishe, rashe in his actions, and foolishe: as the learned <hi>Conciliatore</hi> reporteth, in his Rubrick of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomie.</p>
               <p>The necke formed strong, and very bigge, whether the same be of length, and that this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye turneth: doth innuate such a person to bée a gréedie proller, and gatherer of goodes togither, howsoeuer the same be.</p>
               <p>The necke decerned crooking (after the bredth of the bodye) as eyther from the right, or the left side: doth denote suche a creature to be full of wordes, deceytfull, wily, and vnfaythfull: as the same, the Phisiognomer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny subiects. For which cause, this <hi>Cocles</hi> warneth a man, especially to eschew the felowship &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of such, which of nature are wrte necked: &amp; haue a drawing in, or narrownesse to be decerned betwéene the shoulder poyntes: in that these are knowne to be wicked persons, enuious, fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,

and hypocrytes: as the same, the Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Cocles</hi> obserued, in sundrie of the obseruant brothers in his tyme, and in many Melancholicke persons.</p>
               <p>The necke formed in a meane maner, both in the bignesse, and length: doth demonstrate such a person to be strong of nature, apt to learne, and of a singuler witte: but these oftentymes are knowne to haue a subtill or craftie witte, and to bée deceytfull.</p>

                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:4287:186"/>HEre conceyue (sayth the Phisiognomer) that such persons hauing the shoulder poyntes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently distant from the knottinesse or spondile of the neck, which first appeareth aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shoulders, where the shoulder poyntes or necke are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, and not to neare ioyned to it: are of a good nature, and hauing rype or good senses: and by the consequent of a good vnderstanding. The Philosopher in <hi>Methaphoricis,</hi> vttereth a reason of this, saying: that the shoulder poyntes beeing sufficiently soluble, that is, sufficiently distant from the spondile or knottinesse: in such maner, that the space betwéene them, be equall: doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note that such indiuiduates, readily receyue, that is, easily the sensitiue motion. For these haue the note, or sensitiue power easily mooueable, that is, lightly reducible from the power, vnto the act of perceyuing. But such which about the spondiles of the necke, appeare hidden: are noted to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons lacking witte: forasmuch as these hardlye (being soluble) which about the knottinesse are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned weake, to receiue the motion of the senses.</p>
               <p>The shoulder poyntes decerned sufficiently distaunt a sunder, doe denote such a creature to be liberall after nature, applyed for the same, vnto the decent apparancie and forme: for that lyberalitie, aunswereth and agréeth to suche a forme: and the like formed, are the shoulder

               <p>The shoulder pointes séene néere ioyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, doe contrariwise signifie niggardship, and vncurtesie to rest in that person.</p>
               <p>The shoulder pointes appearing sufficiently distaunt a sunder, and decently spaced from the knotte, or ioynt of the neck: doe argue such a person to be of a simple perceiuerance and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and by the consequent knowne to be a dullard: as the learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> wryteth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:4287:187"/>The shoulder poyntes (after the minde of the Phylosopher) well brawned with an eminencie or bearing out of the fleshe, and these strong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are applyed after nature, vnto the Male kinde. For as much as the nature of the muscle is to possesse the ingendred hotenesse strong, and of the reason of the heate is this procured, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the forme of the members, according to euerie Dametre.</p>
               <p>The shoulder points decerned bigge, &amp; large in forme: doe indicate a hotnesse to consist in that creature. The strength of euery person consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the sinewes and bones: for which cause when the muscles are sufficiently formed fleshie, then must néedes insue a mighty strength, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist both in the sinewes and bones: of which, the spirit conioyned in such an habitude or body, may well exercise, and attempt or doe strong actions, if néede requyreth.</p>
               <p>Of which, <hi>Rasis</hi> reporteth, that the shoulder pointes decerned large, doe indicate a strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of an honest minde, of good conditions, and perfite vnderstanding. The reason of this appée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, in that through the bredth of the shoulder pointes, the muscles are indicated to be large, and strong: which procéede from a strong begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that is in the braine, where the beginning consisteth of the sinewes, and the seate of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
<pb facs="tcp:4287:188"/>
So that of necessitie, this must néedes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, that the forme of the heade to be capable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the retayning and possessing the goodnesse of senses: as the Phisiognomer vttereth, of hys skill and practise knowne.</p>
               <p>The muscles formed weake, and yll compow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of strength, that the shoulder points appeare in a maner flatte, and peraduenture matched or couered with a softnesse of fleshe: doe argue a flegmatick qualitie, of the contrary nature to rest in that creature: as afore vttered in the proper place: and if these appeare and be without a soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they import the like qualitie, after the mind of the Phisiognomer.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Of which <hi>Rasis</hi> vttereth, that the shoulder pointes formed thinne: doe indicate the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

of wit and vnderstanding. The Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Cocles</hi> reporteth, that he knewe and sawe sundrie women in his time, which drew by Arte, and through their bestiall indumentes, the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der points so néere togither, that they formed in a maner the like, vnto <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A matter which séemeth in my opinion incredible to be exercised of any faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full christian, but the Phisiognomer séemeth tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to vtter, what he sawe and knewein sundrie places.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:4287:189"/>The bearing of the heades of the shoulder pointes verie farre out: doe denote foolishnesse to consist in that creature: which maner, <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth vnto king <hi>Alexander:</hi> to be a note of rygorousnesse, and vnfaythfulnesse to dwell in that person.</p>
               <figure/>

crooke backed, which were of a good nature: but that these hauing the like bearing out, or bunche on the shoulders, were rather trayterous, and verie wicked in their actions. And such (sayth the Phisiognomer) were knowne in his time, to be the founders of all wicked deceites, yea wylie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der myners and gropers of the people, and had a deepe retching wyt, and wylie fetches, in wicked actions. So that it seemeth impossible after na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that such deformed persons shoulde possesse in them laudable actions: for as much as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite connexed in such an habitude, doth yeelde a retrograde forme and propertie: which (sayth the the Phisiognomer) is knowne for the more part to be Melancholike. For which cause, a man ought carefully to beware and take héede, of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowshipping or kéeping company with such infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate persons, for the aboue sayde reason, and worke of nature. For these (sayth the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer) are the lyke to be eschewed, as a man of skill would refuse and shunne the company of a person lacking any principall member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. And the like <hi>Aristotle (in secretis secreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum)</hi> vttereth, that a man ought diligently to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and take héede of an infortunate person, lacking any speciall member, as he woulde of his proper animie daungerous.</p>
               <p>The prouerbe like warneth vs to beware, of
<pb facs="tcp:4287:190"/>
the creatures marked: &amp; in an other place, of the persons marked in anye member, that a man trust not them. The reason is, for that the spirites like insue vnto the forme of the body, so that out of an euill shaped bodie, can no lawdable actions procéede or be caused, as afore vttered: and this of him vttered Phisiognomically.</p>
               <p>The Philosopher also vttereth, that the great number of children liuing, is cause many tymes of the yll happe of parents. For these lacking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, for their naturall sustenaunce, are caused to worke mischiefes not tollerable by lawe. For the Phisiognomer learned, and saw sundry times that diuers fathers of many children, not able to prouide sustenaunce for them, were constrayned through great néede to steale, through which prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise exercised, their children like endeuoured, for the helpe of their parents néede, and confessed a lyke matter at the place of execution. So that the Philosopher giueth or sheweth this, not as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced precept, but rather perswadeth, that in the cause of a necessitie, the same to be procured as a rule in miserie: which to the beholder may lyke appeare. And the Mother Philosopher <hi>Asculanus</hi> vttereth, a summe of the matter afore taught.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4287:195"/>
singularitie of the wytte, the iestes and other skilles in euery creature. This also formed of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a strong helper, to retche and take vnto it all such things which are néedefull: so that this necessarily and aptlye serueth, both to take and doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Isy dore</hi> learnedly vttereth, that this part is named the hand, for that the same is the officer &amp; presenter vnto the whole bodye: and is the same which presenteth and ministreth meate vnto the mouth: which thus ministred: is after caried into all the partes of the body.</p>
               <p>This Authour nameth the paulme, to be the hande with the fingers stretched out, and the hand séemely drawne togither, to be the fiste of the creature.</p>
               <p>Those braunches of both the hands, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly named the fingers, which in number, are knowne to be ten, and decently matched or ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togither: For these we sée (sayth the Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer) that they both haue a perfite number, and a most decent order in their standing.</p>
               <p>The proper names of these, and their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, shall here briefly be touched: as first the same (so named the Thombe) in that this among the others, rendreth or gyueth a vertue and power: the seconde aptly named the shewing or pointing finger, and the saluting: for that with the same,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4287:195"/>
we in a maner salute all persons, and expresse with it most matters. The thirde properly named the infame, or middle finger, being the longest, which is much occupied about the lowe, and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing place. The fourth artly named the ring fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for that on the same, the wedding ring (for the more part) is worne. The fift rightly named the eare finger, for that with the same we daylie emptie and cleanse the eares: as to most men knowne, and exercysed the like at this day.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Formica</hi> wryteth, and of skill knowne, that it behooueth a man to learne and knowe first the quantitie of the hande, after the qualitie, substaunce, and condition of the same: for as much as the accydent notes yéelde and giue to euerye skilfull person a great perseueraunce and vnderstanding, to knowe and pronounce what these tende vnto: as reporteth <hi>Aristotle, in primo de Anima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The bignesse and shortnesse of the fingers, doe argue the paucitie or smalnesse of matter, and a flegmaticke qualitie: and that nature coulde not dispose and guide: of which the spirites then bée like to that nature. And of this such are noted foolish: and of the same mynde, is both <hi>Rasis,</hi> and <hi>Conciliatore</hi> and, <hi>Ptholomie</hi> the Philosopher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Formica</hi> wryteth, that verie necessarie is it to know, that the bignesse of the hande doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
<pb facs="tcp:4287:196"/>
procéede of great labour: and for that cause, such which labor much, haue bigge handes. Yet these sometymes, are bigge of nature: and then caused through the bignesse of the bones, and sinewes. Such a person whether the same be man or woman, is naturally strong. The same sometymes procéedeth, through the grossenesse of fleshe: and then such are drunkardes, lecherous, and (naturally) procured vile persons.</p>
               <p>If any hath the handes bigge, and fingers (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the endes of the nayles) sharpe: doe denote such a person to be deceytfull, and couetous.</p>
               <p>Forasmuch as the Phisiognomer hath expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in this hande herevnder placed, the most lynes knowne: and giuen names to them in the Latine tongue, with letters added to eche, for a better conceyuing, and knowing of them at any tyme.

               <p>He also reporteth, <hi>in differentia.</hi> 54. that the nayle is a bodye extensed thinne, produced &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the superfluities, and hardned on the fingers endes, for a speciall helpe to them being there situated; and groweth on the fingers endes and toes: as the heares, vttermost of the skinne, doe occupie on the bodie.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Auicen</hi> vttereth, that the nayles both on the fingers and toes, were ordayned in the endes of these members, the better to strengthen: for to take, and holde things firmely, and to couer the flesh at the endes: which ioyntly being well mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, giue a more strength. This well appeareth, in that if any of the small bones be lacking at the endes of any of the toes, or fingers: then like doe the nayles, lacke at the endes of those members: as the same may euidently appeare, in any large scarre on the fleshe, where after groweth no heares to be séene. The maner also of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal &amp; cause of those nayles, is proportionall to the production of the heares, through the grosser su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities

               <p>The nayles playne, white, soft, and thinne, reddish, and sufficient cleare, doe indicate a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler witte in that person: and this is one of the notes, which very seldome fayleth: forasmuch as such nayles, doe procéede of the best qualitie, as <hi>Albertus</hi> reporteth: so that the spirites which produce the nayles delated (from the heart) are cleare and thinne: through whose superfluitie, are the nayles engendred.</p>
               <p>The nayles rough, and harde, doe denote such a person to be prone to the venereall act: as the learned <hi>Morbeth</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>The nayles ouer short, doe argue wickednesse in that creature.

These also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the minde (of the Phisitions) with a leannesse of the fingers: doe witnesse a consumption of the bodie.</p>
               <p>When the nayles fall of, without cause: doe threaten the leaprie to come, or euen at hande: as the learned <hi>Conciliatore</hi> vttereth.</p>
               <p>The childe borne without nayles, or hauing them but weake: doth witnesse the mother to haue vsed the dayly continuance, or ouermuch eating of salt: as witnesseth the Philosopher <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle, in septimo de natura animalium. cap. 4.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ptnolomie</hi> the Philosopher reporteth, that the nayles long, doe signifie pouertie to that person, and to liue in bare estate or beggerie, all his lyfs tyme. The same is confirmed of <hi>Pontius Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>I much maruayle (sayth the Phisiognomer) that all the legitimate authours doe affirme: that the white prickes in the nayles: to signifie happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and friendes: which (as it shoulde séeme) hath many tymes béene obserued and noted, and iudged of the Phisiognomer, by the order of the fingers: as thus, the white prickes séene in the Sunnes finger, doe signifie the encrease of honor, worship, offices, and friendship with noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. &amp;c. The reason of this is, forasmuch as these denote a good humour, and benigne, presupposing there a good qualitie, and vnderstanding: of which a good discretion, and curtesie ensueth: so that such persons through the same, do attaine friends and commended of many. The lyke pricks founde
<pb facs="tcp:4287:205"/>
in the little finger: doe denote friendship with the <hi>Mercurians:</hi> and that Mercurie to be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, and stronge, in that place aboute. &amp; <hi>similia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the blacke prickes séene in the nayles, and chiefly in the middle finger, doe argue harmes, persecutions, imprisonment, and all kindes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimentes, that may happen to any: as the same the Phisiognomer vnderstood of a certaine friend, which noted the lyke in many persons. And these he reported to like succéede, according to the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of the fingers: forasmuch as the infortune, and losse of richesse happened after the positure of them on the fingers.</p>
               <p>But some Autours report, that these doe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate hatred. The reason of this is, through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the drie Melancholie, which then aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: and lacke of the naturall heate, which fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. So that the blacke prickes, doe alwaye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, that the colde Melancholie, and an earthly drynesse to insue. Yet it séemeth to mée (sayth the Phisiognomer) that experience maye contradict the same, séeing I haue alwayes séene (sayth he) that the blacke and white prickes on the nayles to come, and passe awaye, within a fewe dayes: and that these to be caused, of determinate effectes: which otherwyse can not procéede or be caused, but through the Periode and course of the

               <p>THe breast is that part, which conteyneth the spirituall members: for that in it are certaine partes conteyning, and certaine conteyned. The partes conteyning are fower, that is, the fleshe, the brawnie part, the pappes, and the bones. The partes conteyned are eyght, that is, the hart, the lungs, the pannycles, the ligaments, the sinewes, the veynes, the arteries, and <hi>Hysophagus.</hi>

               <p>The Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> vnto king <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> vttereth, that the largenesse of the breast, and bignesse of the shoulders, and back: doe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue such a person to be honest, bolde, of a readie vnderstanding and wyttie.</p>

               <p>When the weysande beneath, shall be farre dystant from the shoulders, and large: doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note such a person, to be of a féeble courage.</p>
               <p>The weysand being a meane, doth then argue
<pb facs="tcp:4287:209"/>
such a person, to be honest conditioned, &amp; strong. These hytherto <hi>Conciliatore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here conceaue that the weysande appearing emynent, and large, doth denote an effeminate person, especially if he be double chinned.</p>
               <p>The breast large, and well proportioned, with the other parts large, is a most perfit &amp; true note to be conceyued in euery creature, forasmuch as this largenesse of the breast, is proper to man.</p>
               <p>The breast thinne, and weake compowned, doth argue a weake courage and will, after the minde of certaine Autours.</p>
               <p>The breast thick couered with fleshe, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note such a person to be vngratefull, as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer reporteth.</p>
               <p>Whose breast is mightily bending in, and that the Muscles so procéeding, that through these are caused (lyke to an hollownesse) doth denote a peruerse person and wicked. When this is verye emynent, the heart of such a person is hote, of a small vnderstanding, &amp; daylie wéepeth, or singeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rasis</hi> affirmeth, that the qualitie of the heart, if it shall be hote: doth argue the pulse to be quick mouing and often, and the breath fast.</p>
               <p>Much heare seene on the breast, and thick, and that in the féeling the same perceyued hote: such a qualitie of the heart, doth demonstrate that person to be bolde, sturdie, and verie yrefull.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:4287:209"/>The composition of the body, both in the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and smalnesse, is to be considered: for that the same demonstrateth the qualitie of the heart.</p>
               <p>So that the breast formed bigge, doth argue properly the hotenesse and bignesse of the heart: and this the more confirmed, if (with the same) the heade appéereth small, or that it be not bigge: which if it shall so be, a man néedeth not to haue regarde vnto any other signes.</p>

               <p>The colde qualitie of the heart, doth procure a weake pulse, and féeble breath: through which the breast is caused to possesse fewe heares on it, &amp; those but small: so that the breast by the meanes, is found colde in the féeling. The person being of such a qualitie, is noted fearefull, and stuggish.</p>
               <p>The qualitie drie, hath a hard pulse, and is the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the bodie brawned, &amp; swartish of colour.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4287:210"/>
both thick and harde.</p>
               <p>But the moyst complexion, doth cause a soft pulse, the breast naked of heares: the fleshe also softe and gentle: and such a person is noted effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</p>
               <p>The complexion or qualitie hote and drie, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a harde and quick pulse, and the same often: and engendreth much heare both thick &amp; stiffe, on the breast, and on the thighes. The breath also out of the same qualitie, procéedeth both great and often: and the whole bodye besides is in the féeling decerned hote, and brawned, and the vey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes apparaunt. The person being of this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is noted yrefull and obstynate.</p>
               <p>But the qualitie decerned colde and moyste, worketh the contrarie to these aboue vttered: these hytherto the wordes of the auncient <hi>Rasis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To come vnto the matter and purpose (sayth <hi>Cocles</hi>) that is, when the breast is founde well compowned, and orderly formed, doth indicate strength, manlynesse, boldnesse, the others lyke, and aunswering, which properly belong vnto the man, as the Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> meaneth: and such a habitude ought not to appéere much fleshy, nor so soft in the féeling, as the softnesse of the woman.</p>
               <p>The lyke wordes vttereth, the singuler Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition <hi>Galen:</hi> that the bodye appearing not ouer
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4287:210"/>
fatte, nor ouer leane, and contynuing the lyke: doth argue such a person to lyue long: yet the body decerned rather leane than fatte, is the more commended, and doth lyue longer: after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement of the learnedst Phisitions.</p>
               <p>The veynes of fatte bodyes, are euermore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned narrowe: whereof such appeare to haue but a weake and small breath, and little bloude consisting in the speciall partes of the bodye. Of which, such growing elder in yeares, are reported to be short lyued: and to be abreuiated lyfe, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a fewe, and these small accydences to insue.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4287:211"/>When any considereth a subiect, let him first (sayth the Phisiognomer) marke the condition of the breast, after the forme of the head, and other members of the body. For if the breast be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med large, and bearing out, and the head séeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bigge, with a shortnesse of the neck, doth then indicate the hotnesse of the heart, so that there appeareth a nakednesse of heares: which after nature doth procéede, through a largenesse of the powers consisting in that creature, that properly can not retayne the matter of the heares: or else of the occasion, that the straightnesse of the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be so narrowe and close, that these let the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing forth of the heares, after the due propertie and course of nature.</p>
               <p>As touching the leane bodies after nature, these are in a contrarie maner formed to the fatte: for as much as their principall members are knowne to be open, and able (by the report of the Phisiognomer) to indure but small matters, and traueyles. But the persons knowne of a temperate qualitie, &amp; dyeting themselues dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, or rather after discretion, that these maye so waxe fatte: are by that meanes procured, that their veynes and arteries are caused strong, and indure large. Of which, their heate (by that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) is not so soone extinguished: as the singuler Phisition <hi>Galen</hi> vttereth. So that such an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4287:211"/>
with the Phisiognomer, is accounted law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and this generally ment in all the body.</p>
               <p>Here conceaue (sayth <hi>Cocles</hi>) that the heart in man, is cause of all the workings, if the principal members are duelie formed: of which, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and malice of minde insueth, according to the positure of dyuers partes in the creature.</p>
               <p>The contrarie of this is to be iudged: when as the neck is long, the breast large, with a much quantitie of heares, as in sundrie places afore vttered.</p>
               <p>The thinnesse of flesh on the breast, with a due proportion of the other members: doth argue hotnesse of the heart, and by the consequent, a warlike boldenesse: as appeareth in the cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke. And as the lyke, by the former words afore may be gathered.</p>
               <p>Of which, the authoritie of <hi>Flauius Vegetius</hi> witnesseth, that the yong man fitte to be trained vp in the warres, must haue a quick, &amp; readie eie, an vpright necke, large breasted, the shoulders brawned, or fast of fleshe, the handes and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers strong, wyth longer armes, after the forme of the body, a meane belly, the legges sufficient fleshie, and strong sinewed, and rather meane, than tall of stature: for that a strong and hardie Souldiour, is more to be preferred, than a tall &amp; bigge person. And of this diligent héede must be
<pb facs="tcp:4287:212"/>
                  <figure/>
gyuen, to the proportion of the members.</p>
               <p>¶ The forme of the pappes is to be considered: which (as it is written) are compowned of white flesh, hauing many kernels, &amp; little holes like to a spunge, through the veynes, arteries, &amp; sinewes: and of this, they be ioyned with the heart, the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and the braine, with the generatiue mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>If the pappes of anye man séeme to hange
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4287:212"/>
                  <figure/>
downe, (in a maner) like to the womans, and compassedwith soft fleshe, doe denote effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and intemperancie.</p>
               <p>The Philosopher <hi>Ptholomie</hi> reporteth, that hée (which on the left side, of the breast) hath a bigge fleshie Mole, high out, and round, with one, or many heares on it, doth then promise the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of riches and honor. This experienced of <hi>Pontius Gallicus,</hi> &amp; of the Physiognomer <hi>Cocles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such women which haue bigge pappes, and shorte: are denoted sluggishe, and rammishe of smell, as some affirme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4287:213"/>Such women which haue no veynes, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on the breasts, are vnfitte to giue suck vnto children: For that such a positure doth argue a flewmatick, and an inordinate matter. Such wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men also are of a rude nature, and beastly: and giue sucke with paine, through some gréeuous accydence.</p>
               <p>The pappes of (a meane bignesse) not soft, and the veynes apparant, and straight out: doe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a good mylche Nurse: especially if hir skinne be swartishe in colour.</p>
               <p>The pappes small and leane, or slender tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe drynesse: doe denote such a woman, to be weake of body.</p>
               <p>When the pappes beginne to arise, then doe they denote, that (such shortly after) to be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto the veneriall acte.</p>

               <p>But such a creature which hath the space, consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the nauill vnto the breast lesser in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, than the same which is from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breast, vnto the neck, hath (by the report of the Phisiognomer) a great or large stomack: the stomack here ment, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proper belly: of which this person is knowne (of obseruation) to be weake of body, &amp; short liued. The reason of this is, in that the bellye, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the stomacke consisteth colde, through the smalnesse of the same: of which, this ventricle or stomack (sayth the Phisiognomer) doth not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and well digest, but rather ingendreth su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities in it: and of the same, such are prone vnto diseases or sicknesses, and to be short lyued. And the multitude of sicknesses procured in that creature, are occasioned and caused through the intensed hotnesse, which the same purchaseth, and by the meanes of the bowelles, and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers néere placed: that hastily drawe from the stomack, the meate by a force vndigested.</p>

               <head>The signification and iudgement by the notes of the belly. The. xlvii. chapter.</head>
               <p>THe Phylosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth here instruct, howe a man maye Physiognomate by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude of the belly: in that the belly is knowne to be the same, which receyuing the meate (as <hi>Isy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> reporteth) doth throughly digest it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyeth the excrementes forth, that be superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for which cause, this of nature formed, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and appearing outward.</p>
               <p>Suche which are sufficient fatte aboute the bellye, that is, well brawned, and that the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye beare not to much outwarde: are denoted strong after nature, applyed for the forme, vnto the male kinde. And such a condition of it, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be naturall: so that the composition of the belly (after the minde af <hi>Constantine</hi>) is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fleshie after nature, yea hotte, and moyste: and this, through the occasion of digestion proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Of which <hi>Rasis</hi> vttereth, that such creatures
<pb facs="tcp:4287:219"/>
which possesse bigge bellies after nature, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be libydinous, great féeders, and that spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily digest meates.</p>
               <p>Such creatures which are decerned in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie condition to this, as hauing flatte bellyes, not sufficient brawned, and these founde soft: are denoted and iudged to be weake of body, and for the forme, applyed vnto the apparaunt congruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. In that we commonly sée (sayth the Physiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer) that such possessing leane bellyes, procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of anye accydent, as eyther of to much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, or of a sicknesse caused, or procured other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of any accydentall cause: are argued to be vnapt to learne, and to conceaue déepe matters, yea weake of body and courage. And howe long soeuer such continue in the like passion, and so long they tende or leane vnto the womanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions and courage: after the agréement of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, Albertus, Conciliatore,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth also vtter, <hi>in secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis secretorum,</hi> that he which possesseth a bigge belly: is denoted and iudged to be an vndiscréete person, prowde, foolishe, and often desiring to coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, for the hotnesse resting in him.</p>
               <p>A meaue proportion and forme of the bellye decerned, with a narrownesse of the breast, doth indicate such a creature to be of a déepe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, of a good discretion and wytte, of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4287:219"/>
conuersation and trustie. For a meanesse of the belly (sayth the Phisiognomer) is procured of a hotnesse, proportioned in that creature, of which, lawdable spirites insue. Where the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher vttereth, wyth a strayghtnesse of the breast: this is here ment to be formed with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the same breast: for if this should be compowned with an ouermuch largenesse, it woulde indicate a hotenesse of the heart in that creature, to hinder vnderstanding. Of the same minde and iudgement (by the report of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomer) is the learned <hi>Loxius,</hi> where he wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, that such a forme of the belly is knowne to be soft. <hi>Conciliatore</hi> reporteth that the bignesse of the belly, doth denote an ouermuch desire vnto the veneriall acte. Whose stomacke and belly are decerned fleshier, are reported to be strong.</p>
               <p>He also affirmeth, that the belly soft in youth, doth witnesse: that the same in many to become flatte &amp; drawne togither in olde age, &amp; <hi>econtra:</hi> of which this lyke, doth indicate a heauinesse in olde age. The learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> vttered vnto the mighty king <hi>Alexander,</hi> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> person hauing a great belly, to be vndiscréete, foolish, prowde, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to coeate. A meanesse of the belly decerned (as aboue taught) with a decent narrownesse of the breast: wytnesseth a déepenesse of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and readie counsaile in that creature. These

hitherto <hi>Conciliatore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The bignesse of the bellye, procéedeth of the great heate, reuerberating in the emptinesse of the same: especially, vnto the region of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors. In that (as it is sayde) the vertue Morall or intellectiue, is not scituated in a body ouer hot: and of this, such are procured to be vndiscréete, and foolishe. Such also are noted to be great drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, gluttonous féeders, and delighted in slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnesse: and gyuing their minds much to luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. As hath bene noted in sundrie persons, which ledde an easie lyfe.</p>
               <p>A hearinesse decerned on the belly, doth argue such a person to be full of wordes: applyed for the forme, vnto the kinde of birdes: in that it is knowne, that the propertie of such, which are thus hearie on the bellye, to be talkatiue, and full of wordes: and this note onely conceyued and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, of the chattering of birdes: which through their light spirites, are thus mooued to chatter: and the lesser birdes are knowne much lowder to sing: and to haue many more notes, as the Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale, and such lyke, which are so procured and caused through the subtilnesse of their bloud, and lightnesse of the spirites: in that these are of an ayreall nature, through which, they are so lightly mooued vnto myrth, and diuers desires, which in theyr many songs, and chaunging of notes, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4287:220"/>
to expresse. And the Cockes of those kinde, more exercise song, than the Hennes doe, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are formed hoter, and by the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent haue subtiller bloud, and lighter spirites, than the Hennes. And that hearinesse, or manye more feathers appearing on theyr bellyes, procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth through the abundance of the heate vapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, in that the same more aboundeth in this place, through the digestion there bearing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sway: whose note is, that the fleshe of theyr bellyes is found farre swéeter, and more sauerie in taste, than any part of their bodyes besides: so that of the lyke causes, sundrie men are knowne to be very hearie on the belly. Of which, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, in that these possesse a subtill bloud, and light spirites, through the light motion of bloud, and the spirites. For that cause, are diuers fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in those subiectes, lightly procured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in minde, which, of them vttered in theyr speach, and talke. So that of these, a certaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the cause appeareth, why the chattering, and many wordes in them, doe indicate a heari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to consist about their Bellies.</p>
               <p>The Phisiognomer knew sundrie persons of the like condition, which were very leacherous, and that much desired to frequent the same. And the lyke condicioned creatures (sayth <hi>Cocles</hi>) are these knowne to be, which possesse or haue but a
<pb facs="tcp:4287:221"/>
short space, betwéene the heart and braine: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if such are found Collericke. Thus by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent considering the notes, in this Arte taught: maye a man attaine, vnto manye other hidde se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of this Arte, not here vttered.</p>
               <p>Here note, that <hi>Ptholomie</hi> the Philosopher, and <hi>Pontius Gallicus</hi> wryte, that he which hath one line on the nauill, doth signifie knowledge, and skill in Artes. He which hath two lynes vnder the nauill, is iudged to be a person, which shall haue many wiues. If thrée lines be séene vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nauil, than doth it denote, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such a person shall haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children. If foure lines there appeare, then doe they promise long lyfe, vnto that perso. And if fiue lynes be there séene, then doe they denote great aduauncement, or great honour, vnto that person. But if any vnder the nauill, shall haue two vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall lynes: is then iudged to be a person so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that there is little trust to be had in him. &amp;c.</p>

And that the largenesse or breadth of his bodie, to be lyke so much: for howe much the distaunce is, betwéene the two endes of the middle fingers (the armes and handes) stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out: and so much is the distance betwéene the crowne of the heade, and sole of the foote. By this reason also (the olde wryters) named man, the little worlde: in that if a circle were drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, he woulde then be founde as wholye round. For which cause, if any person doth excéede this quantitie of length, he is then noted to be tall and long of stature: but the person which lacketh of this, or is lesser of stature (then this discription

of quantitie. For in those (as the Physiognomer affirmeth) the bloude, the liuely spirite, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate hastily and swiftly procéede, and are moued from the heart vnto the braine, or vnto the cogitatiue vertues: in which such a motion is on the small, and short space: and euen the same is in very small persons, in as much as by the quantitie of the body. Although the Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher séemeth in the first, to Physiognomate by the smalnesse of the body, in comparing vnto the chollericke complexion, or the hote and drie qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. And the Philosopher meaneth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the smalnesse signifieth a sharpnesse of wyt, and the goodnesse of perceyuing, in as much as is of that quantitie: yet by reason of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the small which are of a drie qualitie, which he meaneth, vsing hote and drie meates: and such which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde in the hotnesse of body: as if he sayde, the small chollerick in qualitie, and in whome a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and superfluous hotnesse consisteth, and that lesser beare sway, doe performe little or nothing, that is, they are alwaies vnapt or vnable vnto the performing, and perceyuing, especially vnto the well iudging or decerning. For the motion of the bloude and spirites in them is ouer swift, and by reason of the smalnesse of the space, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much hotnesse causing them cursible, that they

neuer can consist in the same, as this in perfitely perceyuing and knowing. In the second, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher instructeth to Phisiognomate by the greatnesse of bodye, in comparing the same vnto the cold complexion and moyst or flegmatick. In the thirde the Phylosopher vttereth, to Physiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomate by the smalnesse of bodye, in comparing the same vnto the colde and moyste complexion. And he meaneth, that the small which are of a colde and moyst complexion: are perfite, that is apt vnto the performing: although the bloud and spirite in these are moued vnto the hart spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, for the smalnesse of space: yet neuerthelesse caused vnmoueable, by reason of the complexion or coldnesse, in that moysture restrayne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h, the dryth and heate: and thus of the short and swift motion of those spirites, by reason of the space: and in a slowe maner, by reason of the moysture of those spirites, shall the motion be caused com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurated, and both a meane and temperate, apt vnto the perfourming: In the fourth he Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomateth by the greatnesse of bodye, by a comparison vnto the hote and dry complexion: in that such are perfite and quick in conceauing. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in those the space of motion be great, yet the bloud and spirite in them are verie swift moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by reason of the great heate: and on such wise in these, is a temperament of motion cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4287:241"/>
and are apt vnto the performing. Here is to be conceaued, that although the hote and dry, and generally the chollerick, are of a difficill or hard conceauing, and of a dull wytte, by reason of the dryth, which hardly receaueth: neuerthelesse the chollerick bigge in bodye, are more perfite, and apter conceaue then the small in quantitie of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For when these giue and apply their wit vnto the conceauing and attayning of any thing, they long retayne the same with them: and although they haue the spirite and bloud moueable, yet for that the space of the motion is great, for that cause, before any other thing or matter occurreth, they first conceaue and take, &amp; strongly retaine. For a more drynesse than moysture, consisteth in the hinder part of the braine of this creature. So that drinesse hath the propertie to attaine and receaue with difficultie, and when this hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued a forme, the same purchased, it retayneth for a long tyme: which contrarie is of the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. For the moysture or moyst braine behinde doth lightly receaue a forme, and soone looseth the same: in that the formes which are imprinted in the moysture, are not preserued any long tyme: but soone vanishe awaye. And for as much as the chollerick small in body, doe not so long consist in any maner, that any forme in their spirite can be fixed: yet are these neuerthelesse noted perfite, as
<pb facs="tcp:4287:242"/>
is afore vttered. For the learned <hi>Aristotle</hi> here meaneth, that the more chollerick in bodye, are perfite simplye, but this vnderstanded in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison vnto the chollerick small of bodye. The Sanguine of complexion, and bigge in body, are very perfite: in that they be of a temperate moyst qualitie, and of a good receyuing, and retayning.</p>
               <p>In the excéeding, the Phylosopher doth Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomate by the quantitie of the body, betwéene a verie small and verie bigge, as vnderstanding of a meane. Of which such hauing bodies ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much excéeding in greatnesse and heigth, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much lacking in the smalnesse of bodye and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are perfite by hap: in that these sometymes are on such wise, &amp; sometimes in a contrarie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: according to the same, as they are dyuersly complexioned. So that by the consequent, such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer small, and ouer bigge are vnperfite, in as much as vnto the extending: which maye be on such wise, and otherwise in the ouer small forme: so that the vnperfite is, as euery variable contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or hapning: For that cause in stature and quantitie of bodye a meane: which are neather ouer small, nor ouer bigge vnto sense: are the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to perceyue and knowe.</p>
               <p>The Phisiognomer further vttereth that the person which is not of length, and largenesse a like is noted to be one, not in a due forme propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

               <head>A perfite instruction, in the maner of iudging.</head>
               <p>FIrst consider, that a man may not hastily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce iudgement, of any one note alone, but gather and marke diligently the testimonies of
<pb facs="tcp:4287:244"/>
all the members: and if there happen to thée, to appéere diuers notes, and that vnto diuers effects: then leane by the councell of the Phisiognomer, vnto the mightier, and worthier part. In that the qualitie of the whole bodie, consisteth of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the partes. So that by one note onely, a man may not argue and iudge the affection or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motion of any person, but by sundrie togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore when thou wilt pronounce the happes to come of any person, to be eyther grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or lesser: then the same iudge, after thou hast throughly learned and vnderstanded of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conditions. And in marking and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this way of iudging, thou shalt seldome erre. As by example. If any hath the notes of a wicked person, &amp; threatned to come vnto a miserable end: yet if such wickednesse doth then but a little moue him, then may it be coniectured, that such a person hath well maystred his wicked affections: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye to others, which (for the more part) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to come vnto cruell torments, or sustaine long imprisonment. And an other example, that if anye hath the notes of an yrefull person, and that anger doth then but little disquiet him: then is it to be thought and iudged, that he hath well repressed and brideled the passions of yre: and eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like iudgement may be giuen, in all others. This also marke, for a sure note in this Art,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4287:244"/>
that the good and séemely forme of eche member, doth denote a good composition and strength of the body, whether that member be small or bigge, in respect of the bodye. And the formes of the members well proportioned, doe denote vertue: but euill fashioned, doe argue an euill conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned person.</p>
               <p>Yet the more open and manifester signes are they, which be caused &amp; appeare in the principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest places, and these named the principallest, that are about the eyes, the forhead, the head, and the face. But the seconde and next place is the same, which is knowne to be about the shoulders, the breast, the belly, the legges, and the féete. But the last, is the part which is to be considered about the belly. But the generall difficultie or hardnesse of these, consisteth of the iudgement, euen as the like doth the same both in the Arte of Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and Phisicke practise depende. And of this <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth, that the Physiognomer maye erre in his iudgement, for dyuers causes: First, in that to any one note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a man may not trust: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the same be proper of it selfe, as is aboue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Therefore no one note alone maye be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of any speciall parte of the body: in that by the nature of one particuler, doth not the nature of man in generall consist. In the second there is errour caused, for that to the alteration of nature
<pb facs="tcp:4287:245"/>
and age, they doe not sometymes agrée, in that there be notes, which sometimes declare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rather past, than to come: like as in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of thrée score yeares olde, which may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: that doth then argue his leacherousnesse to be past, and not present to be affirmed. And sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie wryters affirme, that the notes gathered by the fore part of the bodie, are knowne to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier then those conceyued of the hynder part, as witnesseth <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> who willeth first to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde and note the face of the sicke. And others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so affirme, that those to be the mightier notes, which are taken of those members, by which the passion is exercised: as the notes which doe vtter and declare the yre of the breast, and ribbes, which is exercised by the heart, within those parts placed. Further in that by the shoulders, armes, legges, and féete, strength is exercised: therefore are the mightier notes for strength, gathered and taken of them. And thus of the other members, gather and iudge in the like maner. But here for a playner vnderstanding of the Art, and that you may learne howe to iudge by the lyke, shall here be propounded an example or two, and thus ende the worke.</p>
               <p>First this person (by whome the example is giuen) shall be imagined to be of a meane stature, yet rather vnto a smalnesse, than vnto a bignesse
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4287:245"/>
                  <figure/>
of personage, and that the heade to be vniforme, and agréeable in proportion vnto the bodie, the necke bigge and liuely, the heares on the heade meane, yet rather thinne, than thicke, crisped and not plaine, the foreheade of a comely forme, with vigilant eyes, rather more inwarde standing, than outwarde situated, and rather small than bigge, being of a gray colour to the skie: the face rather long than rounde, and rather bonie than
<pb facs="tcp:4287:246"/>
fleshie, the chéekes not full puffed vp, but of a meane bignesse: the eares rather small than big, the nose chollericke or lyke vnto the Eagles bill: the nosethrilles rather large than narrowe, the mouth rather bigge than small, the téeth great and thick set: the lips like vnto the Lyons, so that the vpper lippe be somewhat thicke, and the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lippe somewhat bigge, yet not louse hanging: the chinne long, and rather sharpe than rounde, and the vnder chinne not palliolated, the whole body rather bony than fleshie, the shoulder poynts comely formed, the breast large with the reast of the bodie proportioned: the haunches brawned, with a good fastnesse, and bending somewhat out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde: the legges rounde and séemely brawned in the partes, the féete séemely bigge and not small, the héeles comely formed: and in pace goeth vpright, and in a séemely forme of length: and whether he be polled or not polled, it forceth not: and that such a person also of propertie, rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyneth vnto the good, than vnto the euill: and that in all his attempts, he procéedeth with a stoutenesse of courage.</p>
               <p>In this seconde example, shall be vttered the forme of a stowte and furious person, whose members of the bodie ought to be thus propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: first the heade sharpe or rounde, the nose flatte and hollowe, the middle part or chest of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4287:246"/>
                  <figure/>
breast bearing outwarde, so that there be but a small distaunce betwéene the heart and braine: the necke short, the eyes fierie, and spotted, the distaunce great (from the place of the stomacke) vnto the nauill of the belly: the fatnesse of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die fast, and not louse: the voice bigge and lowde, with a quicknesse of speach: and treading quicke, with a swiftnesse of paces: the bodie most hearie, and well bearded: the armes long, wyth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunt veynes: the handes rather bigge, than
<pb facs="tcp:4287:247"/>
small: that if slender, yet not ouer slender of body, and that the reast of the members of the bodie, be well proportioned: and that he be not long, or tall of stature (for fewe such be hardie) and not Crane legged, nor hauing the Pecocks pace. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Phisiognomer doth here giue warning vnto generall Capitaynes of an host of men: that they choose (in no case) any vnder capitanes, which possesse effeminate members, and bée like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned: that is to saye, delighted in pleasures and banquettings: in that such souldiours (for the more part) fighting vnder their ensigne, were knowne to be put to the worse, and driuen backe, vnto the great discomfort of the whole host: which experience <hi>Cocles</hi> had, and obserued in diuers and sundrie battayles, in which, the lyke Capitaynes (seruing for the onely desire of their belly, and couetousnesse of money) brought their Souldiours vnto a like lamentable end, and miserable destruction.

For by a naturall frailtie, proceeded from our forefather Adam, euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (after nature) is drawne, and allured vnto the lyke dispositions, and passions of the minde. But to be briefe, the creatures which are regenerated through the holye Ghost, doe not onely endeuour to mortifie their fleshlye appetites, but seeke to put away and correct all other inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and vices resting in them: although there still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth a frailtie to sinne, and offences daylye committed, euen of the wise: which for that we bee so intised of the flesh, no marueyle is it (sayth the Phisiognomer) that so manye insue, and followe the like steppes of sundrie sentences pronounced in this Art, the more is to be lamented: that these so bestiall, shoulde bee thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongst vs, as we day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see and know.</p>

I referre mée then wholy to the learned correction of the wise, beséeching them friendly to giue knowledge vnto the Printer, or to me, &amp; being detected of my fault, will willingly correct and amend the same: for wel I wote, that no treatise can alwayes be so worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly handled, but that somewhat sometymes may fall out amisse, contrarie to the minde of the wryter, and contrary to the expectation of the reader. Wherefore my petition to thée gentle Reader is, to accept these my traueyles, wyth that minde I doe offer them to thée, and to take gently, that I giue gladly, in so dooing I shall thinke my paynes well bestowed, and shall bée en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged hereafter to trust more vnto thy cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie.</p>
               <p>I may here compare my selfe with two or thrée examples, not altogither impartinent to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. It is written of one <hi>Falarus Thebanus,</hi> a Capitaine, who béeing in the fielde with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, readie to giue battaile, notwithstanding, hée was marueylously (at that instaunt) vexed with a sore disease of the Lunges, yet couragiously hée set vpon his enimies, in the ioyning of which bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, he fought himselfe, and béeing then stroken on the breast with a speare, his griefe ceassed, and was for euer after healed of the same.</p>
               <p>A like example to this, we haue of <hi>Mamillus
<pb facs="tcp:4287:260"/>
Bubulus,</hi> King of the Tuskanes, who hauing a stripe in the necke, there remayned behynde a péece of yron, which through the smalnesse of it, coulde be by no meanes got out. He on a tyme, ryding on hunting, his horse happened to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe him, the fall was so boystrous, that the little péece of yron flewe out of his mouth, and so was healed.</p>
               <p>As those two, <hi>Falarus,</hi> and <hi>Mamillus,</hi> béeing both diseased men, were contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion healed of their griefes: euen so I béeing weake in skill, and in knowledge, and therefore doubting my successe, yet boldely aduenturing this my booke into print, shall by your gentle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of it, contrary to my desert, be released of my feare. But I feare me, I shall not be so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, as eyther of these were, but rather chaunge that fortune with <hi>Cornelius Rufus,</hi> who drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming he had lost his eye sight, and that one did leade him, in the morning when he awaked, found himselfe blinde in déede: euen so I in doubtfull maner dreaming of <hi>Momus,</hi> when I least thinke of him, shall finde me encountered of him: for what fault is there so small, which <hi>Momus</hi> will not finde. If the learneder sort brought vp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, vnder <hi>Minerua,</hi> are sometymes touched of him: much more I who neuer tasted of the learned Lake, but rather alwayes rudely taught,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4287:260"/>
among the Smithes of <hi>Vulcanus</hi> forge, muste néedes be stung of him. Séeing therefore I doe halfe perswade my selfe, that I shall not obtaine the friendly countenaunce of all men: yet I doe not doubt, but the wise, will giue me their good worde, and will consider mine intent, as it is in déede, that is, to please the common sort, for whose onely sake, I haue taken these paynes, and haue published this booke: and will not so much regarde the yll, or well handling of the matter, as my good intent. And therefore (gentle reader) once againe I craue at thy handes, the thankfull accepting of these rude labours of mine: and thus the fauor of God, be with thée al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
