            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Medusa</hi> seducing the heart of inconstant <hi>Neptune</hi> with her youth and beauty, is a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xuriant wit priding it self in the invention of novelties in Religion: The violation of <hi>Minervaes</hi> Temple, the staining of the holy Church, with sordid tenets and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; <hi>Pegasus</hi> the high flying thoughts of heretical spirits; Those snakes and serpents crawling from <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusaes</hi> head, and twisting themselves about her neck, gnawing and consuming not onely one another, but the head which bore them; are wicked Heresies hatch'd in the brain, and nourish'd in the head of Arch-Hereticks, condemning and thwarting one another, by perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties, and still gnawing upon the Conscience which brought them forth. The Petrifying Metamorphosis wrought upon the curious spectators of <hi>Medusa,</hi> is the obduratenesse of those hearts who open too broad an eye to the speculations of Hereticks: The wasting and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ever oppos'd that femal army, the horrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, civil warres, destractions, desolations caus'd by Hereticks, both in ancient, and in our present ages: The undaunted <hi>Perseus,</hi> the supreme Bishop of the Catholick Church, guarded with the shield of Faith, and arm'd with the sword of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> cuts off the serpentine

head of <hi>Medusa,</hi> errours and heresies with his definitions, decrees, censures, and anathemaes; the drops of bloud distilling from <hi>Medusaes</hi> head, even after it was struck dead and divided from her shoulders, turning into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny snakes and adders, the pullulation of new divisions, and subdivisions of Heresies, spreading themselves all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and infesting the countries where they fall with implacable dissentions and tumults each against other; This is the sad story of <hi>Medusa,</hi> Emblemis'd. And yet happy had been our Nation, and many others with it, had it rested in the nature of an Embleme, and been no more then a bare speculation: But as it hath faln heavy upon several Countries in all precedent ages, so in this and the former has it almost crush'd ours, and many adjacent to us: the histories are too too fresh in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and the late pressures too broad before our eyes, to need recital; and yet we might hope to obliterate their foul Characters in time; were there not new drops di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling from <hi>Medusaes</hi> ghastly head, and perpetuating that generation of vipers, which took their first birth from it.</p>
            <p>Force of Reason and Authority had devested our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of both, and so enervated their Principles that they had no consistency; when behold a new brood of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Novelties, dropping from <hi>Medusa</hi>'s brain, rise-up to reestablish their dying cause; <hi>Sects and Schismes are united, as parts to the Catholick Church, Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Councils are despoiled of their ancient Authority, Ecclesiasticall Decrees pin'd up within the Circuit of the</hi> Romane <hi>Empire, true Christian and Divine Faith made consistent in the same soul with Heresie, ancient The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall Definitions question'd and revers'd, &amp;c.</hi> And those Principles once advanced, (which both Parties condemned and execrated as Diabolicall) our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:49965:5"/>
are frustrated, and we put upon a necessity to prove what we and all Christians suppos'd hitherto as undeniable Truths.</p>
            <p>This is the task which <hi>Mr. Richard Baxter,</hi> inventer of the said Novelties, hath put upon me; a man, who had his fecunditie of invention, been equalliz'd with a soliditie in Learning, might have proved as offensive, as he is now invective against the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>My present work therefore, is not so much a defence of mine own, as of the common cause of Christians; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those young <hi>Meducean</hi> Serpents, new bred Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hissing against it; so that it may be equally intitled CHISTIANITY MAINTAIN'D, and NOVELTY REPRES'T. Yet I have made choice of the latter, as not daring to assume a Title to any writing of mine, which a Person so far excelling me in all respects has prefixed to his own, in answer to another bold oppugner of Christian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Whosoever therefore shall please to peruse this present Tract, shall, I hope, find the whole controversie laid open so plain before his eyes, that he needs no more then to parallell each answer to its respective objection in their severall Paragraphs; for to this end I have inserted the whole first part of <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> last Answer, by Sections <hi>verbatim,</hi> and to each applyed my rejoinder; that neither the Reader may be put to the cost or trouble of perusing <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> Book, nor he himself have any occasion to complain that I accuse him, to say any thing which he expresses not in his own Treatise: For the same end also, I have reprinted here the whole precesse of the argument, with all our precedent respective Answers and Replies, that the Reader may have all ready at hand, for a more facil understanding of the whole matter. Yet in my Answer to his second part, in
<pb facs="tcp:49965:5"/>
proof of the perpetual visibility of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, I have not inserted his Text, both by reason it would have<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> rendred the tome improportionable, and that he often spends many Leafs in proving Propositions, which I deny not, so that it had bin to no purpose at all to insert them; what I found material in that part, I have reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and answered, and remit the judgement and censure of the whole work to any impartial Reader. If <hi>Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> will venture upon an Answer, I expect as fair a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from him, as he has here from me; to insert by Sections as I have done my Text, and apply a particular Answer to each Section; for otherwise all impartiall eyes will see that he flies the light, and seeks corners to hide himself, and takes a new occasion both to pervert my words, distort my sense, and make me say what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, when he cannot answer what I say, as he has done more then once in this his Answer.</p>
            <p>The whole issue of the work, is not onely a discovery of the weaknesse and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

All we have to say or doe in relation to his Person, is earnestly to beg of the God of mercy, pardon and forgivenesse for him for what is past, and a new beam of light from heaven to guide and direct him for the future, and bring him into that saving way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he may attain unto a never ending felicity.</p>

               <p>But there is no salvation to be had out of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Christians, which is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> There is no salvation to be had out of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Christians which acknowledges S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his lawful Successors the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> ever to have been since the Ascension of Christ; and <hi>now</hi> to be by the Institution of Christ their chief Head and Governour on earth in matters belonging to the soul next under Christ.</p>
               <p>The Minor is clear; For all Christians agree in this,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49965:7"/>
that to be saved, it is necessary to be in the true Church of Christ; that only being his mystical Body, Spouse and Mother of the faithful, to which must belong all those who ever have been, are, or shall be saved.</p>
               <p>The Major I prove thus.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever Congregation of Christians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, hath been always visible since the time of Christ, either under persecution, or in peace and flourishing.</p>
               <p>But no Congregation of Christians hath been always visible since the time of Christ, either under persecution or in peace and flourishing, save that only which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his lawfull successors, the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever to have been since the Ascension of Christ; and <hi>now</hi> to be by Christs Institution their chief Head and Governour on earth, in matters belonging to the soul, next under Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Whatsoever Congregation of Christians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, acknowledges S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his lawful successors the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> ever to have been since the Ascension of Christ; and <hi>now</hi> to be by Christs Institution their chief Head and Governour on earth, in matters belonging to the soul, next under Christ.</p>
               <p>The Major is proved thus:</p>
               <p>Whatsoever Congregation of Christians hath always had visible Pastors and people united, hath always been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible either under persecution, or in peace and flourishing.</p>
               <p>But whatsoever Congregation of Christians is <hi>now</hi> the the true Church of Christ, hath always had visible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and People <hi>united.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Whatsoever Congregation of Christians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ hath always been visible, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under persecution, or in peace and flourishing.</p>
               <p>The Major of this last Syllogism is evident, for seeing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49965:8"/>
a visible Church is nothing but a visible Pastor and people <hi>united</hi>: where there have always been visible Pastors and people <hi>united,</hi> there hath always been a visible Church.</p>
               <p>The Minor I prove from <hi>Ephesians,</hi> cap. 4. ver. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, that Christ had instituted, that there should be Pastors and Teachers in the Church for the work of the Ministry, and preserving the people under their respective charges from being carried away with every wind of doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which evidently shews those Pastors must be visible, seeing the work of the Ministry, which is Preaching, and Administration of Sacraments, and governing their flocks, are all external and <hi>visible</hi> actions. And this shews likewise, that those Pastors and People must be <hi>always visible,</hi> because they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue from Christs Ascension, untill we all meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the unity of faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot be before the day of judgement.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be said (as some say) that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Christ is only conditional, since to put it to be so without evident Reason, giveth scope to every one at his pleasure to make every other promise of Christ to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional. And so we shall be certain of nothing that Christ hath promised, neither that there shall always be a visible or invisible Church, nor any Church at all; no nor of Judgement, nor of Eternal life, or of the Resurrection of the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for one may say with as much ground as this is said, that some conditions were included in all those promises, which being not fulfilled, hinders the execution of them.</p>
               <p>There remains only, to prove the Minor of the second Syllogism, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Congregation of Christians hath been always visible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> save that which acknowledges S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his lawfull successors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be their chief
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49965:8"/>
Head and Governour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> next under Christ.</p>
               <p>This Minor I prove, by obliging the answerers to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate any Congregation of Christians, which always till this present time, since Christ, hath been <hi>visible,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under persecution, or in peace and flourishing, save that only which acknowledges S. <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ut supra.</hi>

To this as to all the rest of my Arguments, which may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be urged: I require a Categorical and strict Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logistical Answer in Form, by <hi>Concedo, Nego, Distinguo, Omitto, Transeat.</hi> And the particular Propositions specified, to which the Respondents apply any of them; and no more then precisely thus, neither adding Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, Reasons, Proofs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their own out of form, and that this may be done with all convenient speed. To the place of Scripture, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is also required a Categorical answer to what is precisely pressed in it, without directing the Discourse to other things: And what is answered otherwise, I shall not esteem an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, but an <hi>Effugium,</hi> or declining of the difficulty: By this method exactly observed, Truth will easily and speedily be made manifest; and your desires of Brevity will be punctually complied with. I also desire, that the Respondent or Respondents will (as I do to this) sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe his or their name or names to their answers, so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as any are by him or them returned, with the day of the month when returned:</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHoever you are, a serious debate with so sober a Disputant, is to me an exceeding acceptable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: I shall not, I hope, give you any cause to say, that I decline any difficulties, or balk your strength, or transgress the part of a Respondent. But because, <hi>1.</hi> You have not (as you ought to have done) explained the terms of your Thesis. <hi>2.</hi> And have made your Propositions so long. <hi>3.</hi> And have so cunningly lapped up your falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; your Respondent is necessitated to be the larger in distinction and explication. And seeing you are so instant with me for strictness, you thereby oblige your self, if you will be ingenuous, to make onely the learned, and not any ignorant men the Iudges of our dispute: because you know that to the unlearned a bare <hi>Nego</hi> signifieth nothing: but when such have read your Arguments at length, they will expect as plain and large a confutation, or judge you to be in the right for speaking most.</p>
            <p>TO your Argument. <hi>1.</hi> Your conclusion containeth not your Thesis, or Question. And so you give up your cause the first step, and make a new one. It should have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49965:9"/>
contained your Question in terms, and it doth not so much as contain it in the plain sense; so much difference is there between [Assemblies of Christians united, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] and [Congregation of Christians] and between [Salvation or the Church, never was in any other then those Assemblies] and [no Salvation out of that Congregation;] as I shall shew you: besides other differences which you may see.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad Majorem Resp. 1.</hi> By [Congregation] you mean, either the whole Catholick Church united in Christ, or some particular Congregation, which is but part of that whole. In the latter sense, your Subject hath a false supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> that a part is the whole; and your Minor will be false. And your [whatsoever Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians] seems to distinguish that from some other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Congregation of Christians that is no part of the Catholick Church, which is a supposing the chief part of the Question granted you, which we deny. We know no universal Congregation of Christians but one, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all particular Congregations and Christians, that univocally deserve that name.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Either you mean that [this whole Congregation or true Church acknowledgeth] the Popes Soveraignty, or else [that some part of it doth acknowledge it.] The former I deny, and challenge any man living to prove: If it be [part onely] that you mean, then either [the greater part] or [the lesser]: that it is the greater, I as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently almost deny: for it is against the common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of men acquainted with the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you mean [the lesser part] you shall see anon that it destroyes your cause.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Either you speak <hi>de Ecclesia quae talis,</hi> or <hi>de Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia qua talis:</hi> and mean that this [acknowledgment] is essential to it, or at least an inseparable property, or else that it is a separable accident. The latter will do you no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49965:10"/>
good: the former I deny. In sum: I grant that a small corrupt part of the Catholike Church doth <hi>now</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Pope to be Christs Vicar, (or the Vice-christ;) but I deny, <hi>1.</hi> That the whole doth so (which is your great cause.) <hi>2.</hi> Or the Major part. <hi>3.</hi> Or any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation through all ages, (though if they had, it would do you no good.) <hi>4.</hi> Or that it is done by any upon just ground, but is their corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad Minorem,</hi> Resp. <hi>1.</hi> If you mean any [part] of the Vniversal Church by [that Congregation which is now the true Church] I deny your Minor: If [the whole] I grant it. <hi>2.</hi> You say [all Christians agree] in it, <hi>&amp;c. Resp.</hi> I think all Protestants or near all, do: but <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscus à sancta Clara</hi> hath copiously told us (in <hi>Artic. Anglic.</hi>) that most of your own Doctors are for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Infidels; and then either you take Infidels for your Church membrs, or your Doctors for no Christians, or you play not fair play to tell us so grosse an untruth, that <hi>all Christians</hi> are agreed in it.</p>
            <p>To your Conclusion. <hi>Resp. 1.</hi> Either you mean that [there is no Salvation to be had out of that Vniversal Church, whose part (a minor corrupt part) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the Popes Soveraignty] or else [that there is no Salvation to be had out of that Universal Church which wholly acknowledgeth it.] or else [that there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be had out of that part of the Universal Church which acknowledgeth it.] In the first sense I grant your conclusion (if really you are part of the Church.) There is no Salvation to be had out of Christs Universal Church, of which you are a small corrupted part. In the second sense I told you we deny the supposition in the subject. In the third sense; I deny the sequel; <hi>non sequitur,</hi> because your Major Proposition being false <hi>de Ecclesia universali,</hi> the conclusion must be false <hi>de parte ista,</hi> as excluding the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49965:10"/>But to the unskilful or unwary Reader your conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seemeth to import, that [the being in such a Church which acknowledgeth the Popes Soveraignty, as it is such a Church, is necessary to Salvation] and so [that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons acknowledgement is neccesary.] But it is a <hi>fallacia accidentis</hi> cunningly lapt up, that is the life of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported cause. That part of the Universal Church doth hold to the Popes Soveraignty, is <hi>per accidens;</hi> and could you prove that the whole Church doth so (which you are unlike to do) I would say the like. And that your falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may the beter appear; I give you some examples of such like Sophismes.</p>
            <p>[Whatsoever Nation is the true Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> is proud and cruel against Protestants: But there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection there due to any that are not of that Kingdome: therefore there is no protection due to any that are not proud and cruel.] Or [whatsoever Nation is the true Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> acknowledgeth the Pope: but no protection is due from the Governours to any that are not of that Kingdom: therefore no protection is due to any that acknowledge not the Pope.] Or [what ever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was for the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi>: but there was no right of Inheritance for any that were not of that Nation: therefore there was no right of Inheritance for any that was not for the Earl of <hi>Tyrone.</hi>] Or suppose that you could have proved it of all the Church. If you had lived four hundred years after Christ, you might as well have argued thus. [Whatsoever Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst kneeling in adoration on the Lords days. But there is no salvation to be had out of that Congregation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which is now the true Church of Christ: therefore there is no salvation to be had out of that Congregation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49965:11"/>
which is against kneeling on the Lords day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] But yet, <hi>1.</hi> There was Salvation to be had <hi>in</hi> that <hi>Congregation</hi> without being of that opinion. <hi>2.</hi> And there is now Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be had in a Congregation that is not of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as you will confess.</p>
            <p>Or [whatsoever Congregation of Christians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, doth hold the Canticles and the Epistle to <hi>Philemon</hi> to be Canonical Scripture, (and so have done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But there is no Salvation to be had out of the true Church: therefore there is no Salvation to be had out of that Congregation which holdeth the Canticles and Epistle to <hi>Philemon</hi> to be Canonical Scripture.] But yet, <hi>1.</hi> Salvation is to be had in that Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holding it. <hi>2.</hi> And its possible hereafter a Church may deny those two books, and yet you will think Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation not thereby overthrown. This is but to shew your fallacy from a <hi>corrupt accident,</hi> and indeed but of a part of the Church, and a small part.</p>
            <p>Now to your proof of the Major. <hi>Resp. ad Major.</hi> The present <hi>matter</hi> of the Church was not visible in the last Generation, for we were not then born: but the same form of the Church was then existent in a visible <hi>Matter,</hi> and their Profession was visible or audible, though their faith it self was invisible. I will do more then you shall do, in maintaining the constant visibility of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad minorem. 1.</hi> If you mean that no Congregation hath been alwayes visible [but that Vniversal Church whose lesser corrupt part acknowledges] the Popes Soveraignty, I grant it. For besides [the whole contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Christians as the parts] there can be no other. If you mean [save that part which acknowledgeth] you contradict your self, because a part implyeth other parts. If you mean [save that Universal Church, all whose
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49965:11"/>
members (or the most) acknowledg it], there is no such subject existent. <hi>2.</hi> I distinguish of <hi>Visibility:</hi> Its one thing to be a visible Church, that is, visible in its essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials; and another thing to be visible <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> as to some separable accident. [The Universal Church] was ever visible; because their Profession of Christianity was so, and the persons professing: But [the acknowledgment of the Vice-christ] was not alwayes visible, no not in any parts, much less in the whole. And if it had, it was but a separable accident, (if your disease be not incurable) that was visible: and therefore, <hi>1.</hi> It was not necessary to Salvation, nor a proper mark of the Church. <hi>2.</hi> Nor can it be so for the time to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> need to say no more to your conclusion. Your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no better then this, [whatsoever Congregation of Christians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, hath been alwayes visible since the time of Christ: But no congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Christians hath been so visible, save onely that which condemneth the Greeks, which hath a Colledge of Cardinals to chose the Popes, which denieth the cup to the laity, which forbiddeth the reading of Scripture in a known tongue without license, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Congregation of Christians is now the true Church of Christ, hath all these]; <hi>1.</hi> In a corrupt part it hath. <hi>2.</hi> But it had not alwayes. <hi>3.</hi> And may be cured hereafter.</p>
            <p>To your proof of the Major: <hi>1.</hi> I grant your Major.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. Ad minorem. 1.</hi> Either you mean [Vniversal Pastors] each one, or some one having charge and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the [whole Church,] or you mean, [unfixed Pastors having an indefinite charge of Preaching and Guiding when they come and have particular calls and opportunities] or you mean [the fixed Pastors of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches] In the first sense your Minor is false, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49965:12"/>
Catholike Church was never so united to any Universal Head but Christ: no one of the Apostles governed the rest, and the whole Church, much less any since their time. In the second sense, I grant that the Church hath ever had Pastors since the Ascension. In the third sense, I grant that some parts, or other of the Catholick Church, have ever had fixed Pastors of Congregations since the first setling of such Pastors. But any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation may cease to have such Pastors, and may cease it self: And <hi>Rome</hi> hath been long without any true Pastors; and therefore was then no such visible Church.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> If by [Congregation] you mean not the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church but [a part], or if you mean it of [all the parts of the Universal Church] <hi>I</hi> deny your Minor: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of Christians, and particular persons have been and may be without any Pastors, to whom they are united or subject. The Indians that died in the faith while <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentius</hi> and <hi>Edesius</hi> were there preaching, before they had any Pastor, were yet Christians and saved: If a Lay man convert one, or a thousand, (and you will say that he may baptize them) and they die before they can have a Pastor, or ever hear of any to whom they owe subjection, they are nevertheless saved, as members of the Church; And if all the Pastors in a Nation were murdered or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, the people would not cease to be Christians and members of the Church. Much lesse if the Pope were dead or deposed, or a vacancy befell his seat, would all the Catholick Church be annihilated, or cease.</p>
            <p>To your Confirmation of the Major [that a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church is nothing but a Visible Pastor, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple united] I answer: <hi>1.</hi> Its true of the Universal Church, as united in Christ, the great Pastor, but not as united in a Vice-Christ or humane head.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49965:12"/>
               <hi>2.</hi> It is true of a particular Political or organized Church, as united to their proper Pastors. <hi>3.</hi> But it is not true of every Community of Christians who are a part of the Universal Church. A companie converted to Christ, are members of the Vniversal Church, (though they never heard of a Pope at <hi>Rome</hi>) before they are united to Pastors of their own.</p>
            <p>The Proof of the Minor from <hi>Ephes. 4.</hi> I grant as aforesaid: The Text proveth that Pastors the Church shall have: I disclaim the vain Objection [of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality in the Promise] which you mention. But it proves not, <hi>1.</hi> That the Church shall have an Universal Monarch or Vice-Christ, under Christ. <hi>2.</hi> Nor that every Member of the Universall Church, shall certainly be a member of a particular Church, or ever see the face of Pastor, or be subject to him.</p>
            <p>You say next [There remains only to prove the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the second Syllogism, <hi>Viz.</hi> That no Congregation of Christians hath been always visible but that which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] This is the great point which all lyeth on: The rest hath been all nothing, but a cunning shooing horn to this. Prove this, and prove all: Prove not this, and you have lost your time.</p>
            <p>You say [The Minor I prove, by obliging the answerers to nominate any Congregation of Christians which always till this present time since Christ hath been visible — save that only which acknowledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] And have I waited all this while for this? You prove it by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging me to prove the contrary. Ridiculous! <hi>sed quo jure? 1.</hi> Your undertaken form of arguing obligeth you to prove your Minor: You cannot cast your Respondent upon proving and so arguing, and doing the Opponents part. <hi>2.</hi> And in your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49965:13"/>
Postscript you presently forbid it me; You require me to hold to a <hi>Concedo, Nego, Distinguo, Omitto, Transeat;</hi> threatning that else you will take it for an <hi>Effugium.</hi> And I pray you tell me in your next, to which of these doth the nomination or proof of such a Church as you describe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long? Plainly, you first slip away when you should prove your Minor, and then oblige me to prove ehe contrary, and then tell me, if I attempt it, you'l take it for an <hi>Effugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> A good cause needs not such dealing as this: which me thinks you should be loth a learned man should hear of. <hi>3.</hi> Your interest also in the <hi>Matter</hi> (as well as your office as Opponent) doth oblige you to the proof For though you make a Negative of it, you may put it in other terms at your pleasure. It is your main work to prove [that all the members of the Vniversal Church have in all ages held the Popes Soveraignty or Universal Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.] Or [the whole Visible Church hath held it] Prove this, and I will be a Papist; you have my promise: You affirm, and you must prove. Prove a Catholike Church, at least that in the Major part was of that mind: (though that would be nothing to prove the condemnation of the rest.) If you are an impartial enquirer after truth, fly not when you come to the setting too. I give you this further evident reason why you cannot oblige me to what you here impose; <hi>1.</hi> Because you require me to prove the Visibility of a Church which <hi>held not</hi> your point of Papacy; and so put an unreasonable task upon me about a <hi>Negative:</hi> Or else I must prove that they held the contrary, before your opinion was started: And it is the Catholike Church that we are disputing about; so that I must prove this <hi>Negative</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church. <hi>2.</hi> It is you that lay the great stress of Necessity on your Affirmative, more then we do on the Negative; you say that no man can be saved
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49965:13"/>
without your Affirmative [that the Pope is the universal Head and Governour] But we say not that no man can be saved that holdeth not our <hi>Negative,</hi> [that he is not the Vice-Christ] For one that hath the plague or leprosie may live. Therefore it is you that must prove that <hi>all</hi> the Catholike Church was still of your mind. <hi>3.</hi> And it is an Accident, and but an Accident of a smaller cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted part of the Catholike Church that you would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me to prove the <hi>Negation</hi> of; and therefore it is utterly needlesse to my proof of a visible Catholike Church. I will without it prove to you a successive Visibility of the Catholike Church, from the Visibility of its Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or Constitutive parts (of which your Pope is none.) I will prove a successive visible Church that hath still professed faith in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and been united to the Universal Head, and had particular Pastors, some fixed, some unfixed, and held all essential to a Christian. And proving this, I have proved the Church of which I am a member. To prove that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath been so long a Kingdom, requireth no more but to prove the two Essential parts, King and Subjects, to have so long continued united. It requireth not that I prove that it either <hi>had</hi> or <hi>opposed</hi> a Vice-King. This is our plain case; if a man have a botch on one of his hands, it is not needful in order to my proving him a man heretofore, that I prove he was born and bred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: so be it I prove that he was born a man, it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth. Nor is it needful that I prove the other hand always to have been free, in order to prove it a member of the body: It sufficeth that I prove it to have been still <hi>a hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do therefore desire you to perform your work, and prove that [no Congregation hath been still visible, but such as yours] or that [the whole Catholike
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49965:14"/>
Church hath ever since the ascention held a Humane Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Governour under Christ,] or else I shall take it as a giving up your cause as indefensible. And observe, if you shall prove onely that <hi>a part</hi> of the Catholick Church still held this (which you can never do) then, <hi>1.</hi> You will make the contrary opinion as Consistent with salvation as yours. For the rest of the Catholick Church is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable. <hi>2.</hi> And then you well allow me to turn your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against your self as much as it is against us (and so cast it away.) <hi>e. g</hi> [what ever Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is now the true Church of Christ, hath been alwayes Visible: But no Congregation of Christians hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Visible, but that which <hi>quoad partem</hi> denieth the Popes universal Headship; therefore whatever Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christians is the true Church, denieth the Popes universal Headship.</p>
            <p>Well! but for all this (supposing you will do your part) I will fail you in nothing that's reasonable, which I can perform. A Catholick Church in all ages that was against the Pope, in every member of it, I hope I cannot shew you; because I hope that you are members, though corrupt. But you shall have more then a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or a hundred.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> At this present, two or three parts of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church is known to be against your Vniversal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. The Greeks, Armenians, Etheopians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Protestants. <hi>2.</hi> In the last age there were as many or more. <hi>3.</hi> I the former ages till <hi>An.

For more be faln off in <hi>Tenduè, Nubia,</hi> and other parts then the Protestants that came in. <hi>4.</hi> About the year <hi>600.</hi> there were many more, incomparably; and I think then, but at least of <hi>400.</hi> years after Christ I never yet saw valid proof of one Papist in all the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49965:14"/>
world, that is, one that was for the Popes Vniversal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy or Vice-Christ-ship. So that <hi>most</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church (about three parts to one) hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you to this day; and all against you for many hundred years. Could I name but a Nation against you, I should think I had done nothing; much lesse if I cited a few men in an age. <hi>5.</hi> And of all those of <hi>Ethiopia, India,</hi> &amp;c. that are without the verge and awe of the Ancient Roman Empire, never so much as gave the Pope that Primacy of dignity, which those within the Empire gave him, when he was chief, as the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> is of the Earls of <hi>England</hi> that governeth none of them, and as the Lord Chancellour may be the chief Iudge, that hath no power <hi>in alieno foro,</hi> or as the eldest Iustice is chief in the County, and on the Bench, that ruleth not the rest. Mistake not this Primacy for Monarchy, nor the Roman Empire for the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you can say nothing.</p>
            <p>At present, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> I give you sufficient proof of this succession. As you use to say that the present Church best knew the judgement of the former age, and so on to the head, and so Tradition beareth you out: I turn this unresistibly against you. The far greatest part of Christians in the world that now are in possession of the doctrine contrary to your Monarchy, tell us that they had it from their Fathers, and so on. And as in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils so with the Church Real, the Major part (three to one) is more to be credited then the Minor part; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it is a visible self-advancement that the Minor part insisteth on. And were not this enough, I might add, That your Western Church it self in its Representative Body at <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> hath determined that not the Pope, but a General Council is the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour under Christ; and that this hath been still the judgement of the Church, and that its Heresie in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49965:15"/>
whoever that hold the contrary. <hi>7.</hi> And no man can prove that one half or tenth part of your people called Papists are of your opinion: For they are not called to professe it by words: and their obedience is partly forced, and partly upon their principles; some obeying the Pope as their Western Patriarch of chief dignity; and some and most doing all for their safety and peace: Their outward acts will prove no more.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, I have told you what Church of which we are members, hath been visible; yea and what part of it hath opposed the Vice-christ of <hi>Rome.</hi> This I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed not an hour after I received yours, because you desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red speed. Accordingly I crave your speedy return; and intreat you to advise with the most learned men (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iesuites or others) of your party in <hi>London</hi> that think it worth their thoughts and time: not that I have any thoughts of being their equall in learning, but partly because the case seemeth to me so exceeding palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that I think it will suffice me to supply all my defects against the ablest men on earth, or all of them together of your way; and principally, because I would see your strength, and know the most that can be said, that I may be rectified if I err (which I suspect not) or confirmed the more if you cannot evince it, and so may be true to Gods Truth, and my own soul.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT was my happiness to have this Argument trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into your learned and quiet hands; which gratefully returns as fair a measure as it received from you; that Anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>sities on both sides reposed, Truth may appear in its full splendor, and seat it self in the Center of both our hearts.</p>
            <p>To your first Exception.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Thesis</hi> was sufficiently made clear to my friend, who was concerned in it; and needed no explication in its address to the learned.</p>
            <p>To your second Exception.</p>
            <p>My Propositions were long, that my Argument (as was required) might be very short, and not exceed the quantity of half a sheet; which enforced me to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate many Syllogisms into one; and by that means in the first not to be so precise in form, as otherwise I should have been.</p>
            <p>To your third Exception.</p>
            <p>Seeing I required nothing but Logical form in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, I conceive that regard was more to be had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the learned to that, then to the errors of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar: that whilest ignorance attends to most words, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might attend to most reason.</p>
            <p>To your fourth Exception.</p>
            <p>My Argument contains not precisely the terms of my <hi>Thesis</hi>: because, when I was called upon to hasten my Argument, I had not then at hand my <hi>Thesis.</hi> Had I put
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49965:16"/>
more in my <hi>Thesis,</hi> then I prove in my Argument, I had been faulty; but proving more then my <hi>Thesis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (as I clearly do) no body hath reason to find fault with me, save my self. The <hi>reall</hi> difference betwixt <hi>Assemblies of Christians,</hi> and <hi>Congregations of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and betwixt Salvation is <hi>only to be had</hi> in those As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and Salvation is <hi>not to be had</hi> out of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, I understand not: seeing all particular Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of true Christians, must make one Congregation.</p>
            <p>To your Answer to my first Syllogism.</p>
            <p>He who distinguishes Logically the terms of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, must not apply his distinction to some one part of the <hi>term</hi> only, but to the whole <hi>term,</hi> as it stands in the proposition distinguished. Now in my proposition I affirm, that the Congregation of Christians I speak of there, is such a Congregation, <hi>that it is the true Church of Christ,</hi> that is, (as all know) the whole Catholick Church: and you distinguish thus, That I either mean by <hi>Congregation</hi> the whole Catholick Church, or only some part of it: as if one should say, <hi>Whatsoever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of men is the Common-wealth of England,</hi> and another in answer to it should distinguish, either by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of men</hi> you mean the whole Common—wealth, or some part of it, when all men know, that by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of England,</hi> must be meant the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: for no part of it is the Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, you distinguish, that some things are Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, or Necessaries, and others accidents, which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged or practised in the Church. Now to apply this distinction to my Proposition, you must distinguish that which I say is acknowledged to have been <hi>ever</hi> in the Church by <hi>the Institution</hi> of Christ, either to be meant of an Essential, or an Accident; when all the world knows
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49965:16"/>
that whatsoever is acknowledged <hi>to have been ever in the Church by Christs Institution,</hi> cannot be meant of any <hi>Accidental thing,</hi> but of a necessary, <hi>unchangeable,</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> thing, in Christs true Church. If one should advance this proposition, Whatsoever Congregation is the true Church of Christ, acknowledges the Eucharist ever to have been <hi>by Christs Institution,</hi> a proper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new Law: and another should distinguish (as you do my proposition) This may be meant either of <hi>an Essential or Accidental thing to Christs true Church:</hi> Seeing whatsoever is acknowledged to have been always in Christs Church and instituted by Christ, cannot be acknowledged but as <hi>necessary and essential</hi> to his Church. If therefore my <hi>Major,</hi> as the terms lie expressed in it, be true, it should have been granted, if false, it should have been denyed. But no Logick allows that it should be distinguished into such different members, whereof one is expresly excluded in the very terms of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. These distinctions therefore, though learned and substantial in themselves, yet were they here unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and too illogical to ground an answer in form (as you ground yours) still insisting upon them in your address almost to every proposition. Hence appears first, that I used no fallacy at all <hi>ex Accidente</hi>; seeing my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position could not be verified of <hi>an accident.</hi> Secondly, that all your instances of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> &amp;c. which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Accidents,</hi> are not apposite; because your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions as they lie, have no term which excludes <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Adjuncts,</hi> as mine hath.</p>
            <p>To the proof of my <hi>Major. Syl.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>You seem to grant the <hi>Major</hi> of my second Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism; not excepting any thing material against it.</p>
            <p>To my <hi>Minor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You fall again into the former distinctions, now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49965:17"/>
and excluded, of the meaning of <hi>Congregation,</hi> &amp;c. in my Proposition, and would have me to understand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately either the whole Catholick Church, or some part of it, (and so make four terms in my Syllogism:) whereas in my <hi>Minor, Congregation of Christians</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken generically, and abstracts, as an universal from all particulars. I say <hi>no Congregation,</hi> which is an universal negative; and when I say, none, Save <hi>that Congregation which acknowledges Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the term <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> supposes for the same whole Catholick Church mentioned in my former Syllogism, but expresses it under a general term of Congregation <hi>in confuso</hi>; as I express <hi>Homo,</hi> when I say he is <hi>Animal,</hi> a <hi>man,</hi> when I say he is a <hi>living creature,</hi> but only <hi>generically,</hi> or <hi>in confuso.</hi> Now should I have intended determinately either the whole Catholike Church, or any part of it, I should have made an inept Syllogism, which would have run thus. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever true Church of Christ is now the true Church of Christ, hath been alwaies visible, <hi>&amp;c</hi> But no true Church of Christ hath been always visible, save the true Church of Christ, which acknowledges Saint <hi>Peter, &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> whatsoever true Church of Christ, is now the true Church acknowledges Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. which would have been <hi>idem per idem</hi>; for every one knows that the true Church of Christ, is now the true Church of Christ. But speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I do in abstractive and generical terms, I avoid this absurdity, and frame a true Syllogism.</p>
            <p>Now my meaning in this <hi>Minor</hi> could be no other then this, which my words express; That the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that is, <hi>the whole Congregation</hi> acknowledges Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. and is visible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not any part, great or small of it. For when I say, the Parliament of these Nations doth, or hath enacted a Statute, who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me, whether I meant the whole Parliament, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49965:17"/>
some determinate part of it? You should therefore have denyed, not thus distinguished my <hi>Minor,</hi> quite against the express words of it. What you say again of Essentials and Accidents, is already refuted; and by that also your Syllogism, brought by way of instance. For your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position doth not say, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges those things were <hi>always done,</hi> and that by <hi>Christs Institution,</hi> as my Proposition says she acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successors.</p>
            <p>To my third Syllogism.</p>
            <p>Granting my <hi>Major,</hi> you distinguish the term <hi>Pastors</hi> in my <hi>Minor,</hi> into <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>universal, fixed</hi> and <hi>unfixed,</hi> &amp;c. I answer, that the term <hi>Pastors</hi> (as before <hi>Congregation</hi>) signifies determinately no one of these but generically and <hi>in confuso</hi> all; and so abstracts from each of them in particular, as the word <hi>Animal</hi> abstracts from <hi>homo</hi> and <hi>brutum.</hi> Neither can I mean some parts of the Church only had Pastors; for I say, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Congregation of Christians is now the true Church of Christ, hath always had visible Pastors and People united.</hi> Now <hi>the Church</hi> is not a part but the whole Church, that is both the whole body of the Church, and all particular Churches the parts of it. And hence is solved your argument of the <hi>Indians,</hi> of people converted by lay-men, when particular Pastors are dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For those were subjects of the chief Bishop alone, till some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Pastors were sent to them. For when they were taught the Christian Doctrine, in the explication of that Article, <hi>I beleeve the holy Catholick Church,</hi> they were also taught, that they being people of Christs Church, must subject themselves to their lawful Pastors, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the Christian doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. who though absent in body, may yet be present in spirit with them, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:49965:18"/>Your Answer to the confirmation of my <hi>Major</hi> seems strange. For I speak of <hi>visible</hi> Pastors, and you say 'tis true of an <hi>invisible Pastor,</hi> that is, Christ our Saviour, who is now in heaven, <hi>invisible</hi> to men on earth. The rest is a repetition of what is immediatly before answered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. proves not only that some particular Churches, or part of the whole Church, must always have Pastors, but that the whole Church it self must have Pastors, and every particular Church in it; for it speaks of that Church which is <hi>the Body of Christ</hi>; which can be no lesse then the whole Church. For no particular Church alone is his mystical Body, but only a part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. is not directly alledged to prove an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Monarch, (as you say) but to prove an uninterrupted continuance of visible Pastors; that being only affirmed in the proposition, which I prove by it. 2. This is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy answered.</p>
            <p>I stand to the judgement of any true Logician, nay or expert Lawyer, or rational person, whether a Negative proposition be to be proved otherwise then by obliging him who denies it, to give an instance to infringe it. Should you say, <hi>no man hath right to my Benefice and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in my Parish, save my self</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and another should deny what you said; would not you, or any rational man in your case answer him, that by denying your proposition he affirmed that some other had right to them, and to make good that affirmation was obliged to produce who that was: which till he did, you still remained the sole just possessor of your Benefice as before; and every one will judge that he had no reason to deny your asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he brought no proof against it. This is our case.</p>
            <p>The Contradiction which you would draw from this, against my <hi>Nego, Concedo,</hi> &amp;c. exacted from the Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and nothing else, follows not. For that prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49965:18"/>
is to be understood, that the Respondent of himself, without scope given him by the opponent, was not to use any other forms in answering; but if the opponent should require that the respondent give reasons or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, or proofs, of what he denies, that then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent is to proceed to them. And this is most ordinary in all Logical Disputations, where strict form is observed, and known to every young Logician. Instances therefore demanded by the opponent, were not excluded, but only such excursions out of form, as should proceed from the respondent, without being exacted by the opponent.</p>
            <p>You say, though I make a Negative of it, I may put it in other terms at my pleasure. But the question is not what I may do, but what I did. I required not an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to an Argument, which I may frame, but to that which I had then framed, which was expressed in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative proposition.</p>
            <p>You tell me, if I prove the Popes universal Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, you will be a Papist: And I tell you, I have proved it by this very Argument, That either <hi>He</hi> hath that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, or some other Church; denying that he hath alwaies had it, hath been always visible; and that Church I require should be named, if any such be, and whilest you refuse to name that Church (as here you do) you neither answer the Argument, nor become a Papist.</p>
            <p>You say <hi>I affirm,</hi> and <hi>I must prove.</hi> I say in the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about which we now speak, I affirm not, &amp; so must not prove; and you by denying it, must affirm, &amp; so must prove.</p>
            <p>You prove it is not your part here to prove, because the Popes Supremacy could not be denied, before it was affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and you must be obliged to prove that deniall. I oblige you not to prove a continued visible Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and expresly denying it, but that it was of such a constitution as was inconsistent with any such supremacy,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49965:19"/>
or could and did subsist without it; which is an Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>You affirm, that because I say you cannot be saved if you deny that Supremacy, and you say that I may be saved though I hold it, therefore you are not bound to prove what I reprove, but I to prove my negative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. But this would prove as well, that a Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is not bound to prove his religion to you, but you to prove yours to him, because you say he cannot be saved being a Mahumetan; and he says, that you may be saved being a Christian. See you not, that the obligation of proof in Logical form depends not of the first Position, or <hi>Thesis,</hi> but must be drawn from the immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, affirmative or negative, which is or ought to be proposed?</p>
            <p>To what you say of an Accident and a corrupt part, I have already answered.</p>
            <p>To what you say of a Vice-king, not being necessary to the constitution of a kingdom, but a king and subjects only, is true, if a vice-king be not instituted by the Full power of an absolute Authority over that kingdom, to be an Ingredient into the essence of the Kingdom, in the Kings absence: But if so constituted, it will be essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; now my proposition saith, and my Argument proves, that <hi>by the Absolute Authority of Christ, Saint</hi> Peter <hi>and his Successors were instituted Governors in Christs place of his whole visible Church</hi>; and whatsoever Government Christ institutes of his Church must be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to his Church. You see now the Disparity.</p>
            <p>You insist to have me prove a Negative; and I insist to have you prove that Affirmative, which you fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by denying my Negative, and leave it to judgement, whose exaction is the more conform to reason, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical form.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49965:19"/>But <hi>if I prove not here,</hi> say you, <hi>the whole Catholick, Churches holding ever the Popes Supremacy, you shall take it as a giving up my cause.</hi> I tell you again, that I have proved it by this very Argument, by force of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logistical form: and it is not reasonable to judge that I have given up my cause, if I prove not again, what I have already proved.</p>
            <p>Your taking upon you the part of an Opponent now, is, you know, out of Season; when that is yours, mine shall be the Respondent.</p>
            <p>AT length you give a fair attempt to satisfie your Obligation, and to return such an Instance as I demanded of you. But you are too free by much in your offer. I demand one Congregation, and you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to produce more then an hundred. But as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the number, so are they deficient in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which I require. I demand, <hi>that the Answerer nominate any Congregation of Christians, which always till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time since Christ hath been visible,</hi> &amp;c. and you tell me of more then an hundred Congregations, besides that which acknowledges Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. whereof <hi>not any one</hi> hath been all that designed time visible: which is, as if I had demanded an Answerer to nominate any Family of Gentry, which hath successively continued ever since <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour till this present time; and he who undertakes to satisfie my demand, should nominate more then a hundred Families, whereof not so much as one continued half that time. You nominate first <hi>all these present, the Greeks, Armenians, Ethiopians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Protestants.</hi> These you begin with. Now to satisfie my demand you must assert, that these, whom
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49965:20"/>
you first name, are both one Congregation, and have been visible ever since Christs time. This you do not in the pursuit of your Allegations. For <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. you nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate none at all, but tell me, that <hi>in the last age there were as many or more.</hi> What were these <hi>as many, or more</hi>? were they the same you nominated first, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? I required some determinate Congregation to be nominated all the while, and you tell me or <hi>as many or more,</hi> but say not of what determinate congregation they were. In your <hi>Num.</hi> 3. you tell me, in the former ages, till one thousand, there <hi>were near as many, or rather many more.</hi> A fair account! But in the mean time you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate none, much less prosecute you those with whom you begun. <hi>Num.</hi> 4. You say, in the year six hundred there <hi>were many more incomparably.</hi> What <hi>many</hi>? what <hi>more</hi>? were they the same which you nominated in the beginning, and made one Congregation with them? or were they quite different Congregations? what am I the wiser by your saying <hi>many more incomparably,</hi> when you tell me: not what, or who they were? Then you say, <hi>But at least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>or four hundred years after Christ, I never yet saw valid proof of one Papist in all the world, that is, one that was for the Popes universal Monarchy, or vice-Christ-ship.</hi> What then? are there no proofs in the world, but what you have seen? or may not many of those proofs be valid which you have seen, though you esteem them not so? and can you think it reasonable, upon your single <hi>not-seeing,</hi> or <hi>not-judging</hi> only, to conclude absolutely, as you here do, <hi>that all have been against us for many hundred years</hi>? In your. <hi>Num.</hi> 5. You name <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> as having been without the limits of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> whom you deny to have acknowledged any Supremacy of power and authority above all other Bishops. You might have done well to have cited at least one ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49965:20"/>
for this Assertion.

               </note>? When the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperors were yet Heathens, had not the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> the Supremacy over all other Bishops through the whole Church? and did those Heathen Emperors give it him? How came St <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in time of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Empire to request <hi>Stephen</hi> the Pope to punish and <hi>depose</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> as we shall see hereafter? Had he that authority (think you) from an Heathen Emperor? See now how little your Allegations are to the purpose, where you nominate any determinate Congregations to satisfie my demand.</p>
            <p>I had no reason to demand of you different Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, of all sorts and Sects opposing the Supremacy, to have been shewn visible in all ages. I was not so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as not to know, that the <hi>Nicolaitans, Valentinians, Gnosticks, Manichees, Montanists, Arians, Donatists, Nestorians, Eutychians, Pelagians, Iconoclasts, Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Waldensians, Albigenses, Wicleffists, Hussits, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, Calvinists,</hi> &amp;c. each following others, had some kind of visibility, divided and distracted each to his own respective age, from our time to the Apostles, in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heads and hands together against the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy. But because these could not be called <hi>one suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Congregation of Christians,</hi> being all together by the ears amongst themselves; I should not have thought it a demand beseeming a Scholar, to have required such a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49965:21"/>
visibility as this. Seeing therefore all you determinately nominate, are as much different as these; pardon me, if I take it not for any satisfaction at all to my demand, or acquittance of your obligation. Bring me a visible suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of any <hi>one</hi> Congregation of Christians, of the same belief, profession, and communion, for the designed time, opposing that Supremacy, and you will have satisfied: but till that be done, I leave it to any equall judgement, whether my demand be satisfied or no. You answer to this, That all those who are nominated by you, are <hi>parts of the Catholick Church, and so one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> But Sir, give me leave to tell you, that in your principles, you put both the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and your selves, to be parts of the Catholick Church: and yet sure you account them not one Congregation of Christians, seeing by separation one from another they are made two: or if you account them <hi>one,</hi> why did you separate your selves, and still remain separate from communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Why possessed you your selves of the Bishopricks and Cures of your own Prelates and Pastors, they yet living in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time? and drew both your selves and their other subjects from all subjection to them, and communion with them? Is this dis-union, think you, fit to make one and the same Congregation of you and them? Is not charity, subordination and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the same state and government required, as well to make one Congregation of Christians, as it is required to make one Congregation of Common-wealths men? Though therefore you do account them all parts of the Catholick Church, yet you cannot make them in your principles <hi>one Congregation</hi> of Christians. Secondly, your position is not true; the particulars named by you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, nor can be parts of the Catholick Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you make <hi>Arrians,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49965:21"/>
parts of the Catholick Church: which were either to deny them to be Hereticks and Schismaticks; or to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that Hereticks and Schismaticks separating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the communion of the Catholick Church, notwithstanding that separation, do continue parts of the Catholick Church. For who knows not that the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to this day are <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Rosse</hi> his view of Religions, <hi>p</hi> 99, 489, 492<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.

               <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereticks. And a great part of those Greeks and Armenians, who deny the Popes Supremacy, are infected with the Heresie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and all of them profess generally all those points of faith with us against you, wherein you differ from us; and deny to communicate with you, or to esteem you other then Hereticks and Schismaticks, unless you both agree with them in those differences of Faith, and subject your selves to the obedience of the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as to the chief Head and Governour of all Christian Churches next under Christ; and consequently as much a Vice-Christ, in your account, as the Pope can be conceived to be. See, if you please, <hi>Hieremias</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> his Answer to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> especially in the beginning and end of the Book; <hi>Acta Theologorum Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebergensium,</hi> &amp;c. and Sir <hi>Edwyn Sands,</hi> of this Subject, in his Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 232, 233, 242, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Either therefore you must make the Eutychians and Nestorians no Hereticks, and so contradict the Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Councils of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

them as such; and the consent of all Orthodox Christians, who ever since esteemed them no other; or you must make condemned Hereticks parts of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, against all antiquity and Christianity. And for those Greeks near <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who are not infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Nestorianism and Eutychianism, yet in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Holy Ghost, against both us and you, they must be thought to maintain manifest Heresie; it being a point in a fundamental matter of faith, the Trinity: and the difference betwixt those Greeks and the Western Church, now for many hundred of years, and in many General Councils esteemed and defined to be reall and great; yea so great, that the Greeks left the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church upon that difference alone, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver esteemed the Bishop of <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Nilus</hi> on this Subject.</note>

And yet sure they understood what they held, and how far they differed one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, much better then some Novel Writers of yours, who prest by force of Argument, have no other way left them to maintain a perpetual visibility then by extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that difference of <hi>Procession</hi> betwixt the Greek and Latin Church, which so many ages before Protestancy sprung up, was esteemed a main fundamental error by both parts, caused the Greeks to abandon all subjection and Communion to the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> made them so divided the one from the other, that they held each other Hereticks, Schismaticks, and desertors of the true Faith, as they continue still to do to this day, and yet you will have them both parts of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49965:22"/>But when you have made the best you can of these <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Ethiopians, Protestants,</hi> whom you first name, you neither have deduced, nor can deduce them successively in all ages till Christ, <hi>as a different Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christians, from that which holds the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>; which was my Proposition. For in the year 1500. those who became the first Protestants, were not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation different from those who held that supremacy; nor in the year 500 were the Greeks a visible Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>different from it</hi>; nor in the year 300. were the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians; nor in the year 200. the Eutychians <hi>a different Congregation from those who held the said Supremacy:</hi> But in those respective years, those who first begun those Heresies, were involved within that Congregation, which held it, as a part of it, and assenting therein with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who after in their several ages and beginnings fell off from it, as dead branches from the tree; that, still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining what it ever was, and <hi>only</hi> continuing in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall visibility of succession.</p>
            <p>Though therefore you profess never to have seen convincing proof of this in the first 400 years, and labour to infringe it in the next ages, yet I will make an Essay to give you a taste of those innumerable proofs of this <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible consent</hi> in the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> Supremacy, not of <hi>Order</hi> only, but of <hi>Power, Authority</hi> and <hi>jurisdiction</hi> over all other Bishops, in the ensuing instances, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened within the first 400, or 500, or 600 years.</p>

               <hi>Nestorius,</hi> but rather to put <hi>Celestines</hi> condemnation of him, given the year before, into execution. S. <hi>Cyril</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being constituted by <hi>Celestine</hi> his chief Legate ordinary in the East, by reason of that prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, and primacy of his See after that of <hi>Rome,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided in the Council: yet so, that <hi>Philip,</hi> who was only a Priest and no Bishop, by reason that he was sent <hi>Legatus à Latere,</hi> from <hi>Celestine,</hi> and so supplied his place, as he was chief Bishop of the Church, subscribed the first, even before S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and all the other Legats and Patriarchs. In the sixth Action of this holy Council, <hi>Iuvenalis</hi> patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> having understood the contempt, which <hi>Iohn</hi> patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who was cited before the Council, shewed of the Bishops and the Popes Legats there assembled, expressed himself against him in these words, <hi>Quod Apostolica ordinatione &amp; Antiqua Traditione</hi> (which were no way opposed by the Fathers there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) <hi>Antiochena sedes perpetuo à Romana diregeretur ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicareturque,</hi> That by Apostolical ordination and ancient Tradition the See of <hi>Antioch</hi> was perpetually directed and judged by the See of <hi>Rome</hi>: which words not only evidence the precedency of place as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> would have it, but of power and judicature in the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> over a Patriarch of the Eastern Church; and that derived from the time and ordination of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. The Council therefore sent their decrees, with their condemnation of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> to Pope <hi>Clestize,</hi> who presently ratified and confirmed them.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, in the year 445. <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour makes this <hi>manifesto</hi> of the most high Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical authority of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> in these words:
<q>Seeing that the merit of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who is the Prince of the Episcopal Crown, and the Dignity of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no less the authority of the holy Synod, hath
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49965:26"/>
established the primacy of the Apostolical See, lest presumption should attempt any unlawful thing against the authority of that <note n="*" place="bottom">See this at length in <hi>Baronius,</hi> in the year 445.</note> See, (for then finally will the peace of the Churches be preserved every where, if the whole universality acknowledge their Governour) when these things had been hitherto inviolably obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Where he makes the succession from S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to be the first foundation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; and his authority to be, not only in place, but in power and government over the whole visible Church: And adds presently, that the definitive sentence of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> given against any French Bishop, was to be of force through <hi>France,</hi> even without the Emperors Letters Patents. <hi>For what shall not be lawful for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of so great a Bishop to exercise upon the Churches?</hi> and then adds his Imperial precept in these words.
<q>But this occasion hath provoked also our command, that hereafter it shall not be lawful neither for <hi>Hilarius</hi> (whom to be still intituled a Bishop, the sole humanity of the meek Prelate (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) permits) neither for any other to mingle arms with Ecclesiastical matters, or to resist the commands of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. We define by this our perpetual decree, that it shall neither be lawful for the <hi>French</hi> Bishops, nor for those of other Provinces, against the ancient custom, to attempt any thing without the authority of the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pope of the eternal City: But let it be for a law to them and to all, whatsoever the authority of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick See hath determined, or shall determine. So that what Bishop soever being called to the Tribunal of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop, shall neglect to come, is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the Governour of the same Province, to present himself before him.</q>
Which evidently proves,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49965:27"/>
that the highest, Universal, Ecclesiastical Judge and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was, and ever is to be the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> before mentioned, plainly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when writing to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> they say, <note n="*" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>As to what you say of <hi>Congregation of Christians,</hi> in the beginning, I answer, I took the word of <hi>Christians</hi> in a large sense, comprehending in it all those (as it is vulgarly taken) who are baptized and profess to beleive in Christ,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49965:28"/>
and are distinguished from Jews, Mahumetans and Heathens, under the denomination of Christians.</p>
            <p>What you often say of an universal Monarch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if you take Monarch for an Imperious <hi>sole Commander,</hi> as temporal Kings are, we acknowledge no such Monarch in the Church: if onely for one who hath received power from Christ in meekness, charity, and humility, to govern all the rest, for their own eternal good, as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren or children, we grant it.</p>
            <p>What also you often repeat of a <hi>Vice-christ,</hi> we much dislike that title, as proud and insolent, and utterly disclaim from it; neither was it ever given by any suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authority to our Popes, or did they ever accept of it.</p>
            <p>As to the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> they never questioned the Supremacy of the Pope, as <hi>ordinary chief Governour</hi> of all Bishops and people in the whole Church: nay they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly give it to <hi>Martinus Quintus,</hi> when he was chosen.</p>
            <p>But in extraordinary cases, especially when it is doubtful who is true Pope, as it was in the beginning of this Council, till <hi>Martinus Quintus</hi> was chosen: whether any extraordinary power be in a general Council, above that ordinary power of the Pope: which is a question disputed by some amongst our selves, but touches not the matter in hand; which proceeds only of the ordinary and constant Supream Pastor of all Christians, abstracting from extraordinary tribunals and powers, which are seldome found in the Church, and collected only occasionally, and upon extraordinary accidents.</p>
            <p>Thus honoured Sir, I have as much as my occasions would permit me, hastened a Reply to your Answer; and if more be requisite, it shall not be denied.

                  <p>SIR, Num. 1. <hi>THe multitude and urgency of my employments gave me not leave till this day</hi> (May 2.) <hi>so much as to read over all your Papers; but I shall be as loath to break off our disputation as you can be, though perhaps necessity may sometime cause some weeks delay. And again, I profess my indignation against the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical jugling of this age doth provoke me to welcome so Ingenuous and Candid a Disputant as your self, with great content. But I must confess also, that I was the lesse hastie in sending you this Reply, because I desired you might have leasure to peruse a Book, which I published since your last,</hi> (a Key for Catholicks) <hi>seeing that I have there answered you already, and that more largely, then I am like to doe in this Reply. For the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that I must crave your patience, the persons and cause I thought required it.</hi>

                  <p>Num. 1. <hi>Sir,</hi> Your Plea is my Defence; I had my imployments, and those of great concern, as much as you; which have hitherto detained me from accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Reply. I have my Adversaries as well as you;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49965:29"/>
and no lesse then three at once in Print against me, yet the esteem I have of your worth, hath exacted from me to desist a while, from what I had begun in Answer to the chief of them, that I might bestow the whole time on you; which notwithstanding was lately interrupted (even when I was drawing towards an end) by an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and unrefusable occasion; which hath already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me many weeks, and is like to deprive me of many more. Some small time (an <hi>interstitium</hi>) (through the absence of my Adversary) hath afforded me; and that hath drawn the work almost to a period. I have not hitherto had any leisure to peruse <hi>your Key</hi>; and indeed what you here acknowledge of it, <hi>Sharpness,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrs me from medling any further with it, then what may be occasioned in this your Answer. I finde even this, (in several passages) of a relish tart enough; but I can bear with that, and I hope, observe a moderacy, where passion speaks against my cause or me. For I tell you truly, I had rather shew my self a patient Christian, then a passionate Controvertist: What reason utters, will have power with rational men: Passion never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to speak, but when reason is struck dumb, and so cannot speak according to reason.</p>

ever in the Church by Christs Institution, cannot be meant of any accidentall thing, but of a necessary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable and essential thing in Christs true Church; <hi>To which I reply, either you see the grosse fallacy of this defence, or you do not: If you do not, then never more call for an exact Disputant, nor look to be delivered from your Errors by Argumentation, though never so convincing: If you do, then you are not faithful to the Truth. In your Major Proposition the words being many, (as you say, you</hi> penetrated <hi>divers Arguments together) ambiguities were the easier hidden in the heap. That which I told you is accidental to the Church, (and that but to a corrupted part) was</hi> the acknowledging of the Papacy,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fallacy</hi> 1.</note> as of Christs Institution: <hi>and therefore if it were granted, that a thing of</hi> Christs Institution <hi>could not be</hi> accidental, <hi>yet the</hi> acknowledgment, <hi>that is, the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or</hi> asserting <hi>of it, may. If the Church by mistake should think that to be essential to it, which is not, though it will not thence follow, that its essence is but an accident, yet it will follow that both the false opinion, and the thing it self so false conceited to be essential, are but accidents, or not essential. You say</hi> it cannot be meant of any accidental thing. <hi>But</hi> 1. <hi>That meaning it self of theirs may be an accident.</hi> 2. <hi>And the question is not what they</hi> mean, <hi>that is, imagine, or affirm it to be, but what it is in deed and truth.

                     <hi>Num.</hi> 7. <hi>Sir,</hi> The fallacy is not in my Proposition, but in your understanding. You assert, that the Soveraignty of the Pope, is as accidental to the Church, (as will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear) as pride and cruelty is to the Spanish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49965:32"/>
and therefore the Acknowledgement of it is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental: for if the acknowledgement be in a matter Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential, it self must also be Essential, either to the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or destruction of the Catholick Faith. For the Essence of Faith requires, that all Essentials be believed, And it must be destructive of Faith, to believe any thing to be Essential, and absolutely necessary to Christian Faith, which is a meer Accident, and non-Essential. For such an Errour constitutes a false Christian, and teaches that to be Essentially Christian Religion, which is a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity in Christian Religion. If therefore the whole Church (as I affirm) hold the Popes Supremacy to be by Christs Institution, that is, to be essential to the Church, (as you admit for the present) and it be not by his Institution, the Church errs in an Essential matter; which errour is not Accidental to the Church, that is, such an errour, that the Church can subsist as truly with it, as without it, but essentially destructive of the Church. If the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy be by Christs Institution and thereby Essential, (as you now suppose) the Churches acknowledgement that it is so, is not accidental, but necessary and essential to the subsistence of the Church. So that to admit (as you do here) the thing it self, that <hi>whatsoever is of Christs Institution is Essential,</hi> and yet to make the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of its Essentiality by the whole Church, to be Accidental to the Church, is strange Divinity, and one of your grand Novelties. I intreat you therefore to tell me in your next, what makes the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie (as you hold) destructive of Christianity, and an essential Errour, save this onely, that it is against a point essential to Christian Faith? And I think, I have as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to hold the Errour, either contradicting that which is Essential to Christianity, or asserting that, as Essential, which is onely Accidental, to be an Essential
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49965:32"/>
Errour against Christian Faith, as was that of the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> For it had been doubtless, an essential Errour in Faith, and destructive of Christianity, not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Consubstantiality of the Father and the Son, but also to deny, that consubstantially and the belief of it to be essential to the Christian Faith, and necessary to the constitution of Christianity. Your Fallacy therefore consists in this, that you suppose, all that Christ hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to be Essential to the Church, and yet in that very supposition, make the acknowledgement of the whole Church, that such a thing is instituted by Christ, to be accidental to the Church: Of which more hereafter.</p>

Till that be done, you have answered your own Fallacy, not my Proposition. Whence appears the vanity of your instancing in a <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So that I say not, nor ever said, that Christ hath instituted a Politick Body without Accidents (as you misconceivingly accuse me) but that whatsoever he instituted to be <hi>ever</hi> in his Church, is none of those Accidents. You should do well to reflect more punctually upon your Adversaries words, and not to leave out such terms as give the whole force and Energie to his Proposition: For if this be not done, an Answer may be prolong'd till Dooms-day, by multiplying mistakes one upon another to no end.</p>

Or should a company of Murtherers, Thieves, Adulterers, Robbers, Bandits, meet in rebellion together, without Priest, or Pastor, though all Christians, they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49965:35"/>
would be a Congregation of Christians, but would you therefore call them a Church? Or when in Christian Armies the Souldiers and Commanders stand in <hi>Battalia</hi> to fight their Enemies; or Countrey-people congregate in a Fair, or to choose the Knight of the Shire, or at my Lord Mayors Feast in <hi>London,</hi> or at <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Fair to see a Puppet-play, will you term each of the Congregations of Christians, Churches? Will you term the Common-Council of <hi>London,</hi> or the Sessions of Mayor, Aldermen, and Justices, sitting in the Old-Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the Kings most Honorable Privy Councel, or the High Court of Parliament, a Church? yet all the world knows, they are each of them Congregations of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells you (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.) that the Church is composed of different Heterogenial members, (as our bodies are) one subject orderly to another, by way of Pastor and People; which is not found in every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Christians, as I have made it manifest.</p>

To all these Instances I answer, They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing against my Assertion; for I never said, that all particular persons, or communities, are obliged to have an express belief or acknowledgment, of the Roman-Bishops Supremacy; that being necessary to all
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49965:38"/>
neither <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> nor <hi>praecepti.</hi> It is sufficient that they beleeve it implicitely, in subjecting themselves to all those whom Christ hath instituted to be their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastors: and when the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proposed to them to be the supream visible Pastor of of those Pastors upon earth, that then they obstinately reject not his authority.</p>
                  <p>To your first instance of the Captive maid and Saint <hi>Frumentius,</hi> I answer, we can prove as much at least that to have been preacht to them, as you can prove, either Justification by Faith only, or any other particular point of your doctrine, to have been preacht to them. And both of us must say, that all important Christian Truths, both for particular persons and Churches, were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to those people; and till you have evinced this of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy to have been none of those, it is to be supposed, it was sufficiently declared to those Nations: At least in explicating the Article of the Catholike Church to them, they must be supposed to have told them, it consisted of Pastors and people united, and that the people were to obey all their lawful Pastors, in which doctrine, the Pope is implicitely included.</p>
                  <p>To your second from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. The Scripture relates not there all that S. <hi>Peter</hi> said, but affirmeth (<hi>vers.</hi> 40.) that <hi>he gave testimony to them in many other words.</hi> And who can tell whether amongst the rest, that of his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, might not have been sufficiently intimated to them? However it appears by the Text (<hi>vers.</hi> 37.) that the people addrest themselves first, and in particular to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> before all the rest of the Apostles, as the prime amongst them, and he who first preacht the Gospel to them. Prove the English and Dutch Convertites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by Protestants (if you mean those, as you must do, if your argument have any force) to be instructed in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49965:38"/>
true Faith, and then your Instance will have some force; prove those of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to be Orthodox and Catholick Christians. To what purpose produce you instances, which are assoon denied, as they are proposed? Your last touches only particular persons, which I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are not obliged to know this expresly, to be of the Church; the Pope is their true pastor, and so beleeved to be implicitely by them, when they subject themselves to all their lawful pastors, he being one and the chief of them.</p>

The question in treatie is (seeing we both confess the <hi>members</hi> and <hi>profession</hi> of the Universal Militant Church to be visible) whether Christ in the exercise of his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or chief-Pastorship over the Church, renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self visible to our corporal eyes, or performs immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any visible action in relation to his Church.

I say not, that every Opponent may come to a Negative <hi>at his</hi> pleasure, (as you make me say) but when that Negative is deduced by force of Syllogistical form, and denied by the Respondent in a matter proveable by instances, as this is, I affirm, and desire it should be sent to both our Learned Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, that he, who denies the universal Negative, is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49965:41"/>
obliged, in Logical process, to give some instance to the contrary: and that there is no other means to prove that Negative, but by infringing the instances, which the Respondent produces against it. For if the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent go to prove his universal negative by Induction, <hi>viz.</hi> in my present Minor, <hi>But no Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians hath been alwayes visible, save those which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge St.</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he must come at last to this, Such a Congregation is neither that of the Arrians, nor of the Eutychians, nor of Nestorians, nor any other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that can be named. Then, if the Respondent deny that Proposition, and affirm there is some name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he is obliged to tell which it is, otherwise it is impossible to make progress in the Argument: which way of arguing notwithstanding is most Logical, and usually practised amongst Learned Disputants.</p>

                  <p>Num. 25. <hi>We are all agreed, that Christianity is the true Religion, and Christ the Churches universal Head, and the Holy Scriptures the Word of God. Papists tell us of another Head and Rule; the Pope and Tradition, and Iudgement of the Church. Protestants deny these</hi> Additionals, <hi>and hold to</hi> Christianity <hi>and</hi> Scripture one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: our Religion <hi>being nothing but Christianity, we have no controversie about: their</hi> Papal Religion, superadded, <hi>is that which is controverted. They affirm</hi> 1. <hi>the</hi> Right, 2. <hi>the</hi> Antiquity <hi>of it: We deny both.</hi> The Right <hi>we</hi> disprove <hi>from</hi> Scripture, <hi>though it belongs to them to</hi> prove <hi>it. The</hi> Antiquity <hi>is it, that is now to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Protestancy being the denial of Popery, it is</hi> we <hi>that really have the</hi> Negative, <hi>and the</hi> Papists, <hi>that have the</hi> Affirmative. <hi>The</hi> Essence of our <hi>Church</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49965:41"/>
(<hi>which is</hi> Christian) <hi>is confessed to have been successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visible: But we deny that</hi> theirs, <hi>as Papal, hath been so: and now they tell us, that it is</hi> Essential <hi>to ours, to deny the Succession of</hi> theirs; <hi>and therefore require us to prove a Succession of ours, as one that still hath</hi> denied theirs. <hi>Now we leave our Case to the Lawyers, seeing to them you make your Appeal,</hi> 1. <hi>Whether the Substance of all our Cause lie not in this question,</hi> Whether the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, or universal Government by the Pope, be of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or of Men?<note place="margin">Fallacy 8.</note> 
                     <hi>and so,</hi> Whether it hath been from the beginning? <hi>which</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>and therefore are called</hi> Protestants; <hi>and they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and are therefore called</hi> Papists. 2. <hi>If they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> first prove <hi>a</hi> Successive visibility <hi>of their</hi> Papacy <hi>and Papal Church, then what Law can bind us to prove that it was</hi> denied <hi>before it did</hi> arise <hi>in the world, or ever any pleaded for it?</hi> 3. <hi>And as to the point of</hi> Possession, <hi>I know not what can be pretended on your side</hi> 1. <hi>The possession of this, or that particular Parish Church, or Tythes, is not the thing in question; but the</hi> universal Headship <hi>is the thing. But if it were, yet it is I that am yet here in Possession; and Protestants before me for many Ages Successively. And when possessed you the Head-ship of the Ethiopian, Indian, and other Extra-Imperial Churches? never to this day. No, nor of the Eastern Churches, though you had Communion with them.</hi> 2. <hi>If the question be, who hath possession of</hi> the universal Church, <hi>we pretend not to it; but onely to a part, and the soundest, safest part</hi> 3. <hi>The Case of Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session therefore is, Whether we have not been longer in Possession of our Religion, which is bare Christianity, then you of your super-added Popery. Our Possession is not denied of Christianity: yours of Popery we deny: (and our denial makes us called Protestants) Let therefore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49965:42"/>
the reason of Logicians, Lawyers, or any rational sober man determine the case, whether it do not first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally belong to you, to prove the visible Succession of a Vice-Christ over the universal Church.</hi>

                     <hi>Num.</hi> 25. Fair and softly, Sir, you are run quite out of the field, and have lost your self I know not where. The present question is not, who is to prove the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal and perpetual Supremacy of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Bishop? See you not, that I have already undertaken the proof of that in this present Argument? The question at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is nothing but this, when I have brought the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this Head; that no other Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians can be named perpetually visible, save that which acknowledges the Roman Supremacy, and you deny that negative Proposition of mine, whether you be not obliged upon that denial, to name some Congregation, which has been perpetually visible beside it. This, and this onely, is that which I referr'd, and still refer to the the judgement of the Learned: as to your Case, when it comes in season; it shall be resolved. This onely <hi>ex abundanti</hi> for the present: whatsoever may be, or not be, of the Indians and Ethiopians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which shall hereafter be examined.) You, who confess the Pope to have been constituted,<note place="margin">Part 2.</note> at least by the Churches grant, Patriarch of the West, and thereby to have acquired a lawfull Supremacy over the Western Churches, (and consequently over that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) and was in <hi>full and quiet possession</hi> of that Right, when your first Protestants began to reject it; you, I say, cannot deny, those first Protestants at least to have been obliged, by reason of that possession, to bring convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49965:42"/>
proofs that it was unlawfull: which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you must hold impossible to be done, because you hold that Patriarchal power over them to have been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Now what obligation falls upon you, as maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing successively so wrongfull a cause, I leave to your consciences to determine. Nay, it is most evident, in time of the first breach with the Roman Bishop, he was in as quiet possession of Supremacy over the English Church, in quality of Supreme visible Pastor over the whole Church, as he was in quality of the Western Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch; for the English obeyed him as Supreme over all, and not as Patriarch of the West onely, as appears by thousands of testimonies extant in our National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Doctors, Bishops, Historians, Records, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore those, who dispossest him of that possession, were bound either to have demonstrated it undeniably to be unlawfull, or to have procured a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive Sentence against him by such as had full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to judge him, that his possession was unjust: neither of which either hath been done, nor can ever be done.</p>

                  <p>Num. 27. <hi>I told you, I would be a Papist, if you prove,</hi> That the whole visible Church in all Ages held the Popes universal Head-ship. <hi>You say that</hi> you have proved it by this Argument, that either he hath that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, or some other Church, denying that he hath alwayes had it, hath been alwayes visible: <hi>and that Church you require should be named. I reply,</hi> 1. <hi>Had not you despaired of making good your Cause, you should have gone on by Argumentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till you had forced me to contradict some common Principle.</hi> 2. <hi>If you should shew these Papers to the world, and tell them, that you have no better proof of the Succession of your Papacy, then that we prove not, that it hath alwayes been denied by the visible Church, you would sure turn thousands from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, if there be so many rational considering impartial men, that would peruse them, and believe you. For any man may know, that it could not be expected, that the Churches should deny a Vice-Christ, before he was sprung up. Why did not all the precedent</hi> Roman <hi>Bishops disclaim the title of</hi> universal Bishop, <hi>or Patriarch, till</hi> Pelagius <hi>and</hi> Gregory? <hi>but because there was none in the world that gave occasion for it.

First, you are forced to contradict that Principle in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, That he, who denies an universal Negative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, framed in a positive Historical matter, as mine is, is not obliged to give an instance, when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to infringe the universality of it: and this I have, and do refer. The second is a Theological, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian Principle, That no professed Heretick, nor Schismatick properly so called, is a true part of the universal visible Church of Christ. That this is such a Principle, shall appear hereafter; where I shall make it evident, that a professed Heretick, properly so called, had, or could have, true Christian Faith, or the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, without which no man can be a true member of the Catholick Church, that is, united to Christ as his Head, as you explicate your meaning. Your other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, about the Title of Universal Bishop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be answered in their place.</p>

But have you dealt as fairly with me; when after I had so clearly explicated my self, in my former Answer, not to exact a perpetual visible Church, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and expresly denying that Supremacy, you make me frame an Argument, in the precedent Paragraph, exacting the formal and express denial of it in all Ages: is this fair? You corrupt again my Proposition, I say not that I freed you from proving a Church that denied the Papacy formally and expresly, but (as you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in this Paragraph) that <hi>I obliged you not to prove a continued visible Church formally and expresly denying it,</hi> that is, such a Church, as denied it so, all the time that it was visible; yet I quitted you not of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of instancing in a Church which at some time or other denied it formally and expresly, as your infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence seems to affirm I do.

For you may now see plainly, that to prove that the Church was without an universal Pastor (which you require) is to prove the Negative,</hi> viz. <hi>that then there was none such; whereas it's you that must prove, that there was such.

But give me leave to tell you, till that be done, I shall take it for an <hi>Effugium</hi> from you, and (and so I think will all rational men) to set upon a new work before the old be finisht: For by this means we shall bring nothing to an Issue, but still flit superficially from one difficulty to another, without bringing any thing to a period; and thereby both lose our time and credit. Let us first follow this close, and when we are come to an end, we shall be ready to begin another. It is not for the present the proof of the perpetual visibility of your Protestant Church in particular, which is aimed at for answer to my Argument: Be it that, or any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> authority, 'tis all one for solution of the Argument: The force of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course consists in this, <hi>No Congregation of Christians has been perpetually visible, save that which acknowledges the Popes Supremacy</hi>; Ergo, <hi>No Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is Christs true Church, save that.</hi> Now this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment presses all Congregations of Christians, whether Ancient or Modern, not acknowledging that Supremacy, as much as Protestants; and if any of them can be proved to be perpetually visible, the Argument is solv'd: So that the Argument is not directed particularly against Protestants, but as well against Grecian Schismaticks, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians, Nestorians, Montanists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as against them;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49965:47"/>
and had it fallen into their hands, as it did into yours, the proving their visibility (though yours had not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) would have given satisfaction: nay if you had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the perpetual visibility of any others, as you have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed to do of yours, you had given an equal satisfaction to the Argument. But seeing you have pitcht upon the visibility of your Protestant Church you have imposed an obligation upon me of answering the reasons and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, whereby you labour to prove it to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually visible.</p>

You must therefore, either have nominated, and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what sort of professions you mean, or acknowledge you have spoken in the air, and produc'd a pure non-proof, in the nomination of those Countreys, since no man can know by that, what sort of profession you mean, amongst all those different professions which have inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the said Nations; for Arrians, Sabellians, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, Menandrians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom you hold to be no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and to erre in Essentials, denied the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in those Nations.</p>

Now though that Council was celebrated in the year 430. yet both that, in a moral consideration, passes for 400. and those Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates witnessing what they said, to have alwayes been known to every one (<hi>notum omnibus,</hi> &amp;c.) give an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical Testimony, that it was alwayes acknowledged as a Christian Truth, in and through the Church; and consequently within the first 400. years. No, nor was the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> nor any part of it, then against us. For if they had, they would have, at least some of them, contradicted that, which they had (in your sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position) esteemed so manifest an untruth, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the liberty and jurisdiction of all other Bishops and Churches; as imposing upon them a Superiour, and Judge, who had no lawfull Authority over them.</p>

I neither find it, nor can find it, till you tell me, which were these Extra-Imperial Churches you mean, when you say <hi>other Extra-Imperial Nations.</hi> Mean you <hi>all other,</hi> or <hi>some other</hi>? If <hi>all,</hi> I find the quite contrary. For the Goths, successively inhabitants of <hi>Spain,</hi> never acknowledged themselves Subjects to the Empire; who notwithstanding are now subject to the Roman Bishop; and consequently were and are, for some time, under him. And the Suedes and Danes, which pretend to proceed from the Goths, Vandals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though now they reject all obedience to him, yet in the year 1500. they all acknowledged themselves to be his Subjects in Spirituals, and that for many hundred of years together. Well then; I find not all <hi>Extra</hi>-Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Churches from under the Popes Jurisdiction; and some who are, I can and do find, when and how they turned from him. It was about the year 1520. by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Heresie, as all the world knows. If you mean onely some of those other Extra-Imperial Churches, when you have told me, which are <hi>those some,</hi> you shall have an Answer. In the <hi>interim</hi> give me leave to tell you, that to maintain your Novelty, you must shew all Extra-Imperial to have been exempt: for if any one were not, all might have been subject, nay were to have been so, <hi>à paritate rationis.</hi>

Nor were the Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians, in all ages, a different Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Romane. For <hi>Anno</hi> 1524. the Emperour and High Priest, <hi>David,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised obedience to the Sea Apostolick.

You undertook to shew, in Answer to my <hi>Minor,</hi> some visible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, beside that which acknowledges the Popes Supreme power, in all Ages since Christ. To prove this, you nominate onely the Indians, Ethiopians, Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Now no one of these Three have been in all Ages, a visible Congregation <hi>beside that of Rome</hi>: for each of them, at one time or other, became the same Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to that, by subjecting and conforming themselves to and with the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I have proved. You assert, that these Three are, and ever were, Extra-Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Nations; and upon that score (in your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) independent of the Roman Bishop: and yet Two of these made themselves subjects to the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as I have now proved. You undertook to prove, that those three forenamed Nations, and other Extra-Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Churches were never under the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>: and in proof thereof you say in your first reason, that <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>most of them,</hi> (that is, not all) at this day are from under his Jurisdiction: so that your Argument runs thus.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49965:52"/>
None of them were ever under him, because all or most of them were never under him. Take you this to be Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick? You tell me, <hi>we</hi> cannot tell, when or how they turned from us; and I tell you, and have prov'd it, that the Goths in <hi>Spain</hi> are not from under us at this day: and that the Suedes and Danes, being their off-spring, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from us, till about the year 1520. by occasion of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Heresie. This is your first proof: and no marvel you put it, as your <hi>Achilles,</hi> in the front, it is so mighty strong. Now let us hear your second.</p>

Must those Books which contain nothing but the service of the Church, determine points of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, no way pertaining to that subject? What rule have you for that? Yet I finde in their very Liturgie, both a plain acknowledgment of St. <hi>Peters</hi> primacy, and of the reverence they bear to the three first general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; in making a particular Commemoration of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which were in them, in the Cannon of their Mass: whereby they profess to receive the Decrees of those three Councils, and thereby their subjection to them; and name not the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> (the fourth general) because they follow the Heresie of <hi>Eutiches</hi> who was condemned in it.</p>

For if those Ancients mean't by <hi>merita B. Petri,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Sanctity, and grounded the Primacy of his Sea in them, it must have been undoubtedly known to them, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a greater Saint, and of a life more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, then either S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Evangelist, or S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> or any of the other Apostles; of which none of these had any certainty at all, much less was it a thing received in the Church, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Sanctity, then any of his fellow-Apostles: prove there was any such perswasion. Nay it would probably have been esteemed a temerity, a very great curiosity, to have preferr'd the sanctity of any one amongst them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the rest. But I wonder much, you observed not the manner of speaking of those holy Fathers and grave Authors, who give it clearly enough to be understood, what <hi>Merits</hi> they meant. For had they been of your opinion, they should have added by way of explication, <hi>Meritis Beati Petri, qui sanctissimus erat inter omnes Apostolos,</hi> (by the Merits of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est amongst all the Apostles.) But to shew they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not that, but the Merits of Dignity and Authority, they usually add this clause, <hi>Meritis Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ati Petri, qui Princeps est omnium Apostolorum,</hi> (by the Merits of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who is the Prince of all the Apostles,) which speaks manifestly a merit, or worth, of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And it were very strange to regulate the Authority of Episcopal Seas by the personal merits of their first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutors; both because that is (without an express re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) a thing known to God onely, and would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion a thousand contentions about the precedency of Bishops; every one being desirous to esteem the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of his City, or Nation, the greater Saint; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there never was, in Ancient times, any such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son given for the precedency of Episcopal, or Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

Seas; (if there were, shew it) nor was any of the other Apostles successors preferred before the rest, upon pretence that his merits and sanctity was esteemed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then that of others.</p>

                        </gap>b. 6.20.</note> He is <hi>a Pope according to the order of Melchisedec.</hi> I alwayes thought, that <hi>Pontifex,</hi> or <hi>summus Pontifex,</hi> signified the highest sort of Priests, both in the Old Testament and the New, but never heard that it signified <hi>Pope</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But you have some drift in this. <hi>Baronius,</hi> say you, in <hi>Martyrolog. Roman. April.</hi> 9. affirms, that all Bishops were stiled anciently, not onely <hi>Pontifices,</hi> but <hi>summi Pontifices,</hi> that is, say you, <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>chief Popes</hi>; to infringe thereby what some gather, (as you say) <hi>viz</hi> the Supremacy of the Roman Bishop, from this Title, of being stiled <hi>Summi Pontifices,</hi> chief Popes, say you, <hi>pag.</hi> 173. You should have done well to have told us, who those <hi>some</hi> were; and would have done so, had you writ like a Scholar. But I'le help you out for once. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is one of that <hi>some</hi> you speak of, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Pontif. Roman. cap.</hi> 31. <hi>sect. Quartum.</hi> But <hi>Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> say you, affirms that Title to have been attributed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49965:60"/>
anciently to all Bishops; that's true too, if you take the Latin words; but not in that sense, wherein <hi>Bellarmin</hi> takes <hi>Summus Pontifex.</hi> For <hi>Baronius</hi> takes it for a chief Priest, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for the chiefest, or highest Priest, not onely in respect of simple Priests, who are in a rank below Bishops, and in relation to whom Bishops were anciently stiled <hi>summi Pontifices,</hi> such as were in the highest order of Priests; but absolutely in respect of all other Bishops in the Church. For <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> in proof of this Title, cites an Epistle of Pope <hi>Stephen,</hi> where the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is stiled <hi>Summus omnium praesulum Pontifex,</hi> the highest Bishop of all Prelates, or Bishops. In the same sense he cites S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> And lastly the sixth Synod, which intitles him, Act. 18. <hi>in Sermon. Acclamatorio, Sanctissimum Patrem nostrum, &amp; summum Papam,</hi> (their most holy Father, and most high Pope) that is, the highest of all Bishops, even over the Bishops of that Council. And though <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> cited by you, grant the bare words of <hi>summus Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex,</hi> as they signifie onely a chief Priest, were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently given to all Bishops, yet in his Annals, <hi>Anno</hi> 215, <hi>&amp;</hi> 216. <hi>num.</hi> 3. from the Title of <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> (the greatest, or highest Bishop) that is <hi>summus Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex</hi> in <hi>Bellarmins</hi> sense, he proves the eminent Authority of the Roman Bishop. Now this is worth the noting also, that you first take <hi>summus Pontifex</hi> for the chief Pope, in <hi>Bellarmins</hi> sense, and then prove that <hi>summus Pontifex,</hi> as it signifies not the chief Pope, but a chief Priest, as <hi>Baronius</hi> takes it, is no proof of his universal Authority.</p>
                  <p>In your second Paragraph you shew, that the Titles <hi>Papa, Dominus, Pater Sanctissimus, Beatissimus, Dei aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimus,</hi> &amp;c. were commonly given to all Bishops. Who confute you here? who ever said these Titles prove his Supremacy?</p>

                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49965:60"/>The like is of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> being called the <hi>mother</hi> of all Churches: <hi>Paraph.</hi> 3. for the term <hi>mother</hi> may be understood either in relation to the first origin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or fountain of Christanity, and in this sense <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is the mother Church; or in regard of authority and government, which a mother hath over her children.

But is it not very handsome for you, first to affix the title of <hi>mother</hi> absolutely to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and then to infringe that title by saying the <hi>Church of Cesarea,</hi> (out of S. <hi>Basil</hi>) <hi>is the mother of all Churches in a manner.</hi> Would you think it a rational answer, if one should prove your mother had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to correct you by vertue of the title of <hi>mother</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>In your fourth Paragraph you say, If the words be consulted where the Roman Church is stiled <hi>mater Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiarum,</hi> (mother of all Churches) for thats her title, they signifie only priority of dignity, that is, without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and jurisdiction over all Churches joyned to that dignity. And this you never go about to prove, so irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable is your authority, that your bare word must passe for a proof.

                  </p>
                  <p>In your fifth, you first call those <hi>marks of flattery,</hi> for giving the title of <hi>Vniversal Bishop</hi> to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> which the whole Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> approved, and read publikely; and therefore must all have concurred with flatterers, and yet in the next line you affirm, that by the

title of <hi>universal,</hi> they meant no more then the Bishop, <hi>which in order of dignity is above the rest</hi>; and that you confess, belongs as due to the Roman Bishop: how then account you them flatterers, when they give the Pope no more then his due? Either therefore they were no flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; and then you injure them in branding those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venerable persons with so black a note; or they meant more then you would have them mean by <hi>universal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>; and then you speak untruly, in putting a false gloss upon their words; chuse which you please, you contradict your self.</p>
                  <p>And you are as consonant to your self in instancing, that many particular Churches are oft called <hi>Catholick</hi>; What then? <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Title of <hi>Archbishop of the Catholick Church,</hi> or the <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> proves not the Popes Supremacy: Draw these two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if you can.

Then will you say, if you say any thing, there must be a difference betwixt <hi>an Archbishop of a Catholick Church,</hi> and the <hi>Archbishop of the Catholick Church</hi>: Thats true too. But see you not that this discourse quite overthrows yours; for you say not that the title, whose sequel you infringe is, that the Pope is called <hi>an Archbishop of a Catholick Church,</hi> for so is every Orthodox Archbishop as well as the Pope, but that he is called <hi>the Archbishop of the Catholick Church:</hi> These are your precise words.

at <hi>Constantinople, Anno</hi> 518.

                  <p>Presently upon this you fall upon a Story concerning <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and by that you prove nothing.

Thus <hi>Iustinianus junior</hi> endeavoured all he could, even by force and violence, to draw Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the Trullane Cannons, though he could not effect it: Nay, had you drawn a natural sequel from such proceedings, it should rather have been, That <hi>Iustinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus senior</hi> therefore proceeded so violently against <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> to induce him to subscribe to the condemnation of the <hi>Tria capitula,</hi> decreed in the fifth Council, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he esteemed him to be of so eminent power, that it would never have been universally received as a lawful General Council without his Subscription to it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it; which was the reason that moved <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus junior</hi> to press <hi>Sergius</hi> so forcibly to subscribe to that in <hi>Trullo.</hi>

when you are deceived your selves, how will you look Christ in the face, when you must answer for such temerity?</hi> Leo <hi>hath no Sermons</hi> de natali suo, <hi>but only one Sermon affixed to his Sermons, lately found in an old Book of</hi> Nicol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fabers. <hi>And in that Sermon there is no such words as you alledge.

                  <p>Nor will your usual Solution to my subsequent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections serve your turn. For it appears evidently in the form used in Excommunications and Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Rome,</hi> they were, not onely Declarations that the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Bishops, substracted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from communicating with them (which, say you, any Christian may do) but a positive ejection of them out of the Church, and from the Communion of all faithfull Christians. Thus runs the Excommunication and Condemnation of <hi>Acacius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Christantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and his adherents, the Bishops of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> given out against them by Pope <hi>Felix. Habe ergo cum his quos libenter amplecteris, portionem ex sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiâ praesenti.

Thou art separated from Priestly Honour, from Catholick Communion, and from the number of the Faithfull. Know that thou art depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Name and Ministery of a Priest, being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the judgement of the Holy Ghost, and by Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Authority, never to be loosed from the bonds of this <hi>Anathema.</hi>) See here, 1. A positive exclusion from the number and communion of the Faithfull. 2. A deposition from Priesthood, or being Bishop. 3. That this is done,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49965:69"/>
not by way of counsel, but of authority, <hi>authoritate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicâ,</hi> it was done by the Popes Apostolical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 4. That this judgement of the Apostolick Sea is attributed to the Holy Ghost. And lastly, That the Pope exercises this high authority over the three chiefest and highest Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> at the same time. From which it will hereafter sufficiently appear, how groundlesse your Answers are to my Objections. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>Nor yet can you alledge (as you do to some of my proofs) that these were unlawful, and unjust proceedings. For first, The matter of the sentence was not unjust, those being Hereticks, Schismaticks, Intruders and Usurpers, against whom the sentence was decreed: and that it was not unjust, as proceeding from one who had no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to inflict such a punishment, is clear: For neither did the Catholick, nor Orthodox Christians, no nor those very Schismaticks, who were thus censur'd by <hi>Felix,</hi> pretend any thing against the power of his Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; and if any such plea were used by them, let it be evidenced out of authentical Authors in or about those times. Now to your discourse, if either the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a Jury, or the Senior Justice upon the Bench, or the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> or the first Earl of <hi>England</hi> should pronounce a penal sentence against those, who respectively are inferiour only in place and precedency to themselves, would it not be judged profoundly ridiculous?</p>

But I have now proved the power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Roman Bishop to be over all Nations, that were Christian, in the instances given above. If therefore the power he had were given him by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, they must have given him power over all Churches; which no Emperor could do, as having no Authority over Extra-Imperial Churches. Whence follows evidently, the power he had could not have been given him by the Emperours. And as little could that of precedency even over the Empire, have been given him before the Nicene Council by the Bishops within the Empire, for there is no step in antiquity of any such gift, and if there be, shew when, and by whom it was first given him.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49965:74"/>
not onely all kind of Authority, but plain reason, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws this your Novelty.</p>
                  <p>For first, the end, why these Councils were gathered, was to procure peace amongst Christians, not in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire onely, but through the whole Catholick Church, and to put a final period to the controversies defined in them, as appears from the Authorities now cited out of S. <hi>Austin.</hi> Now if the Extra-Imperial Nations had not been obliged by those Definitions, the controversies had still continued among them, as much as if no such Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition had been made. Secondly, if any desired to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace still the Heresies condemned in them, it was but conferring themselves to the Extra-Imperial Churches, and they had freedome in conscience from their former obligation, as not being bound there to subscribe to the Councils Decrees. So that every obstinate Heretick might shake off these Decrees at his pleasure. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any Nation, or Province, should have been by force of Arms won from the Empire, which was under it in time of these Councils, they would <hi>ipso facto</hi> have been freed from obeying the Decrees, and beleeving the Doctrine of these Councils. Fourthly, if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary any Extra-Imperial Nation had been reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Empire, <hi>eo ipso,</hi> it would have contracted an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to conform to the Decrees of the said Councils; so that Christian belief should have depended on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of War. Fifthly, if your assertion were true, it would follow, that now <hi>de facto</hi> neither <hi>Spain, France, Italy, England, Denmark, Swethland, Poland,</hi> nor any of the Eastern Churches are obliged to subscribe to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, (and the same is of the rest) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then of their free choice, ever since they were from under the command of the Empire. Nay hence will follow, that even those of <hi>Germany,</hi> by reason that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49965:74"/>
is another Empire, instituted independently of that in those ancient times; and consequently, that no Christian Churches in the world, have any obligation successively descending down to them, of obeying and following the Decrees of the four First General Councils. My last rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, that those Extra-Imperial Christians, who embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Heresies condemned in any one of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, never alledged this reason of yours, that those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils had no power to oblige them, because they were not under the Empire: and I pray you, in your next, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any such reason, authentically testified, to have been alledged by them.</p>

And therefore we cannot call</hi> the Universal Church, one, <hi>in any other formal respects, but as it is</hi> Christian, <hi>and so</hi> one in <hi>Christ.</hi>

                     <hi>Num.</hi> 88. We acknowledge the Church to be <hi>one in Christ,</hi> as much as you, but we acknowledge him as <hi>Head,</hi> not to be the Formal, but the Causal unity, that is, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the formal unity, to wit, Faith and Charity in his Church. It is not enough to make one living organical body, that there be one head and parts, but those parts must be united to their Head, and amongst themselves, and to that Head: Nor is it enough, that there be several parts in the Church, and one head of it, but those parts must also be united to their Head, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves; otherwise they are not <hi>one.</hi> Now that which is the formall cause of this Unity, is true Christian Faith and Charity, which do both unite Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans amongst themselves, and to Christ their Head. I mean that necessary and prime charity, which preserves exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion, and society amongst Christians, so much celebrated by the Fathers and Schoolmen, which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by nothing but Schism, or that which includes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49965:77"/>
Schism: Whence appears, that to whomsoever the name of Christian is vulgarly given, unless there be found true Faith and this Christian charity amongst all the other members, they cannot be actual parts of the one true Catholick Church: When therefore you say, the Church universal cannot be called <hi>one, in any other formal respect, but as it is Christian,</hi> if you mean by <hi>Christian,</hi> all such as have <hi>true</hi> Christian <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, (ut supra)</hi> you say true; and you say nothing, but what all good Christians say. But then here comes the difficulty, how any Heretick or Schismatick can be a Christian, more then <hi>nomine tenus,</hi> in denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, or in a laxe acception of the word, for such as make a bare profession to beleeve in Christ, and are thereby distinguished from Jewes Mahumetans and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and so pass under the notion of Christians.</p>
                  <p>For if to be a Christian in our present strict sense, be required a true Christian Faith, then all that are true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have true faith; but no Heretick hath true faith; <hi>Ergo,</hi> No Heretick is in this strict acception a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. The <hi>Major</hi> is evident: I prove the <hi>Minor.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hath true faith, beleeveth the material object of faith (or the thing beleeved) for the Divine Authority of God revealing it: But no Heretick beleeves the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial object of faith (or the thing beleeved) for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of God revealing it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Heretick hath true faith. The <hi>Major</hi> is granted by all Divines, yours and ours. For Christian faith must rest upon Gods revelation, as its formal object. I prove the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi> Whosoever beleeves the material object of faith, (or thing beleeved) for the Divine Authority of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it, must beleeve all things, which are as suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently propounded to him to be revealed by God, as are the rest of the Articles which he beleeveth, protesteth to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:49965:77"/>
and beleeve nothing as revealed, which is as sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to him to be erroneous, or not revealed by Divine Authority, as are the Articles of Faith propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be revealed by God. But every Heretick either refuses to beleeve something, which is so sufficiently propounded to him to be revealed from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>od, or beleeves something as revealed, which is so sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to him to be erroneous, or not revealed from God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Heretick hath true faith. The <hi>Major</hi> I prove thus, as to the first part: Whosoever refuses to beleeve what is so sufficiently propounded to be revealed by God, either beleeves all that is so propounded, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves some things, and refuses to beleeve others, as sufficiently propounded as those which he beleeves. But if he refuses all, he can have no true faith; for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves nothing, and consequently is no Christian. If he beleeves some, and refuses others equally propounded, he beleeves them not for the Divine Authority reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (for when <hi>that</hi> is equally propounded to his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, it ought to work equally upon it) but upon his own willful choice, or private judgement refuses one, and assents to the other.</p>
                  <p>To illustrate this, Let this sentence of Scripture, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ die refurget, (he shall rise again the third day)</hi> be so sufficienly propounded to be Gods revelation, that whosoever refuses to beleeve the substance of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Resurrection delivered in it, is justly condemned for not beleeving Gods revelation. Now suppose some new Heretick (as I have heard of one such lately) should beleeve, that Christ did rise again from the dead, yet dis-believes that he rose the third day, and perswades himself, that his Resurrection happened some time after the third day: Let such an Heretick be asked why he beleeves, that Christ rose from death, if
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49965:78"/>
he tell you because God hath revealed it in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named sentence, then ask him what moves him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God has revealed it: if he tells you, because he finds it clearly expressed in this sentence of Scripture, which he beleeves to be Gods revealed word, demand further, why he beleeves it to be his word? he will tell you, because it is sufficiently propounded to him as such, so that he is satisfied that it is the Word of God. Then presse him thus: But certainly, you beleeve not that place of Scripture to be the Word of God; for if you did, you would beleeve all that it contained in it, which you do not; for it is as clearly exprest in that sentence, That Christ rose again <hi>the third day,</hi> as that he <hi>rose at all</hi>: but you beleeve not that he rose the <hi>third day; Ergo,</hi> You beleeve not that Sentence to be the Word of God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> You cannot beleeve that Christ rose again, for the authority of Gods word in that sentence; <hi>Ergo,</hi> You beleeve it not because God has revealed it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> You have no divine Faith at all of the mystery of the Resurrection, but a meer humane perswasion, grounded upon your own particular phansie or reason that it is so. Thus you see it is impossible to beleeve any thing, which God has revealed, for the Authority of Divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unless he who beleeves gives the like assent to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other truth, (be it of what importance, great or small, in it self, makes nothing to our present difficulty) which is as plainly proposed to him to be revealed from God, as that which he beleeves.</p>
                  <p>To make this yet more facile to the unlearned, I will declare it by a Vulgar instance. Suppose there were some honourable and worthy Person in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, of so great credit, that what he saves is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by every one as an undoubted truth. Some other of credible Authority tells his friend, this Honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49965:78"/>
has told him two things, and affirmed both of them to be true of his own knowledge; his friend tells him he beleeves the one, but will not by any means assent to the other. He asks his friend, Why beleeve you the first? He answers, because such a person affirmes it to be true. He demands further, why beleeve you he said so? the friend answers upon your relation. Then sayes the other you hold my relation to be a sufficient indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to make you beleeve he said the first. Yes, says his friend, I do; not so, replies the relator; for if you did, you would beleeve he said the second, as well as the first; for I assure you as much that he said the one as the other. Now what can his Friend answer? he must either say, that he beleeves not the Honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son said so, upon the sole authority of the others relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and consequently, that neither of those truths were sufficiently propounded to him by that relator, and so could beleeve neither the first not the second, contrary to his former acknowledgment, and our present supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or he must deny that he beleeves the second of those relations, though the Honourable Personage said both the one and the other; and then it is evident, he beleeved not the first upon the sole credit of his saying, but for som other reason of his own. For if he had beleeved the first upon his sole word, he must have beleeved the second also; seeing he had as much reason to beleeve he said the second as the first.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have endeavoured to prove the first part of my <hi>Major.</hi> Now I prove the second, <hi>Viz.</hi> That no man can have true Christian faith, who beleeves any thing as revealed from God, which is as sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him to be erroneous, or not revealed from God, as are the Articles of Faith, to be Gods revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49965:79"/>
the very same Authority which affirms the one, denying the other. Let us suppose some rigid Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist, beleeving the Pope to be that great Antichrist, foretold in the Revelation; and that the very same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which (as he acknowledges) sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him the Articles of Christian Faith, as revealed from God, assured him, that no such matter as the Popes being that great Antichrist, was ever revealed, and that it was a manifest error in Faith. In this case ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Calvinist must dis-beleeve that propounding Authority, and thereby loose his Faith in the former Articles, and have no true Faith at all in the first, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it in the second, because it is still the very same Authority in both. For that very Authority which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the Articles of Faith as revealed from God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this as not revealed, and as contrary to Gods revelation.</p>

Can you call the head and the neck two heads, because both of them with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination the one to the other, are placed above the rest of the body? The head is the highest part of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical body, and whatsoever is subordinate to that, is no head absolutely, though it be next the head, and higher then all the other parts. Christ is only the Head of his whole Church, comprising the Militant and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant; and of this whole Church the Pope is a part, but no Head. The Holy Councils and Fathers indeed stile him sometimes Head of the visible Militant Church (as we shall see hereafter) but that is only in regard of the visible government of the Church, not absolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and soveraignly: for the only soveraign head of the Militant Church works in it, and governs it invisibly, by his holy lights and inspirations, and particularly him who is its visible Head according to its visible govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is therefore amongst us one only absolute head of the Church; the other hath no absolute Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent

but your self) and then I'me sure, you neither are, nor can be of one Church with me, so long as you remain in the state you are in, yet it is the height of my desires, that we may both be joyned in one Catholick Church, which I shall most earnestly and unfainedly beg of God, still hoping that your zeal and ardency in what you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, may (as it did S. <hi>Paul</hi>) bring you to see, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his true Church.</p>

If it be not so, shew what you can say for your selves, which any of those Hereticks might not as well have alledged in their own defence; for neither did any of them separate from the Church as it was Christian, nor did either the Pelagians, Donatists, Acacians, Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferians, Novatians, dis-beleeve any essential point of Christian faith, if Protestants dis-beleeve no essential; what you say of not separating from us <hi>as we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> is a precision never used by Catholick, or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in ancient times; nor indeed did ever any Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, who esteemed himself a Christian, affirm he sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Church as it was Christian; for that had been to deny himself to be a Christian, which no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ever did; so that if this excuse save you from Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical separation, every Heretick in the world may be excused as well as you.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49965:84"/>

                  <p>Nor will it excuse you to alledge, you communicate with all Churches <hi>as Christian</hi>: for whilest you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess your selves Christians, you cannot affirm, that you left all Churches, as they are Christian; and by this means never yet any Heretick, no neither <hi>Arrian,</hi> nor <hi>Sabellian,</hi> could be convinced to have separated from all Churches; for never would any of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they left them as Christian, seeing they all not only protested, but really beleeved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Christians. Now if you will acquit your selves of separation from Christs Church, shew in your Rejoynder some visible Churches, pre-existent immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly before you, and co-existent with you in your first beginning, which did not pray for the dead, desire the assistance and Prayers of Saints for themselves, use and reverence Images in their Churches; which had not Altars, Priests, Masses, reall and proper Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; which held not Bread and Wine to be really changed, by vertue of consecration into Christs true Body and Blood, before they received them; which held not S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and him whom they esteemed his lawfull Successor, to be the Supream visible Governour, next under Christ, of the whole Militant Church, as is declared above: Or which held not some other points as points of Faith which you deny, or held not, or denied some points which you hold to be points of Christian faith, by reason wherof you had sufficient reason to leave their external Communion, if you had reason to forsake

                  <p>Num. 98. <hi>But O Sir, what manner of dealing have we from you! must we be imprisoned, rackt, harg'd, and burned, if we will not beleeve that Bread and Wine are not Bread and Wine, contrary to our own and all mens senses; and if we will not worship them with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship, and will not obey the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>in all such matters, contrary to our Consciences; and then must we be chidden for separating from you, if we can but a while escape the</hi> Strappado <hi>and the flames? What! will you blame us for not beleeving, that all mens senses are deceived, and the greater part of Christians and their Traditions (against you) are false, when we read, studie, and suspect our selves, and pray for light, and are willing to hear any of your reasons, but cannot force our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings ti beleeve all such things that you beleeve, and meerly because the Pope commands it: and when we cannot thus force our own understandings, must we be burned, or else called</hi> Separatists? <hi>Would you have the</hi> Communion of our Ashes, <hi>or else say,</hi> We forsake your Communion? <hi>In your Churches we cannot have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49965:85"/>
leave to come, without lying against God and our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and saying,</hi> We beleeve, <hi>what our senses contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; and without committing that, which our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces tell us are most hainous sins. We solemnly protest, that we would do as you do, and say as we say, were it not for the love of truth and holiness, and for fear of the wrath of God and the flames of Hell: but we cannot, we dare not rush upon those Errors, and sell our souls to please the Pope. And must we then either be</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, <hi>or</hi> taken for uncharitable? <hi>Will you say to so many poor souls, that are ready to enter into another World</hi>; Either sin against your Consciences, and so damn your souls, or else let us burn and murder you, or else you do not love us; you are uncharitable, if you deny us leave to kill you, and you separate from the Communion of the Church. <hi>We appeal from the Pope and all unreasonable men, to the great God of heaven and earth, to judge righteously between you and us concerning this dealing.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>As for possessing our selves of your Bishopricks and Cures, if any particular person had personal injury in the change, being cast out without cause, they must answer for it that did it, not I; though I never heard any thing to make me beleeve it. But must the Prince and the people let alone Delinquent Pastors, for fear of being blamed for taking their Bishopricks? Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the same Religion with us may be cast out for their crimes: Princes have power over Pastors as well as</hi> David, Solomon, <hi>and other Kings of</hi> Israel <hi>had.</hi> Guil. Barclay, <hi>and some few of your own knew this. The Popes treasonable exemption of the Clergie, from the Soveraigns judgement, will not warrant those Princes before God, that neglect to punish offending Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49965:85"/>
And I beseech you tell us, when our Consciences (after the use of all means that we can use to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) cannot renounce all our senses, nor our reason, nor the judgement of the most of the Church, or of Antiquity, or the Word of God, and yet we must do so, or be no members of your Church, what wrong is it to you; if we chuse us Pastors of our own, in the order that God hath appointed? Had not the people in all former ages the choice of their Pastors? We and our late Fore-fathers here were never under your over-sight: but we know not why we may not now choose our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, as well as formerly, we do it not by Tumults: We kill not men, and tread not in their blood, while we chuse our Pastors as Pope</hi> Damasus <hi>was chosen: The Tythes, and other Temporal maintenance we take from none; but the Magistrate disposeth of it as he seeth meet for the Churches good: And the maintenanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> is for the cure or work; and therefore that are justly cast out of the cure, are justly deprived of the maintenance. And surely when they are dead, none of you can with any shew of reason stand up and say,</hi> These Bishopricks are yours, <hi>or,</hi> These Parsonages are yours: <hi>It is the Incumbent personally that only can claim the Title; saving the super-eminent title of Christ, to whom they are devoted. But the successive Popes cannot have ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to all the Tythes and Temples in the World, nor any of his Clergy, that never were called to the charges. If this be</hi> dis-union, <hi>it is you that are the</hi> Separatists, <hi>and cause of all. If you will needs tell all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, that except they will be ruled by the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>and be burned if they beleeve not as he bids them, in spight of their senses, he will call them</hi> Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists, Schismaticks, <hi>and say they dis-unite, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable;

Change therefore the term <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> into that of <hi>the Catholick Church of Christ,</hi> that is, all Orthodox particular Churches existent at that time, which are comprised in the number of <hi>all visible ancient particular Churches</hi> then existing, and address your exclamations to it, and then you will see how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a Christian complaint there is in that whole digression. To this therefore I presse you once again, to produce some Visible Church in the year 1500. from whose visible Communion you were not separated in your first beginning <hi>Anno</hi> 1517. as much as were the <hi>Pelagians</hi> or <hi>Donatists</hi> from all Visible Churches in their times? And to render a sufficient reason, why your dis-obeying, or substracting your selves from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance and obedience of all the Visible Pastors in all Churches, <hi>Anno</hi> 1500. was not as much deserving to be termed and held a criminal Schism, and spiritual Rebellion, as any former separation from all Visible Churches.</p>

In this sense only are all the kindomes of the earth one kingdome, under the invisible Government of the Invisible God; but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be truly called one visible kingdome, but more. Now it is evident through the whole discourse, that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Controversie is of the visible Church, as it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; and in this sense it is, and must be one; and consequently must be under some visible Government, which must make it one. That cannot be Christ, for he governs not his Church now visibly; <hi>Ergo</hi> there must
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49965:87"/>
be some other: and that must either be some Assembly of chief Governours; as would be a General Council: or some one person, who has Authority to govern the whole body of the Church. A general Council it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be: for, that was never held to be the ordinary, but only the extraordinary Church-Government, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent occasions require it: and even when that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, there must be some one person, to avoid Schisme, and quiet Controversies, which may possibly arise in the Council, with Authority above all the rest. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore manifest, the Church cannot be perfectly one, visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, politick Body, unless there be one visible head to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it visibly, as the ordinary Governour of it. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, Sir, reflect often upon this distinction; and you will see the chief ground of your discourse answered by it. For to say, (as you do here) that the Church is one visible Kingdome, &amp; yet to make it no more one visibly, then the School of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> or <hi>Westminster,</hi> is one visible School, is in my Logick to speak-contraries.</p>

                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:49965:87"/>
Now <hi>your position</hi> is to hold, that some Hereticks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called, are <hi>parts</hi> of the Church of Christ, and united to him as their Head; by reason, that they believe with a true Christian Faith the Essentials of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whereby they are Christians, though they erre in some Accidentals, as appears by that distinction so often used by you. In this sense then, I say, you hold Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to be true and real parts of the Church. And this I affirm to be contrary to all Christianity, and a novelty, never held before by any Christian.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49965:89"/>
some of our Divines is only about part of their Heresie, and you would make your Reader believe, it were about the whole. Some points of their Heresie are clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by all Catholick Authors; as is that of the denyal of original Sin, That Infants which dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptisme, are not in the state of Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now these are enough to make them Hereticks, and out of the Church, whatsoever is of the rest of their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: which howsoever some dispute now, wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth, yet when they were first condemned, there was no dispute about it. But here's another grand No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie of yours to be considered. Who ever yet, before you, said, that Catholick Church could be divided <hi>in it self,</hi> when it is a most perfect unity. See, what the Fathers say of this point: why is it called <hi>una Ecclesia Catholica</hi> (one Catholick Church) in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, if it can be divided: and then you adde another No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, as the former. For who, but you, ever said, the <hi>Donatists</hi> were not divided absolutely from the Church? does not S. <hi>Aug. lib. de Baptismo, contra Donatistas,</hi> say, they separated and divided from the Church, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times over?

(Immediately before your first visible opposition against the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) own you (as you have not proved, nor can you ever prove, they doe) but upon the same, or for some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reasons Reject you, for which the Easterne and Westerne Churches have disclaimed you; you cannot but confess, you are rejected by the whole Catholick Church of Christ, seeing you were Rejected by all the visible Churches of that time. Now whosoever is rejected as an Heretick by the whole Catholick visible Church, either must be no part of it, or the Catholick Church, must not be able to know, which are, which are not, her true parts, and be fallen into so desperate an Errour, as to reject as out-casts and enemies those who are her true Children.

Now reduce your selves, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> sayes, to your first <hi>origine,</hi> in the year 1500, even in your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the visible Catholick Church, was all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christians through the whole world, but all these Congregations disowned you as Aliens, and Separatists from them, when you first begun, <hi>an.</hi> 1517. <hi>ergo</hi> the whole Catholick Church disowned you, as Aliens, and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists; <hi>Ergo</hi> you were then either such as the Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed you to be, or the whole Catholick Church was deceived; but all good Christians will rather believe,

that you, who were then but a handfull of new-hatched Novellists, were deceived in fancying your selves to be parts of the Church, against the censure and judgement of the whole Christian world: then that the whole Christian world should be deceived, and you only in the Right. Nay, that you may have no shadow to shroud your self under, not only the whole Christian world, when you begun, rejected you, as not belonging to their Body; but you your selves, never so much as pretended then to be parts of any of these Churches, but hated, and abominated them as much as they did you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them all of Errour, and Superstition, of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish</hi> captivity, and utter darknesse, of Antichrianisme, and Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Read your first Writers and you will find it so; for seeing all the visible Christian Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations held many of those Points, which your first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners held to be Idolatrous, and Superstitious in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in condemning the <hi>Roman,</hi> and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from it, upon those pretended Superstitions and Errours, you separated from, and condemned the whole Catholick Church; nor can you free your self from this, unless you nominate some Church, in those times spread all the Christian world over, which resisted those said Errours, as you did, and joined with you against the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in this opposition.</p>

And that you may see what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Patriarch assumes to himself, and how plaguely he stiles himself a <hi>vice</hi>-Christ (quite contrary to your groundlesse Assertion here) <hi>Hieremias</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> prefixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his censure of their Doctrine, saies thus,

                  <p>Num. 117. It is a pretty kind of art you have, of Triumphing before the Victory, and collecting a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion without Premisses: 'Tis true, the <hi>Greeks</hi> did not intend to exclude the Son from the procession of the holy Ghost; for they admitted him as a <hi>medium,</hi> through which he proceeds from the Father, as water issues from the fountain through the Conduit-pipe; but yet they wholly denied, he proceeded from the Son, as from a principle of his procession, and their reason was, because then (said they) there would be a double procession of the holy Ghost, as from two principles, the Father and the Son; and this they thought so evident, that it could not be denied, and thereupon supposed the <hi>Latines</hi> put a double procession, and a double principle; now when it was made manifest to them by the Authorities of the ancient Fathers (as the Council here affirmes) that he proceeded from the Father and the Son as from one principle: so that those Fathers who affirm that he <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Father by or through the Son,</hi> say the very same thing with the others, who say, <hi>he proceeds from the Father and the Son</hi>; they were content, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call their former Errour, and to hold with the <hi>Latines,</hi> that he proceeded from both as from one Principle, by one indivisible procession, or spiration; whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the union betwixt those two Churches. Now that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49965:99"/>
the <hi>Greeks</hi> before and after the Council, when they were returned home, thought it impossible they should proceed from both as from one Principle, is evident both from the long craggy disputes betwixt them in the Council, and from <hi>Mark</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately defended the common Opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and would never yield to the union in this point; and it appears also from the <hi>Grecians</hi> themselves, who after their Return relapsed into their former Errour; and from <hi>Hieremias</hi> his Censure, <hi>C.</hi> 1. who excludes the Son in expresse terms, <hi>Spiritum sanctum ex solo Patre procedere,</hi> that the holy Ghost proceeds from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone; and from all the other <hi>Greeks</hi> who reject at this day the Union made in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council, and maintaine their former errour against it. Now your Argument has this force with it: the <hi>Grecians</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted their Errour in the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> convinc't by the Authoritie of the holy Fathers, agreed with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that the holy Ghost proceeded from the Father and the Son, or from the Father through the Son, as from one Principle of Procession; <hi>Ergo Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Ephesius,</hi> who refused that Agreement, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Greeks</hi> ever since that Council who reject it, and the others before the Council, who contradicted it, held the very same Doctrine with the <hi>Latines,</hi> that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Father and the Son as from one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; whereas they most manifestly denied, that he could so proceed, and all of them deny it to this day: see you not your fallacie, how it proceeds <hi>à parte ad totum,</hi> and <hi>à particulari ad universale</hi>? that is, from that partie of the <hi>Grecians</hi> who consented to the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council, to the whole bodie of them ever since; and with that, I hope you will see, how illogically you extend the Union in this and other points, to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49965:99"/>
of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church at this present time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some few of them assented to it in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council, whose consent with the <hi>Latines</hi> is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and condemned by the present <hi>Greeks</hi>; and how undeservedly you accuse me of extinguishing <hi>both Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and Humanitie,</hi> for which I heartily beseech God to forgive you; and desire only, you will please to note, that seeing I speak of the <hi>Grecians</hi> as they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and of those who held as they now do, your testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of what they held many hundred yeares before our times hurt me not, nor so much as approach to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what I say; and please to consider this also, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> holding the holy Ghost's proceeding from the Father and the Son, argu'd a double principle, and a double spiration; as it was a real difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the <hi>Latines</hi> before the Union, so is it yet a real difference betwixt the <hi>Latines</hi> &amp; those <hi>Greeks</hi> who reject that Union, and that of so great concern, that the present <hi>Grecians</hi> chuse rather to denie he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Son, as from a Principle, then grant, that he can proceed from both, as from one principle, or by one spiration from them both.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49965:100"/>
other cause of dissention between the</hi> Latine <hi>and the</hi> Greek <hi>Churches, then that the Pope refuseth to defer the Cognisance and Iudgement of that which is</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, <hi>to a General Council, but he will sit the sole Master, and Iudge of the Controversie, and will have the rest as Disciples to be hearers of (or obey) his word, which is a thing aliene from the Lawes and Actions of the Apostles and Fathers; and he begins his Book (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few words) thus,</hi>
                     <q>Causa itaque hujus dissidii, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cause therefore of this difference, as I judge, is not the sublimity of the point exceeding man's capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for other matters that have divers times troubled the Church, have been of the same kind; this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not the cause of the dissention, much lesse is the speech of the Scripture it self; which as being concise, doth pronounce nothing openly of that which is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted; for to accuse the Scripture, is as much as to accuse God himself. But God is without all fault; but who the fault is in, any one may easily tell, that is well in his wits.</q>
                     <hi>He next shews, that it is not for want of learned men on both sides; nor is it because the</hi> Greeks <hi>do claim the Primacy, and then concludeth it as before, he maintaineth that your Pope succeedeth</hi> Peter <hi>onely as a Bishop ordained by him, as many other Bishops that originally were ordained by him in like manner to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, and that his Primacy is no governing power, nor given him by</hi> Peter, <hi>but by Princes and Councils for order sake; and this he proves at large, and makes this the main difference.</hi> Bellarmine<hi>'s answering his so many Arguments, might have told you this, if you had never read</hi> Nilus <hi>himself; and if you say that this point was the Cause, I deny it; but if it were true, yet was it not the onely or chief Cause afterwards; The manner of bringing in the</hi> (Filioque) <hi>by Papal Authority without a

This is a strange manner of Arguing; what if his chief subject be about the Popes Primacy, may he not <hi>ex incidente</hi> and <hi>occasionaliter,</hi> treat other matters? Is not your chief matter in this Treatise to prove the succession of your Church, and oppose ours; and yet treat you not in this very place incidentally the procession of the holy Ghost? I say then that <hi>Nilus</hi> declaring the cause why the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath lost all that Primacy, and Authority which he had ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by reason he is fallen from the Faith, in adding <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioque</hi> to the Creed, and teaching that the holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son; the words you cite out of <hi>Nilus,</hi> proves nothing, he pretends indeed that the cause of the present dissention is the Popes chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging so high a Primacy, which they are unwilling (as all schismaticks ever were) to grant him, but that may well stand with what I affirm him to say, that the first original cause of the breach betwixt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> was the adding of <hi>Filioque,</hi> and holding the holy Ghost's procession from the Father and the Son: But see you not how fair a thread you have spun, by pressing those words, as you do, against me? is there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no other cause of dissention betwixt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church; nor ground of their breach, save the Popes supremacy? then sure there is a full agreement in all other things; if so, there is a main disagreeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in all other points of Faith controverted betwixt you and us; for if they agree with us, they disagree from you in every one of them; nay
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49965:101"/>
you press <hi>Nilus</hi> his words (in that sense you must take them to frame an Argument against me) quite against the very words themselves; for you alledge them to shew, that he touches not the procession of the holy Ghost in that Book, as the first ground of their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; to prove this you must proceed thus, he treats no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there save the Pope's Supremacie, <hi>ergo</hi> he touches not the holy Ghost's procession; you prove the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent by the words of the Title of his first book here cited, because he affirmes in them, there is no other cause of dissention, then that the Pope refuses to stand to the judgement of a general Council; as if that onely were controverted betwixt them, for otherwise you prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Now it is most evident that <hi>Nilus</hi> supposes many other Controversies betwixt them and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>; for he saies (even as you cite him) thus, <hi>then that the Pope refuseth to defer the Cognisance and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that which is Controverted to a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; Ergo</hi> you must acknowledge, that according to <hi>Nilus,</hi> there was something controverted betwixt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Latines,</hi> besides the Pope's Supremacie; and after you bring him in <hi>pag.</hi> 124. mentioning this very point of the procession, when you alledge him thus, <hi>the cause therefore of this difference, as I judge, is not the sublimity of the point exceeding man's capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,</hi> where he speaks of the holy Ghost's procession, as I affirm him to doe; thus you play fast and loose, say and unsay at your pleasure; thus you confound times, and by not distinguishing the <hi>past,</hi> (as before you did not the future) from the present, make that, which is now onely pretended by <hi>Nilus,</hi> to be the chief cause of their not coming to Agreement, to have been many hundred yeares agoe, the original cause of their breach, and opposition against the <hi>Latines</hi>; whereby you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49965:101"/>
the first occasion of the breach, and the present obstacle to the making it up, and reconciling them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as if they were one, and the same thing; Now it is most manifest that the first occasion of the breach made by the <hi>Greeks</hi> from the <hi>Latine</hi> Church, was the Exception they took against the <hi>Latines,</hi> for adding the word <hi>Filioque, and from the Son,</hi> to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed; for <hi>Michael</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople, anno</hi> 1054. in time of <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. Pope, and <hi>Constantine</hi> the 10. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, styled <hi>Monomachos,</hi> aspiring not onely in name and Title, as many of his predecessours had done before him, but in reality and effect to be universal Patriarch, proclaimed <hi>Leo,</hi> and all the <hi>Latines</hi> who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to him to be Excommunicated, because contrary to the decree of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council, they had made an Addition to the Creed; so that the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop being pretended by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to be thereby deposed from his Sea, The Primacie of the Church fell by Course, and right upon him, as being the next Patriarch, after the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which gave occasion to <hi>Nilus</hi> of acknowledging that Controversie about the procession of the holy Ghost, to have been the first occasion of the breach.</p>

the highest in place, and honour, me thinks, even in your principles, he has a stronger claim to be supream in authority also, then any one singular person through the Church; now if we set up the Pope as a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming head over the whole Church (as you say we do) I should be much obliged, if you would please to nominate the first Pope whom we set <hi>up as such a head,</hi> who they were that set him up, and who withstood it as a noveltie; you cannot in your principles alleadge <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the third, for the having his title, as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend from <hi>Phocas,</hi> and <hi>Phocas</hi> having no power out of the Empire, could not give him any authority over the extra-imperial Pormies (no not so much as prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in place over all the extra-imperial Bishops, for what reasons had they to conform themselves to the Emperours orders, who had no authority over them) and consequently not over the whole Church, nor was the Emperour so foolish, to give more then he had power to give; now that Popes before <hi>Boniface's</hi> time had ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction over the whole Empire, you are forc't to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge divers times in your reply, not being able o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to resolve my arguments: <hi>Phocas</hi> therefore neither made nor could make <hi>Boniface</hi> head over the whole Church, nor was he the first who set him up over all the Churches within the Empire. oblidge me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in nominating to me the first head so set up in your rejoynder to this: I have no obligation to prove my succession, my argument presses you to the proof, who though you made a bold essay to produce one Congregation of Christians perpetually visible, either denying and opposing the Popes universal supremacy or at least of such a nature in Church government as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it inconsistent with it, and in this your present reply <hi>p.</hi> 92. you undertake the proof of such a visible

                  <p>Num. 127. Yes I think so in very good earnest, and when you shall have fixt your second thoughts upon what past in this affaire, I doubt not but your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity will induce you to think so too. 'tis not every appeal made from any tribunal or Judge to another, who hath power to summon the defendant and to pronounce sentence against him, in case of not appearance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his cause, a strict and juridical appeal to a higher Court or Tribunal? was not this appeal such? I know when you consider the letters and sentence given by <hi>Felix</hi> against <hi>Acacius</hi>; you neither will, nor can deny it; whence appeares, how far your instances of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, and nominal appeales are from the present mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Should a poor Peasant of <hi>Northumberland</hi> being wronged by some inferiour persons, having the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> his friend, appeal to him, and require of him, that he cite those Judges to appear before him, and in case they did refuse to appear, pronounce sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against them, and deprive them of their offices, lands, and possessions? would it not be highly ridiculous? seeing therefore such a proceeding as this, was held by virtue of this appeal of <hi>Iohn Thalaida,</hi> and no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of those times, ever condemned <hi>Felix</hi> for doing it, nor <hi>Iohn</hi> for requiring it, as is most evident, it was an appeal or complaint (as <hi>Baronius</hi> affirms) to an higher Judge. Now seeing an appeal made from one Judge to another, as all solemn and proper appeals are made, and understood in law, must be from a lower to a higher Judge, and the word appeal (as all other words) must be taken in a proper sense, where nothing constraines us, to take it improperly: it is most manifest that this

appeal must be understood to have been made to a higher Judge, then were those who deposed <hi>Thalaida.</hi>

their Arbiter, nay seeing the appeal was made to <hi>Felix</hi> whether they would or no, they refuseing to appear in defence of themselves, and make good their accusations against <hi>Thalaida</hi>; it is most manifest that <hi>Felix</hi> was not made Arbiter of the cause by joynt consent as all Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters must be, but had of himself the power of judging both parties. Now though it was admitted, not granted, that the recourse of <hi>Thalaida</hi> to <hi>Simplicius</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi> was rather a complaint of violence &amp; injury done him by force, then of an unjust juridical sentence pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against him, yet my intent will evidently follow from it: or it had been ridiculous in <hi>Thalaida,</hi> to have sought redress from that injury, and a condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory sentence against <hi>Acacius &amp;c.</hi> from one who had no power or jurisdiction over them, and it had been a most insufferable injustice, and presumption in <hi>Felix</hi> to have deposed and deprived <hi>Acacius,</hi> had he had no jurisdiction over him, and the rest of his complices. Hence your fallacy consists in this, that you proceed from <hi>secundum quid</hi> to <hi>simpliciter,</hi> that is, from appeales improperly so called, or vulgar appeales, to juridical or proper appeales, whereas you should have given some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, where an appeal, made from an unjust sentence, to another Judge, who hath power to cite, and condemn those from whom the appeal is made, is not alwayes made to an higher judge: for such was the appeal of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laida</hi> to <hi>Simplicius,</hi> as I have proved.</p>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49965:115"/>
what need was there of that? for I read not, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> was excommunicated by the false Councill of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but deposed from his Bishopprick; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been accused of Nestorianisme, and as such, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in this Councill, the Pope according to the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al custome declared him Orthodox, and received him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his communion; it was a restoration to his Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Sea which he appealed for, and a reversing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just sentence (in his absence, and having no warning given him to plead his cause, and defence) which he sought for to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and he was accordingly restored in the first Session of the Councill of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently by the Authority of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and took his seat in the Councill with the other Fathers: because the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had judged him innocent, and restored him: nor is there any mencion made of the Bishops of the West, but only of a restauration ordered by <hi>Leo's</hi> authority, nor could the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> have don any such soveraign act, as this was. (which you say but prove not.) shew me if you can, ever nay appeal like this of <hi>Theodorets</hi> made from the sentence of a generall Council, to any patriarch in the world? save the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> or any Bishop thus appealing restored to his sea after deposition by a general Council, save only by the Popes authority.</p>

                  <p>Num. 143. Here are many untruths put up together, 1.

The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill did not restore him otherwise, then by ratifying and approving Pope <hi>Leo's</hi> act of Restaurations which is not to have the final judgement of the cause, but to consent and approve by a publick act, what was justly, and Canonically adjudged before, which may be, and is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently don by equall, or inferiour judges: if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the judgement of <hi>Leo</hi> had been reverst in the Councill, without the recourse had to him about it, you might have had some Colour to affirm, the finall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was by the Councill.</p>

                  <p>Num. 244. <hi>But if in his distress he appealed as you say, to a just judgement, from an unjust: or sought to make</hi> Leo <hi>his friend no wonder! but this is no grant of an universal Sover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Num. 144. It was an act of jurisdiction out of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49965:116"/>
the Western Patriarchs, therefore it could not proceed from <hi>Leo</hi> as he was Patriarch of the <hi>West</hi>; so that he must have done it, as having authority, and judicatory power over other Patriarchals; and seeing there is no reason alleadgeable, why he should have power in the Patriarchals where <hi>Theodoret</hi> was Bishop, more then in any other: <hi>à paritate rationis,</hi> it proves that he had juridical power over all the Patriarchals, <hi>ergo</hi> an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal power over the whole Church, at least within the Empire. if you will solve this argument, you must shew a disparity, why <hi>Theodoret</hi> was more subject to the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> then any other Bishop within the Empire, or the rest of the Patriarchs.</p>

                  <p>Num. 145.

Who ever before you said, it was only for that strait? name any one clasick author of antiquity, if you can, who said so? Canons of general Councils though occasioned by sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al accidents, are to be supposed as perpetual to the whole Church, till they be either repealed by some authority equal to a general Council, or some manifest action given in the institution of them, that they are only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visionary for a time: prove if you can by the words of this Council? that it intends them only to be obligatory only for <hi>that strait</hi> and not to be perpetual. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were an excellent way to infringe the obligation of all or the most part of the Ecclesiastical canons by saying, they were in aid upon <hi>such a strait,</hi> (as all were made by some or other,) and therefore binde not, after
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49965:120"/>
that occasion is past. But what if in effect, either the same or the like occasion and strait, more or lesse, be still found in the Churches.

                  <p>I have denyed any power at all to be given to the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> by these canons; they only determine the use which was to be made of his presupposed power, by whom, and when. If an order be made in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, That such particular persons as have been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by others in inferiour courts, shall have recourse by appeal to one of the Lords cheif Justices. Does that Parlianent by virtue of that order create or institute the Lord cheif Justice? or rather, is it not evident it supposes him to have the power of cheif Justice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to that order, and only ordaines that others have recourse to him: But yet the power they mention of redresse and appeal to the Roman Bishops is to him only as Judge; for the canon sayes nothing of any Council joyned to him, nor names any other Judge, save the Pope. when a Judge sits in judgement at the assizes, though the bench be filled with other justices who inform and assist, yet the sentence proceeds only from the Judge. Thus though the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in matters of great concernment to the whole Church, to call some neighbouring Bishops to sit in Council with him for his better information, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Can there be more evident markes of an absolute judge, than these are? If the Pope had power only to examine the causes: who had the power to judge them according to these Canons? or to what purpose where those examinations made, if none were impowred to passe judgement, after the causes were examined? Now seeing the canons attribute the power of judging to no other, save the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi>: for they make no mention at all of any Council; then the Council sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the power of judgeing to be in him alone, and not joyntly in the provincial Council and him.</p>

                  <p>Num. 161. This is a strange way of answering.

Now that this was done not by way of recommendation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and testification of his profession of the Catholick <hi>Nicene</hi> faith, in consideration whereof he desired he might be restored to the Bishoppricks, is manifest; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he actually restored him, by an absolute command. For you to alleadge other passages of a different nature, and nothing contrary to what I say, and unfit to shew the thing I cite, to be untrue, is a meer <gap reason="foreign">

But I see it is hard to hide rancor, where it is excessive: For being universal authority drawn from these, and the like instances, is of force by an argument <hi>a paritate Rationis.</hi> What reason can be alleadged, why Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> should command the restauration of <hi>Eustathius</hi> a Bishop of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Patriarck, save this? that he had power to restore any one wrongfully ejected through the whole Church. You assert, that all the preheminence he had given him over all the Bishops within the Empire, was no more then a Primacy of place and precedency, how then came he to have a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of authority and jurisdiction over all the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bishops, to judge, condemn, and restore them? shew me who gave him that imperial power? this you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver resolved in your whole book; and I know the reason, you could not resolve it into any other grant, then into that of Christs institution; from the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> it could not be, both because that Council (according to your principles) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther restraines his power to the <hi>Western</hi> Churches then extends it into the wole Empire, and the Popes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised power through the wole Empire long before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> so that neither that nor any other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Council could give it him, nor could the Christian Emperours give him that power, for he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised it long before the Emperours were Christians, both in the <hi>East,</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> nor did the the primitive Bishops through the whole Empire give it him, for there is no proof in antiquity of any such grant: <hi>ergo,</hi> there is no appearance, that any such authority was given to the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> from any, save Christ himself. Now
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49965:125"/>
Christ never restrained the power he gave him to the Empire, but rather intended it to the whole Church. and if he did restrain it, shew where and how?</p>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49965:131"/>
them, if he had no true and real jurisdiction over them; for had there been no more in the case, then what of their non-appearance, he should have surceased from any further proceeding, and neither helpt nor hurt them. Should you send accusations to the Chancellour of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> against some of your brethren here in <hi>England,</hi> that by reason of his eminent authority in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he might do you some favour; and he upon the receipt of those accusations should summon those Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of yours to appear before him, and for not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance condemn them, and acquit and restore you, would not all the World see that he exceeded his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission? No Patriarch by vertue of his Patriarchal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, though preceeding the other in place, had power to condemn any belonging to another Patriarchate (if the fact were not committed within his jurisdiction) without the consent of that Patriarch, under whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he was, according to the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>

                  <p>Num. 182. All those consequences are proved at large in other parts of this treatise. The first because this proceeding of <hi>Iulius</hi> having been approved in all ages by the whole Church, there can be no other reason given of his power over the Bishops of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>East,</hi> save this, that he was head in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over all the Churches through the whole Empire.

The second that it was by divine right, for it was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by virtue of an ancient rule or canon received in the Church as <hi>Iulius</hi> affirms, which could not be, that of <hi>Nice,</hi> for that was instituted a very few years before.

Now whether I affirm <hi>Chamier</hi> to have said the matter of fact, to have been so, that is, to have been <hi>rightly done,</hi> your own printing of my words will put the matter out of question: therefore <hi>pag.</hi> 52. in the margin you cite my words thus: <hi>concerning St.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius <hi>being judged and righted</hi> by Pope <hi>Iulius, Chamier cit:</hi> acknowledges the matter of fact to be so. Now one may be judged and righted, that is set again into his right, by one who hath no power to judge him, and consequently judges not <hi>rightly,</hi> that is, duly, juridically and Canonically: now by changing <hi>righted</hi> into <hi>rightly</hi> you change the whole tenure and meaning of my words, and then grate on me upon the Conscience, with what not I, but you or your printer
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49965:134"/>
was guilty of, and truly I should have been most willing to have cast it upon him, had your written copy shewed the contrary, so here you have not <hi>righted</hi> but <hi>rightly,</hi> neither do I finde these words, <hi>to be so,</hi> in my marginal copy, but only thus, <hi>Chamier confesses the matter of fact,</hi> without <hi>to be so,</hi> though I will not contend with you in this; as not having seen the copy which was sent you. True it is, <hi>Chamier</hi> would have this judgement to have passed as from a freind, but to prove this he contends that it could not be from a competent and canonical Judge, because it was under the notion of a judgement unjust, seeing both parties were not present to be heard in judgement, so that he holds this to have been an unjust judgement, if taken in a rigorous sense, which is all that I said. But in the mean time you answer not my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby I prove it just, nor could you answer them without impeaching St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> of concurring with <hi>Iulius</hi> to an unjust judgement, for though <hi>Iulius</hi> had past this judgement as a freind, yet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to execution, before the adverse party was heard, or things made so evident that there was no place for defence, would have been an unjust proceeding: and if matters were so undeniably clear, it was not unjust for want of that formality, so that if it were unjust in a freind, according to equity or justice, can justify a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son accused without hearing what his accusers are able to make good against him: much lesse can those accusors be condemned as manifest detractors and lyars, when they are not permitted to speak for themselves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their evidences in quality of a judgement, for want of the defendants being heard, it would have been unjust in quality of freind-ship for the same reason, for now to say that St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> concurred with <hi>Iulius</hi> either as an unjust Judge, or as an unjust freind, would
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49965:135"/>
to wrong that blessed Saint and your self too, but I would gladly be satisfyed in this, how one who had no judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory authority above another Court, could reverse the Sentence of that Court, and restore the person injured by it, to his right, as <hi>Iulius</hi> here did, by the Sentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Council against St. <hi>Athanasius</hi>; or what man in his right wits, would address himself to a friend for relief, in that which he knows is above his power? should a Citizen of <hi>York,</hi> injured in the Mayors Court, frame an appeal to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> because he is his friend, and the prime Mayor in <hi>England,</hi> being the chief Officer of the Imperial City, to reverse the sentence given at <hi>York</hi> against him? would he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a laughing-stock both to <hi>York</hi> and <hi>London</hi>?</p>

                  <p>Num. 184. Here you say nothing at all to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miers</hi> granting it to be an appeal as to a Judge, that was so plain belike, that you could not answer it; nor yet would you expresly grant it neither, that had been too flat against you; So you thought it best to huddle it up in silence, and say nothing of it, and thought (it may be) your adversaries would have past it over too, but I hope all wise men will see your failing in this.

But by your good leave, if this were not a forcible Instance, supposing it were <hi>as to a Iudge</hi> (which <hi>Chamier</hi> grants, and you deny not) to prove <hi>à paritate rationis,</hi> that every Bishop, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Empire and Church, might have as well appealed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop as to a Iudge, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> did; had he been injured as he was? If I say this was not of force, shew in your next some particular reason, why the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had power to judge the case of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> rather then of any other Bishop in the Church? which till you do,<note place="margin">

                     </note> your <hi>effugium</hi> that this appeal was not made as to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Governour or Judge, speaks nothing, for if he (as in our sense) be an universal Judge or Governour, to whom every Bishop of the Church may appeal, as to his Judge, then seeing <hi>Theodoret's</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to him as such, proves every Bishop had as much right in the like circumstances, which <hi>Theodoret</hi> then had; it proves also, that he appealed to him as to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Governour or Judge, that is, to such a one to whom every Bishop might appeal in the like case.</p>

Every appeal from a juridical sentence to have it reversed, and the injured person restored to his former right, and the unjust Judges punished by the authority of him to whom the appeal is made, is to a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Court or Judge: But St. <hi>Chrysostome's</hi> appeal was such: <hi>Ergo</hi> it was to a superiour Court or Judge. the Minor is evident from the matter of fact, for St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> writes thus to <hi>Pope Innocent: Scribite, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor, &amp; authoritate vestra discerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>

make those to lye under the Churches censure, who have committed such injustices, but command that we who are innocent, unconvicted, and unguilty, be restored to our Churches, that we may re-enjoy our wanted charity and peace with our Brethren. Is not this a full proof of the Minor? The Major is also evident, for none have power when appealed to perform those acts of authority over those of any Court, unless they be a higher Court and Judge then the other from whom the appeal is made, as all Jurists know and confess.</p>

                  <p>Num. 186. <hi>In his first Epistle to</hi> Innocent, <hi>he tells him over and over, that (he appealed to a Synode, and required Iudgement) and that he was cast into a Ship for banishment (because he appealed to a Synode, and a righteous Iudgement) never mentioning a word of any such appeal to the Pope.</hi>

I cannot perswade my self you doe; now had it been unlawful, St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> would never have intreated <hi>Innocent</hi> to do it. If you mean, any Bishop can do it invalidly and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, you say nothing to the purpose, it was not indeed in his power how far it was regarded, nor is it the power of a King how far his commands are regarded by power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rebels: but what of that? he had power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and censure, to annul and restore, and so it was in his power to oblige others, and procured that it ought to have been regarded &amp; that they sinned griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in disobeying his command, which is enough for my purpose.

it in those times.

Your argument is not only nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but fallacious. For though those three historians mention it not: yet <hi>Leo Augustus, Metraphrastes, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drenus, Zonaras, Gennadius, Nicephorus, Glicas, Georgius Alexandrinus,</hi> whereof some are ancient Historians, record it; and the very Epistles which were written betwixt <hi>Innocentius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius</hi> (yet extant in an ancient <hi>codex</hi> in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth) give full testimony to the truth of it. Now had you produced a full negative argument against this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, you should have proved, that neither any of the three authors you mention, nor any other creditable ancient author or records testify the truth of it. Nor concludes your parity from the recording of St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his excommunication of <hi>Theodorus.</hi> For, first, I finde not that <hi>Socrates</hi> hath mentioned it in his history: so that you suppose a falshood in affirming it to be recorded by those three Authors. Secondly, that hapned by a publick notorious act in a great Church of <hi>Milan</hi>: this was only contained in a letter, and so soon recalled by pennance, that it is not certain, whether it came to publick execution or not. 3 That was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition

from entring into the Church, this was only from receiving the Sacrament, the first being much more to be taken notice of then the second, because many came to Church, who received not every time they came.</p>

the Empress he mentions were <hi>Eudoxia.</hi> Now if it were not <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> he should have told us what other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press there was living at that time in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to whom those presents were given.

                  <p>Num. 205. But sure, if it can be proved, a man of your learning can prove it, and then why have you not done it? is it not a shrewd sign there was no such po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, when there can be given no instance in so many hundred years, that it was ever brought into practice? you know, <hi>frustra datur potentia quae nunquam redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur in actum</hi>: and if such a power, whereof you say many instances <hi>may be</hi> given, had ever been, sure it was either frustraneous, and thereby not from God: or fome steps of the exercice of it would have appeared in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. We speak not here of what is or is not in it self unknown to us, but of what can be proved to have been: and that must appear by the acts and exercise of such a power, recorded in some ancient Authors or Records.</p>

                  <p>Num. 206. 3. <hi>I deny your unproved assertion, that the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>singly restored all the Church over; it is a meer fiction. How many restored he out of the Empire? Or in the Empire, out of his Patriarchate? but swasorily or Synodically.</hi>

                  <p>Num. 206. Very many. Such were all those Bishops who about the year 400. in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>France, anno</hi> 475.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:49965:146"/>
in <hi>England, anno</hi> 595. in <hi>Germany, anno</hi> 499. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Western and Northern Kingdoms, which were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either from under the command of the <hi>Romane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, or were never under it, who were restored by the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s authority, when wrongfully depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from their Sees, addressing themselves to him, and requiring justice from him, whereof all Ecclesiastical Histories of those Nations are full of instances. And in more antient times, whilst the Emperours were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, the cause of the Pope's authority, out of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Patriarchate could not be the subjection those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had to the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> but must have been derived from a spiritual authority instituted by Christ himself. For neither had there been any General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in those times to invest <hi>Rome</hi> in that authority, nor can it be ever proved from antiquity, that it was given him by the unanimous consent of all Bishops, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then as supposing it still due to him before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective times, by the power granted by our Saviour to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his lawfully Successors, as I have already af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to have received all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy you esteem him to have from a Council, as shall be proved hereafter: And I press you to produce any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in those times, which witnesseth it was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally given him by consent. Now that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> exercised jurisdiction over the Eastern Bishops in St. <hi>Victor's</hi> time, and over <hi>Firmilian</hi> and those of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia</hi> in Pope <hi>Stephens</hi> time, is so evident that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed. See St. <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> Nor will it avail to say, those instances of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c. were in latter times,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>And St.</hi> Cyp. <hi>in his Epistles to Pope</hi> Stephen.</note> where we dispute about the four first ages; for if in all those ages it had been a common known tradition, that the Pope had no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49965:147"/>
of the Verge of the Roman Empire, that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would have been publiquely and universally received in the years 500. and 600. even to the first ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of those new Kingdoms in the West and North,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>And Vincentius Lirinensis. infra citandus.</hi>
                     </note> so that every one would have known, they were no longer bound to be under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bishop then whilst they were under the Roman Empire, because all knew (in your novel supposition) that the jurisdiction of the Pope extended no farther then the Roman Empire. Why then did those Kings, and all the Bishops and Churches in their Kingdoms, esteem themselves as much obliged to the obedience of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> after they were freed from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Roman Emperour, as they were before; and never alleadged any such reason, as you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, of the Popes authority limited to the precincts of the Roman Empire, to plead thereupon his not having any longer jurisdiction over them, as being now no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Empire? What I say therefore, is no fiction, but a solide and manifest truth; that he had authority of restoring Bishops wrongfully deposed, all the Church over, even out of the Empire: but yours is a pure fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to assert that as a publick tenet and practice, which was manifestly unknown to those, either of the four first, or any subsequent ages, coined lately from your own brain, upon which, I pray God heartily, it lie not heavy one day, as novelties in Religion use to do upon the heads of their first Inventors. What you say <hi>of swasorily,</hi> and <hi>Synodically,</hi> I have above clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, by shewing that the Councils of neighbouring Bishops in <hi>Italy,</hi> were only assistants to the Pope, but could have no juridical power over the whole Church, or in parts remote, and without the Western Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:49965:147"/>
Now to what you usually presse of <hi>Ethiopia, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> outer <hi>Armenia,</hi> &amp;c. that no instance can be given, of any Bishop of those Churches restored by the Popes authority. I answer, that I can prove as effectually by instances their restoration by the Pope, as you can prove them to have been restored by their own Primates, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, Provincial Councils, or Collections of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, within their own Charters; nay, as you can shew, that any of them were restored. The reason therefore, that no such instance is given in the primitive times, is not as you imagine, and would impose upon your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that none of them were subject to the Pope, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no Records, or mention in Ecclesiastical History, that any were restored, either by this or any other authority; and if there be, produce them. The reason whereof is, because the Roman Emperours then Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens permitted no publique correspondence of those who were out of the Empire, being their enemies, with those who were within it; and after the Christian Emperours being in war with those barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, refused to admit (unlesse upon very urgent occasions) such correspondences; nor have we extant any authentick Authors of those Provinces, who have recorded the Histories, and transactions of the said Churches, so that 'tis unknown to us what either passed betwixt them and the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or amongst themselves,</p>

                  <p>Num. 207. <hi>Your next instance of</hi> Theodosius <hi>his not permitting the Council at</hi> Ephesus <hi>to be assembled, and his reconciling himself to the Church, is meerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. We know, that he and other Princes usually

                  <p>Num. 207. You still seek diversions to avoid the difficulty. The question is not now whether <hi>Theodosius</hi> and other Emperours, did, or might write to other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarcks about the celebration of Councils, as well as the <hi>Roman</hi>: but it is this, whether they wrote <hi>in the same manner to them</hi> as they did to him; that is, as Pope <hi>Leo</hi> witnesses, <hi>epist.</hi> 15. <hi>that he</hi> (Theodosius) <hi>bare this respect to the divine institution, that he would use the authority of the Apostolick Sea for the effecting of his holy disposition.</hi> And this was celebrating that Council, the 2d of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which as then appeared to the Pope to be good and holy. Finde me such a sentence of his, writ by <hi>Theodosius</hi> or other Emperours, to any of the Patriarcks beside the <hi>Roman,</hi> that their authority was necessary, according <hi>to divine institution</hi> for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating of a general Council? and you will have done something: without which you trifle.</p>

Take the context of my proofs along with you (which you conceal here) and you confess, this demanding the Popes authority as necessary to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of a general Council, and in that, giving respect <hi>to divine restitution,</hi> is a sign of his universal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seeing general Councils (as I have proved) are representatives, not of the Empire, but of the whole vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church. And <hi>Theodosius</hi> his pennance, whereof one effect was that he required the confirmation of <hi>Anatoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in the Sea of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and thereby attested his power over that Patriarck, and, <hi>a simili,</hi> over all the rest; he shewed himself to believe, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop was supream governour of the universal Church.</p>

Is, think you, authority overthrown, or rendred, or argued null, because it is opposed and contemned by Rebels? you shew in this, what your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is, and how inconsistent with true Government, when you make the contempt of Rebels, an argument that all whom they reject have no lawful power over them: a thing seasonable enough when you wrote this, having then rebellious times, and persons well suiting with it, but yet demonstrative what you thought then, and may still be esteemed one of your principles. But I wonder much you were so venturous as to let it passe the print, and see light since the happy return of our most gracious Soveraign. For think you men are so blind as not to see this consequence, that if Hereticks, outing and contemning the authority of a Catholique Bishop (as <hi>Dioscorus</hi> an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> and his party did that of <hi>Leo</hi>) be a good argument (as you make it) to prove he had no authority over the Church, nor over <hi>Dioscorus</hi> who excommunicated him: you must also hold, that a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Rebel's deposing a Soveraign, is a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to justifie the fact, and to prove that Soveraign had no authority over him. Or if you your self dare not

                  <p>Num. 112. You flie again the difficulty. I make not this argument: the Emperour was subject to the Pope in spirituals, <hi>Ergo</hi> all those Christians who were <hi>Extra</hi>-Imperial, were also subject to him. This is no argument of mine, but your imposition. My argument is this: The Emperour and all Christians, within this Empire, were subject to the Pope, as to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successor and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49965:150"/>
Pastor of the whole flock and Vineyard of Christ, by Christs institution: <hi>Ergo</hi> all <hi>Extra</hi>-Imperial Churches were also subject to him. Now this to have been the reason of their subjection, is evident, both from St. <hi>Leo's</hi> Epistle lately cited concerning <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and from the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> treated by me hereafter; and from the command of <hi>Martian,</hi> and all the other declaratives of the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> supereminent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, delivered and received in antiquity: where not so much as any one of them hath chained it up within the circuit of the Roman Empire, or given that for a measure or reason of his power; and it still remained in full force in such Kingdoms as were taken by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians from the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, who (as I have said) never affirmed their freedom from the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to have franchised them from the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> authority. Whence is clearly answered your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Kings of <hi>Englands</hi> subjection to the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> for the Kings of <hi>England</hi> never subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted themselves to the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> as to the Supream visible Governour in spirituals of the whole Catholique Church, no not as to one who had any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction out of <hi>England</hi> at all.</p>

                  <p>Num. 215. Your words from the Epistle of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> and <hi>Martian,</hi> infringe not those mentioned by me: for it may well be, that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> remitted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of the place to the Emperour, as judging it more belonging to them then to himself, as a thing wholly temporal, though the precise words, <hi>qui nobis placuerit,</hi> may be, in rigor, applied both to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Pope. My first authority therefore from that Council, is not answered at all in this your paper.</p>

                  <p>Num. 216. <hi>But what if you had spoke truth, doth it follow that Pope</hi> Leo <hi>was Christs Vicar-general Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the world, because that the Soveraign of one Common-wealth did give him leave to chuse the place of a Council?

                  <p>Num. 216. I argue not so: you proceed fallacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a <hi>secundum quid ad simpliciter.</hi> The force of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument consists not in the chusing of the place by the Pope, that's a pure circumstance: but the strength of my reason consists in this, that the Council was gathered by <hi>the Popes authority.</hi> And to this you say nothing; which notwithstanding is an evident proof that the Pope had authority over the whole Church, as I shall prove here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Serious things should be seriously answered, and not be thus jested at by fraudulent fallacies and disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

Now in my words here cited, <hi>viz.

                  <p>Num. 218. I find no Epistle of <hi>Pulcherius</hi> to <hi>Leo,</hi> nor so much as any such man in those times. You would say, I suppose, <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> the Empress: But you should have dealt more fairly, if you had declared in what manner <hi>Pulcheria</hi> mentions the Confession of Faith sent by <hi>Leo.</hi> Really Sir, the cunning which you use here, is unsufferable. First, you say, <hi>that Confession of Faith from</hi> Leo, <hi>was sent to</hi> Anatolius. Which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festlie untrue; for the Empress <hi>Pulcheria</hi> saith, it was sent to <hi>Flavianus,</hi> his Predecessor: This may pass as an error, in Historie onlie. Secondlie, you say, <hi>that</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natolius <hi>consented to that Faith,</hi> which is true, but you express not in what manner he consented to it: for equals may consent in Faith one with another, but the Empresse saith, that <hi>Anatolius</hi> subscribed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith sent to <hi>Flavianus</hi> from Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49965:153"/>
that without the least difficulty or demurr, which argue that <hi>Leo's</hi> confession was sent to this end, that the Pope required the Bishops of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to subscribe to what he wrote there, to shew that they believed the Catholick Faith. [<hi>Et Epistolae similiter Catholicae fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei quam ad sanctae memoriae Flavianum Episcopum tua Beatitudo decrevit, sine ulla dilatione subscripsit Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolius</hi>] The Empresse writes thus. [<hi>And he Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, without any delay, subscribed to the Epistle of Faith, which thy blessedness directed to</hi> Flavianus] Thirdly, whereas this Epistle or Confession of Faith, was sent as from a superiour, to be subscribed by those Patriarcks, that he might know whether they held the right Faith or no, and thereby judge whether he were to admit them into his communion (as was then the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary custome,) you would make it to be a confession sent as from an equal, to give them to whom he sent it, an account of his Eaith. Fourthly whereas I speak of a confession, ordered by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be sent from the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to him, that the Pope might thereby judge of his Faith: you in answer, return a confession of Faith, as freely sent from the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as though the Pope had given an account of his Faith to that Bishop, now all know it to be a rule of Faith, sent <hi>Vide verba Pulcheriae,</hi> by <hi>Leo,</hi> to which was required the <hi>in ep. ad Leonem.</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, to shew that he held the same Faith with the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereby deserved to be received, as a Catholick into his communion. And lastly, you make that to be a confession of Pope <hi>Leo's</hi> faith made to <hi>Anatolius,</hi> when it was only a summe of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith.

that you have imposed a most fals injurious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie upon me.

But had you a little attended to those words of the Popes Legates, you might have discovered they were spoke by them to prove not
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49965:157"/>
the bare precedency in place, but soveraignty in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for they alleadge them, to corroborate the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as sufficient to prohibite the sitting of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> in the Council by vertue of Pope <hi>Leo's</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And you were prest as hard to finde an answer, for <hi>omnium Ecclesiarum,</hi> all Churches, that is to say, <hi>non omnium,</hi> not all, but only those within the Empire: thus you can make all, some, and the whole, a sole part, when you have nothing else to say: see you not how you give advantage to the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and <hi>Menandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> &amp;c. who when, one should have prest them <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.2. That our Saviour is creatour of all things, they should have replyed as you do, thar is not of all, but only of some things, not of bodies, but of spirit only. Are you a person fit to dispute in matters concerning conscience and salvation, when rather then not reply to what cannot in reason be answered, you will quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the words opposed to you, by your glosse upon them, are not these desperate Intregues? But tis very strange that the ancient Councils, and Fathers when they call the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>Caput omnium Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, head of all Churches,</hi> as they doe very familiarly, should allwayes according to you, mean no more then the Churches within the Empire, and yet should never signifie they mean no more then those: &amp; if they ever doe signifie it, name the place and words in any one of them, and you shall be answered. As to the word, <hi>Caput,</hi> head, applied here to an original body. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares the Church to be, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it must not only have the propriety of being the highest part in the body, but also of having a power and capacity of governing and directing all the other parts, (as the head hath in natural bodies) whereby it is evident that the legates in stiling the <hi>Roman</hi> Church the head of <hi>all Churches,</hi>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:49965:157"/>
must be properly understood to mean, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath not only the cheif place, but the cheif vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible government, and direction also over all other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches. Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. Composing the Church of different organical parts, affirms that one amongst them is the <hi>head,</hi> and by <hi>head</hi> he cannot mean our Saviour, for he speaks of such a head, as cannot say to the feet, they are not necessary for it, which cannot be true of Christ; he must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mean a visible created head, which hath need of the inferiour members, as they have of it.</p>

Moreover when you affirm this council decreed without and against the Pope, you fall into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fallacy, for seeing (as I have now prov'd) those Fathers proceeded to that decree, through confidence they should obtain <hi>Leo's</hi> consent, they cannot properly be said to have done it without, much lesse against his consent: for they conceived themselves to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent presumed, which is sufficient when no more can be had to regulate humane actions; and though <hi>Leo</hi> thought fit to deny his consent, yet that was after the canon was fram'd, for whilst they formed it, they had hope he would consent.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49965:163"/>
as did here this Council St. <hi>Leo,</hi> in this their Epistle to him. General Councils understood the extent of their authority too well to beg of any Patriarch, save him of <hi>Rome,</hi> to yeeld consent to their decrees, for they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all obliged to assent to them, when they were approved by the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop, as appears both in this Council by the Emperours writing to all Churches, to know whether they consented to it, and their punishing <hi>Dioscorus</hi> the first,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But you use a petty sleight or two here; first, you say they write to <hi>Leo,</hi> for his consent in the former Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, not specifying the manner of their writing, and thereby leaving your Reader an occasion to think, they might write by way of command or exaction, (for there are very different manners of writing one to another) whereas I have declared their writing to <hi>Leo,</hi> to have been by humble requests and intreaties: and then in this Paragraph, you say Councils ordinarily writ to Bishops in the same manner as this Council did to <hi>Leo,</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing what Councils you mean. For if you speak of such Councils as were accounted in their respective times, only National or Provincial; 'tis true, they might entreat other Patriarchs and Bishops to give their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of them, but that's a stranger to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent matter: if of general Councils which is only in question, you should not have supposed but proved it.

But see you not a wide disparity? those whom you instance, were condemned by such as were contemporary with them, for having proceeded unjustly in those excommunications, &amp;c.

power issued primarily from his being successor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom Christ gave the keyes of his Church ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, as well without as within the Empire, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it was in no mans power to restrain it to the sole Empire, <hi>ergo</hi> he had as much power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, depose, or deprive any Bishop without the Empire (when occasions were given to exercise that power) as he had through the whole Empire.

                  <p>Num. 237. I see you were sore prest with this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when it puts you upon so desperate glosses. Are you really in earnest? did you ever read that the word (<hi>subjectus</hi>) subject, related to that which is above, can properly signifie no more then of an <hi>inferiour order</hi>? the Lord Mayor of <hi>York</hi> is of an inferiour order, or ranke to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> is he therefore <hi>subject</hi> to him? I see you would again preach pleasing things to your good wife of <hi>Kiddermunster,</hi> for when they read in St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1 Pet. 3.5. that wives should be <hi>subject</hi> to their husbands, they will have learnt from
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:49965:166"/>
this book of yours, that <hi>subject</hi> signifies only one of an inferiour ranke, not that their husbands should have any government over them. But for all this it signifies here, say you, no more then one of an inferiour order who has no government over the other: and why so? why: <hi>you your self doubt not but this was all his sense.</hi> nay, if <hi>you</hi> doubt not of it, I have done; that must needs be enough to make it certain, are you serious when you trifle thus? yet at all adventures, if haply you misse in this congruous construction, you have another turne to save your self, for if St <hi>Gregory</hi> truly meant, subject, (as all the world meanes it) <hi>for being under the power and government of an other,</hi> then you say that <hi>Gregory</hi> sayes, and unsayes? it seems you have some particuler picqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49965:166"/>

Is it think you

probable, that <hi>Nestorius</hi> would have written to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine,</hi> and required his authority for the approbation of his doctine, had he esteemed him to have no more power over him, then the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> hath over the Mayor of <hi>York</hi>? nor was the question propounded by St. <hi>Cyril</hi> about a positive excommunication of <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> (as you misconceiv'd) but onlie a non-communion with him as you presently acknowledge.</p>

this, whether private men upon their particular judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when a novelty ariseth, not yet expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church, are to avoid the maintainers of it as Heretiques, before they be declared to be so by publique authority of those who have power to judge them and their doctrine?</p>

given him to repent.

                     <hi>And</hi> Leo <hi>was the first that attempted the excessive advancement of his seat above the rest of the Patriarchs.</hi> 2. <hi>It is known that the Emperours sometime gave the Primacy to</hi> Rome, <hi>and sometime to</hi> Constantinople, <hi>as they were pleased or displeased by each of them.

It was then belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that</hi> Antioch <hi>and other Churches had a succession from</hi> Peter. <hi>It is the merit of</hi> Peter, <hi>and the dignity of the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the authority of the Synode joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he ascribeth it to.

                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi> 
                     <hi>was but</hi> Leo's <hi>fraud to perswade the raw Emperour of the authority of a Synode, which he would not name, because the Synode of</hi> Sardica <hi rend="sup">7</hi> 
                     <hi>was in little or no authority in those dayes. The rest of the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:49965:173"/>

                     <hi>Emperour, yet they took not in the East. And</hi> Leo <hi>himself it seems durst not pretend to a divine right and</hi>

                     <hi>institution, nor to a succession of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy from the Apostles.</hi> 6. <hi>But nothing is more false then your assertion, that he extendeth the power over the whole visible Church; The word</hi> universitas, <hi>is all that you translate in your Comment, the whole visible Church. As if you knew not that there was a Roman universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that Roman Councils were called universal, when no Bishops out of that one Common-wealth were present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the Church in the Empire</hi> 
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>0 <hi>is oft called the whole Church, yea, the Roman world was not an unusual. And I pray you tell me, what power</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian <hi>had out of the Empire? who yet interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his authority there,</hi> Neque praeter autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem sedis istius illicitum, &amp;c. &amp; ut pax ubique serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>And in the end, it is all the Provinces, that is, the university that he extends his precepts to.</hi> 7. <hi>And for that annexed, that without the Emperours letters, his authority was to be of force through</hi> France, <hi>(for what shall not be lawful, &amp;c.) I answ. No wonder, for</hi> France <hi>was part of his Patriarchate, and the Laws of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had confirmed his Patriarchal power, and those Laws might seem with the reverence of Synodes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out new letters to do much: But yet it</hi>

                  <p>Num. 258. In this paragraph you have no lesse then a bakers dozen of non proofs, I have noted them by figures in your text, let them be prov'd, and then they shall be answered, till then they deserve no answer. To what has any seeming ground or proof, I answer. First it imports little whether <hi>Theodosius</hi> had any hand in this Epistle or no, I say nothing of him in my text, <hi>p.</hi> 59.60.61. Secondly Your proof from <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> is already answered in my observation made upon <hi>p.</hi> 174. of your key, only I see you have mended your ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and put <hi>lib.</hi> in place of <hi>lege</hi> 3. Must it needs follow that it is my fiction? because it is not the words of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> that <hi>the succession from St.</hi> Peter <hi>is the foundation of</hi> Romes <hi>primacy.</hi> May not a <hi>medium</hi> be given betwixt those two extremes, what if it were the true sense of <hi>Valentinians</hi> words? it was then neither his words, nor my fiction, but a true interpretation of his words; and that it is so, is manifest, for there must be some reason sure, why the merit of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> conferr'd a primacy rather upon the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> then upon any other Bishop, but none can be imagined, save this, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> succeeded St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the sea of <hi>Rome, ergo</hi> it must be that succession, or nothing. You seem to say, that <hi>because St.</hi> Peter <hi>last preached, and was martired, and buried, and his relicks lay there he should be most honoured,</hi> and by, honoured, you must mean, as <hi>Hosius</hi> cited by you here, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> doe, in the power acknowledged in the Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this cannot subsist, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached last at <hi>Rome</hi> also, was martyred, and buried, and his relicks lay there, yet no authors say, the primacy of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:49965:174"/>
Bishops was founded in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> merits, now no reason can be given of this, save that which I gave, <hi>viz,</hi> that the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops succeed not to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as they doe to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> because St. <hi>Paul</hi> was never Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was. What you say of the succession from St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Antioch,</hi> availes nothing; for he, having deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Bishopprick of <hi>Antioch</hi> in his life time, and transferr'd his seate to <hi>Rome,</hi> were he dyed Bishop of the <hi>Roman</hi> see, was to have his proper successour there; for by tranferring his see to <hi>Rome,</hi> he transferr'd the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Primacy of the Episcopal crown, (as <hi>Valentinian</hi> sayes there) appropriated to him, and took it from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and by dying Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> left it there to his successours; whence appears that the Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> was a successor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as were other Bishops, but no successor to his supereminent dignity and primacy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Church, because so long as St. <hi>Peter</hi> lived, it could not descend upon any other. Fourthly, I deny not, that he ascribes the establishment of <hi>Romes</hi> prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to those three, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the city and the Synod; yet he makes the first foundation of it, the dignity of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore prefixes it before the other two, and that it may appear he makes this the first and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental reason, and not the Synod, he addes these words, <hi>haec cum fuerint hactenus inviolabiter custodita,</hi> since these things (<hi>i. e.</hi> that nothing of great concern should be done without the authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> see) have been hitherto inviolably observ'd; for if the Synod had conferr'd that dignity to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he could not have said with truth, that those things had been alwayes observ'd, for before the Synod which gave it, which was three hundred years and more after the re-Surrection of our Saviour, they were observed: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore they were alwayes observed, that power
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49965:175"/>
&amp; authority must have been, in the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> long in being before those Synods were celebrated. Now how the dignity of the <hi>Roman</hi> city concurr'd to this primacy I have above declared, whence appears, the loud untruth which you pronounce, <hi>n.</hi> 4. Here is not the least inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <hi>that this primacy was but by the appointment of the Synod,</hi> nor that it had continued so from St. <hi>Peters</hi> dayes. Since you use not to read over the texts which are brought against you, I pray you what signifie these words, <hi>haec cum fuerint hactenus inviolabiliter obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vata,</hi> these things have been <hi>hitherto inviolably observed,</hi> what signifies <hi>hitherto,</hi> but from St. <hi>Peters</hi> time to his? Your guess at the Synod of <hi>Sardica,</hi> as aimed at by <hi>Valentinian,</hi> though say you it was of little credit in those dayes (which I have numbred amongst your non-proofs,) is a pure mistake; for the Synod he alludes to, is that of <hi>Nice,</hi> which in the 6 canon, as it is recited in the Council of Chalcedon, sayes thus. <hi>Ecclesia Romana sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per habuit primatum,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath allwaies had the primacy, where that holy council gives it not as you surmise, but declares it to have been alwaies due to that see since the Apostles time: whence also appears the falshood of what you say next, that <hi>Leo durst not pretend divine right and institution, nor to a succession of Primacy from the Apostle,</hi> for this very Synod to which <hi>Leo</hi> alludes, warrants both. For if it were alwayes due to it, or that it had alwayes possession of it, <hi>semper habuit,</hi> it must have come not only from the time of the Apostles but from Christ himself, otherwise it had been <hi>semper,</hi> for in the time of the Apostles, it had not been due to it. When you say next, I translate the word <hi>universitas,</hi> the whole visible Church, you wrong me, for I translate it universality, see <hi>pag.</hi> 59. and when I name the whole visible Church, <hi>p.</hi> 60. I make
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49965:175"/>
no translation of his words, but deliver that which I think to be the sense of them. To what you say, there was a Roman <hi>universality.</hi> If you mean, that those who were under the sole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire with exclusion of all extra-imperial Churches communicating with them, were called anciently the universal Church, or the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of Christians, you are much deceived, where prove you that? if as united with them, and giving the denomination to the whole, 'tis true and confirms what I say. Now to shew that <hi>Valentinian</hi> meanes by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salities, not those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire exclusively to all others, he joynes to universalitie, <hi>ubique</hi>; for then sayes he, the peace of the Church will be kept every where, when the whole universality acknowledges their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but certainly <hi>Valentinian</hi> was not so ignorant, as not to know, there were then many Churches out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For about the year 414. that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 20 years before <hi>Valentinian</hi> enacted this law, <hi>Spain</hi> was possest by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and divided from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: and was <hi>Valentinian</hi> think you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that? so that I am not ashamed to confesse my ignorance, that I really know not any <hi>Roman</hi> universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity Ecclesiastical in your precisive and exclusive sense, nor know I any Council anciently stiled oecumenical, or universal, where no Bishops out of that one (the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>) common-wealth, were present, and you have not yet instructed me to help my ignorance in this. I have no obligation at all to tell you, what power <hi>Valentinian</hi> had out of the Empire, for he might first declare (as he did) the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop to govern the whole Church in the beginning of this breif, and in the end, take care, that all those Provinces which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Empire should observe that his law, concerning so much as belonged unto him, that the universal power
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:49965:176"/>
of the Pope should be observed: As may now the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Germany,</hi> or the King of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> first declare the universal power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop over all Churches, and then command all their Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to obey him, which is all the Emperour does here. For <hi>Valentinian</hi> sayes not (as you falsifie his words, <hi>omnium provinciarum</hi> of all the Provinces, but <hi>aliarum provinciarum,</hi> of other Provinces, nor (<hi>ut Pax ubique servetur,</hi>) as you corrupt him, but <hi>tunc ubique servabitur,</hi> then peace will be observ'd every where, if the whole universality acknowledge their governour; and that not in the law but in the declaration made of the Popes authority,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>vide supra.</hi>
                     </note> as an introduction to it. You answer to <hi>Valentinians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Popes authority and sentence was of force without any imperial law to back it, is much deficient. For seeing he had before declared that the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands had been alwaies observed, they must have been of force, both before any Patriarchate was assign'd to him by any general Council, (as you imagine it was) and before any Christian Emperours had enacted any lawes concerning it, and the very law it self destroyes your glosse, for <hi>Valentinian</hi> sayes presently, <hi>what shall not be lawful for the authority of so great a Bishop to exercise upon the Churches.</hi> Whereby he shews his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extends it self not only to his own, but to all other Patriarchates; nay your very restraining his words to the Empire and yet extending them to the whole Empire, shew evidently, that the Popes sentence had not been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of force independently of any imperial law within his own, but also in all other jurisdictions of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs within the imperial verge; and hence the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which you draw from this authority, whereas <hi>Valentinian</hi> sayes it needed not the imperial help, <hi>that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:49965:176"/>
it needed this extraordinary secular support,</hi> is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as to draw darkness from light: and as inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is it to argue from <hi>Hilaries</hi> repugning against the Pope sentence for a time, that the Pope had no such power over him (which notwithstanding you granted just now,) as to argue that a lawful Prince hath no power over rebellious subjects, because they resist it. So that it could never seem to any considering person, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then that it came into the thoughts and words too of <hi>Valentinian</hi> here, that the Popes supremacy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the limits of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough, through the vein that runs through this Paragraph, that you are soundly netled with this law of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and yet because you are resolved, what ere comes on't to persist in your errour, you fall foul upon <hi>Hosius, Leo, Valentinian,</hi> Bishops, Popes, rather then yield to a manifest truth; <hi>Hosius</hi> you <hi>make so shallow,</hi> that he took things away weakly and facilly upon <hi>the custome of the times,</hi> Leo <hi>you make proud and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and</hi> Valentinian <hi>a young and raw Prince,</hi> subject to be perswaded to any thing. The most part of consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readers will smile to see <hi>Hosius</hi> the most honoured Bishop of his time through the whole Church, who presided in two general Councils, and legate of the holy Pope <hi>Silvester</hi> for the <hi>Western</hi> Church, <hi>Leo</hi> graced with the title of most blessed Father,<note place="margin">

But to be more serious. I challenge you to give me any one instance, where <hi>praeesse</hi> signifies not to govern others as I translate it, either in Scripture or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Indeed Sir you are a worse Critick then you are a Controvertist: I say not therefore, 'tis you who mistake it; that to <hi>go before,</hi> must <hi>be to govern,</hi> but that <hi>praeesse aliis,</hi> to govern them, which all the world sayes with me. Whence also, that if <hi>Aurelius</hi> in quality of Primate in <hi>Africa,</hi> did <hi>praeesse conciliis,</hi> he also govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, as did anciently the Primate of <hi>England</hi> the Councils in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>Num. 264. I see here you are as skilful in Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, as you are in Criticismes: know you not that <hi>Vincentius</hi> speaks of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> Pope and Martyr, who sate in the year 258. till 260. in whose time, the temporal greatness of <hi>Rome</hi> served for nothing, but to render its Bishops objects of tyranny, and subjects of torments; nor was there then any <hi>humane ordination</hi> at all, either from general Councils, or Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, from whom only you derive it, for it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years before them both, which notwithstanding, this ancient Catholique author sayes, that even then in those purest times, the Roman Bishop surpassed all other Bishops, <hi>loci authoritate</hi> not in <hi>precedency</hi> only, but in authority of his place. Now I hope you will tell us in your next, who, if not our Saviour, gave that Soveraign authority to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in those dayes. Should one say, <hi>the Lord Mayor of</hi> London, <hi>surpasses all those of the City, in the authority of his place,</hi> signifies no more, then that in publique meetings he is to take place of all the other Aldermen, &amp;c. without any governing power over them, would any rational man think he speaks sense?</p>

I am sure the answer you have given to it, is fallacious, not distinguishing the time wherein <hi>Vincentius</hi> writ, from the time whereof he writes in that Chapter, and it is no less untrue and inconsistent in it self, your constituting humane ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for the Popes authority, when there was none.</p>

to <hi>charge one</hi>?

A father charges his child to rise at six a clock in the morning, will you say? <hi>sanxit</hi>; shew me in any approved ancient author, that (<hi>sanxit</hi>) is ever applied to any, who have not power to command, or to give Laws to others, in regard of whom they do <hi>sancire,</hi> establish any thing to be observed. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not now, what <hi>Stephen</hi> did, or <hi>Cyprian</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but what <hi>Vincentius</hi> sayes of <hi>Stephen,</hi> he sayes, <hi>sanxit,</hi> he sent or fram'd a Law or decree, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of baptism of those who had been baptized by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, nothing should be innovated: but what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by tradition of receiving them into the Church without rebaptizing them, should be observed: this St. <hi>Cyrian</hi> questioned, and inclin'd too much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Nor is the question here what <hi>Stephens</hi> authority was in other particulars, or was not, but whether <hi>Lyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis</hi> say that he had power, and actually did <hi>sancire,</hi> enact and make a Law to oblige all those in <hi>Africa</hi> in this particular. Why divert you the question by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny turnes, I leave your answer to judgement. You still take all occasions to enervate the Popes authority, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging the opposition of those who (you know, and all the learned with you,) were in error against it, such were those in that Council of <hi>Carthage, Firmilian,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> then, whilst they defended the error of rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation. Whence appears the untruth of what you affirm here, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> knew that the ancient custome maintain'd by Pope <hi>Stephen,</hi> of non-rebaptization, was to be observed, for he with <hi>Firmilian,</hi> and Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> &amp;c. practised and taught the quite contrary.</p>

                  <p>Num. 268.

You an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to my difficulty is fallacious, <hi>ex ignoratione elenchi,</hi> you suppose me to argue thus in an universal proposition, <hi>whatsoever is said by any particular person and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted in Councils is consented to by the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>; and upon this false supposition you frame your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Now I advance no such universal proposition at all in that place, but argue from their silence or non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to their consent out of the particuler in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the legates delivering a doctrine (in your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) absolutely destructive of the authority, and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, of all the Bishops in the Council, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were obliged in conscience to contradict it: their silence therefore, evinces they conceived it was no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to them, but a great advantage both to them and the whole Church, and so argues they consented to it. All therefore that I affirm is this, whatsoever is said tending directly to the destruction of the authorities, and priviledges of those to whom it is said (as those words of the Legates must have done in your opinion) would have been contradicted by them, because they were all oblig'd to stand for the priviledges which Christ had given them, and to oppose every one who delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any doctrine contrary to them. Seeing therefore not so much as any one in the Council speak the least word
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:49965:182"/>
against the Legates, its evident they esteemed not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be injur'd or concern'd in them, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently consented to their doctrine as Catholick, and Orthodox, nor any way abridging any Bishop there of those Episcopal dignities and jurisdictions conferr'd by our Saviours institution upon them.</p>

                  <p>Num. 274. By what I have now writ in answer I think you will not have found me in jest, in the proof of these consequences taken with due circumstances. <hi>Celestine,</hi> sayes the legate, commanded, and <hi>Nestorius</hi> was condemned by him, for not obeying <hi>Celestines</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and no man was either in the council or in the whole Church, who had then the repute of an orthodox Christian, either reprehended <hi>Celestine</hi> for commanding, or justifyed <hi>Nestorius</hi> for not obeying and if any did so, produce them in your next by good authority, <hi>ergo</hi> it was a just command. 2. It being a just command, and must proceed from one who had true authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and against one whome you say by right of the first Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was the first Patriarch then in the Church, had he true authority over him, he must have had true authority over all those who were inferiour to him, <hi>ergo</hi> there was no man to be found in the church who had power to command <hi>Celestine,</hi> there; the second consequence. The third I prove thus, he had power to command justly (as is proved) the highest Patriarch in the Empire, and that Patriarch, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also, had power to command the Empire, (as I have proved above) <hi>ergo Celestine</hi> had consequently power to command all those, whom they commanded. The fourth consequence, I prove the legate said this in full and publick council, and were all highly concern'd in it, (as is also prov'd,) and yet did not in the least contradict it, <hi>ergo</hi> the council was of this mind, that it was no abridgement to their priviledges, but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:49965:184"/>
of their authority, a prime preservative of the Churches unity and a fundamental institution of Christ, in the perfect orders of Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, as the legates had delivered it to the council. You sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose here without any proof at all, <hi>that one pastour though equal may command another in the name of Christ.</hi> Who ever taught this doctrine before you? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts it not inevitably the order of Church government, commanded by St. <hi>Paul?</hi> for what is order but a due observance and subjection of inferiours to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective superiours, which is wholly subverted when an equal takes authority upon him to command his equal, whatsoever pretence of the name of Christ he assume to glosse it; for unless that conferre a real authority upon him who commands over him who is commanded, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines his equal still, that notwithstanding, and then he commands without any true authority, which destroyes order: or if it communicate a reall authority over the person commanded, it makes him superiour who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and not equal to the other, which destroyes your supposition, of one <hi>equal</hi> commanding an other. This made good, the last consequence followes inevitably; for seeing his Council has ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Could they? and yet make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the certification and evidence, they reconciled themselves to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church? If any Schismatick in <hi>France</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himself to the Catholick Church, could he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to remain <hi>allwayes</hi> in the communion of the Bishop of <hi>Rhemes?</hi> suppose that Bishop should so be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated or turne Schismatick, as he might, could he promise never to forsake his communion? seeing therefore an absolute promise was made to remain <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi> in the communion of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was presupposed that Bishop once lawfully chosen and installed could never be excommunicated, or become a Schismatick, so long as he remained Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; otherwise the promise had been illegal and impious, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging them to communicate with Schismaticks.

Schismatick: as he who seperates from the loyal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the visible head of a Kingdome, becomes a Rebel but because he has no power above him against whom he can rebel, but as a King can never be a Rebell, so not the highest visible governour of the Church can be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated or commit Schisme by contempt of the lawful authority of the Church, because he who is the highest of all has no authority in the Church over him, for then he were not the highest.</p>

I have so illustrated, and strengthened my instances, (to open them to your understanding) that every one of them, by an argument <hi>a paritate rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis onis (ut supra)</hi> evinces the Popes power to have been universal over all Christendome, seeing those Patriarchs and Prelates that were within the verge of the Empire obeyed him, upon no other score, save this, that they still conceived him to be, by vertue of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and powers given by our Saviour to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his lawful successors, the cheif Governour of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and of all other Prelates whatsoever, and of the whole Church; and I challenge you to produce one sole instance of Authority from antiquity which sayes in expresse termes, that those of the Empire obeyed them because they were members of the Empire, or that his
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49965:187"/>
authority reached not without the Empire. Nay even in time of the Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon, Spain</hi> though seperate from the Empire, obeyed the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop: for it was possest by the <hi>Gothes</hi> an. 414. who have ever since kept it, and the Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> began 430. And not long after, an. 475. <hi>France</hi> was possest by barbarous Kings, and never since returned to the Empire, yet still remained under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> When <hi>England</hi> was after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, betwixt six and seven hundred years, it was no part of the same Empire, yet yeilded it obedience to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>: the like is of many other <hi>Western</hi> and <hi>Northern</hi> Countries out of the Empire converted, about, or after these times. See more of this in my reasons against your grand noveltie in restraint of general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, what you mention here of a parity from <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> hath no parity at all.

If you mean to such eyes as yours, which I have demonstrated either discovered not or mis-saw the face of my arguments, I grant it; but all open and right sighted eyes, I hope will have seen my cause so invested with grace and truth by what I have here replyed, that it will have no shame to appear before heaven and earth, before men and angels for its justification.</p>

                  <p>Num. 383. <hi>In the end you return to terms. To what you say about the word (Christians) I only say that its but equivocally applied to any that profess not all the essentials of Christianity, of which Popery is none, any more then pride is.</hi>

                  <p>Num. 383. I leave it to judgement, whether this answer, related to my explication as of Christianity (pag. 64. your edit.) have any sense in it. For what though Popery, as you conceit, were no more essential to Christianity then pride is, yet if a Papist hold all the essentials of Christianity, as you hold he does, he may be univocally a Christian. Will you say, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:49965:189"/>
pride is none of the essentials of Christianity, therefore no proud man holds all the essentialls of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity? to what purpose then have you added this clause of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi>? when I speak in general and abstractive terms, not medling at all with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Now you give no satisfaction to your Reader a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the clear notion of an univocal Christian; you tell him here, that an univocal Christian is he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves all the essentials of Christianity, but through this whole answer you never give him either a distinct cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of essentials, or prescribe any direct rule, or means to know which they are, as we shall see hereafter.</p>

                  <p>Num. 384. <hi>About the word (Monarch) in good sadness, do you deny the Pope to be (an imperious sole Commander?) Which of these is it you do deny? not that he is a (Commander) not that he is (imperious) not that he is (sole) in his Soveraignty. I would either you or we knew what you hold or deny. But perhaps the next words shew the difference (as temporal Kings.) But this saith not a word wherein they differ from (temporal Kings.)</hi>

                  <p n="384">384. You are really a strange man to deal withal. Can any one speak more clearly then I have done? I say we hold no such Monarch in the Church, as is an imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sole Commander, as temporal Kings are, &amp;c. And when I have said all this in <hi>sensu conjuncto,</hi> and knit my words and sense together as close as I can, you go and pull all in pieces, and ask me if I understand them
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:49965:190"/>
in <hi>sensu diviso</hi>? Is not this very handsome think you? Should I say that <hi>Iane Shore</hi> was no honest Christian woman, would you have askt me, which of these is it that I deny, not that she was a woman, not that she was a <hi>Christian,</hi> not that she was <hi>honest</hi> in her conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; would it not have been ridiculous in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree? and if upon this you should adde, after I had said, <hi>she was no honest Christian woman</hi> (conform to what you do here) <hi>I would either you or I could know what you hold about Iane Shore.</hi> Would not every one laugh at you? But in sober sadness, did you not understand what I denyed, as plainly as what I deny of <hi>Iane Shore.</hi> Hold we him to be an <hi>Imperious sole Commander,</hi> as <hi>temporal Kings are,</hi> whom we unanimously affirm to have no power to deprive Church Officers at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as Kings have power to put out what Officer soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they please through their whole Kingdom; who is not alone to govern the Church either immediately or mediately as Kings govern their Kingdoms (according to Christs institution.) But every Bishop being Christs Officer, and not the Popes as truly as the Pope is within the precincts of his Diocess, are as true Governours of the different respective parts of the Church, as the Pope is of the whole. Now I hope at last you understand me, how Popes differ from temporal Kings.</p>

What mean you by brethren as such, are no subjects abstractively? to what purpose? is it also true to say, men and women <hi>as such</hi> are no subjects, that is, they are not subjects precisely, <hi>quatenus</hi> under the formal notion of men and women, for then all men and women should be subjects exclusively? that is, their being brethren, repugnes to their being subjects. Take heed, that doctrine will be dangerous at Court: what? were not his Majesties brethren his subjects? or because his Majesty ruled them but as brethren, he ruled them not by any governing authority, as you say here of the Pope: the like is if any elder brother should be School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, or General, or Magistrate over his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did he not rule him by governing authority? And have you not an express prophesie of two brethren, <hi>major serviet minori,</hi> the greater shall serve the lesser? Nay, calls not Christ himself his Apostles brethren, will you therefore say he rul'd them not by governing authority? But you (I suppose very innocently) fall into a grosse folly here, when I say he governs them as <hi>brethren,</hi> you would have my meaning to be, <hi>as they are brethren,</hi> by a reduplication upon the object, whereas by the term, <hi>as brethren,</hi> I mean he governs them as brethren use, or ought to be govern'd, reduplicating upon the act of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, not upon the object that is to be govern'd; that is, the chief Governour of Christs Church, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will and institution of Christ, to govern all Christians as a brother, who is a Superiour and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of his brethren, and ought to govern them, to wit, in meekness, charity, and humility: and therefore I make all my reduplications and reflections upon the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:49965:192"/>
act, when I say, <hi>if only for one who hath received power from Christ in meekness, charity, and humility to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all the rest, for their eternal good, as brethren, or children, I grant it.</hi>

                  <p>Num. 392. Here you begin your fallacie, <hi>Vicarius Christi,</hi> is indeed a title, but <hi>Vice-Christi</hi> is none, the one signifies the <hi>Vicar of Christ,</hi> but the other signifies, <hi>in the place or stead of Christ</hi>; which having no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantive or demonstrative annext to it, cannot possibly be a title, for of it self it signifies no determinate sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Now if you will joyn to it a substantive, and say, <hi>Papa est Vice-Christi,</hi> the Pope is in place of Christ,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:49965:194"/>
you may make some kind of title to it, but you can never make it that about which we controvert, for that is <hi>Vice-Christus, the Vice-Christ</hi>; so that all those who are <hi>Vice-Christi</hi> in the genitive case, that is, the place <hi>of Christ,</hi> are not <hi>Vice-Christi</hi> in the nominative, that is, <hi>Vice-Christi,</hi> which title onlie is in question betwixt us; (you were (as some of your Parishioners esteemed you) to govern those of <hi>Kidderminster, Vice-Christi,</hi> in the place of Christ, were you therefore <hi>the Vice-Christ of Kiddermunster</hi>? Nor is the title of universal head of the Church set down in your illimited terms here, either a title acknowledged by us as due to the Pope, or given to him by us. For that Christ being the sole universal head of the Church, which comprehends the Church militant and triumphant, the term <hi>universal head</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that which is due to Christ onlie; we therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there is none but Christ himself according to your expression <hi>universal head</hi> of the Church, nor is there any universal Vice-head, nor Vice-Christ corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding to that universal head, to be found in the whole Church. Nay, even speaking of the sole militant Church, we never say, without some restriction, the Pope <hi>is universal head of the Church,</hi> for universal head, comprises as well the internal and invisible, as the visible Governour of the militant Church; now we all deny that the Pope is head in the <hi>invisible</hi> government of the visible Church, for that manner of government Christ only is the universal head; nor say we, that there is any Vice-christ or Vice-head constituted in the place of Christ, in this invisible direction of the Church. We therefore restrain the term <hi>universal head,</hi> by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive <hi>visible,</hi> nor intend we to say any more then this, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the visible head of the universal visible Church, so far as it is capable of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:49965:194"/>
government, together with other Bishops, who are as truely Christs officers and vice-gerents in their res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective governments though subject to the Pope, as he is in his government. And in this sense only can he be termed a vice-Christ, or vice-God, that is holding the place of Christ in the visible government of his Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church. But he cannot be stiled <hi>the</hi> vice-Christ which is the sole title about which we now contend, for that imports an absolute Vice-gerency under Christ in all things. Now in the othet sense above explicated eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawful Bishop also or Pastor, may be termed a <hi>Vice-Christ</hi> and every King a Vice-God in reference to those whom they govern as truly as the Pope can be: yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we nor you attribute usually any such title to any of them because they seem neither to suite with Christian humility, nor with the incomparable supereminency of Christ. Now to shew that even when they are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some Encomiasticks to our Popes, it is done with restrictions as v. g. <hi>in terris,</hi> upon earth, <hi>visibilis,</hi> visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And every one who knowes any thing knows this is all we mean.</p>

                  <p>Num. 408. <hi>Marcellus</hi> is indeed of more concern, because he speaks in a Council, but the world may see he play'd the Orator, his first expressions are no way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, but true, and proper; that of <hi>divinum imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is so a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Now that particle <hi>ad divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num injunctum imperium</hi> is not spoken of the Popes power, but of Gods divine command, obliging <hi>Iulius</hi> to take care of those who were committed to him, for he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

His exhorting <hi>Iulius</hi> to preserve the health, life, and spirit which he had given them, is easily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, that he both gave them, and preserved them, by a careful direction teaching an external governing the visible Church. His last stiling him <hi>alter Deus in terris,</hi> another God upon earth, is that which offends you most, but had you considered, that <hi>Moses</hi> in holy Scripture is made by God himself, the God of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; that God titles those who are in lawful authority Gods, <hi>ego dixi dij estis,</hi> I have said you are Gods; and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms that all Gods true servants, and children are <hi>participes divinae naturae, participant of the divine nature,</hi> which are as high and much higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, then <hi>Marcellus</hi> gives here to <hi>Iulius,</hi> you would not I suppose so confidently have impeached him of blasphemy; nor indeed could, unless you make both St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the holy Scriptures, nay and God himself, to pronounce blasphemies in applying the like titles to living men: especially seeing that as the holy Scriptures give ground enough to interpreters, to expound them in such accomodated senses, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:49965:202"/>
the least shew of blasphemy at all in them. Now the Council having heard the whole Oration, and not only those parcels, which you have spitefully cul'd out of it, discover'd clearly what his meaning was, and thereupon the Fathers let these expressions pass, as flashes of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick.</p>

                  <p>Num. 410. You erre more then once here. First you commit a tautologie, in repeating the words <hi>in glossa</hi> twice without any necessity: for you say thus, <hi>in glossa extravag. Ioan.</hi> 22. <hi>de verb. significat. cap. Cum inter, in glossae montibus inquit erant, &amp; erant in mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus illis.</hi> 2.

Thirdly, you corrupt the Text, for the words are <hi>haereticum censeretur, it would be thought heretical,</hi> and you put it, <hi>haereticum sensea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, let it be judg'd heretical, or be it judg'd heretical,</hi> and this to make your Reader believe it is a Law or Precept, put in the Imperative mood, when it is no more then the judgement of a private Doctor, glossing upon the Law, or giving an interpretation of it, and by this false play, you give a seeming force to your immediate inference, drawn from these words, <hi>viz. So that by your Law</hi> (say you) <hi>we must believe the power of your Lord God the Pope, or be hereticks.</hi> Whereby you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly impose upon your Reader, that these words are

                     <hi>our law,</hi> whereas you your self confesse, they only are a part of the glosse, which was made by a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or interpretation of our Law. Fiftly hence followes that you contradict your self within four lines, for in the first and second line of this paragraph you confesse twice over, 'tis but a glosse of the law, and in the fift line you say it is the law it self. Your seventh and ninth errour is, that you give here a <hi>non proof</hi> for <hi>a proof,</hi> for seeing you acknowledge some impressions have not the word <hi>Deum, God,</hi> as appeares evidently in the edition of <hi>Paris</hi> An. 1522. where the word <hi>Deum, God,</hi> is not 63 yeares older then that of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. How will you ever prove this <hi>Glosser</hi> used this word but that it was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly added by some copiest, or false print to the text. Yet suppose it were certain (as I have prov'd it is not) that this <hi>Glosser</hi> had adjoyned the Word <hi>Deum, God,</hi> it would be no proof at all; for in this paragraph he refers what he delivered there, to the correction of the Church, <hi>Si in premissis vel in aliquo premissarum contingeret me errare,</hi> if (saith he) I should happen to erre in any of the premises.</p>

                  <p>Num. 412.

                  <p>Num. 414. This discourse of yours is defective many wayes. First it is fallacious, <hi>ex insufficiente enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meratione partium,</hi> For amongst all the titles you have reckoned you have not that of <hi>Pontifex maximus</hi> (and the like may be said of many others) which is peculiar to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was never attributed to any other, nor was any other ever intituled, <hi>Vicarius-Christi,</hi> the Vicar of Christ, nor <hi>Episcopus universalis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi> Bishop of the universal Church, nor <hi>Caput omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um sacerdotum Dei,</hi> the head of all Priests of God, save the Pope; see how much you are out in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. Secondly, it is corrupt, for you fall againe (as you did in your key <hi>ut supra</hi>) to translate <hi>Pontifex</hi> Pope, and <hi>summus Pontifex, Chief Pope.</hi> Thirdly you assert the same things without proof, as that <hi>Head of the Church was given to</hi> Constantinople <hi>that the Popes made an agreement with</hi> Constantinople; <hi>that their Patriarch should keep the title of universal Patriarch, and the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>be called the universal Pope.</hi> Fourthly you speak equivocally, for though <hi>summus Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex</hi> (as <hi>Baronius</hi> notes) was given anciently to all Bishops; yet that was in relation to inferiour Clarks, not to all, even Bishops, Metropolitanes, and Patriarchs, as it is given to the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that <hi>Summus Pontifex</hi> in <hi>Baronius</hi> his sense signifies no more then a chief or highest Priest, but ascribed to the Pope it signifies the chief and the highest Bishop, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant with <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> which <hi>Baronius</hi> affirms to be peculiar to the Pope, as I have already noted: you equivocate also in the title of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> successours, as I have declared above, for though other

Bishops may be said to be his successours <hi>secundum quid</hi> in some part of his Ecclesiastical power, <hi>viz,</hi> as he was a Bishop, yet none can be said to be his successour sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter, absolutely and intirely, that is in the fulnesse of his power, as he was Prince of the Apostles, and chief Bishop of Gods visible Church, as it is visible, save the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; for the reason above alleadged by me, and thus much your self must grant, according to your own principles; for though you assert other Bishops to be his successours in his Episcopal dignity, yet, seeing you grant him a precedency of place before all other Bishops and Patriarchs, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had precedency before all the rest of the Apostles, for otherwise he could not have been as the Ancient Fathers familiarly call him, <hi>Princeps Apostolorum,</hi> the <hi>Prince and chief amongst the Apostles,</hi> for that must <hi>at least</hi> signifie a principallity in place and rank, seeing I say you yield him this precedency, none can have been successour to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the full extent of his dignity, save the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>

Sure you dream'd of logick, when you writ this, yet farther, if these five authorities prove any thing against us, tis, that they make the Pope not the Vice-Christ, but Christ himself, or of equal power with him; and one of them that the Pope is of greater power then God himself, which is directly contrary to your pretence, for no Vice-King is the King, nor of equal power with the King. If you reply, in proving they make him equal to God, and Christ &amp;c. They prove more then was undertaken to be proved, and that they
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:49965:208"/>
make him higher then the Vice-Christ. And secondly you may please to remember, you had two things to prove, the first, that the Popes were held by sufficient authority amongst us to be the <hi>Vice-Christ,</hi> and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Popes accepted of that title. Now though you had prov'd that some have given them eulogiums, sounding something more then the <hi>Vice-Christ,</hi> yet that will neither prove it was done by sufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor, unlesse you prove the Popes have accepted them, (which you never so much as essay to doe) your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in these prooss; for the authorities you alledge are not sufficient to ground a publick &amp; solemn title, so that your Thesis is left bare and naked yet without proof.

Here you fumble in the dark, I pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle this in your next, for I cannot, what is that wee give to the Church real, and representative? wherein is the Church real not able to exert its power? what mean you by <hi>singulis major,</hi> and <hi>universis minor,</hi> to whom apply you this, or to what purpose?</p>

                  <p>Num. 419. <hi>Fiftly, but let it be as extraordinary as you please, if while these Councils sit, the Pope lose his headship, your Church is then two Churches specifically distinct, and the form of it changeth when a Council sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: not like the Spouse of Iesus Christ.</hi>

                  <p>Num. 419. You should have done well to have prest this argument, against those who hold Councils to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Pope, it touches not me at all, who am of the contrary opinion; yet even those of that opinion will answer you with a wet finger, that the Church hath neither then two heads, nor loses the Pope his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: for he remaines chief <hi>ordinary</hi> governour of the Church in all ordinary causes and cases; as well when there is, as when there is not a Council, and he being as ordinary head of the Church, the chief president in the Council, the Council is not its chief governour with exclusion of the Pope, because it cannot be a true general Council but by including him in it. So that he with the rest of the Bishops assembled make up the Council,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:49965:211"/>
you cannot therefore divide the Council from him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you divide him from himself, so that he and a general Council are not two things, adequately distant, but involve him in it, as a humane body involves the head, or a Parliament the King.</p>

                  <p>Num. 420. <hi>Sixtly, As your Popes are said to live in their constitutions and laws, when the person dieth; and your Church is not thought by you to die with them, so why may not Councils do? The lawes of Councils live when they sit not, and the</hi> French <hi>think that these lawes are above the Pope, though I shewed you even now that</hi> Julius 2. in Con.

                  <p>Num. 420. Let them remain in their decrees as much as you please, but that will never make them the ordinary chief governours of the Church, they remain no more in their degrees, then did our ancient Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their Statutes, yet no man dare say, who is a good subject, that those Parliaments were therefore the ordinary soveraign governours of the Kingdome, taken exclusively without the King.</p>

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:49965:212"/>
these Parliaments are extraordinary and not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Soveraign? no doubt they are. And the Council of State is the Soveraign, but the chief Officer or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate for execution of the intervals.</hi>

                  <p>Num. 421. Hitherto you have discoursed warily, and covertly, but now you discover openly your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of State government. 'Tis well you put an <hi>if</hi> to it, and make it a conditional, that will save you at a dead lift, but yet every one sees by it, how great an approver you were of the soveraignty of irregular Parliaments, and authority of Councils of State, for you speak not of what might be, but what then was, when you writ this; but I wonder you were so bold as to let this see light (as you did before something like it) even since the most happy returne of his Sacred Majestie. Let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judge of such passages as these.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> produces his answer to my argument and instances, the last four pages are spent in confident repetition of what is now answered, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of what he would impose upon me to be Sylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistocally proved, a prophesie of Christs speedy coming to judgement, a wholesome admonition to take help from others to be able to encounter him, <hi>scilicet,</hi> a whole Army of such Pigmees as I, is not able to incounter him, he is so great a Giant; but let the Reader judge whether something like that hath not hapned unto him, which hapned to such an other whilst he exprobated and outfaced the hosts of the living God. 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.49.50.

               </p>
               <p>This question Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> resolves affirmatively, pag. 197.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You first prefix an explication of termes, from p, 197. to p. 204. which is of no concern to my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor of much to your answer; I note only <hi>obiter,</hi> these particulars p. 198. you define the universal visible Church, thus, <hi>It is the whole company of believers (or true Christians) upon earth subject to Iesus Christ their head</hi>: where you first make <hi>believers</hi> and <hi>true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Synonimaes; whereas one not baptized may be a believer, but no Christian, for he is made a Christian by baptism, being before a Catechumen; and then you assert the visible Church to consist as well of Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens as of baptiz'd Christians, which is absonous, for by baptism they are made Church-members.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You use the word subject to Christ, in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition which according to you, (<hi>ut supra</hi>) is equivocal, and thereby unfit to be part of a definition, and may signifie no more (according to you) then one of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour rank and order, who is not under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another, so that when you say <hi>subject</hi> to
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:49965:213"/>
Christ, &amp;c. you may express no more by the word sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject then that they are <hi>inferiour</hi> to Christ, and that Christ is to take place of all Christians; nor can you distinguish your self from this difficultie, by alleadging, you say they are subject to Christ <hi>their head,</hi> for you speak equivocally in the word <hi>head</hi> too, according to the former principles where you were forc'd to say head sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more then a <hi>principal member,</hi> proceeding, but not governing the rest. In the same page you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Protestants thus, <hi>Protestants are Christians protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against or disallowing Poperie,</hi> which is worse then the former, for you cannot be ignorant that the first Origin of the word <hi>Protestant</hi> proceeded from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> Landgrave of <hi>Hassia</hi> and some few other Prinees of their faction, protesting against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Edict decreed at <hi>Wormes</hi> an. 1526, the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance whereof was established in the diet at <hi>Spire</hi> 1529, about the not changing any thing in the Churches practise publickly and commonly used before their times till a general Council was assembled, and made decrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it,; Now it is evident these Princes protested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Popery, and disowned it some years before this, and yet were not termed Protestants for that reason. Take you your self to be a man of so uncontroulable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as to make new impositions, and give new sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications to words as your fancie leades you? what? Call you the Greeks for some hundred of yeares <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> because they protested against that which they esteem Popery, the Popes supremacy: the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, &amp;c. I am sure they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrate that appellation as much, nay more, then they do Popery: nor were they ever termed Protestants, till you call'd them so.

If they be Protestants, Protestants be they, much good do it you with them, you'l say <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Antetrinitarians</hi> are no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but you shall see presently your arguments will prove them as true Christians, as you can prove your self to be for an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Antetrinitarian</hi> will say as you do here page. 199. and 200. <hi>We profess our selves to be of no other Church, and before men a man is to be taken of that Religion and Church of which he professeth himself to be, till he be proved false in that profession.</hi> pag. 199. You say Protestants in relation to our religion, are as a man purged, healed, freed, from Leprosie, Plague, Consumption &amp;c. then sure you make that which you call Popery, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Leprocie,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ferne,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bramhall.</hi>

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:49965:214"/>
of a Papist shew him to be a Papist; see you not the difference? thousands and millions deny you to be true Christians, and those not only friends, but ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies also of the Pope, as all the Greeks are, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all your profession to be so; but not so much as one denies those to be Papists who profess themselves to be so.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Pag. 200. Parag. Note, you speak not (say you) of internal belief, but of external profession: but there you'r out; for whatsoever your internal sincerity be or be not, your very external profession in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of your belief, or rather disbelief against the Roman Church, shews your general profession of true christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be false, so that the one convinces the other of falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as (in your principles) an <hi>Arrian</hi> who as you present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, p. 203. is no Christian, though he sincerely profess the belief of Christianity, yet because that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his particular profession of disbelief of the consubstantiality of the Son of God with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, shews his general profession to be false.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Page 201. &amp; 202. You renew first your error of making a visible body without a visible head; for I have shew'd though Christs person be now visible, yet as he is head of the millitant Church, he is invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that is, he exercises immediately no visible office, or action in governing his Church, but all are purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, spiritual, and invisible. Secondly, you say he is <hi>visus, seen</hi> to the triumphant Church; but where finde you (in your doctrine) any corporal eye amongst the triumphant to see him? pag. 202. num. 2. you say the true Christians were very few, to the <hi>Arrians</hi> in their prevalencie, which you neither prove, nor can prove, for it is manifestly false; I omit many such over-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as these, that I may come to your proof, <hi>Non-proof</hi> 1.</p>

Thirdly, you make the predicate of the minor, the subject of the conclusion. This is a hopeful beginning, put your sylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism first in form, and then I'le answer it; suppose all adjusted; I deny your minor. <hi>Protestants are no part of that Church on earth whereof Christ is head.</hi> Non-proof 2.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Pag. 204. the second sylogism is likewise out of form, having no universal proposition in it. Adde <hi>all</hi> to your major to set it in form, and I first deny it. <hi>It is not true, that all who profess true Christian Religion in all its essentials, are members of Christs Church,</hi> for to these essentials they may add some error or non-essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial as an essential to them, and thereby destroy faith, as you your self cite <hi>Durandus,</hi> pag. 211. and put a N.

Your third sylogism p. 295. is also out of form, for want of an universal proposition add <hi>All</hi> to your major, &amp; I grant that, and deny your minor. <hi>Protestants profess not so much as God hath promised salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Covenant of Grace.</hi> Non-proof 4.</p>
               <p>Your fourth sylogism is also out of form, not assuming the whole proposition to be proved, for in that proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was this term, <hi>in the Covenant of Grace,</hi> which is not to be found in this fourth sylogism.</p>

I deny also that they believe with a saving divine faith any of the mysteries here named, or that their profession general and particular affirm this. <hi>Non-proof</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Your 5. sylogism p. 206. nu. 2. is likewise out of form for want of an universal proposition: make it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, and I deny your major, they profess not so much as Catecumens and Competentes, for those profess to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve implicitly all that was taught as matter of faith by the Catholique Church, in that article, I believe the Catholique Church, which Protestants do not, nor can they do it truly, since their profest disbelief of many points evinces the contrary. <hi>Non-proof</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Your 6. sylogism p. 206. nu. 3. is also out of form, for the same reasons, add <hi>all</hi> to the major, I deny your major, their general profession is contradicted by their particular denial of such points as are sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them, as articles of faith. Secondly, you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish not betwixt being implicitly contained in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral principles, and being expresly contain'd in the Creeds and Scriptures. Thirdly, Creeds and Scriptures are not enough, traditions and decrees of general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils in matters of faith must be believed. Fourthly, I deny those Protestants who are such wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and not excused with invincible ignorance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any article of faith at all with a supernal saving faith. Thus in six sylogisms you have not so much as one

               <p>Pag. 208. I deny your minor, what I deny in the former sylogism, is not in your profession, both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular: the second shews the contrary, and contradicts the first, as did the <hi>Arrians (ut supra.)</hi>

               <p>Pag. 217. Your whole discourse is a pure paror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; our question is not what is essential or necessary, <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> or <hi>praecepti,</hi> to be known and expresly believed by all, <hi>per se,</hi> and absolutely, but whether one believing all that is essential and necessary in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and withal disbelieving any other point of faith whatsoever after it is <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> sufficiently propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as such to any particular person, can either be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or be a true real part of the visible Church of Christ. Now we answer negatively to this question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such a disbelief excludes an implicite belief of that point so disbelieved, and consequently a belief of all that God hath revealed, and therby all supernatural &amp; saving faith. To illustrate the truth of this assertion, let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> who believed all that which you account essential, that is, the common Articles necessary for all to salvation, the Creeds, the Scriptures, &amp;c. And had sufficiently propounded to him the belief of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:49965:218"/>
sin as a point of Christian faith, which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to believe, and accounts an errour; the question will not be in this case, whether that <hi>Pelagian</hi> believe all these essentials (in the account) but whether that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, he be not excluded out of the Church, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred from it, by that wilful disbelief of Original sin. This is our present case, controverted betwixt us; so that though it were admitted that you believe all that material object of faith, which you esteem essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and necessary for all to be expresly believed, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we accuse and judge you to disbelieve many points of as much concern as is that of Original sin, and as sufficiently propounded to you as such, as that was to the <hi>Pelagians</hi>; we have as much reason to judge you to be excluded out of the Catholique Church, and dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred from it, as we have to judge them; either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you acknowledge the point disbelieved by you, and propounded as matter of faith by us to you, to be as sufficiently propounded, as was that of Original sin to the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> or you deny it; if you acknowledge it, you must acknowledge you are as much dismembred from the Church by your disbelief as they were: if you deny it, then we will put our selves upon the proof of it; so that till our proofs be heard and fully answer'd, you cannot secure your selves of being parts of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, no more then could the <hi>Pelagians.</hi>

Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which it had under his lawful Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors the Roman Bishops in all ensuing ages? that's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the question: and seeing <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks here of one Church as propagated thorough the world succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively from the Apostolical Churches, and that of <hi>Rome</hi> was one, and the chief amongst them, how can <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> speak of the Church, and not speak of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this sentence? and seeing also he treats here of a Church as one visible, and there is no other means to render it so one, if it have not one supream visible ordinary Tribunal to whom all are subject (as <hi>Optatus</hi> had said above) and that can neither be the Bishops dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd thorough the whole Church, nor assembled in a general Council, (for that is an extraordinarie Tribunal, as I have proved,) there must be some one supream or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Pastor over all other Bishops, which if it be not the Bishop of Rome, pray tell me in your next who it is. By this is satisfied your seven <hi>notanda,</hi> pag. 234. for though <hi>Tertullian</hi> instance in the Apostolical Churches of his time, whilst they agreed in faith with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> as paterns of Christian faith, yet experience hath told us (and you cannot denie it) that all the rest by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the faith profest in <hi>Rome,</hi> fell by degrees into heresie, so that now you must either say there is no Apostolical not fallen into Heresie, or that the sole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man remains pure from it, and a pattern of unitie and puritie of faith to all Christians even till, and at this day.</p>
               <p n="29">29.

send us not to the Roman Church, would you have him to write nothing in his whole works but dispatches to <hi>Rome?</hi> what if he call the holy Ghost only <hi>Vicarius Christi</hi> in that place, sayes he therefore that he only is his Vicar? cannot Christ have one invisible, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther visible Vicar? Why not? sayes <hi>Tertullian</hi> (as you here acknowledge) that it is the holy Ghosts office to procure that all the Churches lose not the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, why then say you they have all lost it? you'l re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie they have not all lost it in its essentials; names <hi>Tertullian</hi> essentials? he sayes the holy Ghost would never permit all Churches to leave the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, now that which you account non-essential, was (as we now suppose) as much their doctrine, as was that which you account essential, besides (<hi>ut supra</hi>) what essentials were contradicted by the <hi>Millenaries, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitans,</hi> &amp;c? yet they (in <hi>Tertullians</hi> account) left the Apostles doctrine, but you'l reply again, those onlie are said to leave the Apostles doctrine, who leave all their doctrine; not those who hold some points, though they leave others. Then no Heretick can be said to have left the Apostles doctrine: for never did any leave it all; then though the Church should deny some articles of the Creed, and hold others, it could not be said to have left the Apostles doctrine; you'l bring, I see, the Church at last to a fair pass. I am glad to see you so ingenuous, as to cite the words of <hi>Tertullian, ecquid verisimili est,</hi> &amp;c. but should have been more satisfied, had you En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish'd them.

               </argument>
               <p n="32">32. Pag. 238. Your third argument is out of form, having the term <hi>as Christian</hi> in the first part of the antecedent, and not in the sequel or second part, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deny the antecedent, <hi>viz. Though the Roman as Christian hath been alwayes visible, yet the Protestant hath not been alwayes visible.</hi> It is <hi>fallacia à secundum quid,</hi> and <hi>simpliciter.</hi> For all that can be pretended to
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:49965:225"/>
follow, is no more then this, <hi>that the Protestants have been visible as Christians, that is, so far as they profess the belief of the chief articles in Christian faith</hi>; nor yet follows so much, for I deny they believe any one of them as Christians ought to do, that is, with an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, supernatural, divine faith, so that they have not been alwayes a visible Church as Christian, though the Roman have been so. Hence falls the proof of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Pag. 239. I denie your supposition, that when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants first pretended to reform what displeas'd them in the doctrine of the Roman Church, that thereby they were cured of the plague, &amp;c. for if the Roman Church were then infected with the plague, all the visible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world, and consequently the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church was infected with it, which is diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally contrary to the Texts here cited by you out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> and a horrible blasphemie, to affirm that the mystical body of Christ is infected with the plague, or any such like mischief. Here you trifle again, prove the Popes supremacie first to be an usurpation, and then take it for a ground of your argument: what millions abroad, and within the Roman Territories are those you talk of? is everie number which you fancie, a million? <hi>Ibid.</hi> you frame an objection of your own, and then answer it, what's the one or the other to me? That which I have objected to be proved by you, is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, but a plain affirmative, for 'tis this, <hi>that you prove any Church now denying or opposing the Popes Supremacy to have been alwayes visible.</hi> Pag. 240. you essay to answer the argument about possession. Your first answer is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> or <hi>falsum suppositum,</hi> that any parts of the Catholique Church, much less the most fit, can be nominated wherin the Popes Supremacy had not possession. <hi>Non-proof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">
                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:49965:226"/>34. Your second of making good against our title of supremacy, &amp;c. is only affirm'd by you who are a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but never yielded by us, nor legitimately judged, or defin'd against us: so that <hi>sub judice lis est,</hi> the matter is still in process, and you know <hi>lite pendente,</hi> till the cause be decreed or yielded up by one of the parties, the possessor is to enjoy his title, according to all law and reason; you therfore by actual dispossessing the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Bishops of that right and title whereof he was quietly possest in the year 1500, in this our Nation, and in all other places where you entred, upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence only that you think you have sufficiently disproved it from the divine law; is to do him as much wrong as if a plantif in a suite at law, should thrust the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant out of quiet possession (without decree or order from any competent Judge) upon this sole pretence that he frames a judgement to himself, he has convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by law the others title to be null, for in these cases both he and you, make your selves judges in your own cause, and proceed to an execution, without a warrant.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Page 240. To your question, what you must prove? I answer 'tis this, <hi>that any Church which</hi> has at any time, or does now deny the Popes supremacy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main independent of it, has bin allwaies visible. <hi>Ibid.</hi> of such as know nothing of the Popes supremacy, I say nothing, it being not our case; then only they are bound to alledge proof for the denyal of it, when it is or shall be sufficiently propunded to them.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Page 241. The Smpremacie it self, I have proved to be essential to the Church, for there can be no visible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without a head. But then it is essential to the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christian faith in particular persons, when it is sufficiently propounded to them as a point of faith page
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:49965:226"/>
241. You propose your fourth argument in proof of the Catholick Church not acknowledging the Popes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy for some time.</p>
               <p>Your first Sylogism is out of form. 1 for want of the word <hi>ever.</hi> it should be <hi>ever</hi> since, in your antecedent; 2 and in the sequel, for you say only that the Church whereof the Protestants are members, <hi>hath been visible</hi>; where as you should say hath been <hi>ever,</hi> or <hi>alwayes</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for that only is the present question. 3 You sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the sole denyal of the Popes supremacy, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the Church whereof the Protestants are members, which I deny, for all hereticks as well as Protestants, denyed his supremacy.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Page 232, 233. I have already answered to your 28 canon of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> first it uses the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is <hi>deferr'd</hi> or attributed, not <hi>gave</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd a new.</hi> 2 they pretend to give no more to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> then the second general Council had done (as appeares by the words) now that was to be next after <hi>Rome,</hi> so that the principallity, which <hi>Rome</hi> had before the Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed by that canon. 3 It is evident that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallity of <hi>Rome</hi> before all other Patriarchal Churches, was not only in precedency of place, and order, but in power, jurisdiction, and authority over them, for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi> as <hi>Photius,</hi> witnesse ep. 125 confirm'd that Constantinopolitan Council which was an act of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream jurisdiction. 4 That additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the second canon about <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> priviledges,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Con. Const.</hi> 1 <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> must have been annexed to the canon by some sinister meanes after the Council was dissolved, for it is both dissonant from the former part of the canon, which decrees that the Canon of <hi>Nice,</hi> c. 6. be observed in exercise of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:49965:227"/>
jurisdiction within their districts prescribed in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and yet this addition infringes the very canon of <hi>Nice,</hi> where the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was the first and of <hi>Antioch</hi> the second, both before <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, when <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> with a Council celebrated by his authority pretended to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise authority over St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> neither St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> nor his adherents ever mentioned this addition to the second canon of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which had it been held authentical in their time, they would doubtless have done, as being so powerful to defend their cause. Thirdly, when <hi>Sicinius,</hi> successour to <hi>Atticus</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> had ordain'd <hi>Proclus</hi> his competitor Bishop of <hi>Sizicene</hi> by virtue of a canon that none should be ordain'd Bishop without the consent of the Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitan Bishop, those of <hi>Sizicene</hi> rejected <hi>Proclus</hi> and affirm'd that canon to have been made only for <hi>Atticus</hi>: nor did <hi>Sicinius</hi> so much as mention this canon of the first Council of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> which he would have don,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Socrat lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 28.</note> had he esteemed it a genuine part of the canon in his time: now what is said of equal priviledges with <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of all priviledges w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
                  <hi>Rome</hi> had, for then <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> should not have been next after <hi>Rome,</hi> but equal with <hi>Rome,</hi> but it must be limited to some particular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, &amp; then though it had been made equal in them, it might in others remain inferiour, nay subject to it.</p>
               <p n="38">38. To what you most urge, that <hi>Romes</hi> priviledges were given to it by the Fathers, and consequently are not derived from our Saviours institutions besides that of the greek word now observed, I answer the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> could not mean that the Fathers gave as by a new gift, the priviledges to <hi>Rome</hi> without a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:49965:227"/>
for in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> the sixt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council is alledged thus, <hi>Ecclesia Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana semper habuit primatum, the Roman Church had alwaies the primacy,</hi> now if it had alwaies the primacie, how could the same Council say, it recieved its privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and consequently its primacy (as you collect here) from the Fathers in succeeding times? Either therefore you must say that (supposing as you do) this canon is a genuine canon of the Council, that the Council contradicts it self, or that they mean not these words, the Fathers gave as a new gift all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to <hi>Rome</hi>; or you must say that this canon is false, &amp; supposititious, fram'd surreptitiously, and rejected by St. <hi>Leo,</hi> destructive of the <hi>Nicene</hi> canon and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent priviledges of other Churches, and coin'd by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolius</hi> &amp; his adherents perswasion out of pride &amp; ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is most manifest it is, &amp; so of no force, as <hi>Leo</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in his epistle to <hi>Anatolius.</hi> And <hi>Anatolius</hi> himself in part acknowledges in his answer to <hi>Leo.</hi> To what you say of the ground of these priviledges, the imperialitie of the <hi>Roman</hi> city, I have told you that was not urged as the sole, but as a partial ground of those priviledges as it is also in the letters of <hi>Valentinian</hi> cited above, but yet that only was mentioned here, because it made most for <hi>Anatolius</hi> his pretension.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Your second argument is page 244, 245, 246, 247. You ground your arguments in a patent falshood, those Fathers, and others, as occasion served, prest mainly and largely this argument, so <hi>Bellar. Baron. Perrone, Coccius, Gualterus, Stapleton,</hi> and others of this subject, and no smal number of them are cited by me in this answer. But you call all their citations, <hi>scraps,</hi> and it must be so, if you have once said it, your word is a proof at any time, but you should have don well to
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:49965:228"/>
have cited those <hi>scraps,</hi> that the world might have seen whether they be so or no; are you a disputant when you have no other reason for your saying then <hi>an I say so</hi>? but if you make so slight of those proofs, how will you prove from the Fathers either the baptisme of Infants, or the necessity of Ministers or the precedency of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop, which you hold but by those which here you call <hi>scraps out of these Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="40">40. Your next argument page 248. is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble untruth, set down by a fore-head of brass; you might as well have out-brav'd the loyal subjects of his most excellent Majesty, in time of the rebellion, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the tradition of the greater part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was against him, and his title, what man in his right wits would have had the confidence to utter so loud a falshood, without any proof at all, if there be any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual tradition receiv'd as you affirm from generation to generation that the Papal viccar-ship or soveraignty is an innovation or usurpation, and that the Catholick Church hath bin many hundred years without it, as known and notorious, as that the <hi>Turks</hi> believe in <hi>Mahomet</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent of histories; and Travelers shew this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from the year 300 to the year 600 to have bin as notoriously known and credited, as it is that the <hi>Turks</hi> believe in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which if you cannot do, all the world will see you are one of the most insufferable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facers of truth and assertors of open falshood, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet set pen to paper; and if you do it, I'le leave the papacy. But see you not what an obligation you have now brought upon your self by your confidence of proving what you have hitherto denyed, you had any obligation to prove, you seem not to understand what tradition from generation to generation is, nominate to me any one profession of Christians which held the Popes sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:49965:228"/>
as it is proposed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be an usurpation, and I here oblige my self to shew the time since Christ, when that profession was not in the Chrstian world, as cleerly as you can shew, when the prosession of the <hi>Turks</hi> in the belief of the <hi>Mahomets</hi> doctrine, was not in those Nations wherein it is now when the profession it self was not, how could it have any tradition?</p>
               <p n="41">41. Page 249, 250, 251. Is first spent in five non-proofs, let them be prov'd in your next; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Indians, Persians, &amp;c.

Now if I can prove (as I have proved) that any one extra-imperial Church was subject to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and you cannot shew some evident reason, why that was subject, rather then all the rest, I convince by that the subjection of all; now it is evident that both the Churches of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France, Brittaine</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> even when divided from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, were as subject to the sea of <hi>Rome</hi> as were those which remain'd united to the Empire.

And in his Epistles themselves, even in those he writ in time of this controversie with <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he gives most evident proofs of it.

And hence also appears the difference betwixt the title of universal, and the thing it self, controverted betwixt you and me, which you would have signified by that title of having care and power committed to one from Christ over the whole Church; this second (sayes St. <hi>Gregory</hi>) St. <hi>Peter</hi> had, but not the first: and this difference appears yet more evidently, for the holy Pope instances also in the high Priest in <hi>Moses</hi> Law, as you acknowledge page 265. who, as all men know, had not only precedency of place, but real power and authority over the whole Church of the Jews; and yet (sayes he) was not call'd universal. Now this being St. <hi>Gregories</hi> doctrine in relation to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and our Saviour having subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Church under the care and providence of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as supream visible Governour in his place, after his Ascention into Heaven, it will follow that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour judged this government alwayes necessary for his Church: for the very same reason, which made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in the Apostles time, evince it to be necessary in all succeeding ages: this government therefore was to be perpetuated in his Church, and seeing it was fix'd upon St. <hi>Peter</hi> by our Saviour, it must fall upon St. <hi>Peters</hi> lawful successors, after his death, and seeing none can claim that succession save the supream Bishop (for he of <hi>Antioch</hi> succeeded him in his life time, and therefore could not have that soveraign power derived to him, for St. <hi>Peter</hi> retained that as long as he lived, as all acknowledge) none save the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> can claim the care of the universal Church committed to
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:49965:234"/>
him by vertue of Christs institution; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he, and he only is the ordinary supream visible Governour of the whole Church of Christ, in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

               <p n="47">47. Thus you first cite authors against us, and then accuse them of vanities and falsity, when those very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which you cite for your self, make against you; the question is not what is, or is not, now extant in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> or wherein St. <hi>Gregory</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his sayings, but whether St. <hi>Gregory</hi> affirms that this title was offer'd him in that Council as you confess,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:49965:235"/>
(by citing his words) he does: and is it fit for so mean a worm as you are, to make this most honourable and holy Pope, the Apostle of our Nation to be a <hi>bragger,</hi> when he relates what pass'd in general Councils? But now let us see a piece of your skill in History, first you say the title was writ by two. Now <hi>Blundel</hi> p. 452. acknowledges there was four, and <hi>Barron. ad an.</hi> 451. <hi>num.</hi> 32. sayes they were <hi>varii clerici &amp; alii Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drini</hi>; then say you these two were <hi>Deacons. Blundel</hi> sayes no such matter, but that they were particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and <hi>Barronius</hi> that they were, <hi>clerici,</hi> and others. Next you add they had no votes in the Council: what wonder's that, when they did not so much as sit in it? You say the names of those who compos'd those bills, <hi>libellos,</hi> against <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> were <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Ischi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> who as they were only those who offer'd them to the Council, in the names of their Authors, the bills being compos'd by others; as well as by them, after his you call those writings <hi>libels,</hi> on purpose to disgrace them, (as it may seem) for though they be called <hi>libelli,</hi> that is, little writings in Latin, yet the word <hi>libels</hi> in English is alwayes taken in a bad sence, and signifies a a false, seditious, infamous pamphlet; but this you thought a fitter name for them because they had a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription containing the title of universal Patriarch given to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> never considering what a disgrace you put upon that holy Council, by making it a favourer and receiver of <hi>libels,</hi> but suppose St. <hi>Greg.</hi> had had no other ground of his so constant affirmation, that the title of universal Patriarch offer'd him by those Clerks of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> read publickly and no way disallowed by any one in the Council, when it concern'd them so much <hi>(ut supra;)</hi> yet this very thing convinces that he thought such a <hi>

<pb n="465" facs="tcp:49965:235"/>
was sufficient to affirm, it was offer'd him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Council, but <hi>per consilium,</hi> by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Next page 254. You shew your skill in Grammar, and argue that if the thing were due, signified by the title of universal, the name was also due, never reflecting that one word may be taken in divers senses, whereof one may agree with one particular thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and not the other. Thus <hi>Tyrannus</hi> signified a King in the ancient signification, but now a Tyrant only, thus Minister in Latin, signifies both a Minister and a servant &amp;c. Nay you your self confess (and that is one of your contradictions) that the Council offered it not to him in that sense wherein it signifies an vniversal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Church, but in an other, now because this word beside the moderate signification, in which the Council offer'd it, is capable of another most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and ante-Christian sense, (as I have declared) St. <hi>Gregory</hi> thought it undue and unfit to be accepted, because he esteemed himself oblig'd to avoid all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil, and never accept of any title which was apt to breed publick scandal in the Church.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Your next work is pag. 255. to confound those two significations of this word, or the thing it self, for that which is to be debated betwixt us, is not what St. <hi>Gregory</hi> judged to be the thing signified, by this word, for that was most wicked, and unchristian, but the being the supream visible governour of Christs Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church, yet so that inferiour Bishops and Pastours, are true governours also, each of his portion, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate officers, and Vice-gerents of Christ, receiving their original power from him, and not from the Pope, which may also be signified by the word <hi>universal</hi>; Now you shift cunningly from this second, to the first, and thereby work a confusion in your whole discourse, and deceive your reader, you take it in the first bad sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:49965:236"/>
or the unchristian thing signified by it (as St. <hi>Greg.</hi> understood it; pag. 254. &amp; then say it is plain, that it is the thing as well as the name, that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> wrote against, but that is not the thing now debated betwixt us, but that which St. <hi>Greg.</hi> took to be signifyed by that word, which we disallow asmuch as he did, or you can do.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Page. 255. num. 2. You equivocate againe about the taking away Episcopacie, by that title; for we affirm not that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> thought or <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> either, to expel all Bishops directly &amp; crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Church, as you and your zealous brethren lately did out of the English Hierarchy. But that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they remain'd still in the possession of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer titles, and office of Bishops, yet in effect according to the malignancie of this proud title, St. <hi>Gregory</hi> thought the virtue and proper force of Episcopacie to be ennervated, that is, that whosoever made himself univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Bishop, made himself Bishop of every particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess, in the Church in <hi>capite,</hi> and thereby the rest who were possest of those Diocesses held their titles as from him, as his vicars a moveable at pleasure, by him as it were his servants or officers. And though happily <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> penetrated not so deep into the malignancy of this title, Yet St. <hi>Gregory</hi> might suppose he did; or fear he would do, &amp; therefore would not permit so dangerous a title in the Church, by force whereof one might lay a claim so obnoxius to, and destructive of Ecclesiastial Hierarchy and this is that which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> signifies, that <hi>Iohn</hi> by force of that title would subjugate all Christs members to himself, that is, make them his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and vicars, holding their Original powers from him, and not immediatly from Christ. Now to say as you adjoyn, that this is the very form of Popery, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but either your calumnie or want of true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:49965:236"/>
of our doctrine, wherewith you ought to have bin furnished, before you had taken to write so bitterly against us. We subject no Bishop according to his Episcopal power of ordination, or original power of jurisdiction in his Diocess to the Pope; no more then are the Collonels or Captaines of an Army, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve their Patents and Commissions immediately from the King, subject to the general in order to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective commands, but are as truly Officers of the King, as the general is; nor can the General displace any of them at his pleasure, as the King can do, though he has power to command them upon the Kings service, or to correct, punish or displace them, when they give suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause; for that is also belonging to the Kings service; Now you had not consideration enough, to see this difference, t'was not (some will say) for want of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Now if we take the word universal in the malignant signification, it will follow that if such an universal Bishop fall, the Church falls with him, because there will be no other true Pastour to maintain her in the truth, through the whole Church, the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not absolute pastours, but his Officers.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Page 257. Is spent in reciting St. <hi>Gregories</hi> execrations against the title of universal, which touch'd not our controversie.</p>
               <p n="51">51. Page. 258. Whether your reply, or <hi>Bellar.</hi> answer, be more miserable, I leave to the Reader, he speaks of a Vicar to sinful man, and you answer tis no indignity to a Bishop to be a Vicar of Christ the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God: next you equivocate again num. 2. the question is not what <hi>Iohn</hi> thought, or pretended by that title, who can prove or disprove evidently what were his secret thoughts? but what St. <hi>Gregory</hi> expresses himself to judge of his pretences, either what he did
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:49965:237"/>
think, or probably speaking might be judged to think, by assuming that title. Now that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> thought such to be <hi>Iohns</hi> pretensions by that title is out of question.</p>
               <p n="52">52. Page 258.259. num. 3. You make Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> his exceed in censure of <hi>Iohns</hi> pretensions in assuming that title, and thereby take away all force from those very citations, which you cite against us, so strong a disputant are you against your self: why should you think groundless discourses should be of any force against your adversarie? nay you are so favourable to St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and so froward to St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> that you make the one pretend no farther, then to a precedency of place, before all other Bishops, which he had before in relation to all, save only the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> so that it was not in reallity a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of all the members of Christ to him, which he sought by that title, supposing that it included no more then a primacy of order, or precedency, but that he sought only by that title (having before precedency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the rest) to obtain precedencie before one more then he had, that is the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And for St. <hi>Gregory</hi> you make him an arrand lyer, for he sayes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himself nor any of his predecessours ever accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of that proud title, and yet (if it were no more but a supremacy of place before all &amp; not an universal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as you say here it was not) you your felf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he and all his predecessors (at least since the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>) accepted of it: nay you will make St. <hi>Gregory</hi> speak absurdly and ridiculously in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing so earnestly against <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> as a forerunner of Anti-Christ, a prophane person, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of Episcopal dignitie &amp;c. For having pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more then to take place of the Pope, whereas you say here, the Pope had then no rite to, nor possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:49965:237"/>
in that precedency of place, but only striv'd for it: and why then might not <hi>Iohn</hi> strive also, for't against him without blasphemy or Anti-Christanism?</p>
               <p>What say you of the Greeks refusing to have the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal government of the Church, I have above confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, out of <hi>Hieremius</hi> against the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>

               <p n="53">53. Page 259. The text you urge proves no more then the former, and shews the truth of my answer: the like is of page 260. That title as subjecting all Christs members, to one, as their universal Bishop, as though they had no other Bishop, nor true Pastour but him, is as manifestly against Christ, as if a General, should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all the souldiers and Officers under him, as if he were their sole commander by immediate commission from the King, and the rest by commission from him would be against the King.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Page 261. The words you urge do manifestly illustrate my interpretation of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> when he sayes, <hi>Et solus omnibus praeesse videretur</hi>: for in our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion it is not true that the Pope, <hi>solus omnibus praeest</hi> is <hi>alone</hi> above all, for all Christians, have some other above them then the Pope, as he is supream governour of the Church. <hi>videlicet,</hi> their respective Bishops and Pastours, but in the sense St. <hi>Gregory</hi> speakes of, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Bishop only is above all, there being no others but such as have their authority from him, and govern as his Officers in his place, and by his authority.</p>
               <p n="55">55. Page 261. Your first reply to <hi>Bellarm.</hi> is now answer'd, t'was but two Deacons, three leaves of, and now tis two or three, they'l increase in time like <hi>Falstafs</hi> blades in buckerome. The Fathers of the Council cal'd him not only head, or head-Bishop, as <hi>London</hi> is cal'd the head City, but they cal'd him <hi>their</hi> head: and themselves the members of that body; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:49965:238"/>
he was head, and said that he governed them as the head governs the members. <hi>Tu sicut caput Membris prae eras (ut supra)</hi> To number the third p. 262. t'was first two, then on the other side of the leaf it increased to two or three Deacons, who offer'd St. <hi>Leo</hi> this title, and without the Councils approbation, and on this side, it is the whole Council, according to St. <hi>Gregory</hi> whose words you cite against us (and therefore must esteem them true) which consisted of thrice 200 Bishops, <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stafs</hi> bounce buckerome was nothing to this increase. Next, you fall into a fallacie <hi>ex insufficiente enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one partium.</hi> It was neither in the sense [now expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated] he thought it was offered by the Council, nor as he was <hi>Episcopus primae sedis,</hi> Bishop of the first sea, in your sense, <hi>i. e.</hi> The first in place, order, or prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency only, but as it signified the supream Bishop, who governed all other Bishops, though they were as true, and proper governours of their respective flocks, as he was of his, which immediate power and commission from our Saviour, as Colonels and Captaines are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by their General. To num. 3. Nor have to this day any Roman Bishop incerted this name of <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> into their titles, as the Bishops of <hi>Constantinople</hi> doe, But contrary wise, ever since this proud title was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by the Bishops of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> have inserted this humble title into theirs, of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi servorum Dei,</hi> Servant of the servants of God, as may be seen in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Epistles, written after that time, to which is prefixed by him, that humble title, <hi>Gregorius servus servorum Dei.</hi> But if it signified no more then that the Roman Bishop is the first in place before all others, why might he not use it, seeing you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be his due, you can give me no other reason for this, then because the word universal is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:49965:238"/>
of a worse, signification, and therefore to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is the very reason I give you, why St. <hi>Gregory</hi> both refused it and inveighed so much against it.</p>
               <p n="56">56. How the rest of the Apostles had the care of the whole Church, you oppose <hi>Bellar.</hi> p. 262. sect. 2. To your first answer I have now replyed. To your n. 2. No man questions St. <hi>Peters</hi> being a member of Christs Church under Christ the head, but so is every Bishop a member of the Church, which hinders not their being true Governours, and visible heads of their respective Diocesses; so was the high Priest amongst the Jews, a member of the Church, next under God the absolute chief head, yet was withal indued with the power of governing visibly the whole Jewish Church as all grant.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Pag. 262. But see you not into what bryars you have cast your self, if you follow the ordinary Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; read it as you do thus, <hi>certe Petrus Apostolus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum membrum sanctae &amp; universalis Ecclesiae est. Peter</hi> the Apostle is the first member of the holy &amp; universal Church. You establish St. <hi>Peters</hi> supremacy, for what is <hi>primum membrum sanctae &amp; universalis Ecclesiae?</hi> is it in place only, then the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> as St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> successors have their precedency in place from him, and not conferr'd upon them by the Fathers, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes the main ground of your novelty; you cannot therefore say it is a naked precedency in place, it must therefore have been a primacy over the whole Church in government, as was that of the other Apostles in their singular jurisdictions, yet was he not to be stiled absolutely head of the whole Church, for the reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove declar'd. But if you follow the lection of Mr. <hi>Iames</hi> (whom I credit as much as you do Mr. <hi>Ross</hi>) you will make a fair piece of non-sence of St. <hi>Gregories</hi>

               <p n="58">58. To your third numb. pag. 263. you are sore pinch'd to find an answer to the Popes being intituled <hi>Episcopus universalis Ecclesiae,</hi> Bishop of the universal Church, could you think it would satisfie any rational man, to say that this title imported no more, then what may be, and ought to be given to every Bishop, <hi>who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the common Communion, &amp; was a Catholick,</hi> to wit, that <hi>he was a Bishop of the Catholick Church?</hi> can you be so ignorant as not to know this and the like titles were given him as signal declaratives of his place &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whereby he was both distinguish'd and preferr'd before all other Bishops and Patriarchs, neither of which could be done, had <hi>Episcopus universalis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi> signified no more then that he was <hi>a Bishop,</hi> that is, to be accounted amongst the Bishops of the universal Church; for this was common to him with all other Bishops thorough the whole Church. And I pray you tell me in good earnest, when any one should have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled his letter to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> v. g. thus, <hi>Leoni Episcopo universalis Ecclesiae,</hi> to <hi>Leo</hi> a Bishop of the Catholick Church; would it not have been profoundly ridiculous, for seeing there might have been some other Catholick Bishops call'd <hi>Leo,</hi> as well as the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who could know to whom this letter was written, by vertue of that title? but that it may appear evidently how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous this your <hi>effugium</hi> is: several Epistles of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> intituled with his own hand will sufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it, Saint <hi>Leo</hi> Epist. 97. intitles his Epist. thus, <hi>Leo Romae &amp; universalis Catholicaeque Ecclesiae Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>: would you translate these words thus, <hi>Leo a Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and of the universal and Catholique Church.</hi>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:49965:240"/>
I pray you how many Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> were there at that time beside <hi>Leo</hi>? Or sees not every one who sees any thing that they must be thus render'd into English, <hi>Leo Bishop of Rome, and of the universal and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church.</hi> Now this evinces that as he was in power and jurisdiction Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> so was he also Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the universal and Catholique Church in power and jurisdiction, for otherwise the sentence will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous and equivocal. In the like manner, ep. 13. he intitles himself, <hi>Leo Catholicae Romanae Ecclesiae Episcopus, Leo</hi> the Bishop of the Catholique Roman Church. Now who sees not both that this must be in authority and government, and that the appellation of the Roman Catholique Church is of 12. hundred years standing, Ep. 42. he writes himself thus, <hi>Leo Catholicae Ecclesiae Episcopus,</hi> now had that imported no more then this, <hi>Leo a Bishop of the Catholick Church</hi>; who could have known who writ this Epistle? ep. 88. he gives himself this title, <hi>Leo Romanae Ecclesiae &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicae sedis Episcopus; Leo Bishop of the Roman Church, and Apostolique Sea.</hi> Now seeing he takes the Roman Church, for the same with the Catholique Church (as we have now seen) it imports thus much, <hi>Leo</hi> Bishop of the Roman or Catholique Church, &amp; of the Apostolical Sea, for had he meant only the particular Roman Church, by <hi>Romanae Ecclesiae,</hi> he had committed a tautology, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adding presently, <hi>&amp; Apostolicae sedis,</hi> for that design'd the <hi>particular Church of Rome.</hi> Now seeing he was by power of government Bishop of the Apostolique Sea, either he must speak equivocally and absonously, or sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie by those words that he was by power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also Bishop of the Roman Catholique Church, ep. 54. thus, <hi>Leo Episcopus Romanae &amp; universalis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae, Leo</hi> Bishop of the Roman and universal Church,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:49965:240"/>
ep. 62. <hi>Leo Catholicae Ecclesiae Episcopus, Leo</hi> Bishop of the Catholique Church; by all this appears the truth of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> illation from this title, against your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and jejune gloss upon the title of <hi>universalis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae Episcopus,</hi> for in effect it comprehends all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which we ascribe to the Roman Bishop over the Church, and as much, nay much more then you would have signified by the title of the universal Bishop, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to this title in its genuine signification, are others of the like nature given to the Popes, by the ancient Fathers. Thus writes St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> ep. 81. <hi>Ad Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricium Papam, Recognovimus literis sanctitatis tuae, boni pastoris excubias, quam fideliter tibi commissam januam serves, &amp; pia solicitudine Christi ovile custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias; we discover by your Holiness letters, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of a good Pastor, how faithfully you keep the door committed to you, and with how holy a care you preserve the fold of Christ.</hi> And again, in 1. <hi>ad Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Domus Dei est Ecclesia, cujus hodie Rector est Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the house of God is the Church, the Governor whereof is Damasus</hi>; who was then the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> (as we have already seen.) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Ed. Binnii</hi> p. 141. The Popes Legates in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> intitle <hi>Leo, Caput universalis Ecclesiae,</hi> head of the universal Church. Now to imbroyle the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie and cast a slurre upon <hi>Bellar.</hi> you put St. <hi>Greg.</hi> at odds with him, and then ask which of those two is the wiser? whereas <hi>Bell.</hi> promises first a distinction of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:49965:241"/>
two different significations of <hi>universalis Episcopus,</hi> universal Bishops. In the one he accords with St <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> that the said title is prophane, sacrilegious, and Anti-christian, and proves that St. <hi>Greg.</hi> took the words in that sence, when he inveighed so highly against them, and never asserts that <hi>Episcopus universalis,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that prophane sence, and <hi>Episcopus universalis Ecclesiae,</hi> are of the same force. Then he accommodates (as you your self do) though another way another sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification to those words, universal Bishop, wherein they were taken in the bills directed to St. <hi>Leo,</hi> in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> for neither would the Council have permitted, nor those Catholiques and Clericks have ascribed a prophane, sacrilegious and Anti-christian ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to Pope <hi>Leo</hi>: and it appears that as they took the word <hi>universal,</hi> it had no more of the prophane, &amp;c. in it as applyed to St. <hi>Leo,</hi> then it had as apply'd to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> for to both of them they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <hi>universal,</hi> as therefore the Council was truly <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> in a most Catholique sence, without any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to other Bishops, or the Hierarchy of the Church: in the like sence did they understand <hi>Pope Leo</hi> to be <hi>universal Archbishop,</hi> his universal jurisdiction, suiting as well with the compleat authority of all other Bishops, as did that of the Council; for though the Council was truly universal in jurisdiction over the whole Church, (as I have proved) yet that notwithstanding, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Bishops became no substitutes, Vicars or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to those of the Council, but still remain'd absolute Officers of Christ, and true Pastours, Bishops, &amp; Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors in place of Christ, in their respective districts, &amp;c. In like manner the Popes being universal, in jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, took not away any part of the full power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of other Bishops, but consisted together with it,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:49965:241"/>
as did the universal jurisdiction, of the Council, Now in this second and Catholick sense only <hi>Bellar.</hi> affirms that <hi>universal Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Bishop of universal</hi> Church, are the same in sense wherein there is no debate between him and St. <hi>Gregory.</hi> Thus you cunningly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude your Readers, by casting such confused mists as these before their eyes.</p>
               <p n="59">59. By this the weakness of what you say next, p. 264. is clearly discover'd, where you vent rather your passion, then speak reason against <hi>Bellar.</hi> for who can doubt but St. <hi>Gregory</hi> had ground enough to execrate as he did that title, when it was so obnoxious in it self to prophaness, &amp;c. And pretended by a person of so ambitious a spirit, as was that <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that he was in danger to make the worse use of it, for his own advantage. Thus though <hi>Christotocos</hi> be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a true and Catholick sense, yet because it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so capable and obnoxius (since <hi>Nestorius</hi> his heresie) to be taken in an heretical signification, the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade it as sacrilegious and prophane, and much more as it was then used by <hi>Nestorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="60">60. In your answer to <hi>Bellar.</hi> second reason; p. 264. you abuse both him and St. <hi>Gregory. Bell.</hi> sayes the title of universal was not due to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> in neither of the two senses now delivered which you conceal and therefore was absolutely prophane and sacrilegious, as applied to him in any sense whatsoever, and yet even St. <hi>Gregory</hi> himself refus'd it, as prophane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though in some sense it might be due to him to beat down the pride of <hi>Iohn</hi>; you abuse St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in saying p. 265. <hi>That he approv'd that title for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> or that <hi>Bell.</hi> affirms, <hi>he approved of it as for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> neither of them say any such matter: prove they do. Know you not that, <hi>Malum ex quocunque defectu,</hi>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:49965:242"/>
that every defect makes a thing evil, seeing therefore there was a defect of a prophane signification, and scandal in the title of <hi>universal,</hi> for that defect he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it evil, and absolutely disallowed of it, nor could the capacity of that word, to be taken in a more moderate sense, prevail with him to approve of it, <hi>quia malum ex quocunque defectu,</hi> the other defect had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it, nor sayes <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that he approved it even for himself, but that <hi>in some sence it agreed with him,</hi> yet the danger of scandal in accepting a title, so subject to bear a prophane sense, deterr'd him from approving of it even for himself, as knowing the curse which lyes upon those which give scandal to their weak brethren, and that Christians are to avoy'd all appearance of evil.</p>
               <p n="61">61. In your last clause of this paragraph, you fall again into your old fallacie, proceeding <hi>a notione se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda, ad primam,</hi> from the titles which hath two signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, to the thing controverted, which corresponds but to one of those significations I have proved though St. <hi>Greg.</hi> disallowed of that scandalous title, yet both he and his predecessors, allwaies admitted of an universal Soveraignty as it was explicated above: most untrue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is your illation, that <hi>it sprung up since St.</hi> Greg. <hi>dayes</hi> your next citation out of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> confirmes what I have now said: he thought the title of universal, by reason of the scandal comprized in it, absolutely to be refus'd by all good Prelats. And so does the rest that followes out of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> page 266. only in these words, <hi>sed quoad in me correptione despicior, restat ut ecclesiam debeam adhibere.</hi> I note these particulars, 1. you miscite St. <hi>Gregories</hi> words, and thereby make them both non-sense, and bald Latin, it should not be (as you have it) <hi>sed quoad</hi> but <hi>sed quia,</hi> thus I find it in two different editions of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> the one anno.

1564. <hi>Basiliae,</hi> and the other 1572. <hi>Antwerpiae,</hi> both which have it <hi>quia,</hi> nor ever found I it printed or cited otherwise, till I read in your book: now, what sense is this, <hi>but until I am despis'd in my correction, it remaines that I use the Church,</hi> that is, I must lay the Churches censures upon you, before you offend I must take them of, and who ever joyn'd a present tense of the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mood with a <hi>quoad,</hi> before you, for that is as much as to say <hi>until I am now despised</hi>; which makes the time present and future all one, and that, I think, is Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense: what think you of it? 2. you prove St. <hi>Gregory</hi> held the Churches authoritie to be greater then his own, by these words now treated. Now whatsoever St. <hi>Gregory</hi> held in this, is not of any concern now, but most certain it is, he neither did nor could prove it by these words; for this phrase, <hi>Ecclesiam debeam adhibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> I must use the Church, signifies no more then this, I must proceed according to the rigor of the Church ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and discipline in inflicting upon you the censures of the Church, that is, I must proceed no longer as a friend to intreat, exhort, and admonish you, as hitherto I have done, but as the chief Pastor of the Church, use the fulness of that authoritie which I have in the name and for the good of the Church, in casting you out of it, by the severity of excommunication: that this only is his meaning, is evident both by the precedent words, where he declares our Saviours doctrine about excommunication of obstinate offenders, and by the words immediately subsequent, where he affirms he must not prefer his person, though never so dear to him, before the institution of the Canons, &amp;c. Now when will you ever prove the consequence, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> threatned the use of censures of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:49965:243"/>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> Ergo, <hi>he took the Churches authority to be greater then his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="62">62. Now you come in good time, to prove your seventh argument. page 257. Which you draw from the confession of Papists. I distinguish your antecedent, if you mean Papists confess, that multitudes or the most part of Christians not univocally so call'd, have bin opposers, or no subjects of the Pope, I grant it <hi>if univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, so cal'd,</hi> I deny it; <hi>therefore by those testimonies there have bin visible Churches of such,</hi> I deny your consequence. To your first authority, from <hi>Eneas Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> I answer, he cannot mean, that so smal regard was had to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that it was not believed to be the head of all other Churches &amp;c. (as I have prov'd it was) unless you make him accuse the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> of Innovation, and of introducing a new government into the Church of God, which notwithstanding they supposed to have been ever before their time, for the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> cites the Sixth <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, as affirming that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had alwayes the Primacy, your answer to <hi>Bellar.</hi> is fallacious proceeding <hi>a parte,</hi>

                  <hi>ad totum, Bell.</hi> you acknowledge sayes he, it is partly true, and partly false, &amp; you subsume, <hi>but if true,</hi> which supposes <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to affirm that its <hi>wholly true,</hi> whereas you should have subsumed. but if <hi>partly true,</hi> as you alledge <hi>Bellar.</hi> to have said it was, and then you fall again into the same fallacy if <hi>it be false</hi> (say you) that is if the whole be false: whereas you should have said, if it be <hi>partly</hi> false, as <hi>Bellar.</hi> said it was. And had you thus proceeded can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, and logically in your subsupmtion your subsequel against our Historians authority had been Evacuated, for
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:49965:243"/>
very many good Authors may speak some things, which in part are true, and in part false; that is in some respect true, and in others false, they understanding what they writ in that respect wherein they are true.</p>
               <p n="63">63. Page 268. You mention first the Greeks in opposition to the Pope, recorded by our Historians, what then? <hi>Ergo</hi> by their testimony there have been visible Churches of such, that is of true univocal Christians, who opposed the Pope thats the thing to be proved; but to prove that, you must prove those historians to have held those schismatical Greeks to have bin univocal Christians which is necessary to compose a visible Church, this you have not done, then you cite <hi>Golestaldus</hi> but where the Lords knows) making mention of such as were under the Popes patriarchal power, and yet oppos'd him? but if that <hi>Golestaldus</hi> were truly ours, prove also that he held them: whilst they stood thus in opposition against the Pope, to be univocal Christians, thats your main work, and yet you do it not; but see you not how you first take such as you must acknowledge to be subjects to the Pope in spirituals resisting their true superiour, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his Patriarchal power, to be patrons of your cause, another seed of Rebellion; and then you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Emperours and Kings to be under the Popes patriarchal power, for many opposers of the Pope were such, I speak of an opposition in faith, and communion, not in civil oppositions, which may happen upon just occasions.</p>
               <p n="64">64. Page 268. Next I wonder to see you so abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably false in your translations; you your self page 251. cite <hi>Raynerius</hi> his words, <hi>non subsunt,</hi> which in my grammar signifies <hi>are not under,</hi> and yet you translate them here, <hi>were</hi> not under the Roman Church: is it not true now to say <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,

non subsunt, are not under the</hi> Roman Emperour, must it therefore be true <hi>they were not under it.</hi>

               <p n="65">65 <hi>Ibid.

But you relapse again into your accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med falsitie in translation, which would have appeared, had you printed <hi>Canus</hi> his Latin words (thus you make Authors speak in what language you please, English or Latin, as it best serves your turne and covers your falsitie,) <hi>Canus</hi> sayes there, <hi>ab aliis plerisque totius or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Episcopis,</hi> which you translate thus, <hi>but almost all the rest of the Bishops of the whole world:</hi> so that <hi>alii ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique, very many others,</hi> is with you, <hi>almost all the rest,</hi> had you only said a <hi>great sort,</hi> or the <hi>most part,</hi> even that had bin to stretch the word, <hi>plerique</hi> to its full length; but to translate it <hi>almost all</hi> is too too bad, and cryes shame of the translator, <hi>for,</hi> by this meanes you would perswade your Reader, that scarce any Bishop at all adher'd to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Author, whereas he in the beginning of this

seventh Chapter saith that not only the Bishops, but <hi>Ecclesia</hi> the Church from the time of the Apostles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes acknowledg'd that the Roman Bishops succeeded place, Faith and authority of St <hi>Peter</hi>; and that all Catholicks respected his judgement, in the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of Religion; and this is most cleer and evident, but yet this is not all your <hi>foul play.</hi> You had undertook to prove, Papists affirm that univocal Christians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing visible Churches, have bin opposers of the Pope, And here you seem'd to have cull'd out a text for your pupose, for <hi>Canus</hi> acknowledges in this place, that a very great number of Bishops, and the greater number of Churches, were against the Pope, and who could he suppose these to be but true Catholick Bishops and Churches? here you think, you have your Reader sure, but why cited you not these words, the next following? O that would have marr'd your market. <hi>Canus</hi> is so farr from holding these mutineering Bishops and Churches to be true univocal Christians, that he affirms expresly they were either Schismaticks or Hereticks. <hi>Quinimo qui à Romanâ quidem sede defecerunt, hi Schismatici semper ab ecclesia sunt habiti; qui vero hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus sedis de fide judicia detrectarunt, heretici.</hi> But those (sayes) <hi>Canus</hi> who made a defection from the Roman Sea, were alwaies accounted Schismaticks by the Church, and those who refused to stand to the judgement of this Sea in matters of faith were esteemed Hereticks, these are fair characters of your great sincerity: If you should reply, though <hi>Canus</hi> account them not univocal Christians, nor true Churches, who made those oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, yet them not to be no true Churches, nor no univocal Christians. I reply, it makes thus much at least, that <hi>Canus</hi> his testimony, proves not that any true Catholick Christians, or Churches, withstood the Pope,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:49965:245"/>
for the proof whereof you cited this his testimony.</p>

               <p n="67">67. Page 271. Your ninth argument halts of the same leg, it follows, not, that though our Church as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal had no successive visibilitie, that the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

the Protestants are members had ever since Christs time on earth a successive visibility, when you have proved this consequence, which you do not so much as mention in your argument: I oblige my self to answer every one of your instances, till that be done, all I am obliged to do by force of logical forme, is to omit your antecedent as nothing to our purpose, for you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not in this second part to disprove ours, but to prove your own perpetual visibility, and I deny again your consequence, which you ought to draw logically from your antecedent, to wit, that it follows not from this argument that the Church whereof the Protestant: are members, hath bin visible ever since the dayes of Christ on earth.</p>

You promis'd in the beginning a fair logical answer, keep your word and turne not opponent, whil'st
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:49965:246"/>
you are to be respondent, stick to something, otherwise you confound all, and render it impossible to draw any controversie to a period; or open a passage to truth: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit your self of your present obligation, prove your said consequence: that accomplished, when your instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come into logical course, I here oblige my self again to answer every one of them: but first let us dispatch this; shew your consequence undertaken here, of the perpetual visibility of the Protestant Church to follow from the want of perpetual visibilitie in the Roman, no more then your perpetual visibility, follows from the want of it, in the Greek, or Abissme Church, what if neither of them have bin perpetually visible? For there is no Heretick in the world, no neither <hi>Arrian</hi> or <hi>Sabellian</hi> &amp;c. (whom you hold no Christians) which may not argue in the same manner against us, as you do p. 242. were they to prove the succession of their Church as you do of yours; what would you have us answer but deny the consequence, for it will never follow, because we have not bin, that <hi>Arrians</hi> have bin perpetually vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Nay should he argue thus against you; Protestants have not bin perpetually visible, <hi>Ergo, Arrians</hi> have bin, might you not omitting his antecedent, deny his consequence, judge therefore by your own cause, and prove your consequence, nay should we argue thus against you Protestants <hi>qua tales</hi> have not bin perpetualy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church whereof Papists are members hath bin perpetually visible, might you deny our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence? the reason why this consequence is denyed by all true Christians is this, because ours not being perpetually visible, confers nothing to your being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually visible, no more then <hi>Cayphas</hi> his not being a good Priest, made <hi>Annas</hi> to be a good one.</p>
               <p>And as little followes it, that <hi>though multitudes of

Suppose therefore (<hi>ex supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione impossibili</hi>) that the Roman Church had not bin alwaies visible, thence will not follow that the Church whereof Protestants are members, has bin alwaies vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, this only will follow, that neither it, nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants is the true Church. I press you therefore once more to prove your consequence, and till that be prov'd I am free from all obligation of answering to the proof of your antecedent, for no man according to logical form is oblig'd to answer the proofs of any proposition, which is neither denied, nor distinguished by the res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent, but purely omitted.</p>

Where the Apostle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any distinction or exception, intends the denial of communion through the whole Church (for he gives a general precept to all Christians) to all those who teach contrarie to the doctrine of Christ. And this not as to others scandalous sinners, lest they should draw others to sin by their bad example, but as to Hereticks, for no other crime then their maintaining a doctrine contrary to the doctrine of Christ, and that in what point soever it be, for he speaks in general of all doctrine contrary to that of Christ. Now since all profess'd Hereticks, properly so call'd, teach contrary to Christs doctrine in some point or other, they are all to be avoided, and deny communion thorough the whole Church &amp; consequently are out of the whole Churches communion, and so out of the Catholique Church. This is proved from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities both of the ancient fathers, later Doctors and Protestant Authors, which are cited and confirm'd at large in <hi>schism unmask'd,</hi> in a late conference with Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

                  <hi>Gunning</hi> and Doctor <hi>Pierson,</hi> from p. 131. to p. 188. where the very definition of schism and heresie, of schismaticks and heretiques make it most manifest, that no profess'd heretick or schismatick properly so call'd, can so long as they remain in that state, be true parts of the Catholique Church. These following I cite for a brief confirmation of this truth. St. <hi>Aug. de fide &amp; symbolo c.</hi> 10. <hi>quapropter nec hereticus pertinet ad Ecclesiam Catholicam, quoniam diligit Deum, nec schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus quoniam diligit proximum,</hi> wherefore neither doth an heretick belong to the Catholick Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she (the Church) loves God, nor a schismatick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she loves her neighbour. And <hi>Optatus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cont.

                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:49965:257"/>75. I have at large deduc'd the reason of this truth against you in my answer to your first part. The sum whereof is this, that whosoever disbelieves any divine truth, sufficiently propounded to him as such, disbelieves the infallible truth of Gods word, and consequently evacuates the formal object of Christian faith, &amp; thereby destroyes faith, which cannot subsist without its formal object, and by that destroyes Christianity (in so much as in him lyes) and consequently Gods Church, nay, and God himself; whence also follows that such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer hath no supernatural faith at all of any other articles which he believes, but a meer humane, natural, and fallible assent to them, for he cannot assent to any of them, because they are reveal'd by Gods infallible authority, for he hath made that fallible in disbelieving something which is sufficiently notified to him, to be revealed from God. Now if he have no true faith, he can neither have salvation, nor be a member of Christs true Church, which is directly destructive of your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.</p>
               <p>That which has deceiv'd you, and such as follow you in this, is, that you make your whole reflection upon the material object of faith, which considered alone, is as a dead carcass in respect of true Christian faith, seeing it wants the soul and life of it, the infallible authority of God revealing it; and though hereticks perversely perswade and delude themselves, they assent for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority of God, to such articles as they believe, yet seeing we now suppose there is no defect in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of such articles as they believe not, that they are reveal'd from God, they being propos'd to them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with other articles which they believe, in reallity there is no other cause of their disbelief, then that they attribute not an infallible authority to God, revealing
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:49965:257"/>
the said articles which they disbelieve. Now if he be fallible in one, he is infallible in nothing, for his erring in one, supposes him subject to error, which is to be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. And as faith is wanting, so is external commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion also to every profest heretick and schismatick, as we have seen, nor will the communion of one heretick or schismatick with another serve the turn, as St. <hi>Aug.</hi> cited by your self delivers, <hi>l. de unitate Eccles. c.</hi> 4. That such as communicate with a part, and not with the whole wheresoever it is diffused, it is manifest they are not in the Catholick Church. Now suppose, one singular person turn a professed heretick or schismatick, and leaves the external communion of the whole Church, he can have no external communion at all; if then he seduce to his party another, that other can have no communion but with the first, who had no communion with the Church; so that their communion is without the Church, and so will ever be, though they increase to thousands and millions.</p>
               <p>This truth therefore thus established, my first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment returns upon you; shew me said I, any Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Christians perpetually visible, besides that which acknowledges the Popes supremacy, &amp;c. This you have not been able to do, but by producing known and notorious heretical congregations, those I have proved not to be either one and the same congregation amongst themselves, (which I demanded) nor one with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick visible Church, because no profess'd hereticks properly so call'd, can be true members of the true Church. And particularly you fail in this second part; for till you prove Protestants to be no hereticks, you can never evince them to be true parts of Christs visible Church. Now therefore it remains that you begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and find out some new solution for my argument,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:49965:258"/>
for as yet you have brought nothing satisfactory to salve it: but I hope God will give you the grace, to desist from such imposible enterprises, strike you with a sweet stroak of mercy (as he did St. <hi>Paul</hi>) and change you into a child of his holy Church, which are the truest hearty desires of</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Your second Answer further proves, that your Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions signifie just nothing; they must live in the unity of the faith, that is, either with faith or without it; with a belief of what God hath revealed to be be believed, or without it; for to believe any point implicitly in your ordinary sense is not to believe it, but onely to believe one of the premises whence the conclusion must be inferr'd. But why do you not tell me what you mean (by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite faith?) faith is called implicite in several sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> 1. <hi>When several truths are actually understood and believed</hi> in confuso, <hi>or in grosse, in some one proposition which containeth the substance of them all; but not with accurate distinct conceptions, nor such as are ripe for any fit expression. This indistinct, immature, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect kind of apprehension, may be called implicite.</hi> 2. <hi>When a general proposition is believed as the matter of our faith, but the particulars are not understood or not believed. As to believe that</hi> omne Animal vivit, <hi>not knowing whether you be</hi> Animal <hi>or</hi> Cadaver; <hi>or to believe (all that is in Scripture is the word of God and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49965:261"/>
true) but not to know (what is in the Scripture.)</hi> 3. <hi>What is onely the formal object of faith, that is believed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out understanding the Material object. The first sort of these I confess is actual though indistinct; but I suppose you mean not this.</hi> 1. <hi>Because it is not the ordinary sense of your party.</hi> 2. <hi>Because else you damn either all the world, or most of your own professed party, at least as no members of the Church; for few or none have an actual understanding and belief of all that God ever revealed to them; because all men (or most at least) have been sinfully negligent in searching after, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving truth, and so are sinfully ignorant; no man knoweth all that God hath revealed, or that he ought to know.</hi> 3. <hi>Because by this rule it is impossible for you, or any man to know who is indeed a member of your Church; for you cannot know mens confused knowledge, or know that it extendeth to all revealed; for if you speak of all revealed in general, or in Scripture, you still damn all (or most in your own sense) for none, as I said, understand it all to a word; but if you speak of all which that particular man hath had sufficient means to know. It is then impossible for you to make a judgement of any mans faith by this, for you can never discern all the means (internal or external) that ever he had, much less can you discern whether his faith be commensurate to the truth so farre revealed; so that by this course you make your Church invisible, I pray tell me how you can avoid it.</hi>

                  <p>Your discourse about implicite faith seems strange; I require a proof from you, that in your ordinary sense, it is no belief at all. 2. That it is onely to believe one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49965:262"/>
of the premises whence the conclusion must be inferr'd. 3. Tell me why you require that I should have declared to you, what I meant by implicite faith, when you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that I speak in the ordinary sense of our school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and I could not but suppose you understood their doctrine. 4. Why do you put the belief of the formal object without the belief of the material object of faith, a third member of implicite belief; or who did ever so before you? 5. Why do you confound the two first members of your Distinction, both of them being knowledge or belief <hi>in confuso</hi>; your first is, <hi>when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral truths are actually understood and believed</hi> in confuso, <hi>or in gross, in some one proposition which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the substance of them all,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thus you.</hi> Your second is, <hi>to believe that</hi> omne animal vivit, <hi>not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether you be</hi> Animal <hi>or</hi> Cadaver, <hi>or to believe that all that is in Scripture is the word of God and true, but not to know what is in the Scripture, thus you.</hi> Now tell me, does not this proposition <hi>omne Animal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,</hi> contain the substance of these truths, <hi>Equus vivit, Leo vivit, Aquila vivit,</hi> &amp;c. so that by believing or knowing this proposition distinctly, <hi>omne Animal vivit,</hi> I believe or know in <hi>confuso,</hi> those other propositions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as <hi>species</hi> under their <hi>genus</hi> in it; and the like is of your second proposition, for believing all that is in Scripture is the word of God, and true expresly; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <hi>confuso,</hi> all that is in <hi>Genesis, Exodus, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticus,</hi> &amp;c. to be the word of God, and true; though I neither believe or know expresly and distinctly all that is contained in those books, can you deny this? If you proceed in Philosophical principles, is not the express knowledge of the <hi>genus</hi> a confused knowledge of <hi>species</hi> under it? and an express knowledge of the <hi>species,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused knowledge of the <hi>individua</hi> under it? and a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49965:262"/>
knowledge or belief (when they are known or believed) in <hi>confuso</hi>? Thus you give distinctions without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and examples to illustrate your distinctions which quite destroy them. 6. Why put you a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory proposition, you say thus; not knowing whether you (that is such a man) be <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Cadaver</hi>; now this is a plain implicancy in <hi>adjecto,</hi> for it is as impossible that you or any man should be a <hi>Cadaver,</hi> as that a man should be a barn door, the one being as truely disparate from a true man, as the other; and disparates you know cannot predicate the one of the other, every one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knows, who knows what a man is, that no man is or can be <hi>Cadaver,</hi> a dead ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>kass; so that no man can be ignorant, whether you be <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Cadaver.</hi> A little more heed to what you write, would do well when you dispute. 7. Why say you, you suppose I mean nor your first manner of implicite faith, when I and all who understand themselves, must either mean that or nothing. The object of implicite faith delivered in the Schools, being nothing else save particular truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in substance under some general proposition; so that though they be neither known, nor believed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, or expresly, yet they are known or believed in <hi>confuso,</hi> confusedly and implicitly, by the knowledge or belief of their general proposition. 8. Why miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you the notion of implicite faith; it is not, as you conceit, therefore no faith at all, of all the particulars in Scripture; because he who has it, understands not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly many truths contained in Scripture; for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian has implicite faith, because (such determinate truths being <hi>de facto</hi> contained in Scripture) by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that is contained therein, he believes confusedly or implicitly every one of the said truths, though he have not distinct knowledge of many of them. 9. But most
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49965:263"/>
of all I wonder, why you take my second answer in a quite other sense then I intended it; for your second question being this, <hi>whether I mean by faith, the belief of all that God hath revealed to be believed, or of part,</hi> &amp;c. My Answer is this, <hi>of all, either Explicitly, or Implicitly</hi>; that is, that those of the Catholick Church must believe all the very same Articles and points of faith; by an Explicite faith in order at least to some of them, and by an Implicite faith in order to the rest; so an explicite faith of some Articles is necessary to all who actually believe with a Divine faith; now you would make me say, as appears by your Reply, that implicite faith is sufficient in relation to all points of faith what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, as if I held it not necessary to believe any thing at all explicitly; for you press me thus, <hi>they must live in unity of the faith, that is either with faith, or without it; with a belief of what God hath revealed, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it</hi>; which inference you could never urge against me, if you had supposed me to hold that some explicite faith is alwayes necessary to salvation, in such as are capable of actual belief; for whilst they have explicite faith of some Articles, they can never be thought to be without faith; nor could you with reason, draw any such consequence from my speaking in this distributive sense, both because it is the ordinary sense of the Schools, where an explicite faith of some Articles is held necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to salvation, and because my Answer connaturally admits of that sense. And lastly because, though the words precisely in themselves were capable of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed sense, yet when words are of a doubtful meaning, no man with reason can bind his words to one deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate sense, but must leave the determination to him who framed the proposition. 10. But now let us try a while what will follow from your Doctrine of Implicite
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49965:263"/>
Faith, as that term is ordinarily understood by us, <hi>To believe any point in our ordinary sense (say you) is not to believe it</hi>; now our ordinary sense (as I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) is so to believe that point, that we have no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct or expresse knowledge of it; but onely a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed understanding, because it is contained <hi>in confuso,</hi> under this Proposition; I believe all that God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, or I believe all that is delivered to be believed in Canonical Scripture; Let us therefore settle this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of your Doctrine, whosoever believes all that God has revealed, or all that is in canonical Scripture, believes no one particular point contained confusedly in those Propositions, which he understands not with an actual understanding in particular to be revealed, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then as contained in those Propositions, this is your Doctrine; now I subsume, But no man knoweth all that God hath revealed; to wit, with that actual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of every particular, required by you immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before, as is above explicated, this <hi>minor</hi> is yours; <hi>Ergo</hi> say <hi>I,</hi> no man believes all that God hath revealed; now <hi>I</hi> proceed, if no man believe all that God has revealed, then you believe not all that God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, this is evident; then further, whosoever believs not all that God has revealed, is no good Christian, nor in state of Salvation; But you believe not all that God has revealed; <hi>Ergo</hi> you are no good Christian, nor in state of Salvation. See you not how fair a thred you have spun against your self; or will you say that he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not all which God hath revealed is a good Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, if you will you may; but sure if you doe so, no good Christian will believe you: and that you may see how far you are out, in asserting this, that one cannot truly believe what he understands not actually, and in particular, or no farther then as the particulars are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49965:264"/>
contained in that universal proposition, <hi>I believe all that God has revealed, or that is in Scripture</hi>; when you recite the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, wherein you professe to believe, that God is creator of <hi>all things visible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.</hi> I demand, do you truly believe as you professe to believe, when you say those words; if you do not, you make a profession against your own Conscience; if you do, then you may believe with an actual Belief, that he is Creator of many particular things both visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and invisible, whereof you have no actual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; or which are wholly unknown in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or distinctly to you, or by any other knowledge, then as confusedly contained in the word <hi>all</hi>; you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, and there professe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>all men shall rise at the last coming of Christ, and give an account of their works</hi>; and yet you have no actual knowledge of many thousands and millions of them: The like is of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he tells us all men are to stand before the Tribunal of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall we say that St. <hi>Paul</hi> believed not as he professed to believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.5, 14. <hi>Credens omnibus, quae in Lege &amp; Prophetis scripta sunt</hi>; yet cannot we suppose that he had then an actual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of every particular contained in them. II. And that you may see by instances how untrue your Assertion is, a Christian I suppose has by vincible or culpable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion forgot some grievous Sinne of his Life past, he comes to the point of Death, he is heartily sorrowfull, even for the pure love of God, for all his sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against the Law of God without any actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance or understanding of that forgotten sin, and so dyes; must not one say in your Principle, that such a Penitent had no actual sorrow for that forgotten sin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, because he had no actual understanding of it;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49965:264"/>
what horrid Doctrine would this be; the like is of one who forgives from his heart all Injuries done against him, but has no actual Remembrance of some of them; does he not therefore actually forgive even those which he has forgotten; a thousand like Examples might be brought, which I leave to your learned consideration, having been something with the longest in this Point, because I know it imports much to make a true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing betwixt us: 12. why are you so wavering and inconstant in your Propositions; first you say, <hi>that few or none have an actual understanding or belief of all that ever God revealed to them</hi>; and within three or four lines you say absolutely and without all exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <hi>no man knoweth all that God hath revealed:</hi> first you say <hi>all men, (or most at least) have been sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully negligent in searching after and receiving truth</hi>; and within a Line or two you leave out your Restriction, and say, <hi>no man knoweth all that God hath revealed, or that he ought to know.</hi> 13. I would know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why you first suppose your principle, that no man can believe all unlesse he actually knows all; and thence inferre against me, that in my Principles, who deny that of yours, I cannot know who is, who is not of my Church, because I cannot know what Reasons any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular have had to know more, or fewer divine Truths, or whether they have concurred with those Reasons or no, and so must make my Church invisible; now I make my Church visible, though by comprehending in it all those who professe an Explicite Faith in several Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which they understand distinctly, and an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Belief of the rest, whereof they have not distinct understanding; by professing that they believe all that God hath revealed to be believed by them, whatsoever they be in particular; now so long as they persevere in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49965:265"/>
this behalf, though they should happen through culpable negligence not arrive to the knowledge of many things which they ought to know <hi>necessitati praecepti,</hi> yet they remain members (though corrupt and wicked) of the Church, whereby you see how easily I avoid that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which you thought I could not.</p>

creatours, as appears above, and of all that God has revealed, and to confirm your assertion in this, you being a particular, an <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> saying <hi>an Animal</hi> may live, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is some particular Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; nor stay you here, but to amend the matter, you bring an instance of changeable things, to confirm a proof of things unchangeable; I, who now am, may cease to be in actual existencie; but whatsoever is once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from God, can never cease to be revealed, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a thing unrevealed; though therefore it follows not, that because <hi>omne Animal vivit,</hi> therefore I live actually; yet it follows, that whatsoever is once revealed of God, remains alwaies actually revealed.</p>

                     <hi>If the former be your sense, then Infidels or heathens may be of your Church, for a man may believe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral (that the Bible is the word of God and true) and

yet not know a word that is in it, and so not know that Christ is the Messias, or that ever there was such a Person.</hi>

                  <p>Your instance is morally impossible, for either such a person believes the Bible rashly and imprudently, and then (according to all Divines) his faith cannot be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and Divine, or sufficient to constitute him a Christian; or he believes it prudently, and then he must be moved by prudential motives of credibility, which must draw him to afford credit to that Authority as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from God, which commends to him the Bible, as the written word of God; now that can be no other then the Authority of the Catholick Church, which he cannot be ignorant, to profess the faith of Christ, there being no other save that; though therefore he knows not by experience that Christ is mentioned in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet he cannot but know that he is professed to be the Son of God, and Saviour of the world, by those of the Catholick Church, (who delivered the Bible to him, as the word of God) and that such a faith in him is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to salvation.</p>

                     <hi>But if somewhat be explicitly (that is actually) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the question that you would have answered was, (what is it?) for till that be known, no man can know a member of your Church by your discriptions.</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49965:266"/>
so often distinguish betwixt points of faith <hi>Essential</hi> and accidental, seeing you ought to understand the terms of your own distinction, as I could not but suppose you did, you had no need to be informed what points were to be believed by explicite faith; all Essentials in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are such.</p>
                  <p>Reply.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If you take (implicite) in the third sense, then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite faith is either Divine or humane; Divine, when the Divine veracity is the formal object; humane, when mans veracity is the formal object, which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, where the Testimonies are so conjunct; as that we are sure that it is God that speaks by man, who is therefore credible, because God infallibly guideth or inspireth him: that is at once to believe a humane and Divine veracity. If any of this be your meaning, that last question remains still to be resolved by you. A man may believe (that God is true) and that his Prophets and inspired messengers are true, and yet not understand a word of the message; so that still if this will serve, a man may be of your Church, that knoweth not that ever there was such a person as Iesus Christ, or that ever he died for our sins, or rose again, or that we shall rise.</hi>

                  <p>Your third member I have rejected before, as a stranger to implicite faith; but I think you speak not true Divinity when you say, that to believe God to be true, and his inspired Prophets to speak truth, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a humane and Divine veracity; for what Divine ever said before you, that Christian faith, which is to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49965:267"/>
believe God speaking by the Prophets, &amp;c. is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve so much, as partially a humain veracity: for that would make Christian faith partly humaine, which no Christian can affirm, it being a pure Theological virtue; and having no other formal object, save Divine vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city revealing: for though the Prophet be a humaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet he speakes when he is inspired by God, not with humain, but with Divine authority, God speaking by his mouth.</p>

fly to uncertain points, because of the diversity of means of informations; and say it must be so much every man as he had means to know, I again answer you.

Secondly, you still damn all your own, there being not a man that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that he hath meanes to know, because all have culpably neglected meanes: and so you have no Church.

                  <p>Truly (Sir) your demand is not so great a Bug-bear, to make me fly from it, for fear it devour me: you cannot but know in your perusal of our Divines that your question has bin answered by them an hundred times over, have you not heard them deliver in <hi>materia de fide,</hi> that trite distinction: that some points of faith are necessary to be believed explicitely, <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> and others, <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> and those of the first classe are absolutely necessary for all men, to be so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, to obtein salvation, and to become parts (at least in <hi>voto</hi> if they be not baptized of the Catholique Church,) and know you not that Divines are devided what are the points necessary to be believed explicitely, <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> some, and those the more ancient hold that the expli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49965:268"/>
that necessity, to be explicitely believed; now to answer your question, what it is whereby our Church members are known, I answer that. First, all those who are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised and believe all the points of our faith explicitely, (if any such persons be to be found) are undoubted members of our Church. Secondly, all those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve explicitely all the Articles, and whatsoever belongs to them in particular, by reason of their respective offices in the Church. Thirdly, those who so believe all things necessary, <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> or <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> extended to all <hi>adulti.</hi> Fourthly, all those who believe in that manner, all things held necessary: <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> according to the first oppinion of the more ancient Doctors. Fifthly, It is probable, though not altogether so certain as the former, that such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve explicitely the Diety: and that he is a rewarder of our works, and the rest implicitely, as conteined in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuso</hi> in that (Baptisme supposed) are parts of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church (now seeing all those who are conteined in my four first numbers (which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend almost all Christians) are certainly parts of the Catholique Church, we have a sufficient certainty of a determinate Church, consisting at least of these, by reason whereof our Church has a visible consistency: these of the fift rank though not so certain as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, take not away the certainty of the former, but that consistency supposed, Divines found a question amongst themselves, those of the first oppinion will answer that such as believe not the aforesaid Christian mysteries ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly are not parts of the Catholick Christian Church, though they believe the Deity remunerating, and the rest implicitely: see you not by this discourse that we answer sufficiently to your questions, by telling which are undoubted members of our Church, and thereby
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49965:268"/>
give a sufficient description of it; (and rendering it visible) by assigning those which are undoubted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, though in some others, without which it hath consistency, be controverted amongst us: in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course I suppose, that such as only believe the Diety, or some few of our misteries, are excused by invisible ignorance from the obligation of knowing the rest, for if their ignorance be vincible, culpable, and willfull, it will indanger at least their implicite faith: would not a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher give a sufficient discription of a humane living body by defining it to consist undoubtfully of head, shoulders, armes, &amp;c. which are the known parts of it, though there be a doubt amongst Philosophers, whether the nailes, humors &amp;c. be animated and parts of it: here therefore you may consider, that we all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in these parts which give a real visible constitution to our Church, though some question be amongst us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Exclusion or Admittance of some few, which whether they be admitted or no, our Church remains by reason of the former in a real visible Existency; and by this are Answered your three ensuing Numbers.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49965:270"/>
thereby would extend my words to all Priests in the whole Church; know you not the difference betwixt Pastours, and Priests? are there not millions of Priests amongst us, and a number of Ministers amongst you, which are no Pastours, that is, have no care or cure of souls committed to them: my Assertion therefore is, that a private christian rejecting the authority of his Parish-Priest, Bishop, Arch-bishop, Metrapolitane, Primate, Patriarch or supream Bishop: who are (in some cases at least his Pastour,) becomes a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, &amp; casts himself out of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now for all the rest who are not his proper Pastours, though they may be Pastours to others, his rejecting or contemning them, will be a grevious fin of pride: but not sufficient alone to cast men out of the Church, because he remaines still dependent of his own Pastours, and here falls to ground all your ensuing discourse of the multitude of Priests, &amp;c.

                     <hi>But is it our allegiance to our Soveraign that is the character of a subject in the common wealth, and not our allegiance, or duty to every inferiour Magistrate? the rejection of one of them, may stand with subjection, though not with innocency; It is not reason to reject a Constable, why then should it more be necessary to our Church membership and Salvation, But still you make your Church invisible: for as no man can know that liveth in the remote parts of the world, whether your Popes themselves are truely Popes, as being duly qualified and elected, now which is that true Pope, when you have often more then one at once, so you can never know concerning your members, whether their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on their Pastors be extensively proportionate to the meanes that discovers their Authority, and whether their disobedience unchurch them or not.</hi>

for the present question) he becomes a Rebell to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, and casts himself out of it; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, because our Saviour hath said, he who heareth you heareth me) and he who contemneth you contemneth me, rejects also Christ's Authority by rejecting them, and thereby casts himself from being any longer (whilst he remains in that contempt) of the Flock, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, which is his Church: For this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt must be the same kind in respect of Christ, that it is in regard of all the aforesaid visible Governours, and therefore must reject the Authority of Christ, because it rejects their Authority; but none of those who reject Christ's Authority over them can be parts of his Flock or Kingdome; <hi>Ergo</hi> note the fallacie of your Assertion in making many Hereticks and Schismaticks properly so called, Real parts of the Catholick Church.</p>

when occasion shall require it in our Larger Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie. For the present it is sufficient to tell you, that whosoever obstinately contradicts any truth revealed from God, as all Hereticks do some or other of them, they sinfully and wilfully affirm, that what God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed is not true; and consequently that God is a lyer, and by that destroy, as much as in them lies, the very essence of God, though their obstinacy and pride will not suffer them to acknowledge it; now since you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse here, that what the Hereticks deny is the <hi>thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi> and the revelation is from God, you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that Hereticks make God a lyer, and thereby take away the veracity or truth of God.</p>

Such as oppose what all visible Churches have most notoriously practised, and believed as Divine truths, whilst they were so universarily taught, and practised, I may safely presume to be Hereticks, because things so notorious cannot morally be presumed to be unknown to any one; for other particulars, I may and do suspend my judgement, for what obligation have I to know all the Hereticks in the world, these Rules being a sufficient judge of the greatest part of them.

men have no opportuny or power to Resist; and when one part of</hi> Europe <hi>was for one Pope, and another for another through so many Schisms, who knows which had the approbation of that which may be called the Church?</hi>

                  <p>The people cannot be supposed to consent freely, lawfully, and effectually to an usurper; now I suppose to consent I speak of to be lawfull, for I speak of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary causes, and not of what seldome or never happens; for where shall you finde an universal or common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to a known usurper, acknowledging him to have a temporal power over them; it is one thing to tolerate, or not resist, and another to consent to his power: now I speak of a free universal consent, where no force or constraint is used.</p>

                  <p>Am I obliged to Answer in this paper all the reasons you alledged in your Book of Episcopacy, what you say here of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> is easily answered, he was sent to be Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about it, or under it's Command, and though there had been no more then seventeen Christians in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet how know you there were no more in all the Countrey adjacent, whereof he was Bishop; But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there had been no more then that small number, neither in that City nor Countrey; know you not that he was sent to multiply Christians there as he did, and thereby to make himself a Competent Diocesse? the Apostle S. <hi>Iames</hi> is recorded to have converted no more the seven persons at the first coming in <hi>Spain</hi>; would you thence deduce, that the Apostolical office did not include in it a superiority over both Priests &amp; Bishops.</p>
