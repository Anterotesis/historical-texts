            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>1. The Goſpel ſhall be propagated and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

the former and latter Sea &amp;c.</hi> That is Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments,
the doctrine and knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt,
together with plenty of gifts and graces, ſhall be diffuſed
and ſcattered abroad among all Nations, who are here
hinted in thoſe expreſſions of the former and latter Sea,
which allude to the watery borders of <hi>Paliſtina,</hi> which
were the lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> now its

all the earth.</hi> Why! you will ſay the Lord is ſo alwayes,
Chriſt was long ſince inaugurated into the Kingdome, &amp;
hath for many ages actually adminiſteredit in the world:
But the meaning is he ſhall ſhew himſelfe to be King,
hee ſhall be known to be King, 'tis not ſpoken in regard
of right or actuall adminiſtration, but in regard of ſenſe
and apprehenſion, hee will ſhew it partly by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and his owne diſpenſations, partly by doctrinall
diſcoveries in the Church, men ſhall more diſtinctly

in the words of the Text. <hi>The Lord ſhall be one and his
Name one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this view we have found the words to be the third

            <p>This reſolution of the Text, doth ſomewhat open it

               <hi>In that day,</hi> that is the day ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 1. deſcribed
<hi>verſes</hi> 6. 7. what this day is, is ſomewhat doubted, moſt
grant it cannot be taken properly, as if all theſe things,
could be tranfacted in the ſpace of 24 houres, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſome be ſo fond, as to interpret all theſe things in
the rigour of the Letter: But what is intended then?</p>
            <p>I ſhall only mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moſt probable opinions, ſome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114283:5"/>
referre it to the firſt times of Chriſtianity, and the
dawnings of the Goſpel in the world: but ſure that's a
miſtake; for it muſt be ſuch a day, whoſe morning is
miſerably troublous, whoſe evening is eminently glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
which will hardly agree to thoſe times: others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it to the day of Judgement: but though the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this day hath no end till then; yet I conceive
that is not intended, for theſe happineſſes here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
of the propagation of the Goſpel, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgedment
of Chriſts Sovereign<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, &amp; the peace of the
Churches &amp;c. though rare and high priviledges yet are
ſomewhat lower then thoſe diſpenſations, which
Chriſt will give out at the day of Judgement, others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
them to the times of the calling of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and
the Churches recovery from the Apoſtacy and defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> ſome more yet more particularly to
the deſtruction of the laſt enemies and thoſe ſecrets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> for the preſent, becauſe I drive
at other things, I ſhall forbeare the through diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this matter, and ſhall only generally and ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the words to ſome latter providences, probably
the times moſt neerly preceding the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for I conceive this text is exactly paralleld to
thoſe promiſes that are every where in ſcripture ſaid
to be fulfilled <hi>in the latter dayes,</hi> and ſpeake of ſo much
glory and ſweetneſſe as then ſhall bee exhibeted and
diſpenſed to the world, therefore if we will know what
this day is, let us know what is intended in that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>the latter dayes,</hi> it is uſed either</p>
            <p>1. More largely for all that effluxe of time and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of ages betweene Chriſts aſcention and his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
comming to judge the world: all that time in
ſcripture is looked upon as the latter dayes, for ſo the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114283:6"/>
times immediately after Chriſt are expreſſely called,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 15. and I remember the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calleth
his times the <hi>ends of the world</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. the reaſon
of which expreſſions is, becauſe, after Chriſts aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there is no change of diſpenſations, as there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
from the Law naturall to the Law of Tables, and
from the Law of Tables to the Goſpel; but now beyond
this time there is nothing but the everlaſting ſtate.
<hi>There remaineth no more ſacr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fice for ſinne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">H. b. 10 26</note> No other way
of ſalvation to be expected beyond the Goſpel, this is
the largeſt ſenſe which not being noted hath occaſioned
ſome miſtakes.</p>
            <p>2. More ſtrictly for that ſpace of time, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
precedeth the worlds ruine, &amp; that is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
in its morning and evening.</p>
            <p>1. In its morning or former part, which is every
where in Scripture made to be of a diſmall and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
appearance, and therefore doe we ſo often heare of
the evil of the latter times, dayes ful of <hi>deluſion</hi> &amp; <hi>deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
a world of deluſion and error there is then, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 1. <hi>The Spirit ſpeaketh expreſſly that in the latter dayes
men ſhall depart from the faith, and give heed to ſeducing
ſpirits.</hi> God hath expreſſly foretold what will be the
fate of thoſe times. So for deſolation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. in
the latter times there <hi>ſhall come hard or perillous times</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, times of great difficulty and diſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>2. In its evening or latter part which is bright and
glorious, &amp; therefore do we ſo much heare of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the latter dayes, as <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3. 5. <hi>They ſhall make
haſt to feare the Lord and his goodneſſe in the Latter dayes.</hi>
So of ſafety, <hi>no provoking briar, no pricking thorne,</hi> Eze.
28 24. So alſo Iſa. 2. 1, <hi>The mountaine of God, above all
mountaines, in the latter dayes,</hi> that is above the reach of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114283:6"/>
oppoſition and violence, looke as there is a morning
light that goeth before the Sunſhine, ſo there are ſome
ſtreakes of glory: and times grow better and better, as
they draw neerer &amp; nerer to the great day of the Lord.
I have done with that expreſſion, (<hi>in that day.</hi>)</p>
            <p>2. The next is <hi>there ſhall be one Lord.</hi> Hitherto there
have beene divers Lords. The Heathens had their
ſeverall Deityes, the <hi>Turkes</hi> their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi>
their imaginary <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> the Papiſts their Lord the
Pope, many nations doe not as yet call Chriſt Lord,
<hi>Other Lords have dominion over them,</hi> Iſaiah 26. 13.
But then Jeſus Chriſt ſhal be the perſon acknowledged,
he ſhall be acknowledged alone, hee ſhall be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
as Lord, all this is included in the expreſſion
&amp;c. That Chriſt alone ſhall be ſpoken of invocated &amp;
adored in all the Churches, they ſhall be ſubjected to
him as the <hi>only King,</hi> and guided by him as the <hi>onely
Shepheard,</hi> Ezek. 20. 24. Hold of him as the only head,
and ſtand to his appointment as the only Law-giver,
<hi>James</hi> 4. 12. And indeed here is the ground of all; for
tis unity of Religion that begetteth unity of affection,
the <hi>one Lord</hi> cauſeth the <hi>one Name,</hi> when men have <hi>one
King,</hi> give themſelves up to the will of Chriſt, and have
<hi>one Shepheard</hi> guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, and have
<hi>one Law-giver,</hi> are willing their opinions ſhould ſtand
or fall at the appointments of Chriſt, then will there be
a ſweet and happy agreement.</p>
            <p>3. The laſt clauſe to be examined is that, <hi>his Name
one,</hi> at firſt I conceived the meaning to bee that men
ſhould looke only at one power and dignity, whereby
to indeare themſelves to the reſpects of God, &amp; thought
the expreſſion paralell to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12.
<hi>That there is no other Name given under Heaven</hi> whereby
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114283:7"/>
we muſt be ſaved, but only by Jeſus Chriſt, this is the
one name, or that Phil. 2 10. <hi>That at the Name of Jeſus
every knee ſhall bowe.</hi> But conſidering it more ſeriouſly,
I ſaw the neceſſity of another ſenſe, for this is but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
and effect of the former phraſe, now it ſeemes to be
added for the greater Emphaſis, and aggravation of the
mercy, that there ſhould be not only <hi>one Lord</hi> but <hi>one
N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me:</hi> therefore what is intended? There are divers
acceptions of the Name of God in Scripture, that
which I conceive moſt proper is, when 'its taken for
Worſhip, the way of our Religion and profeſſion, as
<hi>Micah</hi> 4. 5. <hi>All people will walke every one in the name of
his God, but we will walke in the Name of the Lord our God,
for ever and ever.</hi> That is, ſeverall people ſerve there
ſeverall diſtinct wayes of Worſhip and profeſſion, and
the reaſon why the Scripture uſeth this word in this
matter, is becauſe men are called and named after the
way of their worſhip and profeſſion, thus the holy
worſhippers are called Chriſtians from Chriſt, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi>
from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> &amp;c. and among Chriſtians
men are called according to their diſtinct way &amp; chiefe
opinion, as Papiſts, <hi>Socinians, Arminians &amp;c.</hi> well then
'tis promiſed here that there ſhall be one <hi>Name,</hi> that is,
as one Lord, ſo one way of worſhip and badge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
we ſee now, and wee may bewayle it, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the holy people, there are diſtinct names as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,
Calviniſts, Presbyterians, Independants:</hi> But then
all theſe ſhall vaniſh &amp; be no more heard of, the whole
family ſhall be named <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this is no meane bleſſing, the Divell gets great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by names, and therefore his inſtruments are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie

               <hi>former
things are to be done away:</hi> That is, the former kinde of
diſpenſations and providences; many promiſes there
are which hint the great peace and reſt that ſhall then
be in the Church, now that could not be if there were
diviſions and diſtinctions, they would produce factions
and factious Warrs and contentions, and the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
deſolations, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 4. <hi>The fire devoured the great

can looke for in ſuch caſes, and therefore if there were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114283:8"/>
not unity, how could the other promiſes be fulfilled?
ſuch as theſe, Iſa. 33. 10. <hi>Thine eyes ſhall ſee Jeruſalem

times there hath been ſilence for the ſpace of halfe an

enough: only in the latter dayes is <hi>Jeruſalem a

ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 24. <hi>And there ſhall be no more any pricking
thorne, nor any provoking bryer of all that are round about
her.</hi> God hath promiſed to take away all provocation
and moleſtation, and what ever is grievous; therefore
all the cauſe of its difference and diſagreement, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in Religion ſtirre up the greateſt violences, and
moſt deadly hatred; that which ſhould reſtraine and

is difference in Religion and worſhip, there will bee
diſturbances, and there cannot be that quiet and happy

Ethnicke</hi> that came unto him and told him, I would
become Chriſtian, but there is ſuch variety of Sects
among you, that I cannot anchor upon any thing as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in your Religion. Certainly nothing begets A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme
ſo much as this. Men have ſuſpected the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
becauſe there hath bin ſuch differences and ſtrife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, it makes them doubt of all, to ſee diſtinct facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
making the word of God ductile and pliable to ſo
many ſeverall purpoſes. Therefore now an univerſall
unity would much vindicate and recover the glory of
Chriſt out of the hands of ſuch a ſcandall, and be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
proviſion for the credit of Chriſtianity; to
this end Chriſt prayeth and urgeth this very argument
to his Father, John 17. 23. <hi>Let them all be one;</hi> and again,
<hi>Let them be made perfect in one, that the world may know that
thou haſt ſent me;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Father thou knoweſt
how eaſily the world doe take up any prejudice againſt
my doctrine, now if there ſhould be diviſion among my
worſhippers, they will thinke the Goſpel a fable, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
but a device, oh <hi>let them be perfect in one,</hi> that the
world may know, and owne me for the true <hi>Meſsiah.</hi>
Should wee goe to our owne experiences, this we finde
amongſt our ſelves, that Religion never loſt its awe ſo
much as now. <hi>God was terrible in his holy places,</hi> in the
aſſemblies of his Saints, and in the lives of his holy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114283:9"/>
people, the gravity &amp; the ſtrictnes of their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had a majeſty with it, and did dart reverence and awe
into the hearts of men: but now all this glory and power
is loſt, and religion is looked upon but as an empty
pretence and covert to ſome deſignes. 'Tis ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 4.
32, 33. <hi>The multitude of believers were of one heart, and one
ſoule,</hi> and then <hi>the truths of Chriſt had power, and great
grace fell upon them.</hi> Chriſtianity hath more luſtre when
there is ſuch a common conſent, and ſweet brotherly
accord. The truths of God have their <hi>power,</hi> and the
ſervants of God their <hi>grace</hi> with them. Well then, the
ſcandall being ſo great, the Prayer of Chriſt ſo urgent,
God will at one time or another doe ſomewhat emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
and viſibly to right the honour of Jeſus Chriſt,
and to recover the luſtre of Chriſtianity, and our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
profeſſion: for I take this for graunted, that at
ſome ſpeciall times God will roll away the reproach
of every eminent ſcandall, that hath bin caſt upon
Chriſt, and Religion. And becauſe God loveth like
the good houſholder <hi>to bring forth the beſt wine at laſt,</hi> it
hath not bin done hitherto, but is reſerved for the <hi>latter
dayes;</hi> for indeed you ſhall finde that all the latter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
are but ſo many vindications, and clearings of
Chriſt from the former ſcandalls of the world; as for
the ſcandall of meanneſſe hitherto, <hi>Not many noble, not
many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty are called:</hi>
Chriſt's company hath bin deſpicable, and poore; but
now in the <hi>latter dayes</hi> it is every where promiſed <hi>that
Kings ſhall bring their glory into the Church, that they ſhall
hold their mouthes at Chriſt,</hi> Iſa. 52. <hi>ult.</hi> That is, with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and reverence receive his commands: and the like
every where. So for the ſcandall of perſecution, it is
every where declared that in the <hi>latter dayes</hi> the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114283:9"/>
ſhall be the ſubjected party, glad <hi>to take bold of the
skirt of a Jew,</hi> Zech. 8. <hi>bowe to the ſoales of their feet,</hi> Iſa.
60. <hi>The magiſtrates ſhall call the inhabitants of Jeruſalem
their ſtrength;</hi> and the like elſewhere. So againe, the
Church hath beene under the abaſure of reproaches,
but God hath promiſed a vindicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the latter dayes,
that he will <hi>eſtabliſh Zion a praiſe throughout the earth, ſet
it as a royall diadem,</hi> Iſa. 62. 3. with the 7. <hi>that he will
give them prayſe in the lands of their ſhame,</hi> Zeph. 3. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
to their abaſures that they ſhall have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
So for paucity and fewneſſe, which is another ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
there are promiſes of the Goſpel's being propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
<hi>of the flowings out of living waters,</hi> of the flying in
of Converts like <hi>doves to the windowes,</hi> Iſa. 60. and the
like. So in this preſent caſe, becauſe of the variance of
the people of Chriſt under former diſpenſations, there
are promiſes of ſpeciall unity and ſweet accord in the
latter dayes, Of <hi>one Lord,</hi> and <hi>one King,</hi> of <hi>one Shepheard,
one Head,</hi> Hoſea 1. 11. <hi>of one ſhoulder,</hi> Zeph. 3. 9. And
that God will make <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and all that feare
him, to lye down together in peace and ſafety, and to be
all called by <hi>one name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The miſery of theſe times doth ſeeme to inforce
the greater unity. I take this for the manner and courſe
of heaven, to worke one contrary out of another, by
the greateſt diſtractions to make way for unity and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
It is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 11. <hi>He hath made darkneſſe his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
place.</hi> God's counſells are always carried under the
covert of darkneſſe; uſually when he intendeth the
greateſt flouriſhing, he worketh <hi>the greateſt deſolation in
the earth;</hi> and when unity, he ſuffereth the greateſt
diſtraction; (for what grounds I ſhall tell you by &amp; by,)
hence is it that we doe ſo often heare of the miſery of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114283:10"/>
the latter times, and yet againe of the bleſſedneſſe of
the latter times; hard times, and happy times; miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the beginning, happy in the end and iſſue. <hi>Hell is
let looſe in the latter times,</hi> they ſhall give heed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
ſpirits; <hi>and heaven is opened in the latter times,</hi>
there ſhall be great light and r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight will be the clearer afterwards, and the

               </gap>ctions to
bring forth the greateſt harmony, and the moſt bleſſed

unity: Of this more by and by.</p>

the latter dayes would bee; and therefore that we might
not be diſmaid, hath given us many a comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to ſupport our hearts under ſuch providences.
When God framed the world, there was nothing but
confuſion; you doe not know what God can extract out
of a chaos. Two things I ſhall urge upon you to ſet
home this comfort.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Conſider your hopes.</item>
                  <item>2. Know the reaſon of ſuch providences.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1 Conſider your hopes, your times are not to be
meaſured and valued by appearances, it leaſt of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
a Chriſtian to <hi>obſerve the cloudes;</hi> Rom. 8. 24.
<hi>hope that is ſeen is not hope;</hi> that is, thoſe that would
hope are not to judge by the preſent face of things, but
by the promiſes, teach your faith to <hi>ſee things</hi> that <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſeen,</hi> beauty in diſtractions, unity and order in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
and diviſion; faith is excerciſed not when you
get water out of the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> but out of the <hi>Rocke,</hi>
when you make the EATER give you MEATE,
devouring differences yeild comfort and hope; 'tis
better to looke to a ſure word then to an uncertaine
providence, ſee what a promiſe you have, Iſa. 11. 6, 7, 8.
<hi>The wolfe ſhall dwell with the lambe, and the leopard ſhall lie
down with the kid, and the calfe and the young lyon and the
fatling together, and a little childe ſhall lead them. And the
cow and the beare ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lye downe
together, and the lyon ſhall eate ſtraw with the oxe. And the
ſucking child ſhall play on the hole of the aſpe, and the weaned
child ſhall put his hand on the cockatrice den &amp;c.</hi> I will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114283:11"/>
not undertake to aſſigne a ſenſe to every particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
onely in the generall note, God will effect it,
though there be no more hopes then to ſee lyon and
lambe, leopard and kid come together, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
natures that are moſt fierce and contrary, unto a
peaceable and friendly cohabitation.</p>
               <p>2. Know the reaſon of ſuch providences, men are
perplexed when they do not know the reaſon of things,
feare ſeiſes upon us in the darke, Judges 6. 13. <hi>If the
Lord be with us, why is all this evill befallen us?</hi> They did
not know the reaſon of the matter, and therefore were
troubled at it: If there be ſuch promiſes of unity, why
are there ſuch ſad things befallen us? ſuch great breaches
and diſtractions, the ball of contention bandyed from
one to another, cloudes gathering every day thicker &amp;
blacker? You will thinke this is but an ill time to look
for unity, ſuch generall conſent and agreement: alas,
you erre not knowing the reaſon of your providences,
God uſeth to bring in unity and order by confuſions;
there are divers reaſons for it, I ſhall name 3. which
may incourage hope in the ſaddeſt times.</p>
               <p>1. God doth not love to let the creature looke to
the end of his deſignes, and skill the way of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences;
therefore he will try them by caſting a vaile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his worke, and hiding his glory in a cloude, Iſa 44.
15. <hi>Verily thou art a God that hideſt thy ſelfe O God of
Iſrael the Saviour:</hi> He meant to be a Saviour, but they
ſhould know no ſuch thing, a Saviour under a vaile, an
hidden Saviour. Providences are ſo diſpoſed as if hee
meant to doe quite otherwiſe: ſo Iſa. 48. 7. <hi>They are
created now, not from the beginning, leſt thou ſhouldeſt ſay,
I knew them.</hi> God ſpeaketh concerning the matter of
<hi>Babylon</hi> and the ruine of that Empire, which ſhould be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114283:11"/>
effected ſo ſtrangely that none ſhould ſee which way
providence tended, or ſay, <hi>now I know what God will doe.</hi>
God loveth to hide the particular way and path of his
providence, ſo that your times ſhall ſeeme, not to have
the leaſt connexion or reſpect to your hopes, 'tis ſo in
all his dealings ſee Joh. 11 6. <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved <hi>Lazarus</hi> and
when he heard he was <hi>ſicke he abode two dayes,</hi> little love in
that, to ſtand ſtill when there was neede of helpe, yet that
ſtay was for the advantage of the miracle and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of his love, ſo <hi>John</hi> 2. when Chriſt meant to give
them <hi>wine</hi> he calleth for <hi>water-potts;</hi> for God will not
have you looke to the way and end of his counſells,
<hi>Deus ſum non ſequax</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> ſeemed to heare God
ſpeake to him, when he complain<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of ſome croſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences:
the creatures are not to teach God how to
effectuate his promiſes, there is incouragement enough
to waite, even when the face of things doth moſt lowre
upon your expectations.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe God will ſhew you a point of divine skill
to make <hi>poyſon</hi> become your <hi>preſervative,</hi> and your ruine
your eſtabliſhment, he will <hi>unite</hi> you by your <hi>diviſions,
gather</hi> you by your own <hi>ſcatterings; Judaſ's</hi> treaſon was
called <hi>Faelix ſcelus</hi> an happy wickedneſſe, becauſe it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
Chriſt, many times God maketh contentions
happy in their iſſue and reſult, and though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
their influance is very deadly to Religion; yet
their effect is confirmation to the truth, and in the end
Gods people are brought more firmly and ſweetly to
cloſe with one another and their God The noyſe of
Axe and Hammers doth but ſquare ſtones for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that they may lye the more evenly in the buildings;
uſually we finde that Religious controverſies (like the
knocking of flints) yeild more <hi>light,</hi> and by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114283:12"/>
of God occaſion more ſincere <hi>love,</hi> before wee
had but a <hi>negative affection</hi> to truth, and might rather be
ſaid not <hi>to hate,</hi> then <hi>to love it,</hi> every ulgar and low ſpirit
will love truth, when 'tis honoured and advantaged with
common conſent: true affections are raviſhed with the
beauty of truth, and have ſome poſitive ground for
which they can love truths, yea and the more when
they are ſuſpected and queſtioned; for then they ſhine
with the greater luſtre, as being able to endure contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and as being more ſtrongly vindicated and
aſſerted: thus (you know) trees ſhaken are the more
firmly rooted, and diſlocated joynts if well ſet againe
prove the ſtronger, as in the point of aſſurance, after
doubtings the ſoul doth moſt ſweetly &amp; cloſely repoſe
it ſelf in the boſom of Chriſt, ſo outwardly the more
<hi>ſmoke</hi> there is in the Temple, the greater glory after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
In times of common conſent men keep together
as thoſe that are bound with a chaine: But in times of
difference and diſſenting, Gods people are at one with
God and one another upon higher motives, and love
truth for its own ſake, it being as I ſaid more cleared
and vindicated; I have often wondered at that inference
of the people of God, <hi>Mica.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>All people will every
one of them walke in the name of his God, and we will walke
in the name of the Lord our God for ever, and ever.</hi> That
which is a feandall to the world, is to them a motive
and ingagement to firmneſſe, in the truth and union
with one another, there are different wayes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
in the world, therefore let us the more cleave
together in the right way, the variety that was abroad
made them more at one; So at that of <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 126.
127, <hi>They have made voide thy Law, therefore doe I love
thy Commandements above gold.</hi> When the wayes of God
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114283:12"/>
are queſtioned, nay diſanull'd, exploded with contempt
and ſcorne, the more precious to a gracious heart, <hi>ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe I love them</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> that was the very motive
of his affection. ver. 127.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe God loveth to beſtow bleſſings when the
creatures moſt want them, to give them the greateſt
unity, after the greateſt diſtractions, that their bleſſings
may be according to the rate and degree of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
and abaſement; God (I ſay) loveth to make <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
abound</hi> in the very degree of ſufferings<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 5.</note>, and
therefore you may beare up in the greateſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
when God meant them <hi>Canaan</hi> he would
firſt give them enough of the <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> enough to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſome proportion with the future happineſſe, <hi>Deut.</hi>

of them, I ſay if wee let paſſe theſe generall cauſes, we

us, firſt, they were hatched by the ignorance iniquity
and violence of the former times (when things are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and began to breake out upon this great
change, which the former corruptions did even neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and enforce, as uſually you know great and violent
changes occaſion great tumults, ill humours in the body
diſcover themſelves upon a ſtraine; when God changed
his own Ordinances, erroneous ſpirits were buſie, I
meane in the firſt times of the Goſpel: when a people
begin to innovate 'tis an hard mater to keep them within
the bounds of any moderation, and therefore 'tis the
policy of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to change nothing, <hi>ne
videatur erraſſe, Reformations are very perillous eſpecially
to corrupt bodyes;</hi> here then was the occaſion, and indeed
a ſad occaſion to many, who in the extremity of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

looſe and ſlack the reines of Government have been of
late, with what violence and tumult this change was
managed, not in the ſolemne grave way of conviction
and humiliation. Buildings ſtand whoſe foundations
are lay'd in thoſe deepes: But otherwiſe 'twill be hard
to ſettle things, <hi>partly</hi> becauſe till the error be rightly
ſtated the truth is not found out, <hi>partly</hi> becauſe ſuch
changes make men loſe all awe and reverence in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

all acts of communion and brother-hood are

Nay, when it cometh to this they are ſo ſworne to their

their own intereſt and faction, will call in the open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

to the accommodating of their owne faction, though it
be to the hazard of religion and publicke welfare.</p>
               <p>5. As far as truth and Conſcience will give leave, there
ſhould be a profeſſion of brother-hood, a condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

or at leaſt a Chriſtian forbearance, <hi>Epheſſ.</hi> 4. 2.
<hi>with long ſuffering forbearing one another in love,</hi> the ſtrong
are to forbeare the weake, and the weake the ſtrong, to
ſuffer them a little to walke up to their meaſures of

be thus minded, and if in any thing yee be otherwiſe minded,
God will reveale even the ſame to you; nevertheleſſe, where
unto wee have obtained let us walke together by the ſame rule,
minde the ſame thing.</hi> Every one hath not the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of grace, nor degree of light, as long as they hold of
the head we cannot forſake their communion, the
Apoſtle ſpeaketh thoſe words laſt quoted in reference
to the controverſies of thoſe times; every one could
not ſee ſo far into them as others could, as how farre the
<hi>Law</hi> was to be <hi>left,</hi> and the <hi>Moſaicall Rites</hi> diſcontinued,
therefore the Apoſtle's rule is, that they ſhould walke
together, goe ſweetly together as farre as they could,
and thoſe that were growne and had moſt light, (whom
he calleth <hi>perfect</hi>) he wiſheth to be thus minded, to act
according to their light, but not to diſcourage others in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114283:22"/>
their weak beginnings, and for the other ſort he wiſheth
them to waite upon God without murmuring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and they would finde their hearts directed into
the ſame truths and ways: this is the rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſee, in ſuch
caſes: but now the miſery amongſt us is, wee keep a
proud and contemptuous diſtance, and doe not yeild,
not onely as far as Religion, but, as far as our owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
principles would give leave. Wee doe not walke
together in the Lord, and therefore doth Chriſtianity
ſuffer ſuch loſſe every where, for wee cannot be helpfull

               <p>6. Abſtaine from reproaches and undue provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

bite and devoure one another, take heede yee doe not conſume

to beaſts, for indeed ſuch violence is bruitiſh: God hath
armed the Beaſts with teeth and clawes, but man with
reaſon and judgement: to <hi>ſmite with the hand,</hi> is beneath
a <hi>man,</hi> and <hi>to ſmite with the tongue,</hi> beneath a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
and yet how often is it found, that Chriſtians are guilty
of both? The <hi>Controverſies</hi> between them degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>carnall ſtrifes</hi> and <hi>debates,</hi> and are no more <hi>religious,</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114283:22"/>
replies and defences; and therefore, though provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
forbeare reproaches. The other part of the rule is,
that <hi>all civill reſpects muſt be diſpenſed with all meekneſſe

3. 14. So when <hi>Cerinthus</hi> came into the Bath at <hi>Epheſus,
John</hi> went away, let us goe hence; <hi>Hic eſt Cerinthus hoſtis

the breaches; the reproaches caſt upon us are an hint
from God, to preſſe us to the more care. I hope I ſhall
not take too much upon me, if I commend ſomething
out of the Scriptures to my ſelfe and brethren. <hi>Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
are not <hi>accuſations,</hi> and when God giveth a call, tis
not too much peremptorineſſe to admoniſh: by the
<hi>bowels</hi> of Chriſt, let me intreate you to minde a few
things.</p>
               <p>1. Beware of paſſion in your own intereſts, though
they may be much ſhaken and endammaged in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Controverſies, yet ſelfe-denying patience will be

Our conveniencies ſhould learne to give place to

for worldly glory and great matters in this life; and
truely wee ſhould learne of him. <hi>Paul</hi> would not take
maintenance, becauſe the falſe Teachers pretended they
would preach the Goſpel freely, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>But what
I doe, that I will doe, that I may cut off occaſion from them

now ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> though I have a right, I will not
make uſe of it, that I may not, through their glorying in
this matter, diſadvantage my endeavours in the Goſpel.
Our eſteeme, credit, authoritie, muſt all be ſacrificed
upon the intereſt, and advantage of truth. <hi>Nazianzene</hi>
in his Orations and Verſes, doth often profeſſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of laying down his Biſhoprick, and all his Church-honours
for the peace of the Church. In one place I
remember above all, he tells them of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that
rather than he would any way be guilty of the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
to their diſtractions, he ſhould count it an high

above all.</p>

what he thought was the better way.</p>
               <p>3. When you deale with the errours of the time,
(for certainly that is neceſſary, wee muſt ſtabliſh our
<hi>hearers in the preſent truths,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 12.) doe it with a
great deale of caution, and warineſſe: though I would
not preſcribe, yet give me leave humbly to offer three
things, which poſſibly may prevent ſome abuſes.</p>
               <p>1. Beware of looſe ſtings and generall declamations
againſt errours and hereſies; theſe doe but exulcerate
minds, prejudice our teſtimony, and much hinder it
from being received; this is a miſcarriage on both ſides;
men urge their wayes in looſe flings, conceited nickes,
and implications; generall outcryes of one ſide againſt
<hi>ſuperſtitious antichriſtianiſme,</hi> and the men of the world,
(words ſoone ſpoken) on the other ſide againſt <hi>errours,
new lights,</hi> and <hi>new opinions.</hi> The word worketh moſt
when it is moſt particular and demonſtrative; thunder
at <hi>a diſtance,</hi> doth not ſo much ſtartle mee, as a clap in
my own <hi>Zenith;</hi> it is good to goe by way of particular
proofe and argument againſt opinions; proove them to
be errours, and then call them ſo; otherwiſe looſe and
generall invectives, will make but ſuperficiall impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is very obſervable, that when <hi>James</hi> had prooved
that conceit of Gods being <hi>the author of ſin,</hi> to be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
then he ſaid, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Erre not, my beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi>
He firſt diſputeth, and then diſſwadeth. It's very
obſervable too, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. from the 13. to the 33. verſe,
that our Saviour never denounceth a woe againſt the
Phariſees, but he preſently rendreth a reaſon for it;
<hi>Woe to you Scribes and Phariſees hypocrites; for yee devoure
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114283:25"/>
widdowes houſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Woe; for yee ſhut the Kingdome of God,</hi>
&amp;c. Uſually ungrounded zeale ſtayeth in generalls, and
ordinarily 'tis out of deceit or weakneſſe.</p>
               <p>2. Deale herein with all ſoberneſſe and meekneſſe;
wee ſhould doe what we can to remove prejudices; men
drinke in truths when they are ſweetly propounded;
God was in the <hi>ſtill voyce;</hi> the ſmall raine falleth ſweetly
upon the tender graſſe; men preſently ingage themſelves
to a fervour and heate, and that marreth all; 'tis but as
oyle to the flames. I remember a ſpeech of <hi>Darius,</hi> when
one of the Souldiers of the Campe rayled againſt <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
he telleth him, I kept you to fight againſt <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
not to rayle againſt him: <hi>Thoſe Arrowes of bitter
words, are not the weapons of our warfare:</hi> Paſſion ſheweth
wee are angry more againſt the <hi>perſon</hi> then the <hi>errour,</hi>
too often it maketh us forſake the maine controverſie,
and goe on upon a wrongſent; one ſaith, he that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to Kings, muſt ſpeake <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>with ſilken words;</hi>
he that ſpeaketh to diſſenters, had need make his ſpeech
as ſmooth and ſoft as may be; I am ſure 'tis agreeable to
the Apoſtles advice, <hi>In meekneſſe inſtruct thoſe that oppoſe
themſelves,</hi> 2 Tim. 2 25. And in the ſame place he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that <hi>the ſervants of God muſt be gentle and patient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Take heed of aggravating and greatening matters,
making them of more importance then indeed they are;
former ages were poſſeſſed with this ſpirit, every leſſer
diſſent and miſtake, was made an hereſie or errour in the
faith, as appeareth by their catalogues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> had but ſpoken two or three words, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of <hi>Montanus,</hi> and the Prieſts of <hi>Rome</hi> preſently cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him up for a Montaniſt, and accordingly dealt with
him: <hi>Quo protinus offenſus</hi> (ſaith he<note n="*" place="margin">Pamelius in vitâ Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulliani.</note> that wrote his life)
<hi>prorſus in Montani partes tranſivit.</hi> I confeſſe 'tis good
to be watchfull to daſh <hi>Babylons brats, and take the little
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114283:25"/>
foxes,</hi> Cant. 2. 15. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) To oppoſe the firſt and modeſt
appearances of errour; the party laſt amongſt us began
with <hi>words,</hi> and would have brought in <hi>things.</hi> Therefore
I ſay, 'tis good to be watchfull, however this will not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
rough dealing with thoſe that vary from us, but in
an expreſſion and ſtraining every thing to the worſt
ſence, and moſt odious conſequences, that it may appeare
to be hereticall. Chriſts own words were miſtaken and
wreſted into a ſence which he would not own; he ſaid,
<hi>He would deſtroy the Temple in three dayes,</hi> Joh. 2. 19. He
meant it of his body, they accuſed him of the ſame words;
and yet they are called <hi>falſe witneſſes,</hi> Mat. 26. 61. who
accuſed him of it, becauſe they wreſted it to another
ſence, applying it to the materiall Temple. Many have
a faculty of turning <hi>Eloi</hi> into <hi>Elias,</hi> Molehils into Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
making men offenders for a word, and by falſe
gloſſes cauſing innocent things to ſeeme odious.</p>
               <p>4. Let me intreate you to improve your intereſts for
brotherly and friendly collations; publick <hi>Conferences</hi>
cannot be had without <hi>tumult;</hi> and there is a <hi>prejudice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>publick Sermons;</hi> and againe, <hi>private diſputes</hi> are
more for <hi>victory</hi> then <hi>truth,</hi> uſually there is more of <hi>ſtrife</hi>
then <hi>love</hi> in them.<note n="*" place="margin">Alternis vicibus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of his private diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with a <hi>Jew,</hi> both drew out their reaſonings, and
through the heate of contention, both went away unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
But now, if there were meetings inſtituted for
the propounding of things rather by way of <hi>caſe</hi> then
<hi>Controverſie,</hi> and matters were carried not ſo much in a
diſputative way, but by way of friendly collation and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſcourſe, it would much conduce to the ending of
our differences; certainly, where ſuch meetings have
been ſet up, and wiſely ordered, much good hath come
by them; if we could allure Chriſtians, the lot of whoſe
dwellings is diſpoſed among our Churches into theſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114283:26"/>
Conferences, wee ſhould finde them of much availe.
I conceive much might be ſaid out of Scripture for
them; certainly wee doe not come together ſo often as
we ſhould, to <hi>comfort our ſelves with the mutuall faith of
one another,</hi> Rom. 1. 11, 12. I beleeve, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beſides the publick aſſembly; this benefit you would
find by ſuch a courſe, that your <hi>own</hi> would be ſtabliſhed,
others would be leſſe violent, if brought to theſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſultations, haply it may be a buſineſſe that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
you to much labour &amp; ſelfe-deniall, but that ſhould
not ſway with a Chriſtian Miniſter, whoſe worke is not
ended with an houres diſcourſe in the Pulpit: Wee are
very often calling for <hi>power</hi> to puniſh heretickes; but let
us ſadly ſmite vpon the thigh, and conſider, if any of us,
in private, have improved thoſe <hi>loving courſes,</hi> to gaine
them that have been in our power. <hi>Luther</hi> hath a pretty
ſaying; <hi>Igne charitatis comburendi ſunt haereticis,</hi> you talk
of burning hereticks, <hi>burne them</hi> firſt in the fire of love,
or at leaſt burne them with the <hi>fire of the Spirit.</hi> The
Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>trying the worke by fire,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 13.
Rationall and friendly conviction will do much, at leaſt
it will beget a ſweet and brotherly correſpondence, and
'tis to be hoped, wee ſhall finde more meekneſſe, where
things are not carried in the way of a ſet diſputation.</p>
               <p>I have done with my addreſſe to the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Give me leave to ſpeak a word to your ſelves,
not as if I would preſcribe to you, but onely humbly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
two or three Conſiderations to your thoughts, it
may be, I may not ſhew ſo <hi>much diſcretion</hi> in it, yet if I
do <hi>affection,</hi> I have my aime, which is not ſo much to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi>
you, as to <hi>draw you into a conſultation</hi> about theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and therefore I humbly propoſe the buſineſſe to
your care; think of the Churches unity, you have <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:114283:26"/>
to endeavour that the <hi>Lord be one, and his Name
one.</hi> Conſider, <hi>civill peace</hi> depends much upon <hi>Church
peace;</hi> Religion is called ſo <hi>a religando,</hi> it being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
bond to linck men together; contrary opinions in
Religion, uſually cauſe much alienation of affection, and
great diſturbances in the Common-wealth. Therefore
this matter appertaineth to you in reference to unitie;
I humbly deſire,</p>
               <p>1. That you would ſeriouſly do your utmoſt to draw
things to an agreement; you have appointed a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of accommodation already, we do not know what is
done, ſuppoſe you did try once againe. When<note n="*" place="margin">See the Hiſtory of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Dort</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

troubled the <hi>Churches of the Low Countryes,</hi>
there were <hi>often Collations,</hi> and they did ſelect men once
and againe and againe to conſider how to compoſe the
differences: 'tis true, thoſe endeavours did not ſucceed,
becauſe thoſe meetings were made up of the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſticklers, and the <hi>Arminians</hi> by the means of <hi>Vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogardus</hi>
had the ſecret incouragement and countenance
of ſome of the Magiſtrates, that nothing ſhould be done
to their diſſervice and diſadvantage, and ſo both parties
ſtrove to make the beſt of their opinion and faction; but
now if you would be pleaſed to try once againe, God
knows what will be the ſucceſſe, I ſuppoſe there can be
no danger in trying. Call ſome men together, whoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency
for the power of godlineſſe will make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the more venerable, entertained with the more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and awe; when the people ſmell ſelfe and intereſt
in any endeavours, they have the leſs majeſty with them.
Call men, through age and experience verſed in ſuch a
work, men of a moderate and ſober ſpirit, who preferre
the intereſt of religion before that of a party; bleſſed be
God, <hi>England</hi> doth not want ſuch, call them together to
think of wayes of reconciliation; though many thirſt &amp;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114283:27"/>
pant after it, yet cannot effect it, being but private men,
and ſo not ſo much regarded, and in bodies &amp; aſſemblies
they cannot ſo well drive it on; men of middle intereſts,
being always ſuſpected, have a prejudice upon their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours;
and indeed good men cannot be imagined to
be ſo without all touch and ſenſe of their own particular
opinion, as not to diſpute, ſtickle, &amp; ingage for it in ſuch
bodies and aſſemblies: but now if ſuch were called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by your authority, to make it their onely worke to
provide for the advantage of religion, and to compoſe
the differences; poſſibly and by the bleſſing of God, much
good might be done, however, you will manifeſt that
you have not been wanting to your duty, and therefore
weigh it in your thoughts.</p>
               <p>2. That you would quicken your Miniſters and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in their <hi>Provinciall</hi> and <hi>Claſsicall</hi> meetings, by ſome
charge and command to think of waies how beſt to gain
and deale with diſſentients. The matter is not below the

pleaſed to quicken them by your command and inable
them by your authority, to find out and to act in ſuch
wayes as may tend to the ending of the differences and
controverſies, much good might be done. I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the true nature and intent of ſuch meetings is not
altogether or chiefly to give laws authoritatively to the
particular Churches, as to conſider how to compoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
that do ariſe in them; and 'twere ſad if the <hi>Mint
and Commin</hi> were preferred above the <hi>weighty works,</hi> and
the chiefe of their care were ſpent either in triviall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
or in making rules for their own, rather then in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114283:27"/>
ſtudying all brotherly waies of gaining thoſe that differ,
and healing the breaches of the Church. This (I ſay) were
ſad indeed, the true intent and nature of theſe meetings
being to give ſatisfaction, and to carry things with more
clearneſſe of demonſtration, and to give out the ſenſe of
the Church in matters of difficulty; for indeed the <hi>leſſe
of a Court,</hi> and the <hi>more of a Councell</hi> they have in them the
better: therefore if you would command and chiefly
commend theſe things of unity to their care &amp; debates,
ſome hope might ariſe that way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That you would take care that Miniſters put
out for ſcandall, may not be ſo eaſily taken in againe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that are humbly penitent, and modeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous,
no man would open his mouth, but for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
I am perſwaded they are and will be a great means
of our troubles, partly as they occaſion no ſmall offence
to the godly, the dead body of <hi>Amaſa</hi> in the way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the people of the Lord from going on to union
and accord; the ſons of <hi>Eli</hi> that cauſe many to abhor the
offering of the Lord; partly as thoſe that are very apt to
be the <hi>cinifloes,</hi> that will blow up the coales of ſtrife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us. The firſt ſtirs about religion in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes,</hi>
were occaſioned by the <hi>Miniſters of the old Leaven,</hi>
whom they were faine to take in out of neceſſity in that

Fourthly, In the liberty that you give, uſe great caution,
ſome things you may be forced to beare with for a time,
take heed of endangering the truths of God, you ought to
be tender of Chriſts little ones; woe to thoſe that offend
them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 6. But you ought to be more tender of
Chriſts truths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you owe ſomewhat to Chriſts Saints and
ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: but I ſay again, more to his truths? Tis ſomewhat
unheard of, that theſe two ſhould come in conteſt and
competition; however, you will find Chriſt more jealous
of his ways then of his ſervants; of his truths then of his
Saints: 'tis truth makes Saints, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>Sanctifie them
by thy truth, thy word is truth;</hi>) and husbandmen are ever
more carefull of their <hi>ſeed-corne,</hi> then of <hi>the increaſe;</hi> and
beſides, we may be deceived in Saints, wee doe not know
hearts, but we cannot ſo eaſily in truths, becauſe there is
a ſure ſtandard to meaſure them by. Therefore take heed
of doing any thing againſt truth; 'tis a good old caution,
<hi>In veſte varietas ſit ſciſſura, non ſit,</hi> though there be <hi>divers
colours,</hi> yet let there be no <hi>rent</hi> in the Churches coate. I
will not take upon me to ſtate the matter, what libertie
you may give, and how far; perhaps that may be unfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;
however 'twill not (I hope) be too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
to preſent you with the moſt obvious miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of Magiſtrates in this matter. Three ſorts of men
there are in the world, and concerning every one of them
wee may ſay,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>The way of peace they have not knowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Some are of a prepoſterous zeale in leſſer differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and are all for extremity and violence towards thoſe
from whom they differ in the <hi>leaſt degree</hi> and <hi>circumſtance;</hi>
moſt of the cenſures inflicted by the late <hi>Biſhops</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of Ceremonies, things not weighty in any regard,
no not in their own eſteeme: ſome men breath out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but rage and threatnings upon the leaſt diſſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:114283:28"/>
I remember I have read of <hi>Joab David's</hi> Generall, that
when his teacher had falſely vowelled one word in the
Hebrew hee ſlew him; the place was that charge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<hi>Zechan.</hi> He read it <hi>Zachar</hi> the males of <hi>Amalec:</hi> It is
good to preſerve truth, but ſmall diſtempers will not need
ſo violent a cure; 'tis as if a man ſhould fire an houſe to
deſtroy the mice in it. Union is good, but rigorous inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
eſpecially in trifles &amp; things that lie farre from the
heart of Religion are not ſo warrantable. <hi>Paul</hi> is every
where moſt zealous againſt errours, there is never an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of his but hath ſome what againſt them: However
none more earneſt then he to bring <hi>circumciſion</hi> and <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi>
to a profeſſion of brotherhood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Some are for <hi>medleyes</hi> and compounds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as if that would be peace: Thus <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth
thought to pleaſe all by that wicked booke called the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,</hi>
it did a great deale of harme, and did not any way
heale the difference; many of late amongſt us and in other
reformed Churches endeavored to blend us &amp; Rome, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,
and Zion together, God hateth thoſe <hi>iniquos ſyncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmos</hi>
prophane mixtures, and <hi>intermyſticall</hi> deſignes; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
conſiſts in an <hi>agreement in the truth,</hi> not in a <hi>coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of errors,</hi> ſtrings that are in tune muſt not be ſtirred, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
muſt be ſet up to them: The diſobedient muſt bee
brought up to the wiſedome of the juſt, not that brought
downe to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 17. when the <hi>language is pure the
Souldier is one, Zeph.</hi> 3. 9. little hopes of agreement till you
ſet up pure doctrine, unmixed diſipline, the <hi>new</hi> cloth ſet
upon the <hi>old</hi> will make the rent the greater, the world
thinks the leſſe <hi>purity</hi> the more <hi>unity;</hi> but 'tis otherwiſe,
all the troubles are becauſe <hi>Iron</hi> will not mixe with <hi>Clay,</hi>
Gods waies with man's inventions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Some drive at a promiſcuous leave, and <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of all opinions, and differences though never ſo
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114283:29"/>
contrary to truth, as if this were the beſt way to bring
things to any peace and quiet: ôh conſider how great a
prejudice this is to Religion, this is the very way that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian

And indeed where it doth not <hi>deſtroy</hi> Religion it doth <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe</hi>

men ſpend all the <hi>heat</hi> and firſt-borne of their
ſtrength and zeale in the <hi>contentions</hi> and letthe <hi>practicks</hi>
goe, certainely there would be but little ſecurity to truth
and it's followers, where there is ſuch a promiſcuous <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
where men are godly they cannot be ſo eaſily ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed
into one body and confederacy with perſons errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
they being bound up by conſcience, and having reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of their ſides, are not ſo flexible, and then the others
cannot ſo well agree with them; for two different errours
can better agree and cotton among themſelves then one
errour and the neareſt <hi>truth;</hi> darkneſſe and darkneſſe can
better agree then light and darkneſſe, alwayes you will
find it, men hate the neareſt truth as <hi>being that light by
which their deeds are reproved.</hi> The <hi>Eunomians</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
though they held different errours (the one denyed
the Godhead of the Sonne, the other of the Spirit) could
better agree with one another then with the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> the
<hi>Phariſes</hi> and <hi>Herodians,</hi> though of different principles (the

yet both could conſpire together to entrapp Chriſt. <hi>Iebal</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:114283:29"/>
and <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Amalec</hi> could better accord with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

God is the holy temple, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) there is a God above, one in
