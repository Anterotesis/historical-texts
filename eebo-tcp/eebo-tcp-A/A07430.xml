            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Or the ſame, becauſe he dothe not go beyonde the boundes, whiche his fathers hath ſette? The mayſtre and lorde hym ſelfe ſayde, who hathe ordayned or made me iudge? and ſhall the ſeruaunt be thought to haue iniurye or wronge, excepte he do iudge al men? Thus than Bernarde ſayth, that the ſucceſſoure of the apoſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les dothe vnſemely and vnaccordyngly yf he vſurpeth or taketh vnto hym ſelfe the offyce of a iudge / And the holy apoſtle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, that all men indyfferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (no man excepted, neyther byſſhop, neyther preeſte or deacon) oughte to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t coactyue of iudges or prynces and gouernours ſeculer / and that ſuche ſeculer gouernours ought not but to be obeyed, onleſſe they dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde any thynge to be done dyrectlye agaynſt the lawe of the euerlaſtynge ſaluacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / wherfore in the. xiii. chapytre to the Romaynes: he ſaythe / Let euery ſoule be ſubiecte to the hyghe powers / for there is no powre, but from god and thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that be: are ordayned of god / Therfore whoſoeuer reſyſteth the powre: reſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the ordynaunce of god / and thoſe whiche reſyſteth: dothe purchaſe and gette to them ſelfe dampnacyon / for prynces or gouernours are not feared of them that are well doers / but of them that dothe euyll / wylte thou not drede the powre? do

Therfore be you ſubgiectes / for ſo you ought of neceſſytie / not onely becauſe of wrathe / but alſo becauſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcyence. For becauſe of this, you do pay trybutꝭ. For they are mynyſters of god ſeruynge to this ſame thyng. Gyue you to all men, theyr dueties / trybute, to whom trybute is due / rente: to whom rente / feare: to whom feare / honoure, to whom honoure is due to be gyuen. And I was wyllyng alſo vpon theſe wordes of the apoſtle worthye to be noted, to brynge in the gloſe, after the mynde of ſayntes, and catholyke Doctours / becauſe of thyſe thynges, whiche the apoſtle hathe ſayde, and the gloſe maker / but our purpoſe is ſo openly and euydently ſhewed to be true, that no man beynge of ryght mynde after he hath ſeen and red them: ought to doubte any lenger. The apoſtle ſayd eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry ſoule exceptynge none, where the gloſe after Auguſtynes mynde fyrſte, and otherwhyles after the mynde of Ambroſe, ſayth thus. And here he prouoketh and exhorteth men to humblenes. For certayne men thought, that euyll Lordes and rulers, and namely ſuche as were infydels ought not to haue domynyon and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le <note place="margin">Euyll rulers are to be obey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed as reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as good ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers.</note> ouer chryſten men. And yf they were good and alſo chryſten: that then they we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re but peetes and egall to other good and chryſten men. Whiche pryde, alſo the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here putteth awaye euen from the ſuperyour parte of man / that is to wytte the ſoule, by it betokenynge the hole man. For what is it to ſaye / euery ſoule, but euery man? as yf he ſhulde ſaye. All the foreſayde thynges are to be done / and thoughe you be ſo perfyte in the bodye of Chryſte / yet that notwithſtandynge let <note place="margin">The ſoule is put for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> euery ſoule be ſubiecte / that is to ſaye, lette euery man be ſubiecte / whiche man I do ſygnyfye therfore by the name of the ſoule, that you ſhulde ſerue and be obeyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunte, not onely in bodye, but alſo in wyll and mynde. Therfore let euery ſoule be ſo ſubiecte and obedyent, that is euen alſo in wyll / he do ſerue the ſeculer pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, bothe good and euyll / that is to wytte kynges and prynces / or gouernours / hygh capytaynes / vnder capytaynes / &amp; ſuch other. Lo than, what the apoſtle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode and meaned by the hygher powers / nothynge elles: but ſeculer prynces &amp; gouernours. Than it foloweth in the gloſe / for yf he be a good man, whiche is ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ler, and gouernoure ouer the / he is thy nouryſſher / yf he be an euyll man, he is a temptoure to proue and aſſaye the.

So than lette euery ſoule be ſubiecte to the hygher powers / that is to wyt, in this that they are hyghe / that is in worldlye thyngꝭ. Or elles in this worde hygher is ſignyfyed the cauſe wherfore they ought to be obeyed / that is becauſe they are hygher by the ordenaunce of god.</p>
               <p>¶ For there is no power but of god / he proueth, that they oughte to be ſubiectes &amp; obeyſſaunte, this maner waye, becauſe all power is of god / but thoſe thynges, whiche be of god / are ordeyned of god / than it foloweth, that power and auctory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is ordeyned of god / that is to ſaye, who ſoeuer hathe power or auctorytie, hath the ordynaunce of god. Therfore who ſoeuer reſyſteth the power reſyſteth the ordy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naunce of god. And this is it that he ſaythe, as yf he oughte therfore to be ſubiecte becauſe there is neyther any good man, neyther euyll, that hathe any power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte it be gyuen vnto hym of god / wherfore oure Lorde ſayde to Pylate / Thou ſhuldeſt not haue power ouer me / yf it were not gyuen to the from aboue / whiche <note place="margin">Bernardus.</note> thyng Bernarde alſo repeting to the Archebyſſhop of Senon ſayth.

<pb facs="tcp:12929:60"/>
he ſayde / thou ſhuldeſt not haue any power ouer me: yf it were not gyuen to the from aboue. At that tyme Chryſt ſpake for hym ſelfe, and had experyence of that thynge in hym ſelfe / whiche thynge after he cauſed to be publyſſhed and proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med throughout all the churches, by his apoſtles, that is to wytte, that there is no power but of god / and that who ſoeuer reſyſteth the power: reſyſteth the ordynau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce of god. And within a lytle after in the ſame place Bernarde ſaythe Chryſte <note place="margin">Bernardus.</note> graunteth and confeſſeth, that the power and auctoryte of the Emperours depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Rome, euen ouer his owne ſelf was ordeyned from aboue. And it foloweth in the gloſe / but thoſe that be, are ordeyned of god / that is to ſaye are reſonablye dyſpoſed and ordeyned of god. Therfore who ſoeuer other by vyolence, or by dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde or gyle reſyſteth the power / that is to wyt the man hauynge power in thoſe thynges whiche belonge to the power: as in trybute / and ſuche other thynges: he reſyſteth the ordynacyon of god / that is to ſaye, he reſyſteth hym, that hath power by the ordynacyon of god / and therfore he dothe not accordynge to the ordynacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of god. Of the good power: it is euydent, that god hath made hym ruler reaſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nably and not without good cauſe / And of the euyll power, it maye alſo appere, that he is made ruler reaſonably / whyles both good men are purged by hym: and euyll men are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempned, &amp; hym ſelfe is caſte downe hedlonge worſe and worſe.

But yf thou do euyll: than feare thou / for he beareth the ſwerde, that is to ſay the power and auctorytie to iudge: not without cauſe, but to punyſſhe euyll doers.

And therfore, be you ſubiecte to hym, as of neceſſyte / or elles be you ſubiectes to neceſſytie / that is to ſaye, to the neceſſary ordynacyon of god / And that not onely for feare, that the wrathe of the gouernour, or elles of god, ſhall be auenged: but alſo becauſe of conſcyence / that is to wytte, that your mynde maye be cleane, by louynge hym that is made ruler by god / that is to ſay, hym: whiche hath ſuche rule and auctorytie, by the ordynacyon of god. For albeit that all Chryſten men, that they are chryſten, are one in Chryſte, in the faythe of whom, there is no dyfference, whether they be Iewes, or Grekes, Lordes, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, and ſuche other thynges: yet that notwithſtandynge, there is dyfference betwene them, in the mortall or worldly conuerſacyon.

Or this it may be vnderſtande, wherfore you ought to gyue try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes: for they are the mynyſters of god / they (I ſaye) ſeruynge you: whyles they do defende the countree / for this ſame thynge, that is to wytte, for trybute they do ſerue you in defendynge of the countree / and bycauſe they are the mynyſters of god. So than by this texte of the Apoſtle, and by the expoſycyons of ſayntes, he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re afore brought in: who ſoeuer is not wyllynge / that the name, and the doctryne of the lorde, ſhulde be blaſphemed, as vniuſte, &amp; preachynge agaynſt the Cyuyle lawes: (as the gloſe of Auguſtyne ſayde here in this place, &amp; in the ſext chapytre of the fyrſt epyſtle to Tymothe) he ought to holde without any maner doubtyng <note place="margin">That all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oughte to be ſubiect to pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But the apoſtle neuer ſayde ſuche wordes, any where / of any Byſſhop or preeſt. For the lordes, to whom we ar bounde to obey in coactyue iuryſdyccion ar they, whiche by power and myght of armes ought to defende the countre, whiche thyng, in no wyſe is ſemely or agreynge for a byſſhop or preeſte. Wherfore ſaynt Ambroſe to Valentian in the ſeconde epyſtle, whiche is entytuled to the people, <note place="margin">Ambroſius.</note> ſayth in this wyſe. I ſhall be able to ſorowe, I ſhall be able to wepe / I ſhall be able to ſyghe &amp; mourne / agaynſt armour &amp; wepons, agaynſt ſouldyoures / &amp; the gothes / my armour or wepons are teares / for ſuche ar the munymentꝭ, defence or armour of a preeſt / otherwyſe I neyther ought, neyther may reſyſt / agayne ſuch lordes to whom we ar bounden ſo to obey myght be infydels or myſcreantes (as the gloſe ſayth aboute the begynnynge) but byſſhops neyther ar, neyther may be ſuche maner men. And therfore it is open and euydent to all men, that the apoſtle ſpake not of preeſtes or byſſhops: but of kynges, prynces &amp; gouernours / as ſaynt Auguſtyne ſayd. From this ſubiection alſo the apoſtle excepteth no man / whan he ſayd, euery ſoule. Yf than it be ſo, that they whiche reſyſt ſuche powers, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge infydels, &amp; euyllmen, do purchaſe to them ſelues eternall da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnacion / how moche more do they purchaſe to them ſelues the indignacion &amp; wrathe of almygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty god / &amp; of his apoſtle Paule, &amp; alſo of Peter / whiche deſpyſynge this doctryne of god &amp; theſe apoſtles / haue of late troubled, &amp; contynually do trouble Chryſten kynges &amp; prynces / &amp; moſt of all, &amp; without any maner excuſe, the Emperoure of Rome. For prynces and gouernours ar the myniſters of god, as the apoſtle ſayd. And he ſayd not they ar our myniſters, or the myniſters of Peter, or of any other apoſtle. And therfore they ar not ſubiectꝭ in iudgement coactyue, to any byſſhop or preeſt, but rather contrary wyſe, the byſſhops &amp; preeſtꝭ at ſubiectꝭ to them / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thyng alſo the gloſe after ſaynt Auguſtynes mynde declared, whan it ſayd / Than yf the emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth one thyng, &amp; god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. &amp;c. namynge there no byſſhop, or archebyſſhop, or patryarche, in ſuche iuryſdyctions whiche thyng, yet he wolde haue done, or ought to haue done, yf Chryſte whiche <note place="margin">Bablynge &amp; lyeng Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</note> is the kyng of kynges, and lorde of lordes, had graunted ſuche power and aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie to hym ouer the Emperour, as they do bable &amp; lye in theyr Decretals: which

Lo here howe this holy man, doth ſeperate &amp; departe the iudgement of preeſtes, from the iudgement of prynces &amp; gouernours / becauſe coactyue iudgement neyther dothe belonge, neyther ought to belonge to preeſtes aſſygnynge the cauſes whiche we haue ſayde oftentymes heretofore. The fyrſte becauſe that coactyue power is gyuen by the temporall lawe, or elles by the law maker or prynce / whiche was not graunted to preeſtes in Chryſoſtomes tyme or prouynce.

And he ſayd the ſame vpon that texte in the. ix. of Luke yf any man wylleth to come after me: lette hym denye hym ſelfe. But I haue he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re lefte out the ordre of his wordes, partely becauſe theſe aforeſayd are ſuffycyent and partely for cauſe of ſhorteneſſe / This ſame alſo was plyanely and openlye the mynde of ſaynt Hilarie, to Conſtantius the Emperour / in whiche epyſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge other thynges / thus he wrote to the ſame Emperoure.

Loo here, that god wylleth men to be taughte the knowynge and confeſſyng of hym, that is to wytte by fayth / but not any man to be compelled: therto for that he deſpyſeth. And he reherſeth the ſame agayne not longe after ſayeng / God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth not any coacte confeſſyon. And agayne afterwarde in the perſone of all preeſtes, he ſaythe thus / I can not receyue any man excepte he be wyllynge / I <note place="margin">Hilarius.</note> can not here any man, but prayeng / not ſygne or marke any man: but hym that profeſſeth. Therfore god wyll not haue any coacte confeſſyon of his owne ſelfe / neyther he wylleth any man to be drawen therunto, by any violence don to hym or by compulſyon. Wherfore the ſame Hilarius agaynſt Auxentius byſſhop of Mylayne (whom he reputed to be an Arriane, and whiche procured men to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Therfore accordynge to the trouthe, and to the open and playne intencyon and mynde of the apoſtle, and of ſayntes, whiche of all other, were the cheyfeſt doctours or teachers, of the churche, or of the faythe.

But let vs ſaye, by the doctryne <note place="margin">The lawe of the goſpell to ſuffycyent is the lyfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtynge.</note> of the goſpell we are ſuffycyentlye dyrected in the thynges to be done, and in the thynges to be auoyded and eſchewed in this preſent lyfe, and that for the ſtate of the world to come eyther to the gettynge of euerlaſtynge lyfe, or to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auoydynge or eſcapynge of euerlaſtynge punyſſhement / for the whiche endes and purpoſes the ſcrypture was made / and not for the worldly reducynge of the contentious de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of men, vnto equalytie, or dewe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menſuracyon, concernynge the ſtate or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fycyencie of this preſent lyfe. For chryſte came not in to this worlde, to rule or ſtrayghten ſuche maner dedes, for this preſent lyfe, but onely for the lyfe to come. And therfore the rule of temporall and worldly actes of men, ben ſondry maners and dyuerſe facyons dyrectynge vnto theſe endes. For the one, that is to ſaye the lawe of god / teacheth that in no wyſe we ought to ſtryue, or go to law, or to aſke our owne agayne afore a iudge / albeit it doth not forbyd this. And therfore it gy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth no ſpecyall preceptes of ſuche thynges, as we haue ſayd afore. But the other rule of theſe actes or dedes, that is to wyt the lawe of man: teacheth theſe thynges &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth tranſgreſſours to be punyſſhed: wherfore in the. xii. of Luke whan a certayne man deſyred of chryſte worldly or temporall iudgement betwene hym &amp; his brother: Chryſt made anſwere.

As yf he had ſayde, I am not come to exercyſe ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall iudgement / wherfore the gloſe there ſayth / he dothe not vouche ſaue to be iudge of ſutes or ſtryffes in the lawe, nor to be iudge or vmpere of worldly goodꝭ and ſubſtaunces, whiche hath the iudgement bothe of quycke and deed, and the arbytrement of them all. Therfore the actes or dedes of men coulde not be ſufficy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12929:76"/>
meaſured or ruled by the lawe of god, or by the euangelycall lawe, for the ende of this preſente worlde. And in dede the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menſuratyue rules of ſuche dedes, to the proporcyon which men lawfully deſyre for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of this preſent lyfe, ben taught in the ſame lawe / but ſuppoſed eyther gyuen or elles to be gyuen, and taughte of the lawes of men / without the which alſo for defaulte &amp; lacke of iuſtice, it myght chaunce throughe the occaſyon and contencyon of men fyghtynge, and ſeperacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and departynge of them, and the inſuffycyencie of mannes lyfe in this world which thynge in a maner all men hate and auoyde naturally. It can not be ſayd therfore accordynge to trouthe: that the lawe or doctryne of the goſpell is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte. For it is not ordayned &amp; apte to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfeccyon, of worldly maters.

And to this ſentence, as beynge vndoubtedly true: the gloſe after the mynde of Gregory beareth wytneſſe, vpon the ſyxte chapytre of the fyrſte epyſtle to the Corynthyanes, where he ſaythe.

Nowe yf he had vnderſtande by the wyſdome of exteryour thynges, and of erthly cauſes or contencyons the holy ſcrypture: he wolde not haue ſayde afterwarde / but they whiche are induced with ſpyrytuall gyftes, that is to ſaye with holy ſcrypture: ought not to be entangled with erthlye buſyneſſes / neyther wolde haue ſeperated ſuche perſones, accordyng to this doctryne / one of them from the other. Moreouer, becauſe the apoſtle &amp; alſo the ſayntes after one expoſycyon, had afore called them, whiche had ſuche know lege and wyſdome / that is to wytte of exteryoure thynges / contemptyble perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the churche / whiche thynge neyther the apoſtle, neyther yet the ſayntes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundynge his wordes, meaned or thought of them / that were lerned in the holy ſcrypture. Thus than, how many and what maner legale actes of men there be / by what lawes alſo and iudges / howe, and whan, and by whome, they are to be ruled, made ſtrayghte, and amended.

Albeit after yf the lawe be perfyte he ought to be ſertyfyed of the nature of wordꝭ, or ſayenges, of workes and dedes, by the teachers, workers &amp; practyſers of ſcyences &amp; artes. Than to the queſtyon purpoſed &amp; moued in the begynnynge of this chapytre: I do ſaye / that <note place="margin">Nota.</note> any maner teacher of the dyuyne ſcryptures, whiche is or ought to be euery preeſt may &amp; ought to iudge / by iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the fyrſt ſygnyfycacion, whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cryme wherof any perſone is accuſed, by hereſye or not.

For there ben many deceyuers / which are to be reproued &amp; conuynced. But the ſeconde thynge / that is to wyt, whether ſuche treſpaſſe be prohybyted by the lawe or not / the prynce ought to know. And the thyrde thynge whiche he ought to knowe / is whether he, to whoſe charge that cryme is layde, haue ſayde or exercyſed the cryme of ſpeakynge or doynge hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.

And therfore accordynge to the trouth, &amp; after the mynde of ſaynt Iherome, a byſſhop is none other thynge, than an archpreeſt. And that the eſſencyall dygnyte of a byſſhop and of a preeſte is all one, neyther that one byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop hath more large eſſencyall auctoryte, than an other byſſhoppe.

Paule the apoſtle, not of men or by man: but by Iheſus chryſte, &amp; god y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father / where the gloſe ſayth after the mynde of Ambroſe. Paule the apoſtle, not electe or ſent by men, that is to wyt, by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias <note place="margin">Ambroſe. Paule was not ſent of Ananias.</note> as certayne men ſayd / or by other men, as certayne were elected and ſent by the apoſtles / and a lytle after it foloweth in the ſame gloſe, alter the mynde of Auguſtyne. For the other apoſtles ſemed to be greatter, becauſe they were afore. And this apoſtle ſemed to be leaſte / becauſe he was laſte / but hereof he appereth more worſhypfull / becauſe the fyrſt apoſtles were made and ordayned by chryſte beynge yet partlye a man, that is to ſaye mortall / but the laſt apoſtle (that is to wyt Paule) was conſtituted and made by chryſte nowe beynge whole god / that <note place="margin">Paule was more worthy apoſtle.</note> is to ſaye vtterly mortall / and by god the father / whiche dyd or wrought this by the ſame / and that he myght open and declare wherfore he ſayd neyther by man / he ſayth afterward, which hath rayſed hym vp from deathe. And ſo he hath more worthelye or worſhypfullye made me by chryſte beynge i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mortall: than he dyd the other by chryſt beynge mortal. Agayne the apoſtle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fyrmynge this afterwarde in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame chapytre, ſayth thus. I gyue you knowlege or do you to wyt brethern: that the goſpell, whiche hath ben preached of me: is not after man / for I haue not receyued it, or learned it of man: but by the reuelacyon of Iheſu chryſte / where the gloſe after the mynde of Auguſtyne ſayth. I do you to wytte bretherne, that the goſpell whiche hath ben preached of me: is not after the mynde of any man, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge me / &amp; verely it is not of man: for I haue not receyued it, neyther learned it of man, ſo that man dyd electe me to preache it, or inioyne me to preache it. Ney<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther I learned it of man teachynge me: but by the reuelacyon of Ieſu chryſte. Lo here, that neyther Peter, neyther any other of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtles, or any man hath choſen Paule, or ſent hym or inioyned to hym the mynyſtery of preachynge the goſpell. The ſame is to be iudged alſo of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other apoſtles. Peter therfore had no powre (&amp; moche leſſe than he had coactyue iuryſdyccion) of god i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medyately, vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſtles / neyther of i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtytutige them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offyce of preeſthode / neyther to ſegregate and departe them in ſondre, or to ſende them to the offyce of preachynge / ſauynge onely that this maye ſafelye be graunted, that Peter was afore or aboue other in <note place="margin">Howe and af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

And that this is trewe which we haue ſayd / it is an euyde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t token, ſeynge that we do not fynde
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12929:89"/>
any where in the ſcrypture, that Peter toke vpon hym any auctoryte ſyngulerly aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other apoſtles / but rather that he kepte and vſed egalytie with them / for he toke not to hym ſelfe auctoryte, to determyne ſuche thyngꝭ which were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full concernynge the preachynge of the goſpell, whiche pertayneth to doctryne &amp; teachynge / but ſuche thyngꝭ, as were doubtfull, concernynge this buſynes: were determyned by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune delyberacion or counceyle of the apoſtles, and of other chryſten men moſt learned / and not by the determynacyon of Peter alone: or of a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other apoſtle ſeuerally by hym ſelfe / wherfore in the. xv. chapytre of the actes, when a dyſſencyon was ryſen amonge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachers of the goſpell, whether it was neceſſarye to cyrcumcyſe the chryſten men that were vncyrcumcyſed, for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge or obtaynynge of euerlaſtynge ſaluacyon: and certayne ſayd, that it was neceſſarie, but Paule and Barnabas ſayd playnly agaynſt it: the apoſtles and the ſenyours aſſembled togyther to take conſultacyon of this mater / vpon which Peter and Iames ſayd, that it was not neceſſarye / to whoſe ſentence and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſenyours and the other apoſtles conſented / wherfore it foloweth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes in the texte. Than it pleaſed the apoſtles, and ſenyours, with the whole congregacyon, to choſe men, and to ſende them to Antyoche / with Paule &amp; Bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nabas. &amp;c. ſendynge letters by theyr handes / &amp; the maner of theyr wrytynge, was lyke to the maner of a delyberacyon or conſultacyon in this fourme and facyon. The apoſtles, and ſenyours, and brethern, to the brethern of the gentyles, whiche are in Antioche, in Siria, and Cilicia: ſendeth greatynge. &amp;c. A lyke thynge is alſo had afterwarde in the ſame chapytre, whan it is ſayd / it pleaſed vs therfore beynge aſſembled togyther in one, to choſe men, and to ſende them vnto you / a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne the ſame thynge is had in the ſame chapytre a lytle after / it hathe pleaſed the holy ghoſt and vs, to laye no more burthayne vpon you.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyll / whiche determyned the doubte / whiche choſe meſſengers / and which wrote. And by this auctoryte of the whole congregacyon: the thynge whiche was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyned and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, was of ſtrength / for the congregacyon of the apoſtes was of more or greatter auctorite, than Peter alone / or any other apoſtle by hym ſelfe / wherfore we do rede, that Peter was ſent by the congregacion in to Sama<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye / as it is euydent in the. viii. chapytre of the actes, by theſe wordes / whan the a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſtles had herde whiche were at Iheruſalem, that the Samaritanes had recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the worde of god / they ſent to them Peter &amp; Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Why then or wherof dothe certayne curſed flaterers take vpon them, to ſaye, that any byſſhop hathe fulnes of powre gyuen to hym by chryſte, not onely vpon laye men, but alſo vpon clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes / ſeynge that ſaynt Peter, or any other apoſtle, neuer preſumed to aſcribe ſuch maner powre vnto hym ſelfe, neyther by worde or deade / wherfore they which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrme and ſay this, are to be laughte to ſcorne, and nothynge to be beleaued, and leſſe to be feared / ſeynge that the ſcryptures crye playnlye the contrarye in the lyt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terall and manyfeſt ſence of them. For ſaynt Peter had neuer ſuche powre vpon the apoſtles or other: but he kepte rather equalyte with them, accordynge to the
<pb facs="tcp:12929:90"/>
precepte of chryſte, as we haue ſayd before / wherfore it is red in the. xxiii. of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe.

This ſentence alſo is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyrmed by the apoſtle in the ſeconde chapytre to the Galatianes, where he ſayth. And I went vp to Iheruſalem accordynge to the reuelacyon / and I conferred with them, the goſpell, which I do preache amonge the Gentyles / where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gloſe after the mynde of Auguſtyne ſayth. And I dyd not learne of them as of ſupery<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ours / that is to wyt of Peter, nor of the other more pryncypall apoſtles, of whom it ſhall be ſpoken hereafter. But I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred with them: as with my frendes, and peers, or felowes. The ſame is ſhewed agayne afterwardes in the ſame chapytre whan the apoſtle ſayd / but whan Peter was com to Antioche: I withſtode hym openly to his face, becauſe he was reprouable. &amp;c. where the gloſe after the mynde of ſaynt Iherome ſayth, they gaue nothynge to me, but I gaue to Peter / and it foloweth there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequentlye, I reſyſted or withſtode hym, as his peer or matche / for he wolde not haue ben bolde to do this: excepte he had knowen hym ſelfe not to be inferyor. Beholde here therfore, that Paule was egall to Peter in offyce &amp; dygnyte, &amp; not inferyor / albeit that Peter was ſenior to hym in age, and alſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor afore hym in tyme. Lykewyſe it appereth that neyther ſaynt Peter, nor any other apoſtle, had preemynence or powre &amp; auctoryte aboue other, in the dyſtrybu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynge of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall goodes, which were offered to the prymatyue churche / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is red in the. iiii. of the actes / for as many as were poſſeſſyoners of landes &amp; <note place="margin">Saynt Pet had no more auctorite tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had.</note> houſes / ſolde them, and broughte the pryces of them, and layde them afore the fete of the apoſtles / and they were deuyded to eche man: after as eche one had neade. Lo here, that the dyſpoſycion &amp; orderynge of the temporall thynges, whiche were offred vnto the churche: was done by the apoſtles in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune togyther / and not by Peter alone / for it is not ſayde they layde afore the fete of Peter: but afore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fete of the apoſtles / neyther is it ſayd and Peter deuyded: but they were deuyded. &amp;c. ¶ Tel me therfore, wherby, or from whence, or howe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the auctoryte to the byſſhop of Rome, for to dyſtrybute ſuche thynges accordynge to his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or elles to clayme as dewe to hym ſelfe alone, the thynges bequeſt in mennes teſtamentꝭ for charytable cauſes, &amp; to good and godlye vſes / but yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted to other men for to be kepte or dyſtrybuted / ſeynge that it is neyther laufull to hym alone neyther yet with an other, neyther by the law of god, nor yet of man, to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunde or clayme ſuche maner thynges, whiche hath ben co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted and betaken to the faythfull cuſtody of other men by reaſonable lawes / as by the wyll of the teſtatours, or of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo ordayned / for let the teſtatour ſay or wyll any thynge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernynge that whiche is his owne, &amp; it ſhall be a lawe, as it is wryten in other placꝭ. For there can be no cauſe or reaſon taken of the holy ſcrypture, which maye make vs to beleaue, that this powre belongeth to the byſſhop of Rome, or elles to any other byſſhop / but rather the contrarye / but yf theſe legacies or bequeſtꝭ were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted (by the kynge) to the churche of a certayne and a determynate dyoceſe, for to be dyſtrybuted: than ſhall it appertayne to thoſe byſſhoppes whiche are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd dyoceſe / but in no wyſe to the pope of Rome. And the cauſe of this is, for that the byſſhop of Rome neyther hathe, neyther had, of chryſte any powre or auctoryte aboue the other, that be byſſhops or preeſtes as well as he. And this was one of the thyngꝭ purpoſed of vs ſyns y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begynnynge of this chapytre. For as Peter had not any ſuche prerogatyue or powre aboue the other apoſtles / euen ſo neyther the ſucceſſours of Peter in the epyſcopall ſee of Rome, hathe any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatyue aboue the ſucceſſours of the other apoſtles. For Peter had no powre or

auctoryte to gyue vnto them preeſthode, apoſtleſhyp, or the dygnyte of a byſſhop for all they toke this powre or auctorytie i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medyatlye of chryſte / &amp; not by the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſterie of Peter, more than Peter toke it by the mynyſterie of them / as we haue proued heretofore euydentlie of the ſcrypture. And ſaynt Auguſtyne alſo ſayth <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> the ſame expreſſely in his boke of the queſtions of the newe &amp; of the olde teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the. lxxxiiii. queſtyon: where he ſayth thus.

For all thoughe it were graunted, that the apoſtles were vnegall in aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte: yet had not Peter therfore, nor any other apoſtle by the vertue of the wordes of ſcrypture, any powre vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, to inſtytute or depoſe them, neyther as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge to the dygnyte of preeſthode / which we haue called the eſſencyall dygnyte neyther as touchynge the ſendynge or determynynge, and appoyntynge of them to any certayne place or people / neyther to the interpretynge of ſcrypture: or of the catholicall fayth, neyther as touchynge to coactyue iuryſdyccyon of any man in this world / wherfore of neceſſyte it ſemeth to folowe, that neyther any ſucceſſour of any of them ſyngularly or ſpecyallye (after what ſoeuer maner he be ſo called) hath any of the aboueſayde maners of powre, vpon the ſucceſſours of the other. And this may be euydently confermed by the auctoryte of ſaynt Iherome which we brought in, of his epyſtle to Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre aboute the ende of the chapytre laſt aforegone.</p>

But they ſeme otherwhyles to haue ben determyned and aſſygned to ſome ſpecyall nacyon or people: by the reuelacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of god / for aſmoch as the apoſtle ſayth of hymſelfe in the. xxii. of the actes.

¶ The ſame alſo as I ſayde is agreable to reaſon. For the caſe put, that any byſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhop or other curate, beynge aſſygned and appoynted to a certayne prouynce or people / were gone forthe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouynce co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted to hym (as we ſe it chaunce now adayes more ofte than is nedefull or conuenyent) &amp; dyd mete other by ſome chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, or elles of purpoſe, with ſome infydell and not baptyſed, but yet deſyrynge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by hymſelfe, or by ſome other perſone, of the ſayde curate to be baptyſed and made chryſtened / yf the ſayde curate do the baptyſe hym kepynge the forme of the ſacrament, this is vndoubted, that this man is verely and truely baptyſed, albeit peraduenture, that he dothe ſynne deedly, whiche doth ſo baptyſe any man in the prouynce not ſubiected or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted to hym / wherfore we maye conclude, that no man is determyned or aſſygned, by the epiſcopall or ſacerdotale powre which we haue called the eſſencial powre: vnto any certayne place or people, but this powre indyfferentlye concerneth all nacyons and people. But yet ſuche determynacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aſſygnementes haue ben made ſomtyme by dyuyne reuelacyon / as in the prymatyue churche / but more often by the ordynacyon of man, namely nowe adayes / and that for cauſe of auoydynge ſclaunder, &amp; occaſyon of offence amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the byſſhoppes and preeſtes, one of them with an other, and for other euydent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Laſte of all we ſhall ſhewe / that after the dethe of the apoſtles, or in theyr abſence, the ſecondarye inſtytucion of byſſhops / and of other ſpyrytuall mynyſters / or mynyſtres of the churche, after the moſt conuenyent manere poſſyble to the conuerſacyon of man / was done by the vnyuerſyte, or hole congregacion and multytude of the chryſten people, in the place or prouynce, ouer whiche the ſayde byſſhoppes or mynyſtres ought to be inſtytuted and ordayned / rather than by any other pertyculare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye or perſone / and ſo afterwarde the other thynges ſhall be ſhewed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly.</p>
               <p>¶ The fyrſte therfore of theſe maye appere, that is to wytte, that there can be no more conuenyent cauſe aſſygned, of the aforeſayd determynacion of the apoſtles to a certayue place. &amp;c. than the deuyne reuelacyon, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conuenyent delyberacion of them amonge themſelues, for as moche as in neyther of theſe two: there ſemeth any erroure or malyce to haue chaunced or come betwene / for of the deuyne reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacyon no man doubteth. And as for the eleccyon made by the apoſtles: it ſemeth probable, and to be beleued, that they were inſpyred with the holye ghoſt / as we haue alledged here tofore of the. xx. chapytre of Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ¶ Furthermore I ſay that of the ſecondary inſtytucyon or determynacyon or aſſygnement of theyr fyrſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſours, namely afore the conuerſyon of peoples / the imedyate cauſe effectyue or doer, was and ought to be, all or many of the apoſtles, or ſome one alone of them after the maner aforeſayd / as yf all togyther, or many, or elles but one alone of them: were founde in that place. And this is proued fyrſt by the ſcrypture / for we rede in the. vi. of the actes that the apoſtles dyd after this maner, in the inſtytucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12929:94"/>
of the deacons, yea and that touchynge the fyrſte and eſſencyall (as we do call it) inſtytucion of them. For it is ſayde in the ſame chapytre. They ſette theſe men (vnderſtande thou whiche were to be made deacons) afore the ſyght of the apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and they (that is to wyt the apoſtles) makynge theyr prayers: layde theyr han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des vpon them. They dyd not than bryng them to Peter alone, but they brought them afore the ſyght of the apoſtles.

And this is alſo agreable to reaſon. For it is lyke to be trewe, that all or many of the apoſtles togyther, toke more ſure councell, and dyd leſſe erre aboute the perſone to be promoted outher to preeſthode, or to any other holy ordre than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of them taken ſeuerally by hymſelfe / as we alledged afore in the laſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pytre, that for this cauſe, they aſſembled with the other ſenyours or preeſtes, to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termyne the doubte aboute the lawe of the goſpell in the facte or worke of cyrcu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſyon. Agayne by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune aſſente, was taken awaye the mater and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon of offence and contencyon / whiche of lykelyhode ſhulde haue ryſen amonge them: yf any one of them in the preſence of the other wold haue taken vnto hym any powre or ſuperyoryte aboue other / whiche contencyon ryſen amonges them euen by chryſtes tyme, Chryſte determyned and ended by this, ſhewynge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſynge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> equalyte of them, as we haue here tofore alledged of the. xxii. of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe / and the. xxii. of Luke / and alſo haue ſhewed it more largely by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtle alſo, and the expoſycyons of the ſayntes in the chapytre laſt afore gone.

And that ſuche maner inſtytucion myght lawfully, and ought to be made by one of them alone, it maye be proued by this, that therby was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the beſte, and moſt conuenyent paſtor. For outher it was lawfull for eche one of them at his owne pleaſure to make hymſelfe ouerſeer vnto other in the myny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterye of the goſpell, or els this thynge ought to be done by the eleccion of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytude beynge ſubiecte, or elles by ſome of the apoſtles beynge there prſente.

For in the olde tyme it was a great abhomynacyon, and ſhulde haue ſemed a cyuyle monſtre, yf clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, namely, preeſtes, or byſſhops, had taken harnes or weaponed them ſelues: or had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded other men to take on harneys to fyght / wherfore ſaynt Ambroſe in the place afore alledged in the. ix. chapytre of this dyccyon: ſayth thus.

For ſo we reade of Symachus beynge a man of Sarde by byrthe and nacion / that he beynge coelected with one Lawrence, through dyſcorde, was confyrmed pope of Rome by the iudgement whiche Theodorichus kynge, made or dyd gyue.

So alſo in the cronycle of Martyne, where he ſpeaketh of Benedicte the. ix. it is red of two, that were elected contenciouſlye, and depoſed by the emperyal cenſure and iudgement of Henry, whiche than was emperour of Rome. For to the ſame pryncypall or cheyfe auctoryte it appertayneth, to depoſe, &amp; deſtytute any thynge yf it ſhall be expedyent, to whiche it belongeth to inſtytute it. For aſmoche than, as euery byſſhop ought to be elected by the prynce, by the auctoryte of the ſame he may be deſtytuted or depoſed / as it hath ben certyfyed in the. xvii. of this dyccion. ¶ The byſſhops of Rome therfore, and of other prouynces, and the preeſtes, and all the colledge or companye of clarkes, lyued after the example of chryſte and of his apoſtles, vnder the coactyue iuryſdyccyon, and gouernaunce of them: whiche

For it is playnly and openly contrary to the holſome doctryne, wordes, and ſentence of the apoſtle Paule in the, xiii. to the Romaynes / in the. vi. to the Epheſyanes / in the. vi. of the fyrſte epyſtle to Tymothe / and in the ſeconde and thyrde chapytres of the ſeconde epyſtle to Tite.

And in dede this fydelyte of the forſayde ſubiectes (as Tullius ſaythe in his fyrſte boke intytled De officiis) is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or groundeſell of all iuſtyce / whiche fydelyte betwene the gouernours and the ſubiectes, whoſoeuer gothe aboute to dyſſolue or breake: he gothe aboute to gette vnto hym ſelfe no leſſe thynge, than that he maye accordynge to his owne entent and pleaſure, ouertourne and deſtroye the powre and hyghe auctorytie of all pryncꝭ and gouernours of the cyuyle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munyte, and afterwarde to brynge the aforeſayd ſubiectes, in to his owne ſeruytute and bondage.

But this admytted that Peter by theſe wordes had receyued this auctoryte: yet it is not concluded nor foloweth hereof, but onely that he was inſtytuted paſtor or herdyſman afore other in tyme.

And the ſame is had in the. xxii. of Mathewe. For chryſte ſayde vnto them. But be not you in wyll to be called mayſter / amonge your ſelfe one to an other / for you haue but one mayſter and all you are brethren / that is to ſaye all you are equall.

And whan thou arte ones conuerted, confyrme thou thy brethren. Of whiche texte ſome men do inferre and conclude two thynges / the one is that the faythe of the churche of Rome onely can not fayle / becauſe that chryſte by the faythe of Peter, vnderſtande alſo the faythe of the ſucceſſours of Peter / and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlye, that the byſſhoppe ſucceſſoure vnto hym is the cheyfe and pryncypall of all other. The ſeconde is, that by theſe wordes Chryſte made hym prelate of the other apoſtles / but I do ſaye, that neyther of theſe two thynges do folowe of the wordes of Chryſte, by the vertue and ſtrengthe of the wordes. For in this con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſequence or argument, the contrary rather of that that is inferred and concluded, ſtandeth with the antecedent or with that wherof it is inferred. Secondarylye I do proue by the ſcrypture that neyther of them dothe folowe / and that by the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of chryſte hym ſelfe and none other. The fyrſt of the two, that is to ſaye, that the faythe of the churche of Rome onely can not fayle, I proue to be falſe, in that that chryſte ſayde to them all in the laſte chapytre of Mathewe. Go you therfore and teache all nacyons. &amp;c. And loo I am with you at all tymes euen vnto the endynge of the worlde. Yf chryſte than dyd promyſe hym ſelfe to be with the other apoſtles, at all tymes, euen vnto the worlde ſhall be at an ende, it foloweth than that he vnderſtode alſo of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſucceſſours of the other apoſtles, yf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other aucthory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Agayn yf the byſſhoppe of Rome be called ſyngularelye or ſpecyallye the ſucceſſoure of Peter, it is vndoubted and euydently knowen, that a certayne heretyke, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne heretykes haue ben made byſſhoppes in that ſee / as it hathe ben ſhewed of Liberius and of certayne other popes &amp; it hath ben proued in the. xvi. of this dyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon: that the byſſhop of Rome is not ſyngularlye or ſeuerallye the ſucceſſour of <note place="margin">Liberiꝰ pope.</note> ſaynt Peter / for the cauſes aſſygned accordynge to the ſcryptures in the ſame cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pytre. And the ſeconde conſequence or argument lykewyſe is of no ſtrength that is, that the byſſhop ſucceſſour vnto Peter is the cheyfe and pryncypall of al other which thynge I proue alſo by the ſcrypture. For Paule gaue ſomwhat vnto Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, and dyd profyte and helpe hym in the goſpell, and not contrarye wyſe Peter vnto Paule / as we haue alleaged heretofore ſuffyciently of the ſeconde chapytre to the Galatia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the. xvi. chapytre of this parte. And (which is a more euydent thynge) The wordes of chryſte afore alledged of the. xx. of Mathewe, and of the. xxii. of Luke: deſtroyeth this conſequence, by whiche wordes playnly &amp; openly chryſte defyned &amp; hathe determyned the contrary / wherfore the gloſe expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dynge this place ſayth thus.

whiche certayne men go aboute to proue and conclude the ſame, becauſe that chryſte ſayde to ſaynt Peter, fede my ſhepe / fede my lambes: it is to be ſayd fyrſt, that after the mynde of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gloſe this is the ſence and meanynge of this texte, that to fede the ſhepe: is to comforte them that beleueth, that they do not deſpayre, and <note place="margin">To fede ſhepe what it beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth.</note> to prouyde earthly ſubſydyes, ſuccour, or releaue, yf nede be: to theyr ſubiectes / to gyue them examples of vertues / to withſtande the aduerſaryes of the faythe / to correcte or amende them that ſynne or do amyſſe / and it foloweth in the gloſe.

Or elles it is to be ſayd, and very probablye, &amp; as me thynke agreable &amp; accordynge to the truthe, that for ſo moche chryſte ſayde vnto Peter, fede thou my ſhepe: that he wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytte and betake ſpecyally vnto hym, becauſe of his conſtancie and boldnes, the people of Iſraell or of the Iewes whiche was a ſtyfnecked and ſtubburne people towarde god / as it appereth in the. xxxiii. of Exodus, and the apoſtle alledgeth by Eſaie the profyte, in the laſt chapytre of the actes / for chryſt cam pryncypally to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerte and ſaue the ſayd peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple / wherfore he ſayd in the. xv. of Mathewe, I am not ſent but vnto the ſhepe, which are peryſſhed of the houſe of Iſraell / vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de thou, I am not ſent pryn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cypally.

For that conferrynge of his goſpell with them, ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was all one kynde of doctryne: all ſpottes or dyuerſite of leprye cleane ſhaken awaye. This than was the cauſe of his conferrynge of his goſpell with them / that all ſcrupules and doubtfulnes of the varyete and dyuerſyte of his doctryne &amp; theyrs, ſhuld be rydde and taken awaye from the hearers. And this is it whiche the gloſe had ſayde afore: after the mynde of Auguſtyne. For he ſayd I went vp agayne to Iheruſalem. &amp;c.

And I dyd aſcende not one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly after this dyſpoſycyon and ordre, as I haue reherced: but alſo accordyng to the reuelacyon of god.

And vnto the auctortye wherby he gothe about to fortyfye theſe ſaynges, taken of the. xvi. of Mathewe, Thou art Peter and vpon this ſtone I wylledyfy my churche. &amp;c. it hath ben anſwered heretofore. ¶ And vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reaſon or argument, <note place="margin">9</note> by whiche it was deduced that the churche is but one / and that there is but one pryncypall or hygheſt byſſhop, becauſe of the vnyte of the faythe, accordynge to the mynde of the apoſtle in the. iiii. chapytre to the Epheſyans: it is to be ſayd, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge the churche in his propre ſygnyfycacyon for the multytude or congregacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of chryſten people: that there is ſo but one churche as there is but one faythe. <note place="margin">One churche.</note> And becauſe there is not one ſynguler fayth in nombre, in all chryſten men, but one faythe in kynde or in generall: therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> argumente concludeth not, that the <note place="margin">One faythe in kynde.</note> churche is otherwyſe one than ſo, that is to wyt in generall / And whan it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the churche is not one but by the reaſon that there is one ſyngulare byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in nombre, whiche is ſuperyoure to all other.

And yf there were any ſuche neceſſyte compellynge hereunto by the lawe of god: yet the ſymylytude holdeth not. For it is not all one and the ſame neceſſyte that there be but one orde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer or gouernoure in one houſe, and that there be but one gonernoure in a whole cytie or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munyte or in many prouyncꝭ.

For this reaſon ſhuld conclude alſo that there oughte to be but one orderer or gouernour in nombre, in the hole worlde / whiche is neyther ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pedyent, neyther true. For it is ſuffycyent to the quyete conuerſacyon and lyuyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge togyther of men, that there be but one prynce or hed gouernoure in nombre, in euery one prouynce, as we haue ſayde in the. xvii. of the fyrſt dyccyon or parte. But it ſemeth not yet to haue ben proued, that there ought to be but one coacty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue iudge of all men of the neceſſyte of eternall ſaluacion, albeit that the vnyte of ſuche a coactyue iudge ſemeth to be more neceſſarelye requyred amonge chryſten men than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnyte: of one vnyuerſall or generall byſſhop / for becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a general prynce maye kepe cryſten people in vnyte: more than may an vnyuerſall or gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall byſſhop. For in the olde tymes ſyſmatykes were compelled by the prynces to kepe the vnyte of the faythe, But they coulde not haue ben compelled by the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, becauſe they lacked auctoryte coactyue, whiche ſayd auctoryte is not due to them nor ſyttynge or ſemely for them in that that they are byſſhops, as it hath ben prouyd in the. x. chapytre of the fyrſt parte of this boke, and hath be more lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely confyrmed by the ſcrypture and auctorytes of ſayntes, and by other reaſons in the. iiii. v. viii. ix. and. x. chapytres of this dyccion. ¶ And vnto that auctoryte of Ihon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the. xv. chapytre, that there ſhal be made one folde, and one paſtor, or <note place="margin">12</note> one herdyſman: it is to be ſayde that chryſte ſpake of his owne ſelfe / for he onely was the generall herdyſman, and the hed or cheyf and pryncypall of all paſtores <note place="margin">One paſtor or herdyſman</note> and herdyſmen, and none other after hym lykewyſe as he onely was the hed and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacyon of the churche, as we haue ſhewed in the. xvi. of this dyccyon and alſo haue repeted in verye many other places / &amp; this was the open &amp; playn lyteral ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; mynde of ſaynt Pet<expan>

But Remigius ſaythe, and more to the purpoſe and more agreablye to the lettre, he was ſent ſpecyally to the ſaluaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of the Iewes, that he ſhulde teache them alſo by his bodelye preſence. Albeit that chryſte accordynge to the expoſycyon of ſayntes, was ſente to the ſaluacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all men, yet ſpecyally and pryncypally he was ſent to the ſaluacyon of the Iewes / as the wordes alſo of chryſt do ſounde in the goſpell of Mathewe, whan <note place="margin">Chryſte was ſent to the Iewes.</note> he ſayd.

And becauſe this people hathe alwayes ben hardnecked, &amp; ſturdye or ſtubburne, as it appereth in the. xxxii. chapytre of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, and alſo a kyller of the prophetes, as chryſte, which is very trouche itſelfe, ſayde in the. xiii. of Luke.

Chryſte therfore, whan he had ſayde vnto Peter, fede my ſhepe: he dyd not by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytte a more generall cure or charge vnto Peter, than vnto other, but rather a more ſpecyall charge of a certayne people. For there can not be a more generall cure or charge than that, whiche he gaue to all the apoſtles in the laſt of Mathewe / and in the. xx. of Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / whan he ſayde. Go you therfore and teache all nacyons. And take you or receyue you the holy ghoſt / whoſe ſynnes you ſhall forgyue: they are forgy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen. &amp;c. For by theſe wordes all the apoſtles receyued paſtoral auctoryte and cure / and that in comparyſon vnto all men indyfferentlye / as ſaynt Auguſtyne alſo <note place="margin">By what wordes the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued auctoryte</note> dyd ſay in his boke of the queſtyons of the newe teſtament, in the. 94. queſtyon, and we haue alledged and brought in his wordes heretofore in the. xvi. chapytre of this dyccion.

And alſo becauſe we haue oftentymes by the ſcrypture proued the contrarye, of that whiche they do ſaye. But yf they do meane or vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtande, that full powre, by the inſtytucyon of man i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medyatlye, than I do grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his ſaynge to be trewe.

And hathe alſo ben latelye repeted and reherced agayne in this chapytre But yf Bernarde do meane this prymacie, which he hathe by the graunt of man i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medyatlye, than he hathe that prymacye, whiche hathe ben graunted to hym a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue other, by the humayne powre.

vnderſtande any prymacye due to the byſſhop of Rome vpon other byſſhops, by the lawe of god, or by the i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medyate ordynacyon of god: than as I dyd before, ſo do I nowe refuſe his ſentence / for the cauſes afore aſſygned. ¶ And to the other ſayenge of the ſame.

For in the place i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medyatly afore alledged, ſpeakynge of this auctoryte and power: he ſayd / why ſhuldeſt thou (that is to wytte the Pope) go about agayne to vſurpe the ſwerde: whiche thou haſt ben ones bydden, to put vp agayne in to the ſheth or ſcabarde.

But alſo that iudge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment, and byddynge or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundynge it <note place="margin">Chryſte refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both the ſwerde and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo iudgement or the offyce of a Iudge.</note> to be drawen out / whan he ſayd in the. xii. of Luke, to hym that deſyred ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner iudgement of hym. Thou man who hath made me iudge or deuyder ouer or vpon you? Of which ſayng of chryſt, with certayne other ſayengꝭ, both of chryſt and of the apoſtles, ſaynt Bernarde treatynge in the fyrſte boke and the. v. chapi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tre De co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratione, as we haue alledged in the. v. of this dyccyon: deſtroyeth the interpretacyon of hym that doth ſo expound or declare hym in this place. For this he ſayth to the ſame Pope. Herken what the apoſtles mynde is concernynge ſuche maner auctoryte. That is to wyt of iudgynge temporall thynges and it is <note place="margin">Bernarde</note> in the. vi. chapytre of the fyrſte to the Coryntheans. Is there not ſo wyſe a man amonge you, whiche maye iudge betwene brother and brother? And it foloweth I do ſpeake it to your rebuke and ſhame. Thoſe, whiche are moſte contemptyble in the churche, make and ordayne them iudges. And therfore after the mynde of the apoſtle, thou doeſt vnſemelye, whiche beynge an apoſtolicall perſon, doeſt vſurpe vnto thy ſelfe a vyle offyce, and the degree of conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptyble perſons. Marke here y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpeaketh of the offyce, not of the execucyon / wherfore the apoſtle Paule alſo inſtructynge a byſſhop, that is to wyt Timothe, ſayde in this wyſe. Let no man that is a warryour to god: entangle hym ſelfe with ſeculer buſyneſſes / but I ſpare or forbere the / for I ſpeake not ſtronge thynges, but poſſyble thynges. Suppoſeſt thou that men nowe adayes wolde ſuffre, yf whan men dyd ſtryue for erthlye inherytaunce, &amp; requyred iudgement of the, thou dydeſt anſwere them with the wordes of chryſte, O men who hathe made me iudge vpon you. In to what maner iudgement ſhuldeſt thou come, and what wolde be iudged of the? what wolde a ruſtycall and vnlerned man ſaye? Thou knoweſt not the pryma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye and preemynence. Thou dyſhonoureſt the honorable and moſte hyghe feate / thou doſte derogate the apoſtles dygnyte / and yet for all that they that ſo ſhall ſaye (as I ſuppoſe) wyll not ſhewe, where at any tyme any of the apoſtles hath

To conclude I rede, that the apoſtles haue ſtande to be iudged / but that they haue ſyt iudgynge: I do not rede. This ſhall be in tyme to come / it hath not ben yet. Is the ſeruaunte than a dymynyſſher of the dygnyte, yf he wyll not be greatter than his lorde and mayſter? or the dyſcyple, becauſe he wyll not be great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter than he that ſent hym? or the ſone, becauſe he wyll not paſſe beyonde the boun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des or lymytes, whiche his fathers hathe ſet? who hathe ordayned me iudge vpon you? ſayth that lorde and mayſter. And ſhall it be iniurye to the ſeruaunt and dyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyple, excepte he do iudge all men? Saynt Bernarde therfore, yea rather Chryſte and the apoſtles, do remoue or take a waye from theyr ſucceſſours the byſſhoppes and preeſtes, not onely the execucyon of ſeculer iudgement: but alſo the offyce or auctoryte of iudgynge of ſuche maner maters / wherfore the ſame Bernarde ſaythe afterwardes. Theſe worldly thynges haue theyr mete iudges, the kynges and prynces of the erthe / why do you inuade the boundes of other men? why do you extende or put forthe your ſythe, in to an other mannes corne? This ſentence agayne he dothe repete, confyrme and fortyfye, in the ſeconde boke, and. iiii. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pytre / and we haue alledged it here to fore, in the. v. of this dyccyon / where, vnto the purpoſe here intended: he ſayth thus / dyd he (that is to wyt Peter the apoſtle) leaue dominion &amp; lordſhyp to his ſucceſſours? here what he ſayth his owne ſelfe, not hauynge dominion, or beynge lordes ouer the clargye: but beynge made the example of the flocke. And becauſe thou ſhalte not ſuppoſe, this to be ſpoken of humylyte, and not rather of trouthe, it is chryſtes owne wordes in the goſpell. The pryncꝭ and rulers of the Gentyles, haue dominion and lordſhyp ouer them / and they whiche haue powre and auctoryte vpon them: are called benefyciall. And it foloweth / but you ſhall not do ſo / it is playne here, that domynyon and lordſhyp is vtterly forbydden the apoſtles. Go thou than, and be bolde to vſurpe to thy ſelfe outher apoſtleſhyp, beynge a lorde: or lordſhyp, beynge an apoſtolyke perſon. Verely thou arte prohybyted from bothe (vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de thou from hauynge bothe togyther.) And this is it whiche the ſame Bernarde addeth afterwardes / yf thou couete to haue bothe togyther at one tyme, thou ſhalte leſe bothe. For els thynke not thy ſelfe to be excepted from the nombre of them: of whom the lorde god complayneth thus. They haue reygned: and not by me. They haue ben pryn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces and rulers, and I haue not knowen them. Agayne he expreſſeth the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence, in a certayne epyſtle to the archebyſſhop of Senone, where he ſaythe thus. So ſaythe theſe ſuggeſtours and councellers of dyſobedyence / but chryſte bothe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, and alſo dyd otherwyſe. Gyue you (ſayd he) vnto Ceſar, thoſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whiche are belongynge to Ceſar / and vnto god: thoſe thynges whiche are appertaynynge to god. And this whiche he ſpake with his mouthe: he dyd gyue dylygence to fulfyll anone after in his dede. He that was the creatour and maker of Ceſar: was redy without delaye, to gyue trybute to Ceſar. For he hath gyuen example to you, that you ſhulde do lykewyſe. And howe ſhuld he denye dewe re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerence to the preeſtꝭ of god, whiche cared or regarded to gyue this reuerence euen to the ſeculer powres alſo? Chryſt than wolde not haue te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral domynyon vpon the prynces of this worlde, but he wolde be ſubiecte vnto them / and alſo gyue vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them due trybute and reuerence, gyuynge an example to all his ſucceſſours, fyrſte to the apoſtles, and in concluſyon to preeſtes and byſſhops, to do the ſame. Agayne expreſſynge the ſame ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce afterwardes more playnly: he ſayth thus / why than O relygious men, doth the auctoryte of preeſtꝭ greue you? do you feare infeſtacyon &amp; noyaunce? but yf you do ſuffre any thynge for ryghtuouſnes ſake, you are blyſſed / you contempne and dyſpyſe ſecularyte, that is to ſay ſeculer pryn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces.

But no man was more ſeculer or worldly, than Pylate, afore whom our lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de ſtode to be iudged. Thou ſhuldeſt not haue (ſayde he) any power ouer me: yf it were not gyuen to the from aboue. Euen than he ſpake for his ſelfe, &amp; had expery<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence on his owne perſon, of that whiche he cryed afterwardes by the apoſtles, in churches or congregacyons. There is no power but of god. And who ſoeuer reſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the power: reſyſteth the ordynacyon of god. Go your way nowe than, and reſyſte the emperour the vycare and depute of chryſte: whan chryſt dyd not reſyſt, no not his aduerſarye or ſaye, yf you dare, that god doth not knowe the dygnyte of the byſſhop of Rome, whan chryſte graunteth the power euen of the Emperou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res deputie in Rome, to haue ben ordayned vpon or ouer hym ſelfe, from heuen a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue.

Chryſte anſwered, that there ſhulde be equalyte alwayes amonge them / and that none of them ſhulde be ſuperyoure in auctoryte to other / yf he dyd intende that ſaynt Peter ſhulde be more pryncypall and heed amonge them: why dyd not chryſte alſo gyue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement or charge to the other apoſtles, that they ſhulde be vnder Peter in paſtorall offyce: leaſte ſo great a myſtery myght be hyd from them and theyr ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, howe great was the heed of the churche? for it is not redde any where in the ſcrypture, that Chryſte gaue any ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to the apoſtles. Howe alſo dyd Peter than gyue the ryghte hande of ſocietie and felowſhyppe vnto Paule? Naye he oughte rather to haue gyuen hym co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, as beynge ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peryoure vnto hym. And to ſaye at one worde all the whole ſcrypture where this mater is touched: ſay the openlye the contrarye hereof. Agayne, thoughe we dyd graunte, that paſtorall cure of the other apoſtles had ben co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted to ſaynt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by chryſte i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medyatly, whiche thynge for all that we haue denyed accordynge to the ſcrypture / yet coulde it not therfore be proued by the ſcrypture, that the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Rome or any other byſſhop, after the deathe of ſaynt Peter, is paſtor of all the other byſſhoppes, by the i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medyate ordynacyon of Chryſte.

That chryſte hathe alwaye remayned the heed of the churche / and all the apoſtles and eccleſyaſtycall mynyſtres are membres / as it appereth playnely in the. iiii. <note place="margin">Membres of the churche.</note> chapytre to the Epheſyans, and in very many other places, of whiche we haue broughte in and recyted many, in the. v. parte of the. xxii. chapytre of this dyccy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this, chryſte hym ſelfe alſo dyd manyfeſtlye ſygnyfye in the laſte of Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thewe, whan he ſayde. And I am with you vntyll the ende of the worlde. And let hym that maketh this obieccyon and reaſon, ſaye, whether the churche alſo be not without a mortall heed oftentymes, whan the Romayne ſeate is vacante and without a byſſhoppe / and it is euydent and vndoubted that yet / And yet it is not therfore to be graunted, that it was lefte inordynate or euyll ordered of chryſte / wherfore we muſte retourne agayne to the thynges aforeſayde, and to thoſe whiche we ſhall ſaye in the ſolucyon of the obieccyon folowynge / but to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſfye and make anſwere more largelye to the reaſon, whiche is apparente, lette vs ſaye formablye or in forme. For whan it is deduced and inferred of it, that chryſte hathe not ordered the churche after the beſt dyſpoſycyon or ordre / yf he had not lefte a determynate man to be heed vnto the ſame churche in his abſence: the illacyon or argument is to be denyed. And as towchynge to the ſayenge of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyſtyne, vpon that texte of Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yf I wyl haue hym to abyde ſo, what is that to the? where he ſaythe, that the lyfe whiche is in faythe, is ſygnyfyed or fygured <note place="margin">Prymacie or pryorytye in tyme.</note> by Peter the apoſtle, for the prymacye of his apoſtleſhyp / I do ſaye, that Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyne meaned the prymacye or pryoryte in tyme.

But we do refuſe them and openly deny them. And where they wyll conclude ſpecyallye, that vnto the byſſhoppe of Rome alone, or elles with his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of clarkes, auctoryte belongeth of inſtytutynge perſons to eccleſyaſtycall offyces, and of gyuynge the temporalles or benefyces appoynted for the ſayde offyces: it is to be ſayde, that yf by the eccleſyaſtycall offyces be vnderſtande the inſtytucyons or determynacyons of preeſtes and of the other ſayde offycers, to the cures and charges of ſoules, outher greatter or ſmaller, in certayne places and to the gouernynge of certayne people / I ſaye that to inſtytute ſuche offyces, or to make the determynacyons of perſones to the ſayde offyces, and to dyſtrybute <note place="margin">The benefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be dyſtrybuted by the prynce</note> or gyue the eccleſyaſtycall temporalles, appoynted for the ſayde offyces / apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth to the chryſten prynce, after ſuche maner as we haue ſayde in the. xvii. of this dyccyon.

Therfore where the contrarye of theſe thynges is obiected and layde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt vs, by the Decrees and Decretalles of the byſſhoppes of Rome, it is to be ſayde, that albeit ſuche maner Decrees or Decretalles, and any other lyke ſcryptures or ſayenges, maye contayne verye manye documentes and counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, profytable bothe for the ſtate of this preſent worlde, and of the worlde to come. Yet in that that they are made by the byſſhoppe of Rome with his colledge of clarkes: and alſo, without the lycence of the chryſten prynce and gouernoure, ſuche ſtatutes do bynde no man to ſynne or payne, and namely temporall.

Wherfore he dyd not exercyſe ſuche maner thynges, to the intente that they ought to exercyſe ſuche thynges: but that he myght ſhewe vnto them hym ſelf to be very god. And to the obieccyon whiche was brought in of the. xxii. of Mathewe, the. xi. of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, and the. xix. of Luke: where it is redde.

For they dyd contende, and ſtryue one with an other, aboute ſeculer thynges, drawynge one an other afore heathen iudges / wherfore the apoſtle monyſſhed them, as a paſtor or herdyſman gyuynge them councell, that they ſhulde conſtytute and make iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vnto them ſelues of the company of chryſten men. And choſe not byſſhoppes or preeſtes, but other that were not byſſhoppes or preeſtes / wherfore the apoſtle ſaythe i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>medyatlye folowynge. Therfore yf you ſhall haue ſeculer iudgementes / ordeyne and ſette them to be iudges, whiche are contemptyble in the churche. I ſaye it to your rebuke / is there none ſo wyſe a man amonge you, whiche maye gyue iudgement betwene his brother and brother? but dothe one brother contende and ſtryue with an other brother in iudgement, afore infydels and heathen iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? whiche texte of the apoſtle the gloſe expoundynge, after the mynde of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Auguſtyne, and Gregorye, ſaythe in this wyſe.

That is to ſaye thus haue you done, by reaſon wherof, the brethren myghte be compelled, to haue recourſe agayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The apoſtle repreueth and rebu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth this in them, ſpeakynge Ironycallye / that is to ſaye, meanynge the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to that, that his wordes dothe ſounde. And becauſe it was not ſemely or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenyent that they ſhulde do ſo therofre he ſayth by and by after. I ſpeake to your ſhamefaſtnes / or to your reuerence / that is to ſaye, I do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde / but I do ſpeake, that you ſhulde be aſſhamed / and you oughte to be aſhamed, that there is not one man amonge you ſo wyſe / that he is able to iudge betwene his brother and brother, but that you muſt nedelye make fooles iudges. And yet for all that theſe fooles are to be made iudges, rather than you ſhulde go to heathen iudges, yf there wante wyſe men amonge you. I ſaye is there not ſo wyſe a man amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge you, but dothe one brother ſtryue with an other brother, in iudgement? whiche is an euyll thynge / yea and that afore heathen iudges / which is a worſe thynge / or elles thus. Therfore yf you ſhall haue ſeculer iudgementes. &amp;c. Becauſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſayd, that they myght iudge of theſe leaſte or ſmaleſt thynges, therfore he doth nowe determyne, who are to be ordayned and appoynted iudges to the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termynynge of ſuche maters / that is to wytte, the contemptyble perſones, which are in the churche. For the greatter or more worſhypfull perſones oughte to gyue attendaunce to ſpyrituall thynges. But you whiche ought to iudge, for aſmoche as you muſt iudge: yet do after this maner. Yf you haue ſeculer byſynes or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters / ordayne or ſette them to be iudges, whiche are contemptyble in the churche / that is to ſaye, ſome wyſe men, which for all that are of leſſe meryte / for the apoſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les, whiche went aboute to preache the goſpell, coulde not gyue attendaunce to ſuche buſyneſſes. The apoſtle wolde therfore, that thoſe wyſe chryſten and holy men whiche contynued and abode ſtyll in one place, and not thoſe whiche ranne aboute from place to place to preache the goſpell / ſhulde be the examyners and iudges of ſuche maner byſynes and cauſes. From whiche we can not excuſe our ſelfe by no maner wayes: althoughe we wolde. For I call god to wytneſſe and recorde that I hadde leuer eache daye worke ſomwhat certayne howres with

my handes, and to haue certayne houres at lybertie, to rede, and praye, or to wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke ſomwhat of the dyuyne ſcryptures, than to ſuffre the troublouſe perplexites of cauſes concernynge ſeculer maters and buſyneſſes or ſtryues whiche are ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be decyded and ended by iudgement, or elles to be preuented &amp; put awaye by entreatynge or goynge betwene. I ſaye, ordayne you or appoynte you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible perſons, and this I do ſaye to your reuerence / that is to wyt, that they ſhulde examyne and iudge erthly cauſes / whiche haue gotten the wyſdome and knowledge of exteryoure or outwarde thynges. And they whiche are enryched with ſpyrytuall gyftes, ought not to be entangled with worldly maters or buſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſes / ſo that whyles they are not compelled to dyſpoſe theſe worldlye goodes, they maye be able to do ſeruyce to the ſuperyour or celeſtyall goodes. But yet it is greatly to be prouyded and taken hede of, that they, whiche are excellent in ſpyrytuall gyftes, do not in any wyſe vtterly forſake the buſyneſſes of theyr we ake neyghbours, but lette them outher co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytte the ſayde buſyneſſes to be ordred and brought to an ende, vnto other mete and conuenyent perſones, or elles take the ſame maters in hande theyr owne ſelues. And theſe ſcryptures of the apoſtle and of ſayntes, are to be noted and marked / for fyrſt it appereth by the ſayd ſcryp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures, that all contencyons (betwene what ſoeuer perſones) aboute ſuche thyngꝭ whiche do not appertayne to the lawe of god, are ſeculer and not ſpyrytuall and do belonge to ſeculer iudgement. For the apoſtle ſpeaketh generallye / and ſo lyke wyſe doth the ſayntes vpon this place / makynge no dyfference (as there is none in dede) betwene the temporall or cyuyle contencyons of preeſtes amonge them ſelues one with an other, and generallye of clarkes, or which are betwene preeſtꝭ and laye men, and betwene them whiche are amonge laye men ſelues, one with an other. For lette the ſophyſter or myſuſer of wordes (I beſeche hym) whiche cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that ſpyrytuall, whiche is vtterlye ſeculer after the mynde and callynge of the apoſtle and of ſayntes, let hym, I ſaye, tell me, whether a preeſte doynge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurye to his brother beynge outher preeſte or not preeſte in worde or dede, dothe a ſpyrytuall iniurye, more than dothe a laye man, yf he do lyke iniurye. For to ſay ſo, it is a folyſſhe and a ſcornefull ſayenge / and to byleue it, is vttermoſte mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. <note place="margin">The outwar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de offence of a preeſte is more ſeculer a great deale then is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a lay man.</note> For without doubte the iniurye whiche is done by a preeſte, is more ſeculer and more deteſtable iniurye than that whiche is done by a laye man / For he ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or treſpaſſeth the more greuouſlye and more ſhamefully, whiche is bounden to teache an other man, bothe by his wordes and alſo by the example of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, not to do iniurye / as it hathe ben ſeryouſlye ſhewed in the. viii. chapytre of this dyccyon.

It appereth alſo ſecondarylye, that the iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gement or to be iudge of ſuche maner actes belongeth not to preeſtes. And that to inſtytute ſuche maner iudge, doth nomore, but peraduenture leſſe appertayne to the auctoryte of them, than of other chryſten men as it hathe ben ſhewed in the xv. of the fyrſte dyccion. And therfore the apoſtle ſayde not to any byſſhoppe or

Neyther whan he wrote to the Coryntheans, dyd he ſaye, the byſſhop or preeſte ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtytute or appoynte to you iudges, but gaue them councell, or tolde them what was beſt to be done / wherfore the gloſe vpon thoſe wordes I do ſpeake it to your ſhame, ſayth thus / as who ſhulde ſay, I do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde you: but I do tell you that you ſhulde be aſhamed.

Albeit that it maye be a generall ſentence agaynſt all men, whiche do gyue occaſyon of euyll to any man: yet after the proceſſe of the texte, it maye ſeme alſo to haue ben ſayde agaynſt the apoſtles / whiche in that they aſked who ſhulde be greatteſt: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to contende and ſtryue amonge them ſelues aboute dygnyte / And yf they ſhulde haue contynued in this vyce: they myght by theyr occaſyon and example gyuen, haue hurte theym whom they called to the fayth, whyles they ſhuld ſe the apoſtles ſtryue and fyght amonge them ſelues aboute honoure. And that whiche Iherome ſaythe of the apoſtles: is to be vnderſtanded alſo of all the ſucceſſoures of theym, byſſhops or preeſtes / whiche for all this yf they wyll not of theyr owne good wylles renounce and forſake ſuche maner iudycyall offyces, and the aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte <note place="margin">Iudycyall of fyces ar to be reuoked from preeſtes.</note> of dyſtrybutynge temporall thynges: but do myſuſe them: the chryſten pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces maye lawfullye, bothe acordynge to the lawe of god and alſo of man, yea and ought in dede to reuoke the ſayde offyces and temporalles from theym / as it hath ben ſhewed and proued in the. xv. of the fyrſte dyccyon, and in the. xvii. of this dyccyon. And as to wchyng to that whiche was obiected of the apoſtle in the ix. of the fyrſte to the Corynthyanes &amp; in the thyrde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeconde to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianes, haue not we power &amp;c. it hath ben diſſolued &amp; anſwered vnto, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. xiiii. of this dyccyon. For ſuche power (as it was ſayde there) is not power of iuryſdye<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon: but power of aſkynge lawfullye accordynge to the lawe of god (howe be it yet not in coactyue iudgemente) meate, drynke, and clothynge, due to hym ſelfe for the mynyſtryng of the goſpell, of ſuch as are able to gyue ſuch thynges. And to that obieccyon, whiche was taken of the. v. chapytre of the fyrſte to Timothe, whan the apoſtle ſayde. Agaynſte a preeſte or ſenyour receyue thou none accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon. &amp;c. It is to be anſwered and ſayde that the apoſtle vnderſtode and meaned here yf a preeſte ought to be openly rebuked of his ſuperyour paſtor, or doctoure. For the apoſtle dyd not bydde any byſſhop or preeſt to exercyſe coactyue iuryſdye<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon apon any man becauſe he knew, this thyng not to appertayne to his aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte nor to the auctoryte of any ſucceſſoure vnto hym. And the apoſtle ſygnyfied here that the correpcyon, whiche belongeth to a prelate or paſtor: is onely by wordes, as it appereth by the wordes that foloweth. Rebuke ſynners afore all men: that the other may haue feare. And he ſayd not, take them, or enpryſon them. But he taughte, that ſuche whiche were incorryble and wolde not be amended with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: ſhulde be eſchewed and the companye of them auoyded. Wherefore in the thyrde to Tyte he ſayth, Eſchewe or auoyde his company that is an heretyke: after the fyrſte and ſeconde correpcion, for becauſe he is condempned by the iudgement of his owne ſelfe.</p>

And whan it is added or put to afterwardes, that the body is vnder the ſou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le, or that the vnreaſonable parte is vtterly or elles after a certayne maner vnder the reaſonable parte: thoughe we do graunt the body to be vnder the ſoule as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge to perfeccyon: yet it foloweth not hereof, that the one is vnder the other, <note place="margin">Howe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is vnder the ſoule.</note> as touchynge to iuryſdyccyon / for he that ſhuld make that illacyon or argument ſhulde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytte the vyce or faulte of argumentacion called fallacia conſequentis.

For no byſſhop or preeſte, in that he is ſuch one, is prynce or coactyue iudge of any man for the ſtate of this preſent world, or yet of the worlde to come / as it hath ben ſhewed in the. iiii. v. and. ix. chapytres of this dyccyon.

There is but one lawe maker and iudge: whiche may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye and delyuer. But this iudge purpoſeth not to iudge any mortall man by ſentence irreuocable, neyther he doth ponyſſhe fynallye or rewarde any man in this worlde / but he purpoſeth to punyſſhe or to rewarde onely in the worlde to co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me / as we haue ſayd, and haue proued by the ſcrypture, in the. ix. of this dyccyon Nowe the byſſhop of Rome, with other prelates or paſtores, is the teacher of ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, <note place="margin">The byſſop of Rome is but a teacher.</note> and as it were the leche or phiſycyon of them: but not prynce or coactyue iudge of them / as we haue ſhewed in the place afore alledged, by the texte of the goſpell and by the apoſtle, Hylarye, and Chryſoſtome, and alſo by ſtronge reaſon. And as touchynge to the reaſon, whiche we brought in moreouer, that lykewyſe as <note place="margin">Obieccyon.</note> corporall thynges are in comparyſon of ſprytuall thynges, ſo is the gouernour of corporall thynges in comparyſon of hym whiche is gouernour of ſprytuall thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: for as moch as it is grounded vpon the ſame rote in a maner with the reaſon aforegone: it is to be auoyded and diſolued in a maner vnder the ſame or lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner. For the fyrſt propoſycyon of this reaſon may be impugned and proued falſe <note place="margin">The anſwer. Obiccyon. Anſwere.</note> many maner wayes. And as touchynge the ſeconde propoſycyon of this reaſon where it is ſayde that corporall thynges are vnder ſprytuall thynges, yf by this wordes be vnderſtanded that they are leſſe perfyte: it ought to be graunted, yf the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe wordes ſprytuall and temporall be taken in, in theyr propre ſygnyfycacyons. But whan it is ſayde afterwardes that the byſſhop of Rome is prynce or iudge of ſprytuall thynges, yf this worde iudge be taken accordynge to his fyrſt ſygny<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fycacyon,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12929:138"/>
and as ſpeculatyue or operatyue iudge of theſe thynges: it is true, that the byſſhop of Rome and any other byſſhop is or oughte to be ſuche maner iudge. And hereof it is concluded that he is perfyter than that man whiche iudgeth by ſuche maner iudgement onely of corporall thynges. Namelye becauſe of the good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the thyngꝭ whiche are iudged. But it foloweth not herefore, that ſuche ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner iudge of ſprytuall thynges is ſuperyour to the other maner iudge in iuryſdyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon or coactyue iudgement. For ſo he that conſydereth ſenſyble creatures, ſhuld be prynce or coactyue iudge of the aſtronomer or geometrycyon / or contrarywy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe / and yet neyther of theſe for all that is neceſſary true / but yf they do inten de or meane, that the byſſhop of rome or any other byſſhop is iudge of ſpyrytuall thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after the thyrde ſygnyfycacyon of this worde, that is to wyt coactyue iudge: than this propoſycyon is to be denyed, as beynge manyfeſtlye falſe / as we haue alledged here tofore of the. iiii. of Iames, both in this chapytre, and alſo in the. ix. of this dyccyon. For chryſte onely is ſuche maner iudge / vnto whom we neuer ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue denyed, neyther do denye the iudge of this worlde to be ſubiect, as touchyng to coactyue iuryſdyccyon for the ſtate of the worlde to come / wherfore the apoſtle in the. vi. to the Epheſyans, and in the laſte chapytre to the Colloſſyanes ſaythe thus. Theyr lorde or mayſter, and youres: is in heuens / other than onely Chryſt / wherfore the iudges of this worlde: ſhall be iudged of this iudge onely, by coacty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue iudgement. And they whiche haue offended: ſhall be ponyſſhed by coactyue ponyſſhement / but yet in an other world, according to his owne lawe, as it hath appered in the. ix. chapytre of this dyccyon. This ſayd reaſon therfore is a gyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reaſon, and dyd begyle by the reaſon of equyuocacyon or manyfolde ſygnify<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cacyons <note place="margin">The ſeconde argument.</note> of this worde iudge. And as touchyng to that argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacion or reaſon, whiche ſayth, that as the one ende hath it ſelfe in comparyſon of the other ende &amp; the one lawe in comparyſon to the other lawe, ſo lykewyſe the one iudge hathe hym ſelfe in comparyſon to the other iudge: this propoſycyon yf it be taken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, <note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> may be denyed / but yet yf it be graunted taken indefynytly and the ſeconde propoſycyon ioyned vnto it: it foloweth and is concluded peraduenture in good materyall conſequence or argument, that he whiche is coactyue iudge accordyng to the lawe of god (that is to ſaye chryſte) is ſuperyour to hym that is coactyue iudgs accordynge to the lawe of man, that is to ſaye, to the prynce or prynces, whiche thynge we haue graunted here before. And than yf it be ſayde, moreouer that the byſſhoppe of Rome, or any other byſſhoppe, is iudge accordynge to the la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we of god. A dyſtynccyon is to be made of this propoſycyon becauſe of the many folde ſygnyfycacyons of this worde iudge. And it is to be denyed in that ſence, accordynge to whiche the maker of the argument gothe aboute to conclude, that the byſſhoppe of Rome or any other byſſhoppe is coactyue iudge in this worlde, or in the world to come, accordyng to the lawe of god. And as touchynge to that <note place="margin">Obieccyon.</note> reaſon which ſayth, that he, whoſe accyon or operacion is the more noble, oughte not to be ſubiecte as touchynge coactyue iuryſdyccyon, vnto hym whoſe accyon or operacyon is the leſſe noble or the leſſe perfyte / &amp; that the accyon or operacyon of a byſſhoppe or preeſte is more noble, than the operacyon of a prynce or ſeculer gouernoure, for it is a more noble and a more perfyte thynge to conſecrate the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the aulter, and to mynyſtre the other ſacramentes of the churche, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is the worke of a byſſhop or preeſt, than to iudge and gyue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes of the cyuyle or contencyouſe actes of men whiche is the worke of a prynce or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernoure, or of hym that hath coactyue iuryſdyccyon, onely, in that he is ſuch one <note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> the fyrſte propoſycyon of this reaſon or argument is falſe, and to be denyed yf it
<pb facs="tcp:12929:139"/>
be taken generally, as it muſt nedes be taken here, for elles this reaſon ſhuld not haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenyent forme. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeconde propoſycyon alſo yf it be taken generally, for what ſoeuer preeſthode or preeſt, maye lykewyſe be proued falſe by manyfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de reaſons. For the accyon of preeſtes in other lawes: is not nobler than the accy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or operacyon of the prynce or ſeculer gouernoure as the contrarye hath ben be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ſhewed and proued in the. xv. chapytre of the fyrſte dyccyon or parte. But in the lawe of chryſten men onely, the operacyon of preeſtes is the moſte perfyte ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racyon / whiche thynge for all that we do holde by faythe onely. The fyrſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſycyon therfore of this argumentacyon is falſe / for nothynge letteth, but that he whiche hath the more noble and more perfyte operacyon abſoſutly: maye in ſome thynges and ſome maner waye, depende of hym, that hath the leſſe perfyte opera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon. And ſo in ſome poynte and ſome maner waye be more vnperfyte / For the bodye of man, whiche abſolutlye is more perfyte than all maner bodyes outher ſymple or compoſyte and myxte, at the leſtewyſe whiche are generable: as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge to ſome thynge that maye be aſſygned, is leſſe perfyte than many ſymple or myxte bodyes. This alſo maye we ſe in the partes of one hole thynge. For thoughe the iye be a membre or a parte more perfyte than the hande or the fote, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe it worketh a more perfyte operacyon / yet neuertheleſſe it hangeth of them and receaueth ſome operacyon or mouynge of them. And they lykewyſe agayne do depende of the iye. For by the iye they are dyrected vnto the ende, vnto the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che they moue or are moued / ſo alſo the apoſtle ſayde in the. xii. of the fyrſte to the Coryntheanes. But the iye can not ſaye to the hande: I nede not thy helpe or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure. And after this or lyke maner verelye the prynce and gouernoure alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth and receaueth ſome thynges by the accyons or operacyons of ſome infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryor partes of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munyte (of whiche we haue ſpoken in the. v. chapytre of the fyrſte dyccyon) howebeit not as touchynge to coactyue iudgemente. And yet do thoſe inferyor partes of the comunyte as touchynge to ſome better and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte thynge, and as touchynge to coactyue iudgement, depende of the prynce and gouernoure / as it hath ben ſhewed in the. xv. of the fyrſt dyccyon. So than preeſt hode or preeſtes do depende and receaue ſome what of the prynce or ſeculer gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure: and the prynce or ſeculer gouernour dependeth and receaueth ſome thynge of the preeſte. For the preeſtes do receaue of the prynce and ſeculer gouernoure, in ſtytucyon of theyr cyuyle actes, and defence from Iniurye that they ſhall neyther do iniurye to any other man, neyther any other man to theym, in the ſtate and for the ſtate of this preſent worlde / for this is the offyce of the prynce or hyghe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernoure, and of none other parte or membre of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munyte as it hath ben ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in the. xv. of the fyrſt dyccyon. And this alſo the apoſtle expreſſed in the. xiii. chapytre to the Romaynes / and we haue brought in his wordes in the. v. chapy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of this dyccyon / this ſame alſo he mened in the. v. chapytre of the fyrſt epyſtle to Tymothe, whan he ſayde / I beſeche therfore, that obſecracyons be made, fyrſt for kynges, and all that are in hyghe auctoryte, that we may leade a quyete and peaceable lyfe. Lykewyſe agayne on the other parte, the prynce dependeth and hath nede of the accyon or operacyon of the preeſte. For of the preeſte, he receaueth doctryne, and the ſacramentes dyſpoſynge men in this worlde, and remouynge or puttynge awaye ſuche thynges as are contrarye to ſaluacyon or eternall bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytude, for the ſtate of the worlde to come. But yet dyfferently and after a dyuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12929:139"/>
maner they worke and receaue theſe operacyons eche of other. For the prynce beynge coactyue iudge in this worlde by the ordynacyon of god, maye lawefully exercyſe or impreſſe his operacyon, by coactyue power by doynge ponyſſhement vpon any preeſte: yea thoughe he be not wyllynge or contente, yf he hathe ben a tranſgreſſor of the lawe of man, whiche is not contrary to the lawe of god / as it hath ben ſhewed and proued, in the. v. and. viii. chapytres of this dyccyon and in the. xv. of the fyrſte dyccyon. But the byſſoppe or preeſte, becauſe he is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to the lawe of god coactyue iudge of any man in this worlde (as it hathe ben ſhewed in the. xv. of the fyrſte dyccyon and in the. iiii. v. and. ix. of this dyccy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but is a iudge after the fyrſte ſygnyfycacyon of this worde iudge, and as it were an operatyue teacher, as a leche or phyſycyon: he can not by his operacyon or precepte, compell any man / neyther he ought to compell any man, by payne or ponyſſhement outher reall or perſonall, as touchyng to this preſent lyfe. So than the fyrſt propoſycyon of this ſayd argumentacyon was falſe, wherin it was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, that what ſoeuer thynge worketh the more perfyte operacyon, ought not as touchynge to iuryſdyccyon to be vnder the thynge that worketh the leſſe perfyte <note place="margin">An inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyent or ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſurdytye.</note> operacyon. For of this propoſycyon with the aforeſayde propoſycyons ioyned vnto it, there foloweth neceſſarely an other manyfeſte inconuenyent and a falſe propoſycyon / that is to wytte, that no ſpeculatyue dortor or at the leſtewyſe that the hygheſt or pryncypall phyloſopher or metaphyſycyon is not vnder the iuryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyccyon of the prynce or gouernoure accordynge to the lawe of man. For as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as none of the practyue habytes or ſcyences and qualytes beſydes faythe, in the prynce and gouernoure, or els in any other man, neyther any operacyon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedynge and brought forth of the ſayde habytes or ſcyences, is egall in perfeccyon to the habyte or ſcyence of the methaphyſycyon, or to the accyon or operacyon brought forthe by it whiche habyte or operacyon, it maye chaunce a prynce or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernoure for to lacke. And where as it was afterwardes obiected, that it ſemeth an inconuenyent, and an vnſemely thynge, that the byſſhoppe of Rome, or elles any other byſſhoppe, ought to be vnder the coactyue iudgemente of hym, that is prynce and worldly gouernoure, it is to be anſwered and ſayde that it is none in conuenyent at all, that he or any other byſſhoppe be vnder that ſame or lyke iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, vnder whom the lorde and mayſter of the ſayde byſſhop of his owne fre wyll hath determyned to be, for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenyent ordynacyon or ordre of this worlde to be obſerued / For chryſte, whiche was bothe god and man, wyllynglye ſubmytted hymſelfe to the coactyue iudgement of ponce Pilate, whiche was the vycare or deputye of hym that was Emperoure / ſo alſo dyd the holye apoſtles and taught other alſo to do the ſame, accordyngly vnto the lawe of god / as it hath ben playn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye and euydently ſhewed by the ſcrypture and by the ſaynges of ſayntes, and of other doctours, in the. iiii. and. v. of this dyccyon / and hathe ben alſo repeted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herced agayne in the. xxviii. of this ſame dyccyon / wherfore alſo in as moche as the ſeruaunte is not greatter than the mayſter, neyther the apoſtle greatter than he that hathe ſent hym as we haue alledged and brought in of the ſcrypture, by the ſayinge of Bernarde, in the. xxviii. chapytre of this dyccyon.

And the contrarye hereof is vtterlye inconuenyent, and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Furthermore, becauſe the byſſhoppe of Rome or any other byſſhoppe is not the vycare of chryſte, or his mynyſter, to exercyſe all maner offyce in this world: but onely as touchynge to a certayne determynate offyce / as for example as tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chynge to preeſthode / in whiche offyce, in that it is ſuche one: there is not regarded or conſydered any coactyue iudgemente, neyther ſuperyoure or inferyour as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge to ſuche iudgemente: as we alledged openlye of the wordes of Aryſtotle, in the. viii. parte of the. ix. chapytre of this dyccyon.
