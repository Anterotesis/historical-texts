            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Study of Politicks, the more confident we are, commonly the leſs proficient we are. For there is no other ſtudy wherein the Paſſions of men do more impetuouſly contravene, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn right Reaſon. Men born in popular States, think themſelves bound to abhor all Kings, as being <hi>De genere Beſtiarum rapacium:</hi> So <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf pronounced from the mouth of <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor. Others on the contrary born under Monarchs, ſpeak as odiouſly of Democracies, and make this reply to <hi>Cato,</hi> That even <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, when ſhe plundred a third part of the world, and graced her own Captains, with the pompous titles of <hi>Africanus, Aſiaticus, Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, &amp;c.</hi> was as ravenous a beaſt as any other. See what ſtrong Byaſſes wiſemen have, and obey. The Queſtion is not, Whether this, or that form be free from oppreſſion and injuſtice, or not; we know well, all Forms have their peculiar advantages, and diſadvantages: and that at ſome times they all tranſgreſs their own Rules and Intereſts, as it were by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and not out of miſconſtitution: The queſtion is, Whether the one conſtitution or the other be more free, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from oppreſſion, and injuſtice? Now for ſolution of this, greater light ſhines, and breaks in upon us from demonſtration, and ſenſual proof, then from Syllogiſms, and logical inductions. Reading aſſures us, that <hi>Rome</hi> was not ſo juſt to other Nations, nor ſo conſtant to the Intereſt of her own Citizens, when ſhe was under Kings and Emperors, as ſhe was, when ſhe choſe her own Conſuls, and limited Magiſtrates. Tis as apparent alſo at this day, that the people of <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Hanſ-Towns, <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94379:3"/>
the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> &amp;c. do more flouriſh, and truly injoy the due benefits of Liberty, there the <hi>French, Turkiſh,</hi> or any Royaliſts whatſoever. Tis further as viſible by the publike banks of Treaſure kept in Democracies, and the ſtrange ſplendor which Traffick brings to them beyond Monarchies, that Faith is not kept ſo ſacred and inviolable where one raigns, as where Majeſty and Supream Power remains veſted in the people; and moſt ſure it is, the ſanctity and untemerated chaſtity of publike Faith is the beſt and firmeſt baſis of all Government. To dispute theſe things, is to undervalue the report of our own ſenſes; and to deny our own ſenſes, is to deny our ſelves to be men. The enemies of our preſent Government ubraide this our popular model, the rather, becauſe it exaſperates all our neighbours againſt us; whereas this is a great argument for us, that our neighbours are troubled at the ejection of Monarchy. For neighbours are more apt to envie then pitty: and the condition of him that is envied, is far better then his that is pitied. The main advantage that commends Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Monarchy, is the unity of it, for that it is not ſo liable to civil broils and commotions, as other temperaments where the Magiſtrate is elective: Yet Reader, if thou wilt ſtrip thy ſelf of thy paſſions and prejudices, and peruſe this Treatiſe, thou ſhalt ſee that even Hereditary Monarchy it ſelf is far from being a ſoveraign, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt civil breaches and diviſions. The Author of this Book is unknown to me, and the Book it ſelf came caſually to my hands, but I have been induced to publiſh it, becauſe it invites thee not to Precepts, but Precedents, not to Diſputable but to viſible Politicks. I need ſay no more; by the Work rather then report judge of the Author, and by Experiment rather then Logick judge of the Work.</p>

            <p>As the foundation and originall of Government is confeſt to be of equall Antiquity with the generation and multiplication of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: ſo doubleſs the juſt and methodicall uſe, and due management of it, is as neceſſary to the well-being of men, as the exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and orderly motions of the Heavens are to the preſervation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94379:4"/>
of the Globes; and certainly without it the rationall world would be more miſerable then the materiall without Sun, Moon and Stars, with all coeleſtiall influences, which as they do beautifie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpangle the world, ſo they do preſerve it from returning to its firſt Chaos, and rude maſs of matter; nothing being more contrary to that unity, and harmony, which the God of nature hath moulded, and diſpoſed all things at firſt in, then diſorder, and confuſion, in which, as there is nothing of a deity to be diſcerned, ſo nothing of peace or happineſs can poſſibly be found.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding all this, the world hath ſcarce known what the natural ſweetneſs and true benefits of government are, but only as comparative and rather as oppoſite to Anarchy, then as advancing really and effectually the juſt liberties and freedoms of ſocieties, or propagating the Commonwealth of mankind; for what through the ignorance and ſloath of the people, and the pride and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Governors, the whole order and end of government hath been inverted, and ſubverted, upon all occaſions; and that which was made for the good of the whole, hath been ſo contracted, and circumſcribed in one perſon, that the great and ſoveraign uſe, and end of it, by practiſe and cuſtom, hath been rather to ſet up the pomp, and ſtate of one man, and his Family, then to promote or propagate the profit and happineſs of the Univerſe; and whereas of right to its conſtitution, It ſhould have a free Election as its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and common good for its end, and juſt and equall Laws for its rule; it hath had uſurpation for its Principle, and tyranny, and bondage for its medium, and end. As to this day we may ſee in the greateſt part of the world, where all the liberties of millions of men of all ſorts of conditions, and ranks, are buryed in the glory and ſplendor of one Family; through which narrow channels, all honor and juſtice, all Law and reaſon are to run up and down the world.</p>
            <p>And whereas the goodneſs, and beauty of government conſiſts in the harmonious temperature of power, and obedience, of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and liberty, it hath been quite otherwiſe inverted by practiſe, and made apparent to lie in the Majeſtie, and greatneſs of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and the abſolute ſubjection, and ſervitude of the people; and the excellency, and ſweetneſs of it rather to be ſeen in the preſence-Chamber, and the magnificence, and grandeur of the Court, then in the Courts of Juſtice, and the rich and flouriſhing eſtate of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94379:4"/>
Kingdom, nothing being accounted more politicall, and glorious, then to have the Prince high, and the Subjects beggars; and yet this Ceremoniall way of Government, hath took moſt place in the world, and got almoſt divine adoration, and hath thruſt out all other forms of Government, (equally ſacred with it ſelf, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the nature and benefits of ſocieties, and the Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all the liberties of the people (which are as their bloud and ſpirits in their veins) ſold to maintain its State.</p>
            <p>Beſides many cauſes, and grounds of this degeneration (whereby ſo much miſery hath overflowed the Nations of the world) I find two, which at preſent are principally to be mentioned; the firſt is the neglect of a right ſence, and the often inculcating the originall, and end of government; and the next a lineal ſucceſſion, or continuation of government, by a natural and ſuppoſed heirſhip; For want of the firſt, neither the people know their own rights, or how to maintain them; or the Governour his uſe and end, nor how to keep himſelf within the juſt bounds, and limits of his creation; for what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſtupidity, and ignorance of the people in not knowing their primitive priviledges, that they are the originall, and end of vernment; and the pride, and ambition of men, when once they have got power, forget both how they came by it, and to what end they are diſtinguiſhed from other men, government comes both to be uſurped, and tyrannicall. Did the people but know that their choice and election is the foundation of juſt authority, &amp; that none can rule over them but whom they appoint, they would not then be drawn into controverſies and debates, whether it be treaſon in them to caſt off a bad Governour, who have the only power of chooſing a good one; and on the other ſide, if Kings, and Princes (for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all to them who have been moſt guilty of the abuſe of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) had but the continuall ſence of the root from whence they ſprung, and the duties annexed to their Offices, they could not look on themſelves as rulers, but tyrants when they acted for their own private Prerogative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in diſtinction from, and contrarie to the liberties and freedoms of the people; but theſe conſiderations have been by time and preſcription worn out of the mind and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of both, partly through continual inſinuations of Court Maxims, and the ſpirit of bondage in the people, and by force and uſurpation in the Magiſtrate, whereby it hath gone a long while for currant, that the people have no power, nor the Prince no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94379:5"/>
to give but to God, from whom they challenge an immediate title, as if Kings and Princes, all their names, and ſucceſſions were let down from Heaven, in the ſame ſheet that the beaſts were in <hi>Peters</hi> viſion, and had not their root in the earth as all other Magiſtrates beſides. We have had much ado of late, but to beat off from theſe Royal notions, both by pens and ſwords, and yet ſtill they have too ſtrong a hold in moſt mens hearts, though to their own undoing.</p>
            <p>Whereas all men are equally born free, and naturaliz'd into all the priviledges of freedom and juſt liberty, no man can obtain a ſpeciall power over any, but either <hi>ex pacto aut ſcelere,</hi> either by willing agreement, and conſent, which is the right and juſt way of title, and moſt naturall, or by conqueſt, and uſurpation, which is moſt exotick, and unjuſt; for the original of Kingly power, in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we all know it came in as an effect of the wantonneſs, and diſcontents of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> againſt that ſpeciall way of government God himſelf had ſet over them; And view the Character God gives to them of that government, and not a bleſſing he gives them with it; for its riſe among the heathens, and nations (which knew not God (among whom that government moſt prevail'd;) it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly firſt good, and grounded on the exorbitancies, and exceſs of other Magiſtrates, and a high opinion of the juſtice, and vertue of ſome particluar perſons, as <hi>Cicero lib. offic.</hi> 2. excellently expreſſeth it; <hi>Mihi quidem non apud Medos ſolum (ut ait Herodotus) ſed etiam apud majores noſtros, ſervandae juſticiae cauſa videntur olim bene morati Reges conſtituti: nam cum premeretur initio multitudo ab iis qui majores opes habebant, ad unum aliquem confugiebant virtute praeſtantem.</hi> As if taking it for granted that among all nations that Preſervation, and execution of juſtice, with injoyning of vertue, was the firſt ground of the conſtitution of Kings; But they having got by their own goodneſs chief power and authority, uſe that favour they had gained from their own deſerts, to advance their own family; and having got in the affections of the people, through the ſence of their own preſent worth, what by power and force, and what by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and craft, got the ſame power entailed on their heirs, and ſo by cuſtom have made ſucceſſion the onely right, or at leaſt the moſt juſt to Crowns, and Scepters.</p>
            <p>A principle which hath more hindred the advance of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and run it on more hazards and miſchiefs then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where by a fatall Cuſtom, people muſt be irreparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94379:5"/>
with what they can finde, and reducing all to a blinde Fate, &amp; Fortune, be he good, or prove bad, <hi>talis, qualis,</hi> give up both their own Wills and Liberties to ſuch a ſucceſſion, not only by a natural neceſſity, but a divine inſtitution: How the world came to be ſo blinded, as thus to give away their Rights and Liberties, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their underſtandings, and freedom, as bankrupts do their lands, is not to be determined, but by ſuppoſal of a judgement of God, and an over-reach of power and force, or by an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and ſubtilty.</p>
            <p>For this naturall and hereditary ſucceſſion (which is now adored as the grand title) if truly conſidered, is nothing elſe but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of conqueſt, or a ſurpriſall by the good nature of the people, when they have been either low, and in fear, and taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their high eſteem of ſome eminent perſon, who hath been more then ordinary inſtrumentall to them, have got the people to convey the ſame honor to their poſterity after them; the peoples conſent being thus raviſhed from them, Its made a law, both civil and divine to after generations; but the world is now, or ſhould be grown wiſe: Let us conſider the nature and uſe of this ſucceſſion, both in general, and particular, eſpecially as it hath been acted in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among all the Catalogue of vanities which <hi>Solomon</hi> reckons up in his ſacred retractations, there is none he puts ſuch a character on, as for a man to ſpend his time and ſtrength in getting of riches, and knows not who ſhall ſucceed him in the injoyment of the profit and good of his labour, or whether he may be a wiſe man or a fool; But what a miſery, and worſe then vanity is this, that the ſupream power of Government (in the right execution of which all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of millions of men are intereſted) ſhould be intailed on one man, (though never ſo deſerving in his own perſon,) and the heirs of his body, be he good or bad, a wiſe man, or very nigh a fool, and ſo all their happineſs depend on hap and hazard from generation to generation?</p>
            <p>It cannot be rationally or ſpiritually ſuppoſed, that any man ſhould be born a Magiſtrate or Governor, eſpecially not ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the beſt men, and moſt choiſe ſpirits, who have had the higheſt eminencies of vertue, and beſt improvement of education, and natural genius, are hardly fit for ſo great a work. If Kings have ſuch a <hi>vis formativa</hi> in their loyns, as to beget Kings in the likeneſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94379:6"/>
of their Office, as children in the image of their natures, it muſt be neceſſarily ſuppoſed, that they muſt generate all theſe royall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications together with them, and by the ſame naturall neceſſity transfer all their princely endowments to them alſo.</p>
            <p>Whereas I had almoſt affirmed it, (and I hope no man can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it either Hereſie or Treaſon) that God himſelf cannot intail on any particular line of mankinde, the power and authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment out of his wiſdom, and love to their happineſs (without he meant to do it in judgement, and to plague the world) and not give them ſutable and ſucceſſive qualifications alſo, fit for that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment; It being Gods uſe (according to his wiſdom, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs) neither ordinarily nor extraordinarily to call out per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to any place, but he anoints them with proportionable gifts to it.</p>
            <p>And yet the poor people (whom God hath naturally made free, and to make uſe of their own underſtandings and affections for their own good) are by this ſucceſſion, bound up from the improvement either of ſoul or body, fain to be content with what they can get for preſent, and to ſhift it out from age to age (with the loſs of all opportunities of choice) only with what corrupt nature brings them forth, which oftentimes travels ſorely in pain with the curſe of the Fathers who begat theſe Governors. Hence alſo it comes to paſs, that oftentimes children are made Kings, and though they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable at preſent for the actuall exerciſe of that office, yet are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, as having the right, and title, and all things acted in their name, and the whole Commonwealth, it may be of many Nations, muſt wait for his capacity with fear and hope, which capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is alſo at beſt to be judged by his years, rather then fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or qualification for ſo high a truſt; and in the mean while the Kingdom muſt be governed by ſome Favorites of the laſt King, or ſome next kinſman to this; and while the King is thus in pupillage, we may well ask, who governs the Kingdom? And yet oftentimes it hath faln out, that their Government hath been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordered in their nonage by others, then in their own by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as appears eſpecially in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, Kings of <hi>England;</hi> the firſt being but nine years old when his father died, the latter but nine moneths; who while they were yong, and under the protection of certain wiſe and ſober men, the Laws were adminiſtred uprightly, and with much Juſtice; but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94379:6"/>
when they themſelves came to the years of Kingſhip, and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo Royalled, that both Laws &amp; Liberties were ſoon altered and aboliſhed, as anon the Reader ſhall have a more exact account; And how ſad is it, that when Government may be advanced as well, if not better by others in their minority, without their preſence or influence, the world muſt be at ſuch vaſt charges for a title, and to maintain it ere they can uſe it, and which is worſt, that when they come to exerciſe it themſelves, ſhould make their title the ground of their Tyranny. But if it ſo happen (for its a meer chance)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the next heir prove ſomewhat more then ordinary capable, yet what the next may prove, who knows? If he be an Infant, (as it many times falls out) then there muſt be patient and hopefull waitings, to ſee what he will be when grown up; untill that, there can be no further progreſs made in the alteration or reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs, though of never ſo great, and preſent concernment; and when he comes to theſe years which Cuſtom pronounceth him capable, how unreaſonable is it, that nothing can hinder, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from his Authority, but that he is incapable of being beg'd for a fool? It being enough, if he can koow his own name, and be able to write himſelf <hi>Rex,</hi> though he knows little what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Office, or relation of a King.</p>
            <p>If he be one of riper years, and ſtature, on which this Su<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſſion falls, then muſt all the obſervation of his nature, and the ominous, and more then Aſtrological aſpects of his conſtitution, and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be forgotten; and although ſilenced in his pretended title, and a full complyance looked after, though oppreſt with never ſo many fears, and ſecret wiſhes of a more hopefull Governour; yea, and though he hath been never ſo active againſt the liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when but a Prince, and given demonſtrations what a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor they may expect, yet his ſucceſſion muſt be his qualification, and indemnity, and his Title his vertue.</p>
            <p>On this ground alſo it comes to paſs, that oftentimes women come to hold the rains of government; and to ſteer at the Helm, as wel as men; for if there be any defect of the male line, the female ſucceeds; and that feeble and weaker ſex, whom God &amp; nature have ordained to be onely particular helps, and good Subjects, (only to keep up the name of a Family) muſt be inveſted with the higheſt authority, over the choiſeſt, and moſt ſelect ſpirits of many Nations, and all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoughts of bettering the State of things utterly extinguiſh'd by a female pretence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94379:7"/>And which is moſt deſperate by this ſucceſſion, (and its plea of the only and abſolute right) the fundamental liberties of the people are not onely inſenſibly undermined, but abſolutely rooted up, and that birth-right priviledge of the people, their Election and choice, then which, they have nothing more naturall, and which is far more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary to them and theirs, then by all the Laws of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nature, and reaſon, Crowns can be to Kings and their heirs, is quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; For paſs by the firſt King, (who it may be as with us it hath been, came in by Conqueſt) you muſt go back in ſome King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms five hundred, in others a thouſand years, ere you can but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the clear notion of a free election (wherin the peoples power and priveledge is alone and peculiarly ſeen) and yet that ſo faintly and hardly extorted from them, as great loans of mony from a cruel miſer, without uſe or advantage; and though Election muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged at laſt, the firſt juſt ground of government, yet cuſtom in ſucceſſions ſoon wears out its right, and transfers it on the next bloud; And though in <hi>England</hi> it appears by the Coronation Oath, that there is even in ſucceſſion a kind of election, yet its ſo limited in the line, that its as good as nothing, and ſo weak and implicitely manifeſted, that its but a meer cuſtomary Ceremony, which always is purſued by the natural title, and onely uſed to deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and as a ſtep to the further confirmation of a more fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and ſure right; and its eaſie to demonſtrate it; for our Kings ſoon forget it, ere they come from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> or from the chair of Inauguration to the Preſence Chamber. In a word, what gives all this ground of ſuch an inevitable and ſucceſſively inſenſible incroachment on the laws and liberties of Nations, but this lineall title, whereby the Son without remedy goes on where the Father left off, and by a divine pretence ſeiſeth on what by nature is due to the meaneſt ſubject, as to himſelf? And what makes the preſent Kings ſo daring, and venturous to raiſe their own prerogative, but this, that that they know there can be no alienation of the Crown from his heirs, and that they may make it better (that is more tyrannicall?) but ſurer they cannot: And thus there is a conſtant hope, and poſſibility, by continuation and propagation of principles, and deſigns, backed with title, and authority, that what cannot be done in one Kings reign, may be done in the next, and ſo on; For the minds of Princes are not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually contracted, or contented with preſent enjoyments; eſpecially
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94379:7"/>
if there be any reſtraint on their wills, or more of heighth, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to be attained unto.</p>
            <p>Yea, this is one of the main reaſons (that in our times can be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) why we have had ſuch uneven actings, and ſuch ſtrange alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in ſeveral Kings Raigns; the principles, and laws, the people have been always the ſame, who are capable of ſmall or no variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or change, but as higher, and ſupream influences move them, of which none hath been ſo powerfull as Princes, who as they are Stars of the firſt magnitude, ſo of the ſtrongeſt operations; and though the people be compared to the Sea, yet as the Sea, they have no turbulent motion of their own, but what is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by violent and uncertain winds; but the great change hath been by the temper, and actings of Princes, and commonly the next ſucceſſor hath been the omen and fate of the times; if any way good, then the Nation ſmiled, and his raign began the Spring; if probable, there was hopes; and yet both theſe at firſt promiſed, but at length fruſtrated; and however the beginnings were, yet the ſucceſſion of acts demonſtrated how the title was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for untill they have made their ſucceſſion ſure, none have been more fair, and promiſing, but afterwards both Laws and Liberties, like favourites, have been advanced <hi>ad placitum;</hi> and what they have got an intereſt in by nature, that by prerogative they have centred in their own proper perſons, even the moſt fundamentall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the people, and have only granted Leaſes unto the people of their own inheritances, and dated them not for life (which would have been too great a mercy) but as long as the Royall pleaſure laſts, which changes alwayes with advantages. Yea, by this ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Tyranny is ſo intailed, and all things ſo neceſſarily acted, as if the Prince were not onely the civil, but natural Parent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that Kings had begot the people as ſo many Baſtards to obey, as they do beget one lawfully to raign over them.</p>
            <p>Its too well known, that good and wiſe men are the feweſt of the ſons of men, and are commonly pickt out here, and there, as rich pearls on the ſhoar of violent torrents; but to expect in one Line, and Family, a ſucceſſion of good, wiſe, and governing men, is almoſt as probable to Chriſtians, as to expect Mahomets ſecond coming among the <hi>Turks,</hi> after ſo many hundred years deluſion; and although it muſt be acknowledged, that there have been ſome good Kings, yet they have been ſo few, that as their names
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94379:8"/>
from the beginning of the world can hardly make up the Dominical letters in the Almanack, or poſſibly ſupply the Holydayes in the year, ſo a little goodneſs hath gon far, and at the beſt we ſhall finde it but comparative; good Kings inſtead of better Governors, as ſome of the <hi>Roman Ceſars,</hi> choſe thoſe to ſucceed them who were worſe then themſelves, that they might commend, and ſet off their own Raign, though tyrannicall enough in it ſelf; and we may without any paſſion demonſtrate, that the deſign by ſucceſſion hath been rather to keep up the Governors, and palliate their vices, then ever to maintain or highthen the glory, and ſplendor, or carry on the benefit of the Government it Self in the execution of good and righteous Laws.</p>
            <p>But to come nigher home, and leave generals (granting Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in it ſelf to be a good title) let us view without partiality, the ſucceſſion of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> whereby they plead their title to the Crown, and we ſhall find in our Hiſtories, that nothing hath been more commonly interrupted, then a ſucceſſion of the next Heir; and for this ſeaven or eight hundred years (if not more) we have not had ſucceſſion continued in any even line or juſt right, and no title was ever more broken, and unjuſt, then of our Kings, if they make a Lineall, and Hereditary ſucceſſion the foundation of their right; Let us look but a little back to thoſe which preceded the <hi>Norman</hi> race, eſpecially among the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> the ancient competitors for the Government of this Nation, and it will appear, that the right Heir hath been commonly paſt by; and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or Uſurpers preferred; to go no further back then to <hi>Alfred</hi> King of the Weſt <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the twenty fourth Monarch of the <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> as ſoon as he died, <hi>Athelſtan</hi> his Baſtard was preferred before his legitimate ſon <hi>Edmond,</hi> &amp; after him got his own brother <hi>Edmond</hi> to ſucceed him; and though this <hi>Edmond</hi> left two ſons, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94379:8"/>
Raign was blood, the middle miſery, and the end confuſion; and though he left his ſon <hi>Edmond,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Ironſide,</hi> to ſucceed him, yet <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> by compact got half of the Kingdom from him, and ſoon after the whole, ſetting up his <hi>Daniſh</hi> title, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the two ſons <hi>Edmund</hi> had left, with his brother <hi>Edwin,</hi> that no further pretence might be made by them of their title; and now come the <hi>Danes</hi> to convey their title by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Canutus;</hi> and yet <hi>Harold</hi> his baſtard gets the Crown before <hi>Hardicanute,</hi> who was his legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate ſon; and among theſe three Kings (for the Government under the <hi>Danes</hi> continued but twenty ſix years, and only under theſe three was aone Uſurper, &amp; immediatly interrupted the right of ſucceſſion. And the <hi>Danes</hi> Government being ended, which was but an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of conqueſt) the <hi>Saxons</hi> regain their title; and <hi>Edward,</hi> called the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> the ſeventh ſon of <hi>Elthelred</hi> (who came in with the murther of the right heir) being kept as a reſerve in <hi>Normandy</hi>) is elected King, and the <hi>Saxons</hi> title now begins to revive, but ſoon its extinguiſhed, not onely by the <hi>Norman</hi> pretence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the next ſucceſſor, <hi>Harold</hi> the ſecond, ſon to <hi>Goodwin,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94379:9"/>
had leſs title to his Dukedom then to <hi>England</hi> which he won by the Sword) made himſelf the principal of that divine Succeſſion we now ſtand upon, and all our Kings have no other pretence then by the ſucceſſion of his Sword; and certainly, if the Fountain, and Head-Spring be corrupt, the ſtream cannot be Chriſtall and pure; and yet (as Baron <hi>Thorpe</hi> declares in his Charge given at the Aſſizes holden at <hi>Yorke</hi> the twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> 1648. and now in Print) of all theſe twenty four <hi>Kings,</hi> which have <hi>King'd</hi> it amongſt us ſince that <hi>William,</hi> there are but ſeven of them that could pretend legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſucceed their former predeceſſors, either by lineal, or collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall title, (and he might have contracted that number, and have been modeſt enough.) But that the Reader may not be prejudiced, or wrap up his underſtanding in any expreſſion, let him but follow the diſcents of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the line, (and pardon the firſt ſtrange and exotick way of right) and he will diſcover, that as the firſt title was created by force, ſo the ſucceſſion hath been continued by uſurpation. <hi>Speed</hi> (too Royall a Writer) gives us a hint to go on upon in the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, page 746. (asketh by way of Interrogation) What right had <hi>Will,</hi> the Conqueror, the Father of all our glorious Tyrants? What right (we ſpeak, ſaith he, of a right of equity) had his ſon <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, while their elder brother lived? and ſo he goes on. But to give a more particular account to the Reader, how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every <hi>King</hi> came to his Crown, Let us begin with the firſt of the firſt.</p>
            <p>After that the firſt <hi>William,</hi> who laid the foundation of his right in the blood of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had left this world, as well as his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, great ſtrivings there were who ſhould ſucceed; and though he left three ſons, <hi>Robert, William,</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> yet could leave but one Heir, which was <hi>Robert;</hi> yet <hi>William</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Rufus,</hi> gets the crown ſet on his head, notwithſtanding the elder brothers title, and though <hi>Robert</hi> fights for his right, yet being too weak in the field, is fore't to a compoſition, on theſe terms that he ſhould injoy it after his deceaſe, if he hapned to ſurvive; and yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Henry</hi> the youngeſt brother (called <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt) ſteps in, and makes uſe of his brothers abſence to ſet up himſelf in his place; and <hi>Robert</hi> yet ſurviving, he weares it in his ſtead, and however he ſtrove to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain his right, he at laſt was fain to yield up, not only his title, but his perſon to <hi>Henry,</hi> who not only unjuſtly excluded him from the ſucceſſion to the Kingdom, but cruelly put out his eyes that he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94379:9"/>
might only feel his miſery, and never ſee his remedy. The line male of the Conqueror is now extinct, as well as it was irregularly diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as <hi>William</hi> got his right by his Sword, ſo all his ſucceſſors main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it in imitation of him, rather then by any legal pretence they could derive from him.

This <hi>Henry</hi> had ſix ſons, <hi>William, Henry Richard, Jeoffrey, Philip, John;</hi> the two firſt dying, <hi>Richard</hi> the third ſon, the firſt of that name, Sirnamed <hi>Ceur de Lyon</hi> ſucceeded his father; this <hi>Richard</hi> dying without iſſue, his yongeſt brother <hi>John</hi> uſurps the Crown, notwithſtanding <hi>Jeoffrey</hi> his elder brother had left a young ſon, named <hi>Arthur Plantaganet King</hi> of <hi>Brittain,</hi> who was heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the Crown; and after he dyed, <hi>Henry</hi> his ſon the third of that name ſucceedes him, though <hi>Arthurs</hi> ſiſter was then alive, (though in priſon) who was next to the title (ſuch as it was); after him <hi>Edward</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Longſhankes,</hi> called <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, layes hold on the Crown and wore it with much majeſty, and after him <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond his ſon goes on, but ſtill on the old account, and on the ruine of the moſt proper heirs; this <hi>Edward</hi> was depoſed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his ill government as anon ſhall be more fully related; and his ſon <hi>Edward</hi> the third of that name ſet up in his room; after him followed <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, ſon to the black Prince, who was alſo depoſed, after whoſe dethroning, <hi>Henry</hi> called the fourth, ſon to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gant</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and uncle to the former King, ſnatcheth up the Crown, though of right it, was to diſcend to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Mortimer,</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> the ſon and heir of <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke

of <hi>Clarence,</hi> the third ſon of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and an elder brother of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> and thus we have nothing hitherto, but interruption, and uſurpation; and thoſe which in their own reigns can pretend a divine title by ſucceſſion, which muſt not be altered, can for their advantage put by the ſucceſſion of the iſſue of others. But to go on, Here now began the bloody wars, and conteſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and <hi>York</hi> which made the world to ring of the miſery of the civill wars of <hi>England,</hi> and all about a title, and neither of them (if ſeriouſly weighed) had a right title by ſucceſſion, if the firſt title of their Anceſtors were to be the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; But that cuſtome might be the beſt right, he got in his ſon <hi>Henry,</hi> who was the fifth of that name, to ſucceed; and his ſon <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt (though an infant) takes his place, untill <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> overthrew his Army in the battle at <hi>Towton</hi> Field, and got him depoſed, and was proclaimed King by the name of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, though the title had been carried on in the Houſe of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> thorow three diſcents; thus favor, and fortune, not lineall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion alwayes gave the beſt title; this <hi>Edward</hi> left two ſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, (to maintain the ſucceſſion of the Houſe of <hi>York) Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> and five daughters. His eldeſt Son <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> who was the fifth of that name, ſucceeded him in claim, &amp; title, but rather lived then raigned (being an infant) had never any actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exerciſe of his government; for <hi>Ric.</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and Uncle to this Infant, and made his Protector, that he might ſet up himſelf, cauſeth both the young titular King, &amp; his Brother, (theſe two Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Infants) to be barbarouſly murthered in their beds, and ſo wears the Crown himſelf, by the name of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, untill <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> (a twigg of a Baſtard of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>) by his valour at <hi>Boſworth</hi> field, having overthrown his Army, ſlew the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant himſelf, and created by his ſword (for other he had none) a new title to himſelf, and was Crowned King, by the name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, who, what by his power and by a marriage of the Lady <hi>Eliz.</hi> the eldeſt daughter of <hi>Ed.</hi> the Fourth, confirmed his ſucceſſion, &amp; from him do all our later Princes derive their Title, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and our laſt Tyrant <hi>Charls.</hi> This <hi>Henry,</hi> the foundation of our great ones, was himſelf but a private man, who as <hi>Speed</hi> ſays, had ſcarce any thing of a juſt title, or of a warrantable intention, but to remove an Uſurper; beſides there were many naturall heirs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94379:10"/>
of the houſe of <hi>York</hi> which were children of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence, Richards</hi> elder brother, who had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter right: but when once a title is made, it muſt be maintained, and if it can but get thorow two or three Succeſſors, its preſently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> and pleaded as the onely juſt title and right.</p>
            <p>Thus you have a faithfull, and true account of the ſucceſſion of our <hi>Norman Monarchs;</hi> we can onely ſay we have had ſo many perſons raigning, and as Kings of <hi>England;</hi> but for a title by lineal ſucceſſion, there is none, but what every man may make aſwell as any man, and what is as proper to a ſtranger, as to an heir; power, and favour, murther and deceit being the moſt common principles of the right of moſt of our Kings to their government over us. If it be asked, as <hi>Speed</hi> doth, What right had <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror? then it muſt follow, What right had all the reſt? but ſuppoſing his right, What right had theſe, who ſo many times cut off the line, and made themſelves the Stock of future ſucceſſion? and what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is it that this broken and uſurped title muſt ſtill be forced on us, even by an Eccleſiaſticall, and Divine Inſtitution, who have now a way of redeeming our liberties, and bettering our conditions, and following the direct line of juſt and true titles, the Election and choice of the people? Is not five or ſix hundred year enough for <hi>England</hi> to be under the ſucceſſion of a <hi>Norman</hi> Baſtard (pardon the expreſſion, its true though plain) and to be ſold with all its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, from uſurpation to uſurpation, as well as from generation to generation? I need not be very zealous in application, the hiſtory is enough to make all wiſe men conſider, by whom we have all this while been governed, and upon what terms; How tyranny and uſurpation comes to be adored, if it have but a royall name added to it. Shall the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> be now blamed for cutting off that race of uſurpers and tyrants, and reducing affairs to their firſt naturall and right principle; or will the people of <hi>England</hi> after all their experiences, centre their liberties and freedoms in a cuſtomary uſurpation of ſucceſſion, and loſe their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth for the perſonall glory of a young Pretender? eſpecially, when they have fought againſt the Father, and cut him off as a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, endeavour to ſet up the Son to follow on both the firſt cauſe, and revenge, meerly becauſe he was ſuppoſed to be proceeded of his polluted loyns: this blindneſs will be our miſery, and endear us
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94379:11"/>
to a more perfect and more tyrannicall ſlavery then ever yet <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> felt.</p>
            <p>But to go on, the Reader hath ſeen what a line we have had in <hi>England,</hi> and how pure a title our Kings have had to their Crowns; Lets now but have patience to view their actings ſucceſſively, and yet ſhortly, and we ſhall better gueſs of their right by their raigns; for though one would think that they ſhould endeavour to make good a bad title by a good raign, yet it hath been far otherwiſe; every man having made his right by force, maintained it by tyranny; and when they have gotten power, never remembered how, or to what end they attained it; if we look back again, and make a new and ſtrict ſurvey of their ſeverall actings in their Government, and go over every Kings head ſince <hi>Willam</hi> the Conqueror, we ſhall not much miſtake if we paſs by <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie, Ruſsia,</hi> the <hi>Moors,</hi> and yet call <hi>Englands</hi> Kings Tyrants, and their Subjects Slaves; and however in the theory, and Syſtem it have been limited, and bounded by good and diſtinguiſhing Laws, yet in the exerciſe and practique part almoſt of every <hi>Kings</hi> Raign, we ſhall find it deſerve as bad a name as others who are called moſt abſolute; for the Laws and Priviledges which this poor Nation hath enjoyed, as they have been but complementally granted for the moſt part, and with much deſign, ſo they have ever (upon any occaſion) proved but weak and low hedges againſt the Spring-tides, and Land floods of the Prerogative of the Prince, which hath always gained more on the priviledges of the people, then ever the Sea by all its waſhing and beatings of its boyſterous and unmerciful waves hath gained on the Land; for if at any time the poor Commons (through much ſtrugling, and a good and preſent neceſſitous mood of the Prince) have got off any preſent oppreſſions, and forced out the promiſe for enacting of any good and ſeaſonable Laws: yet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the next advantage, or at leaſt the next ſucceſſor, hath been ſure, either to ſilence, or diannul it, and incroached upon it; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Priviledge or good Law enacted, or gained to the people, but by hard preſſure of the Subject, and with a predominant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of the <hi>Kings</hi> advantage, and ſtill rather out of courteſie then right. We ſhall finde alſo that <hi>England</hi> for three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together (ſome <hi>lucida intervalla</hi> excepted) hath been a ſtage of blood, and the aſtoniſhment of all Nations in civil wars, and that meerly, either for the clearing of the title to the Crown
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94379:11"/>
(which yet at laſt was onely made lawfull by the prevailing power, and as ſoon made illegall when another ſide got the better) or elſe by the Subject and Barons, taking up arms to defend themſelves, and make Rampiers (if poſſible) againſt the inundation of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and rather preſerving, then obtaining any additions of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and yet they were commonly defeated at laſt; for if for the preſent by ſome eminent advantage, they got a little ground, they ſoon loſt it again by royal ſtratagems, and were either forced, or complemented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into their old miſeries, with a worſe remembrance of former actings. But to enter into the particulars of this ſad Story:</p>
            <p>All men know (or may) the tyrannical domination of that firſt <hi>William,</hi> who behaved himſelf as a Conqueror indeed, and a moſt perfect tyrant (ſince whom we have never had an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, but one, who hath been naturalized by the ſucceſſion of his Conqueſt as King of <hi>England</hi>) he preſently changed moſt of our Laws, eſpecially thoſe wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> liberties were moſt tranſparent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and made new Laws, and thoſe which he left, writ them all in <hi>French;</hi> diſweaponed all the Natives, ſent the children of the beſt, and moſt faithful of the Nobility into <hi>Normandy</hi> as Hoſtages, and the moſt gallant of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were tranſported by him into <hi>France</hi> to ſerve his wars, that he might extinguiſh their Families; he advanced his <hi>Normans</hi> into all places of the Nation, and kept them as a guard over the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> brought in the cruel Forreſt Laws, and diſpeopled for thirty miles together in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down many Towns, and Villages, with Churches, Chappels, and Gentlemens Houſes, making it a Forreſt for wilde beaſts, (which is ever ſince named the <hi>New Forreſt,</hi> but was the old enſign of our miſery and ſlavery) he laid on innumerable taxes, and made Laws royal, very ſevere, and in an unknown Language, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> offending might forfeit their ſtates and lands to him, which they often did, through ignorance: But alas, what need I mention theſe? who ever reads but our Hiſtories, (and the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fawning Royaliſt) will ſee more then now can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and yet here is the firſt fruits of our <hi>Kings</hi> and of their righteous title, whoſe ſucceſſion hath been as much in tyranny after him, as in title: and yet we muſt, by a ſacred obligation be bound to maintain with our blood, and lives, the branches of this rotten root, notwithſtanding all the providential, and divine opportunities
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94379:12"/>
of caſting off that miſerable yoak which our forefathers, ſo ſadly groaned under, and would have triumphed in the pouring out their blood (which they ſhed freely, but to little purpoſe) but to have foreſeen their childrens children might have but the hopes of attaining to.</p>
            <p>But although <hi>William</hi> the firſt made ſure his Conqueſt to his own<note place="margin">William Rufus.</note> perſon, yet by his tyranny he gave ground of deſigns, and hopes of recovery after his death, &amp; therefore the people who but murmured and mourned in ſecret formerly, conſider now their condition, and that <hi>Robert</hi> the right heir was wanting, and his ſecond ſon endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to be ſet up, begin to capitulate, and repeat their former grievances, and to ſtand upon their terms, with the next Succeſſors; But <hi>William Rufus</hi> who longed for the Crown, and ſaw what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he had by his brothers abſence, through the mediation of <hi>Lanke-Frank</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (a man for his vertue and learning in great eſteem with the people) got himſelf to be accepted, and crowned King (with excluſion of his elder brother) by fair promiſes, and engagements to repeal his fathers Laws, and of promoting the liberties of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (any probability being then taking to the poor people.) But no ſooner had he got the Crown faſtned on his head, (and defeated his brother in battle) but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat all his own promiſes, follows directly his fathers ſteps, grows exceſſive covetous, lays on intolerable taxes, and mercileſs exactions, returns their longings, and hopes after their juſt libertie into a ſad bondage and ſlavery. The poor people having thus ſmarted for their credulity, &amp; renewing their ſenſe of their miſery, under the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tyrants, take heart once again, and refuſe to admit any after his death, until (as Judge <hi>Thorpe</hi> well expreſſeth it in that forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſcourſe) they were cheated into a ſecond election of <hi>Hen.</hi> the firſt, his youngeſt brother; for the people ſtanding for their Liberties (and yet, alas, but negatively, rather to be freed from exceſs of oppreſſion, then knowing what true freedom was) having felt the miſery of their loſs in the two former perſons (ſhall I call them <hi>Kings?</hi>) Raign; denied any conſent to another perſon of that ſtock without ſolemn capitulations, and covenants to ſettle juſt Laws, and to ingage for the execution of them, with abrogation of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miſchievous and inconvenient ones, (which <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> calls unworthily, a Politique, but trayterous way of capitulating.) Whereupon <hi>Henry,</hi> who had nothing of title, made friends by his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94379:12"/>
engagements, and <hi>Roberts</hi> abſence in the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> and doth abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely promiſe to begin all anew, conſtitute juſt laws, reform his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and brothers exorbitancies, and to be as a Nurſing Father both to Church and State; theſe fair inſinuations got him the Crown, though <hi>Robert</hi> was to have it firſt by his own right, and next by his Brothers Covenant and Will.</p>
            <p>And that he might not ſeem altogether diſproportionable to his<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> life of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt.</note> engagement, the firſt action of his government was to bait the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſugar their ſubjection, as his predeceſſor in the like inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition had done, but with more moderation and adviſedneſs; but having once ſecured his title from his Brothers <hi>jus,</hi> and ſetled ſome affairs abroad, began much after the old ſtrain, (yet not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo violent) yet theſe cruel and ſavage Laws of the forreſt he revived, and put in execution, yea, urged as the moſt fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Law of the Realm, and many ſore in poſitions he levied (which the people were not able to bear;) that theſe two ſons, though they ended the direct line, yet they propagated their Fathers tyranny; onely he got the throne by force; they by ſubtilty, and deluſive en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; and now the poor people, who had ſtill been cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are commonly paſſive, begin in the next Kings reign, (<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Stephen,</hi> another Uſurper) to be active, and to ſtruggle for their liberties more ſeriouſly and thorowly, and not contented with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of abating former preſſures, drew up the ſumm of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in a more exact method, and demand publikely the reſtoring and re-eſtabliſhing of St. <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws (for ſuch a rarity was that former Prince, as they Canonized him a Saint) which were many years before granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by new and ſtrange ſucceſſions buried; and <hi>Stephen,</hi> who came in odly to the Crown, and was continually in various motions to maintain it, confirmed all theſe laws, and to gain the people, ratified them by Parliament, the beſt ſecurity in theſe caſes; But ſoon after Prerogative (like a Lion in chains) breaks forth again with fuller rage, and devours all theſe grants, with the hopes, and expectations of the people; for though in the two next Kings raigns theſe grants were not actually repeled, yet were laid by, and only wrapt up in parchments, and huſht by the noiſe of Drums, and Trumpets. For <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, the next King, ſpent moſt of his time in cleering the controverſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> between <hi>Regnum &amp; Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> the Crown and the Mitre, as in ſetling his own Title both here, and in <hi>Normandy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> a while he and <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94379:13"/>
were ſtanding in the ſpecial rights, and priviledges of the Church, and State, the liberties of the people were laid aſleep, and certainly he hated the former grants, becauſe made by <hi>Stephen,</hi> who had ſtoln the Crown both from his Mother, and himſelf; the notableſt ſtory in this Kings reign (ſetting by his warlike atchievements) is, that after <hi>Becket</hi> had often foiled him in his authority, he was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly whipt by the Monks, in going to viſit <hi>Beckets</hi> ſhrine, which was part of his pennance, for giving ſecret order to Aſſaſinats to make him away; And that he kept <hi>Roſamond</hi> as his Concubine, to the vexation of <hi>Elenor</hi> his Wife, who at laſt vented her revenge on her, having found her out in that intricate Labyrinth made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for her at <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> by the clew which <hi>Roſamond</hi> had carele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly untwiſted.</p>
            <p>The next that laid claim to this Crown, was his ſon <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, ſurnamed <hi>Ceur de Lion</hi> (as before) who was to be commended rather for his perſonal valour, in other Nations, then for any good done to this; He began well in enlarging his Mother <hi>Elenor,</hi> whom his Father had impriſoned, becauſe ſhe could not abide his laſcivious living with his wanton Paragon <hi>Roſamond,</hi> and advanced many perſons by ſpeciall favours; yet theſe reſpects were more particular, then of any publike advantage to the State; for out of a blind zeal in thoſe times, after he had been in <hi>England</hi> but four months after his Coronation, he went into the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> leaving the Regency of the Kingdom to an Eccleſiaſticall Perſon, <hi>William Longchampe,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who to pleaſe the King, and by ſpeciall command, undid the people, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great exactions, and as <hi>Hoveden</hi> ſays, <hi>Clerum &amp; populum oppri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebat, confundens faſ<expan>

their long deſired liberties, but were moſt commonly either cluded, or defeated by promiſes which were never intended to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until at laſt being more entirely united with the Commons, and ſtoutly reſolved and confirmed by an Oath, taken at St. <hi>Edmunds-Burie</hi> in a general Aſſembly, they then ſwore on the high Altar, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to lay down arms, if King <hi>John</hi> refuſed to confirm and reſtore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them theſe liberties (the rights which this Kingdom was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſt with, and which all the late Kings had cheated them of) the King knowing their power, and conſidering their engagements, makes uſe of policy, and deſired time to anſwer them, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with ſmooth and gentle language, and courteſie, untill he had got ſtrength, and then he began anew to try experiments of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing himſelf, and fruſtrating their deſires: But the Lords continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their reſolution, and knowing nothing was to be obtained but by ſtrong hand, aſſemble themſelves with a great Army at <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> from whence they marched towards the King, who was then at <hi>Oxford;</hi> ſent him a Schedule of their claimed liberties, with an Appendix of their abſolute reſolutions, in caſe of his denyal; this Tyrant having heard them read, with much paſſion replies: <hi>Why do they not demand the Kingdom as wel?</hi> and ſwore he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grant theſe liberties, whereby himſelf ſhould be made a ſervant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Barons upon his Anſwer being (as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith) as haſty as he was averſe, reſolve to ſeaze on his Caſtles, and Poſſeſſions; and repairing to <hi>London,</hi> being welcomed by the Citizens, who had too long groaned under the ſame tyranny, they get a great acceſs of ſtrength by new confederates, and renew their ſpirits &amp; oaths for the thorow proſecution of the war; the King ſeeing himſelf in a ſtrait, which by no ordinary ſtrength he could evade, by gentle and teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meſſages ſent to the Barons, he obtained a Conference in a Medow called <hi>Running-mead,</hi> between <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Sta<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94379:14"/>
caſe of breach of any article or priviledge confirmed by that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And now one would think the people were ſecure enough; but though they ſeem now to have the livery, yet they had not the ſeiſin; for preſently the King having got now credit by the largeneſs of his grants, gets liberty with leſs ſuſpicion to undo all; and in a ſhort time (pretending theſe grants to be acts of force) having got power, renounceth his engagement by them, and afterwards repeals them, and diſpoiled all theſe of their lands and poſſeſſions, who had any hand, or heart in procuring the former grants; and by new, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall Laws made them more perfect ſlaves then ever they were before, untill at laſt he was poyſoned by a Monk, inſtead of being depoſed.</p>
            <p>But though he be dead, yet the miſeries of this Nation ended not with him; for his ſon <hi>Henry</hi> the third; who ſucceeded him, though he could not at firſt follow on his Fathers deſigns, being an Infant, yet at laſt did not onely imitate, but outſtrip him, yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, (who are much given to credulity, and apt to be won by fair and plauſible promiſes,) notwithſtanding all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers iniquity, imbrace the ſon, having taken an oath of him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, and confirm the liberties they propounded to his father, which he had often granted, and as often broken; but for all his firſt oath, they were fain, not onely to remember him of it, by peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but oftentimes by arms and ſtrength. And though there was in this Kings Raign twenty one Parliaments called, and many great Subſidies granted, in confirmation of their liberties, yet every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was no ſooner diſſolved, but the ingagement ceaſed; a hint of two or three ſpecial Parliaments, and their ſucceſs will not be amiſs to be ſet down in this place.</p>
            <p>This <hi>King</hi> not being able to ſuppreſs the Barons and people by his own ſtrength, (they having gotten not onely heart, but power) ſends to forraign Nations for aid, and entertains <hi>Poictovines, Italians, Almains, Provincioes</hi> to ſubdue his own people, and ſet them in great places; which dangerous and deſperate deſign the Barons much reſenting, raiſed their ſpirits, and ingaged them in oppoſition to his Government, and ſet them on with more courage to look after their liberties; therefore they ſeveral times ſtand up againſt the violence of Prerogative; but what through want of ſtrength or caution they were commonly diſappointed; yet rather (if we may ſpeak truly) from the unfaithfulneſs of the <hi>King</hi> then

Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> where having (by the ſprinkling of Court water) won many Lords to take his part, begins to ſurpriſe as many of the Barons as he could get, and ſpoiled their Caſtles and Houſes, that ſucceſs and authority grows ſtrong on his ſide, and the Barons with ſome calme proviſoes mediate a peace, inſiſting onely in generall that the Articles of <hi>Oxford</hi> might be obſerved; But the King relying on his ſtrength, defies them as Traitors; which done, the peoples two Generals, the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other means but to put it to a day, ſupply their want of ſtrength by their wit and diligence, and carefully and artificially pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their battel (which was fought at the Town of <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>) overthrew the Kings Army, took the King, the Prince, the Earl of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and his ſon <hi>Henry,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Arundel, Hereford,</hi> with many other Lords, and Gentlemen, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having the King, and Prince, and moſt of the Nobles, and a new confirmation of all, one would think the great Charter was out of danger, either of blotting or razing; eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſolemnities formerly uſed in the ratification of it, (as <hi>Daniel</hi> excellently relates it in his hiſtory, <hi>p.</hi> 169.) The people knowing that no civil promiſes, or verbal profeſſions would hold in Kings raptur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Prerogative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; devoted to perjury to maintain their tyranny, take a more Eccleſiaſticall and divine way of obligation, ſwearing to excommunicate all that ſhould be found infringers of that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; when the people with the King, and all the great Nobility were aſſembled with all the Prelates, and the chief Biſhops in their reverent ornaments (with burning Candles in their hands) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that dreadfull ſentence; the King having one great Candle in his hand, gives it to a Prelate that ſtood by, ſaying, it becomes not me being no Prieſt to hold this Candle, my heart ſhall be a greater teſtimony; and withall laid his hand ſpred on his breaſt all the while the ſentence was pronouncing, which was <hi>Authoritato omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentis Dei, &amp;c.</hi> which done, he cauſed the Charter of King <hi>John</hi> his Father to be read, and in the end having thrown away their Candles (which lay ſmoaking on the ground) they cryed out, <hi>ſo let them that incurre this ſentence be extinct and ſtinck in Hell;</hi> And the King with a loud voice ſaid, <hi>As God help, I will, as I am a man, a Chriſtian, a Knight, a King Crowned and Annointed, inviolably obſerve theſe things.</hi> Never were Laws ſaith he (whoſe words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

Paris, p. 8, 9.</note> and moſt ſolemn concluſion) the King preſently ſtudies how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe all the premiſes, his Paraſites telling him the Pope could ſoon abſolve him for a ſumm of mony, which afterwards the Pope did, and the King returned to his former oppreſſive courſes with more violence, and hardneſs; and taking advantage by the diviſion of the Barons, two Generals, the Earls of <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the latter of which joyned with the young Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> the Kings wicked Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, a new and potent Army is raiſed by them, againſt the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (who had the King priſoner) and thoſe which kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with him for the Peoples Liberties; and he with the reſt of the Barons, are overthrown; and immediately after a Parliament is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and all theſe laws and decrees made voyd; and that Parliament held at <hi>Oxford,</hi> wherein all theſe Laws were firſt confirmed by him, called <hi>Inſanum Parliamentum,</hi> the mad Parliament; and all theſe Patents, Commiſſions or Inſtruments made to ratifie theſe Articles, were brought forth, and ſolemnly damned; and ſo bright and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent did Prerogative break forth, that it was Proclaimed Treaſon in any but to ſpeak or mention any of theſe Grants with the leaſt approbation; and becauſe the City of <hi>London</hi> had engaged with the Barons and People as a principal part of the whole, he would needs have burnt the City, had not ſome wiſe and potent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites interpoſed, and yet they could hardly diſſwade him from that barbarous and impolitick wickedneſſe; But what he ſpared in their houſes, that he gott out of their purſes, and made up all his loſſes with a thorough ſubjection of their perſons, and ſuppreſſion of their liberties. I need relate no more of this King, nor make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94379:16"/>
the Reader will be amazed at the repetition; he at leaſt 20 times gave his promiſe for the confirmation, &amp; execution of theſe juſt decrees (contained in <hi>Magna Charta</hi>) and as many times was perjured, notwithſtanding all the ſolemnities, both Civil, Moral, and Eccleſiaſtical, uſed in the acts of ratification; this may learn us how to truſt the moſt poſitive Engagements of Princes, which croſs their own intereſt, and what to think of that word and promiſe they call Royall; this King reigned fifty ſix years, the longeſt of any King of <hi>England:</hi> But we have had too much of the ſtory of him, as he had too long a time to rule, conſidering his temper, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Its well if we can be wary for the future, and be more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then to truſt the moſt promiſing and inſinuating Princes with our liberties, and priviledges, which can be no longer expected to be preſerved by them, then they may ſerve as footſtools to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them in the Throne of abſolute Majeſty, But no more of this King; never were there more hard ſtrivings and wreſtlings between tyranny and liberty, with ſuch bad ſucceſs to the people; I onely conclude his raign with the exhortation of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 146. 3. O put not your confidence in Princes,</hi> ſurely men of high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are a lye.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> is by this time layd in his grave, and one would think <hi>Magna Charta</hi> buried with him; His Son <hi>Edward,</hi> who was his right-hand in his wars againſt the Barons, and the principal Agent in their ruine, ſucceeds him in the throne; and inſtead of leſſening goes on and makes an higher improvement of that royalty which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left him; having in his own perſon got the victory over the Peoples Libertyes in his Fathers time, and having wonne or worne out the greateſt of thoſe which oppoſed, and being long experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the world, ſo ſecured and advanced the Prerogative, that as one ſayth, he ſeemed to be the firſt conqueror after the Conqueror that got the domination of this State in ſo abſolute and eminent a manner, as by his government appears; He layd unſupportable Taxes both on the Clergy and Laity, even unto Fiveteens and halfs of their Eſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for Tenths, that was comparatively accounted eaſy; the Barons and People for a long time durſt not move for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of greivances, untill that the King (being always in wars in <hi>France, Flanders, Wales</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo needed continually vaſt ſums of mony) called a Parliament wherein he demanded a great treaſure of mony from the People, that he might give them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94379:17"/>
ſomewhat in lieu of their expences, confirmed the two great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the Petition of the Barons and People, (and ſo ſtopped their mouths) and this he did as often as he had extraordinary occaſions for mony; But (like all other royall promiſes) they were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by leaſure. Never was Royalty more Majeſtick and glorious then in this Kings raign, and the people leſs able to oppoſe; he was always ſo watchful and eager to enlarge his own power; I ſhall end his raign alſo with what <hi>Daniel</hi> that impartiall and witty Hiſtorian ſaith of him, He was more for the greatneſs of the Kingdom then the quiet of it; and never <hi>King</hi> before or ſince (<hi>except our laſt Charls</hi>) ſhed ſo much Chriſtian bloud within this Iſle of <hi>Britain,</hi> and was the cauſe of more in that following, and not one grain of benefit procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the people by all their expences on him, which was but to make themſelves more perfect ſlayes.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>King</hi> was <hi>Edward</hi> the Second his Son, who though more vicious then the Father, yet not more tyrannicall; he gave more advantage to the people thorough his lewd life and unmartiall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſeek the confirmation and eſtabliſhment of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other good Laws which were utterly ſuppreſt, and darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Fathers reign. This Prince gave himſelf over to all wicked courſes, and ſurrendred his Judgement, and the management of all affairs of State unto evill and corrupt Counſellors; eſpecially to one <hi>Peirce Gaveſton,</hi> who had both his ear and heart, unto whom he was ſo much endeared, that he ventured the loſs of <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and all the hearts of his Subjects for his company, and preſervation; and though the Barons had by often Petitions, and earneſt ſollicitations prevailed with the King to baniſh him, yet he ſoon after ſent for him home, and laid him more nigh his boſom then before; on this the Barons raiſe an army againſt the King; and ſend him word, that unleſs he would obſerve the late Articles (which they had formerly by much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ado got him to ſign in Parliament) and put from him <hi>Pierce Gaveſton,</hi> they would riſe in Arms againſt him as a perjured Prince; the <hi>King</hi> (whom they found, was apt to be terrified) yeilds again to his baniſhment, with this clauſe, that if he were found again within the <hi>Kingdom</hi> he ſhould be condemned to death as an enemy of the State: All places were now dangerous to <hi>Gaveſton;</hi> both <hi>Ireland</hi> (where he formerly was protected) &amp; <hi>France</hi> alſo too hot for him; in this extremity, finding no ſecurity any where elſe, he again adventures on <hi>England,</hi> and puts himſelf once again into the <hi>Kings</hi>

boſom (a Sanctuary which he thought would not be polluted with blood) and there he is received with as great joy as ever man could be; the Lords with more violence proſecute their ſuite to the <hi>King</hi> for delivering up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or removing him once more; but to no purpoſe; they therefore ſet forwards with an Army, ſay ſiege to the Caſtle wherein <hi>Gaveſton</hi> was, took him, and notwithſtanding the <hi>Kings</hi> earneſt ſollicitation for his life, they condemned him to the block, and took off his head; this obſtacle being removed out of the way, the Lords having now the better end of the ſtaff make advantages of it for demanding the confirmation, and execution of all thoſe Articles formerly granted, threatning the <hi>King,</hi> that if he would not conſent to it, they would force him by a ſtrong hand; with this meſſage they had their ſwords alſo drawn, and march towards <hi>London:</hi> A Parliament is called, where the <hi>King,</hi> after a ſubmiſſion by the Lords to him, for that act done againſt <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> contrary to his conſent, and will, grants the Articles and pardon to them. But the <hi>King</hi> goes on his old way, adheres to wicked counſel (waving the grave advice of his Parliament) and is ruled by the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> who acted with mighty ſtrain of injuſtice, which cauſed the Lords again to take up arms, and ſtand for their Liberties, but are, through the revolt of ſome, and the treachery of others overthrown at <hi>Burton</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> and two and twenty Noblemen, the greateſt Peers in the Realm executed in ſeveral places for nothing but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his evil Counſellors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this was the firſt blood of Nobility that ever was ſhed in this manner in <hi>England</hi> ſince <hi>William</hi> the firſt, which being ſo much, opened veines for more to follow; and now the beam of power being turned, regality weighs down all. But by degrees, through the continuation of his ill government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he daily loſt the peoples hearts, the Lords get an Army, and take the King priſoner, and by generall conſent in Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him as a tyrant, and elected his ſon <hi>Edward</hi> the third to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and his ſon was crowned before his eyes. Thus ended his raign, but not his life.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>England</hi> which had laboured ſo long and ſucceſſively under ſo many tyrants, and had conteſted ſo long with Royalty for their dearly purchaſed liberties, might now hopefully expect at leaſt a dawning of Reformation, eſpecially when they had got ſo much power as to depoſe Authority; and began, as it were, on a new account; and the truth is, affairs were now promiſing, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94379:18"/>
diſtempers ſeemed to wear away with the former Governor; yet the condition of the Kingdom, had but a new face on it, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances were rather not aggravated or multiplied then any whit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and oppreſſions may be rather ſaid to be changed from one ſhoulder to another then aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Edward</hi> who ſucceeded, who was crowned in his fathers life, had obſervance enough to remember his fate, and was much warned by it, both to prevent and ſuppreſs inſurrections, knowing by experience the full ſtate of the controverſie, and therefore began his Government very fairely, and with much applauſe; onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent factions, and ſidings, he privately cauſed his father, the depoſed <hi>King</hi> to be cruelly murdered, and ſo ſate more ſecurely, though with more guilt upon the Throne; his raign was fifty years, &amp; odd months, the longeſt next <hi>Hen.</hi> the third; he ſpent moſt of his time in the wars of <hi>France</hi> to regain his titile to that Crown, which the poor Subject felt in their eſtate and families, and it was a happineſs (ſay ſome) that he was ſo much abroad; for when ever he came home, as he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted money to ſupply his expences, ſo the people got ground to urge their Priviledges, &amp; <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was at leaſt twelve times ratified in this Kings Raign, and ſo often broken; yet becauſe he goes under the name of the beſt Prince that raigned ſo long, and ſo well, let the Reader take but an Inſtance or two concerning his engagements to perform the grand Charter. This King in the firſt Parliament made the fifteenth year of his raign, had granted the enacting of divers wholſom and ſeaſonable Laws, which he willed and ingaged unto for him and his heirs, that they ſhould <hi>be firmly kept, and remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable</hi>

            <p>Another inſtance of his actings we may take up from the ſucceſſe of his firſt ſiege of <hi>Tourney</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> having laid on heavy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive taxes to maintain that war, and the people ſeeing no fruits of all promiſes for executing the Articles of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay any more, without more faithfull performance of his Vows, and ſolemn engagements to them, whereby he wanting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was fain to quit the place, and return for <hi>England,</hi> full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull thoughts, and in much fury breaths out deſtruction to all the refuſers; But the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> told him publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but plainly, that he had oftentimes as well as his Father offered manifeſt violences to the Liberties of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that grand Charter, and if he expected Subſidies, from the people, he muſt more carefully maintain their priviledges ſo juſtly due. But the <hi>King</hi> vexed with ſuch language, both ſtorms againſt the Arch-Biſhop, and as much as poſſibly he then could, ſought the ruine of all that had made any refuſall of payment of theſe taxes, although he had not in any manner performed his own promiſes. Yet I will end his raign, becauſe he hath a name of a good <hi>King.</hi> (though as <hi>Speed</hi> ſaith, by the Generall vote of Hiſtorians, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many foul errors in his government) with a good act he did at the fiftieth yeer of his age (which he kept as his Jubilee) he called a Parliament, and there freely heard the grievances of the people, and redreſſed many, eſpecially a Petition of the Commons againſt the doublings of Lawyers; he cauſed the pleas which were before in <hi>French</hi> to be made in <hi>Engliſh; a neceſſary Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>Speed</hi>) if it had been as carefully obſerved; eſpecially if he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered (ſaith he) that the ſame ſhould not have been written in <hi>French, That the Subject might underſtand the Law, by which he holds what he hath, and is to know what he doth.</hi> But all this is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for as he imparted grace unto his people (ſaith the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) for ſo all acts of Juſtice are termed, wh<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n granted by Kings,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94379:19"/>
ſo he took a care to repleniſh his own purſe by it, that the poor Commons obtain not any thing which they pay not too dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for.</p>
            <p>Here ends the Life of the beſt reputed Prince; and yet you ſee wherein his excellency lay; the beſt happineſs the people had in his raign, was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they had more engagements for their liberties with more coſt, and the remembrances and ſenſe of the goodneſs of them more freſh and ſweet by the often repetition of them; but for execution or addition to them, they were as far to ſeek as in former times. And if it do poſſibly happen that in one Kings raign either through the goodneſs of his nature, or rather want of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, there be an intermiſſion of oppreſſions, (for that is the utmoſt to be expected) yet the next King will be ſure to make it up, and if they give the people a little breath, its but that they may ſow for the next to reap, or as they do with men on the rack, let them down, and give them cordials, and ſpiritfull liquors, that they may be the longer and more ſenſibly tormented; which was made good in the next Kings raign, <hi>viz. Richard</hi> the Second, who preſently daſhes and utterly nips theſe bloſſoms that ſprung out in the former Kings raign, devoting himſelf to all uncivill and lewd courſes, and to enable him the better unto it, layes on ſad and miſerable taxes on the people without ſo much as a mention or hint of their liberties, and as the parallel of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, both lived and died; Its enough to decypher his raign by his end; for he was depoſed by the univerſal conſent of the people in Parliament as a tyrannical, and cruel Governor, and not a good word ſpoken of him to commend him in his Government, and its pitty to aggravate his miſery after his death, and yet (as we ſay) <hi>Seldom comes a better;</hi> when one is cut off, another like the Hidra's head ſprings up in his place. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth who overthrew him in battel, and was made <hi>King</hi> in his ſtead (though by a wrong title) at firſt promiſed the new model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Laws to the peoples eaſe, and did, as in a complement (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſecure his title, then out of affection to the people, or ſenſe of his relation) redreſs many grievances, which were more groſs and leſs concerning the Common-wealth; and as he did ſtrive by theſe common acts to engage the people to him, ſo (as one that had continuall ſence of guilt on him) he got the depoſed King to be barbarouſly murthered in the Caſtle of <hi>Pomfret,</hi> that no competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might endanger his title by his life; He ſpent moſt of his raign
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94379:19"/>
incontinuall wars about his title, and was often oppoſed as both a Tyrant and Uſurper; but he ſtill got ground on both the liberties and laws formerly granted; yet not ſo ſenſibly as in the former Kings raigns, that the people may be ſaid to have a little reſpite from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence &amp; heighth of Prerogative by him; but they may thank the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtneſs, and brittleneſs of his title, for that he being more in fear of of looſing it, then out of love with the exceſs of his anceſtors. I ſhall only add one ſtory to conclude this Kings raign, which is univerſally reported by moſt of our Hiſtorians, worth obſervation, becauſe it hath much of ingenuity in it, and becauſe they were his dying words; Being caſt into an Apoplexie, and nigh his end, he cauſed his Crown to be placed by him on his Pillow, leaſt in the extremity of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it might have been delivered to ſome other, who had better right thereunto then he had; But when his attendants, (through the violence of his diſtemper, ſuppoſed him to be dead, the young Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> ſeiſed on his Crown, whereat the King ſtarted up raiſing himſelf on his arms, demanded who it was that had ſo boldly taken away the Crown? the Prince anſwered that it was he; the King fell back into his bed, and fetching a deep ſigh, and ſending forth many a penſive groan, replyes thus; my ſon, what right I had to this Crown; and how I have enjoyed it, God knows, and the world hath ſeen; But the Prince, (ambitious enough of a Diadem) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him thus; Comfort your ſelf in God (good Father); the Crown you have; and if you die, I will have jt and keep it with my Sword as you have done; and ſo he did ſoon after, maintaining his Fathers injuſtice by his own.</p>
            <p>And now comes up his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth as the next heir, who though while a Prince was given to many wicked practiſes, yet when a King, became moderate, and hath better commendation then moſt of his Anceſtors; the people had two advantages and comforts by him; firſt, that his reign was ſhort, and that he was much imployed in the war with <hi>France</hi> for regaining a title to that Crown, which he accompliſhed, and ſo they were free of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil wars; though they had ſtill heavie taxes, yet they thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pay for maintaining war abroad then at home; and truly, the people thought themſelves very happy in this Kings reign, (though their priviledges were laid aſleep) that they had a little breathing time from Domeſtick and Civil wars, and had hopes to regain by degrees a reviving of their Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94379:20"/>But the next <hi>King, Henry</hi> the ſixth, makes up what was wanting of Tyranny and Oppreſſion in his fathers raign. He was Crowned <hi>King</hi> about the eighth or ninth moneth of his age, and ſo had not preſent oppertunity to ſhew his royalty. Until he came to age, the Kingdom was well governed by his three Uncles, <hi>Humphrey,</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter, John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford, Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Exceſter,</hi> who by their wiſdom and juſtice, kept up the flouriſhing eſtate of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; but when his years of nonage were expired, and he came to weld the Scepter with his own hands, (what as ſome favorably think out of weakneſs, for he was no <hi>Solomon</hi>) all things went preſently out of order, and Prerogative breaks forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond bounds; which gave occaſion to <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> to try concluſions for his title againſt the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and making uſe of the diſcontents of the people through his evil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, oppoſed him, and afterwards depoſed him, and raigned in his ſtead by the name of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and ſo by Conqueſt he got the title to run through the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> having cut it off by his Sword from the houſe of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding actuall poſſeſſion of three deſcents, many overtures of war were yet between them; for <hi>Henry</hi> was not yet dead, though for the preſent outed; but as a dying man ſtrove for life, but being quite overthrown was impriſoned, and afterwards murthered to ſecure the Title; there was in theſe two Kings raign but meerly for a title fought ten bloudy Battles, beſides all leſſer skirmiſhes, wherein many thouſands of Lords, Gentlemen, and Commons were ſlain, and yet not one jot of advantage gotten by it for the peoples liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; It being the miſery and folly of the people to venture all they have, to ſet up thoſe over them who afterwards prove moſt tyranni call, and to ſow ſeeds of future miſery, by ſpilling their bloods for a uſurped title.</p>
            <p>In this Kings reign, as in the former, the whole land was miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly rent by unnaturall diviſions againſt his title, and government; and though neither or theſe two had a juſt title (if we will begin from the root) yet all the bloud of the Nation is thought too little to be ſpilt to maintain their pretences; yet we may not reckon this King among the worſt, had it not faln out that his title muſt be kept up with expence of ſo much blood and ruin of the Engliſh Nation; yet in his laſt five yeers, he laid on ſuch extraordinary taxes, and changed the form of Laws, that he loſt the love of all his Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:94379:20"/>For <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth his Son, who ſucceeded him in title, we need but mention him, for he had but the name of a King (being an Infant) and his reign may wel be called an <hi>Inter-regnum,</hi> for ere he came to know what government was, he was cruelly murthered with his Infant Brother, by his Uncle <hi>Rich.</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who reigned both for him, and afterwards for himſelf by the name of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, a bloody and cruel man, rather a monſter then a Prince, his name ſtincks in the Engliſh dialect; the ſhortneſs of his reign was the happineſs of the people; for after three yeers uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was ſlain in the field by the Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who by his valour, more then his Title got the Crown by the name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; this was the beſt act that was done by him, in eaſing the Kingdom of ſuch a viper. In his reign (who is the firſt root of our Kings ſince) the people had more hopes then benefits, and were rejoyced and made happy more by expectations, then enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of any reall priviledge, or liberty. For though he took all the ways to ſecure his title by his marriage with the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, yet many ſtratagems were laid to diſturbe his peace, which put him on acts of policy, and diligence, (which he excellently demonſtrated) to free and extricate himſelf out of dangers and deſigns; many ſad diviſions were ſtil in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, all men were not pleaſed either with his title or government, and that they might but diſturbe him, or hazard his Crown, they made Stage Kings, dreſt up pretty lads in Princely robes, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them up and down the Kingdom as puppets for the people to gaze one, and admire; all this while King <hi>Henry</hi> had not time to advance his prerogative, while he was but ſecuring his Title; but after he had done that, and now began to look on himſelf as free from either forraign or home competitors, and the coaſt of State ſeeming cleer from all thickning weather, he thinks of redeeming<note place="margin">Sir Francis Bacon.</note> what he had loſt by factions, and imployes his wit for bringing down the height of the Engliſh Nation, and plucking down their courage, and was eſpecially (ſaith one) jealous over his Nobility, as remembring how himſelf was ſet up; and how much more did this humor encreaſe in him after he had conflicted with ſuch idols and counterfeits as <hi>Lambert Simnel &amp; Perkin Warbeck?</hi> the ſtrangeneſs of which dangers made him think nothing ſafe; and thinking that the riches of the Engliſh occaſioned their rebellions, he took a courſe to empty their Coffers into his; and the plot whereby he meant to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94379:21"/>
effect it was by taking the advantage of the breach of penal Laws, which he both found, and made for that purpoſe; his Inſtruments which for this work were pickt, and qualified ſufficiently, were Sir <hi>Richard Empſon,</hi> and <hi>Edmund Dudley,</hi> men learned in the Law, and of deſperate and ſubtle heads, and forward in executing the Kings commands; theſe two attended by troops of baſe Informers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters, Catchpoles, Cheaters, Knights of the Poſt &amp;c. went up and down the Kingdom, cruelly polled and taxed all ſorts of people, and proſecute in every Shire the moſt deſerving and generous men, that the Kingdom in a little time was more beggard, then by moſt of the former Civil wars; and all this done by the Kings ſpeciall command, and countenance, that we may ſee what was the reaſon he began not ſooner to play <hi>Rex;</hi> want of opportunity, and fear of looſing his Crown while he was advancing it; but the latter end of his raign was too ſoon, and too long for ſuch actings. This King ends his raign with the greateſt acts of tyranny; he made himſelf a rich King by beggaring his Subjects; after he had freed his own perſon out of danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he imploys all his wits to enſlave the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the fruits both of his title and tyranny we have felt ever ſence in theſe that followed him.</p>
            <p>His ſon <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth of that name, ſucceeds him; in his firſt beginnings he ſeemed to be tenderly affected to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and redreſſed many grievances, eſpecially thoſe which were laid on by his father, and executed by <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> doing Juſtice on them for their cruelty and oppreſſion. But thoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were too good, and too violent to laſt long; the ſound of Drums and Trumpets ſoon quaſht them, and many encroachments grew on the peoples Liberties; many tempeſtuous ſtorms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies there were in this Kings raign; but they were more Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical then Civil, and ſo more dangerous and ſtrong. In a word, he was accounted a better Souldier then a Governor, and more fit for a General then a King to govern by juſt and equal Laws; the beſt act he did, was the diſcovery of the wickedneſs of the Clergy, and caſting off the Popes Supremacy, which yet he took to himſelf, and annexed it to his own Crown; as the moſt of his raign was ful of controverſies and tempeſts, ſo all affairs were managed in a ranting and turbulent maner, not with that gravity &amp; ſoberneſs as becomes civil and prudentiall tranſactions; he was very laſcivious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted<note place="margin">Martin.</note> much in variety, and changes of Laws, as wives; he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94379:21"/>
much pleaſed himſelf to be in the company, and was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>familiar with ſwaggering and looſe fellows; and the people ever and anon found the power of his Prerogative at home, as his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did of his Sword abroad. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth his onely ſon ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds him, a Prince that was too good to live long, the Phoenix of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings, had he had time to proſecute his intentions and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his genius; but the Sun in him did ſhine too bright in the morning; God gave <hi>England</hi> onely the repreſentation of a good King, but would not in judgement let us be bleſt long with him; Religion began to revive, Liberty to bud forth, the people to peep out of their graves of ſlavery and bondage, and to have their blood freſh and bluſhing in their cheeks; but all is preſently blaſted by his death, and the people (who have ſeldom more then hopes for their comforts) are now fainting for fear; <hi>England</hi> is benighted; and hung with black; Queen <hi>Mary</hi> that <hi>Alecto,</hi> and fury of women ſucceeds; and now both ſouls and bodies of the people are enſlaved, and nothing but bone fires made of the fleſh and bones of the beſt Chriſtians: But its too much to name her in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue; Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſucceedes her, who being prepared for the Crown by ſuffering, came in a moſt ſeaſonable time, both for her ſelf and the people, who were made fuel for the flames of her ſiſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>England</hi> begins to flouriſh again, and to recover its ſtrength; many inlargements were granted, both to the conſciences, and eſtates of the people; yet if we ſpeak impartially, we were kept further off <hi>Rome,</hi> then royalty; yet doubtleſs ſhe may be Chronicled for the beſt Princeſs, and her raign the moſt even, and beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, with more fruits to the people then any of the former Kings, eſpecially if we conſider how long ſhe governed this Nation; I end her raign with this Character, That ſhe was the beſt Queen that ever <hi>England</hi> had, and the glory of her Sexe to all Ages.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Line is now ended; we muſt go into <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſeek for a King, becauſe a daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>James</hi> the fourth, King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but I will not queſtion his title.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> the ſixth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and firſt of <hi>England,</hi> ſucceeded on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne; A Prince that had many advantages to ſet up Prerogative, which he improved; he was too timorous to act, but moſt ſubtile in Councel and deſigns, and no <hi>King</hi> did more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94379:22"/>
and cloſely undermine the Liberties of <hi>England</hi> then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he gave us cauſe to remember from whence he came; but his peaceable raign was the rail to his deſign, and did choak ſuſpition; we were brought by him very nigh <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and yet knew it not; he had an inveterate hatred againſt Puritans, as he had a fear of Papiſts, and made more of Biſhops then ordinary by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbytery; He had as much of Royalty in his Eye as any Prince could have, but had not ſo much courage to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute it; the Puritan alwayes lay in his Spleen, the Papiſt on his Lungs, that he durſt not, that he could not breath ſo clearely and ſtrongly againſt them; but the Biſhops lay in his heart. I will not rip up his perſonal failings after his death; he was the moſt profane <hi>King</hi> for oaths and blaſphemies that <hi>England</hi> had beſides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He now grows old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was judged only fit to lay the Plot, but not to execute it; the deſign being now ripe, and his perſon and life the only obſtacle and <hi>Remora</hi> to the next Inſtrument, he is conveyed away ſuddenly into another world, as his ſon <hi>Henry</hi> was, becauſe thought unſuteable to the Plot, it being too long to waite, untill Nature and Diſtemper had done the deed.</p>
            <p>We are now come to our laſt <hi>Charls</hi> (who is like to end both that race and its tyranny) the perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of all the reſt, and the moſt zealous proſecutor of the deſigns of all his anceſtors, who, if Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence had not miraculouſly prevented, had accompliſhed the utmoſt of their intentions, and for ever darkned the glory of the Engliſh Sun; ſo much I muſt ſay of him, that he got more wiſedom by action, then could poſſibly be expected by his nature; experience that teacheth fools, made him wiſe; he endeavoured to act what others deſigned; he diſſembled as long as he could, and uſed all parties to the utmoſt; But his zeal and hardineſs brought him to his death. He needed no phyſick for his body, had he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred his ſoul. But what need I mention him? he is the laſt of Engliſh Monarchs, and the moſt abſolute monument of Monarchy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of tyranny and injuſtice that ever was known in <hi>England;</hi> he would have been what other Kings are, and endeavoured to attain what others would be; he lived an enemy to the Common-wealth, and died a martyr to Prerogative.</p>
            <p>Thus you have ſeen a faithfull repreſentation of the <hi>Norman</hi> race, under which we have groaned for about ſix hundred years; the firſt Title made onely by the Invaſion and Conqueſt of a Stranger and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94379:22"/>
Baſtard, continued by uſurpation and tyranny, that take away but two or three perſons out of the liſt (and yet theſe bad enough if we conſider all things) and all this while <hi>England</hi> neither had a right heir, or good King to govern it; and yet by deluſion and deceit we muſt be bound to maintain that Title as Sacred and Divine, which in the beginning was extorted and uſurping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if gray hairs could adde reverence to injuſtice. <hi>England</hi> hath now an advantage more then all its Anceſtors, of freeing it ſelf from this ſucceſſive ſlavery, and interrupting that bloody line, and after an apprentiſhip to bondage for ſo many hundred yeers, Providence hath given us our own choice; If we take it we are made; if not, the old judgement of God lies on us for our ſtupidity, and blindneſs. For my part, as I do not give much to that Monkiſh Prophecy from <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth times; <hi>Mars, Puer, Alecto, Virgo, Vulpes, Leo, Nullus</hi> (yet I wonder how the Devil could foreſee ſo far off, and muſt needs ſay that it hath yet been literally fulfilled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both in the Characters of the perſons, and the iſſue) yet I muſt ſo far give way to the power of divine actings on my faith, as to think that either we ſhall never have a King more, or elſe we ſhall have one ſent of God in wrath, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had, ſeeing we are not contented that way which God hath from Heaven led us to.</p>
            <p>As for the Title of this Prince (who would fain be accounted the right heir) Let us but remember from whence he had it, and how its now tainted; were it never ſo juſt, the Treaſon of the Father hath cut off the Son; and how unwiſe an act, beſides all other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, will it be for <hi>England</hi> to ſet up the Son to propagate both his Fathers deſign, and death. We may prophecy ſoon what a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor he is like to be which hath both ſuck't in his Fathers princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and his Mothers milk; who hath been bred up under the wings of Popery and Epiſcopacy, and doubtleſs ſuckt both breſts; one who was engaged from the beginning in the laſt war againſt this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who hath the ſame Counſellors his Father had, to remember him both of the deſign, and the beſt wayes of effecting it; one who hath never yet given any teſtimony of hopefullneſs to this Nation; who was in Armes when a Subject, againſt the Libertyes which <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſpilt much blood for to maintain; one who hath both his Fathers and his own ſcores to cleer, and is ſain to make uſe of all <hi>Medium's,</hi> though never ſo contrary, attended with all the crew of Malignants of three Nations; who is ſo relatively and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94379:23"/>
perſonally engaged, that both old and new reckonings are expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be payd only by him. To his Father He is endebted for His Crown, and bound to pay His Debts, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil (which will amount to no ſmall ſumme); To the Papiſts He is engaged for their old affections, and hopes of new, beſides the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of duty to his Mother, and freeing her from her Monaſtry and Hermitage. To the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> he owes more then his ranſom, beſides the States courteſies; to <hi>Ireland</hi> he is in more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears then his Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> will be able to pay, and to <hi>Scotland</hi> for his entertainment and enſtalment more then <hi>England</hi> (for preſent or in many years) can repay without a morgage, or community of lands, and liberties, beſides what he owes <hi>England</hi> for helping his Father to make the Parliament ſpend ſo many millions of treaſure, beſides blood (which would have weighed down all expences beſides) and helping as a prime Agent the utter deſtruction of <hi>England;</hi> all which muſt be reckoned for with much ſeriouſneſs; and if men have ſo much charity and generouſneſs to forgive all, yet we have a reckoning with heaven to be diſcharged, which debt is yet unpaid (without we think the Fathers blood be ſufficient ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice); and if that death ſhould be a ſatisfaction for himſelf, yet not for his Son, who joyned with him, &amp; now continues the ſame fault, and guilt, and intends to follow on with more violence and intention then ever. Can we think (&amp; retain our memories and reaſons) that <hi>Charls</hi> the Second can forget <hi>Charls</hi> the Firſt? that cuſtom and education can eaſily be altered? that the true and reall engagers with him and his Father, ſhall be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed out of his heart, or that he can heartily love his oppoſers, but as he may make uſe them: or that when ſome Banks and Rocks are out of the way, the waters and floods of Royalty will not run in its wonted Channel? will Epiſcopacy dye in <hi>England,</hi> when King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is ſet up? Can reaſon think or dream, that Majeſty will not eat out ſincerity? or that Presbytery can flouriſh in that ſtate where Prerogative is the aſcendant? or is that perſon fit to be the <hi>medium</hi> of peace, and the glory of this Nation, who was the conjunct inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the war, &amp; the ſurvivor both of the war and peace? a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that durſt not ſtay in his own Nation to plead his right, becauſe of his guilt, whoſe youth and wilfulneſs is moſt unapt for the ſetling the ſtorms and tempeſts of a diſtracted Nation.

            <p>When this poor Nation (after all neglects of providences) hath ſpent its blood and treaſure to ſet up this Prince in the Throne, (which it may be they ſhall never effect) yet at the laſt they muſt ſtand to his courteſy for all their Liberties, which they can never expect, and make him a Monarch. The patience and long ſuffering of God hath permitted uſurpation and tyranny in <hi>England</hi> this long time for the hardneſs of our hearts, and ſottiſhneſs of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and it may be, may lengthen it out to the utmoſt, which will be a miſery with a witneſs, and yet a juſt puniſhment of God on thoſe who were born free, but will ſell away their inheritances for nothing to a ſtranger. Did ever <hi>King</hi> ſince the world began (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide ſome who were Prieſts and Prophets alſo) naturally, and ingenuouſly, with a royall affection devote himſelf to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of the pure and reall liberties of the people? Let him be ſhown forth as a miracle; but that ever any one that hath been all his dayes, both in the Fathers time, and his own engaged in wars againſt the Liberties of the people, (ſolemnly proclaimed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and to ſet up Prerogative, either intended or managed his raign that way (how ever he was brought into his Government) I durſt affirm to be a Paradox, and the utmoſt contradiction; I am ſure its as impoſſible to be fouud in <hi>England</hi> as the Philoſophers Stone among the <hi>Peripatecicks.</hi> But a word more to the Title, between the now preſent Power, and this <hi>Charls;</hi> what reaſon is there, and equity, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> (take them in what qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you will (following to the utmoſt the firſt principles for the liberty of the people) ſhould not be eſteemed as juſt heirs, and their Parliamentary ſucceſſors as this young Confident? ſhal <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> (only having a better Sword) a ſtranger, one who by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was never born heir of any thing, create himſelf a title to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and a ſucceſſion for many ſcore of years, meerly on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? and ſhall every one after him break the line as they pleaſe, and take their opportunities to make themſelves roots of Kings,

though ſpringing in the Wilderneſs? Shall <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh (the Father of us all) who was little leſs then a Baſtard, being the ſon of an illegitimate ſon of <hi>John</hi> a <hi>Gaunt,</hi> a forraigner, and private man, by fortune and power give himſelf a title to this Crown, and all our Kings ſince acknowledging Right by that Root? Muſt thoſe Pretences be Sacred which have only the Ordination of a more keen and glittering ſword? and a confirmation by Cuſtome be thus Divine? and ſhall not the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> (cloathed with the Authority of all the People, and carrying all the Libertyes of <hi>England</hi> with them) backt with the power of a faythfull Army, be thought (in the utmoſt Criticiſme of reaſon) to have as much title to propagate their Succeſſe for our freedoms, as they have had to convey both their uſurpation and tyranny? that a private claym by a better Sword ſhould be <hi>jure Divino;</hi> and a publique Title both by reaſon, ſucceſs, and providence of a ſolemn Aſſembly, who have been many years oppoſing the former oppreſſions, and now have gained it, ſhould not be accounted valid, nor of equall right with a succeſſive illegall claim? Let all the world be judge (who conſider the premiſes) and let the violenteſt reaſon unroyalis'd ſpeak its utmoſt. It is high time now to end that line that was never either well begun, or directly continued; <hi>Charls</hi> the Father is gone to his own place, and ſo is <hi>Charls</hi> the Son likewiſe, he being in his own proper Nation, <hi>Scotland;</hi> Let us keep him there if we be wiſe, and intend to be happy, and let <hi>England</hi> diſdain to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the domination any more of any forraign power for the future; and ſeeing we have conquered the Conqueror, and got the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the true Engliſh title, by juſtice, and gallantry; Let us not loſe it again, by any pretence of a particular, and debauched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
