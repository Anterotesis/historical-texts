            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Their army consisted of some 15 thousand foot, and 25 hundred horse, besides their

Mutiniers, all old and experienced souldiers, and were also divided into three <hi>Brigadoes,</hi> as the <hi>Avantgard,</hi> the <hi>Battell,</hi> and the <hi>Reere,</hi> as the two figures following here vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed shall Demonstrate.</p>
            <p>Now before the Armies mett, it was consulted wherein the Armie should be first em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, either in takeing the <hi>Forts,</hi> which the Ennemie held in the lowe, and broken grounds about <hi>Ostend,</hi> or in the seige of <hi>Nieuport:</hi> the latter being resolued vpon the States (who had all this while marched, and abode with the Armie) departed to <hi>Ostend,</hi> to take the <hi>Fort Albertus,</hi> and to open the passage betweene that Towne and <hi>Nieuport:</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with the rest of the Armie, leaving the Fort of <hi>Ouldenbourgh,</hi> &amp; the others, which the Ennemie had forsaken well garded, as behouefull (because without forcing them, the Ennemy could not come vnto vs, but with fetching a great compasse) marched by <hi>Hems<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerck,</hi> towards a Fort called the <hi>Damme,</hi> lying vpon the River that goeth to <hi>Nieuport,</hi> but finding the Countrie weake, and Moorish, and not able to carry the weight of our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and Artillerie, returned by a small village not farre from <hi>Hemskerck,</hi> and lodged there, thence crossed through the Meddowes towards the sea side, filling many ditches, &amp; laying bridges to passe over the waters, whereof that Countrie is full, and so with much adoe wee gott to the <hi>Downes</hi> by the sea side, and encamped about a Canon shott from the Fort <hi>Albertus,</hi> which was before rendred vp to <hi>Count Solmes.</hi> Earely in the morning wee marched along the sea side towards <hi>Nieuport.</hi> And at the ebbe waded over the river on that side, which maketh the Haven of that Towne, and so encamped there, and spent two or three daies in quartering, and entrenching our selves in places of advantage, for our owne safetye, and the beseiging of the Towne, laying a stone-bridge over the narrowest of the Haven for our Carriages, and troupes to passe too and fro at all times, &amp; as occasion required. The Archduke having vnderstood that his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> was satt downe before <hi>Nieuport</hi> gathered a head, and marched with all expedition with his Armie towards the Downes, passing the very same waye, which his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> did, that he might the soner relieue <hi>Nieuport.</hi> In the meane time his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> was advertized from those of <hi>Ostend,</hi> and <hi>Ouldenhourg,</hi> that the Ennemy with good troupes of horse and foote, were come and lodged neere the Fort, wherevpon consulting, the opinions were diverse, most of them agreeing, that it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Bravado</hi> made by <hi>Ribus,</hi> who as wee heard before had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp in the land some 4000 men together neere vnto <hi>Sluce,</hi> to divert vs from our enterprize, and that then vpon our Rmovall towards him, he would make his retreate to the <hi>Sluce</hi> againe. But Sr <hi>Francis Vere</hi> was of the opinion, that it was the grosse of their Armie, and how it was very needefull without any delay, to march thetherwards with our Armie also, least the Fort, &amp; the rest fell into the Ennemies hands, who might then come and lodge at our backs, &amp; cut of our passage to <hi>Ostend</hi> to the extreame annoyance of our Armie: That in vsing diligence to prevent the Ennemie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> takeing these Forts, wee might at once block vp, &amp; beseige tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se which the Ennemy held in the lowe &amp; drowned lands, being an <hi>Enterprize</hi> equall with that of <hi>Nieuport.</hi> While these things were thus a disputing that night came Messenger vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Messenger to the Prince to give him to vnderstand, first that the Ennemy had Cannon &amp; that those of the <hi>Fort</hi> were summoned in the Archdukes name &amp; afterward it was yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conditions. Thrice that night vpon general &amp; false <hi>alarums,</hi> Sr <hi>Francis Vere</hi> was called vp from his rest, which confirmed him in his former opinion, that the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie was comming towards vs, and that the Fort being yeelded into the Ennemies hands, it was needfull, that the whole Armie with all speede should returne over the water, to stop the Ennemy, from gayning the passage, our selues had made through the drowne land, and to possesse the same, which was the shortest, and the readiest waye the Ennemie had to the Downes and sea side. These reasons (of Sr <hi>Francis Veres)</hi> his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> liked not, but resolving to foreslow the Ennemie, as much as possibly might bee, that hee might gaine the more time: &amp; therefore the second of Iuly at the breake of the day he sent from the Armie before <hi>Nieuport,</hi> his <hi>Nephew</hi> &amp; Cosen <hi>Count Ernest of Nassaw,</hi> with two Regiments of foote, the one <hi>Schots,</hi> the other <hi>Zealanders</hi> with foure troupes of horse, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keing some 2000 footemen, &amp; 500 horse, with some Ordnance &amp; materialls, to entrench vpon the passage, vnto whome the States sent out also, according to his Ex<hi rend="sup">cies</hi> order,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109084:3"/>
some companies out of the garnison of <hi>Ostend,</hi> and those which came out of the Forts of <hi>Ouldenborg, Plassendale</hi> and <hi>Bredene,</hi> to hinder the Ennemie from passing the Bridges, which laye over certaine waters vpon the waye, as you goe toward the Fort <hi>Albertus,</hi> the Prince saying he would followe, &amp; second them with the rest of the Armie in due times.</p>
            <p>But before they came thither, the Ennemy had seized vpon those Bridges, and having passed over them with the choise of his Armie, it was impossible for so small a number to hold vp &amp; stopp the Ennemies passage towards the <hi>Downes:</hi> the afore said Regiments being engaged in fight with the Ennemie, &amp; finding themselves too weake, to resist any longer so puissant an Armie, after they had brauely defended themselues, and carryed themselves like good Souldiers, were at last put to flight, the most lost falling then vpon the Scotch; aswell vpon their chiefes, &amp; Captaines, as Gentlemen, and private Souldiers, who fought it out stoutly: soo that there were slaine about 800. dead vpon the place, amongst the which, there were eleuen Captaines many Lieutenants and Officers. The <hi>Arch-duke</hi> having gott this Victorie, wrote to <hi>Brugges</hi> that he had over throwne the <hi>Avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> of <hi>Prince Maurice,</hi> and that he was so farre engaged with the rest of his Armie, that they could not escape out of his hands: in so much, that this day they began to triumph at Brugges, and the adiacent Townes in ringing their bells, as though they had gayned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the Victorie.</p>
            <p>Now the newes of this defeate put the Lords the States into a great perplexity, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what a danger the countrie was in, if any misfortune should happen to our Armie which laye before <hi>Nieuport,</hi> and encamped on both sides of the Haven, the Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing separated one from an other, which droue them into a great feare. And therefore being in such an extremitie, when all humaine meanes failed them, they tooke their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to the Lord of Hosts by prayes and assembled themselves, and all their traine with diverse Officers and people of the Towne of <hi>Ostend</hi> into their chambers where their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister <hi>Vtenbogaert</hi> made prayers vnto God for the preservation of the person of his Ex<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, the Lords, Chiefes and Commandours, which were with him, yea the whole Army, that God would be pleased to give them a happie successe.</p>
            <p>The Archduke being encouraged with this advantage, and defeate, which he gott so quickly over our men, marched in all hast towards <hi>Nieuport,</hi> imagining to finde his Ex<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> and all his Army so amazed by this overthrow, that he might easely put our men to route. But God had his eye of providence vpon the State of these Countries, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense of his Church in them, giving his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> such wisedome, that he commanded away all the shipping, &amp; boates from <hi>Nieuport</hi> towards <hi>Oftend,</hi> &amp; with all gave order that all his troupes should be ready to passe the Have<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Nieuport</hi> at a lowe water, to gett on the other side, with a couragious resolution, to make head against the Ennemy, &amp; to give him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, according to which his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> went from troupe to troupe to animate and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge his Souldiers. That seing they had the sea on the on side, and the Ennemies Armie on the other side betwixt them, and saw that there was now noe meanes in the world to escape, but to fight it out and beate through their Armie: considering that his Ex<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> reputation depended thereon, yea all their honours, their liues and the good of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie lay now all the stake, &amp; that now they would carry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues brauely &amp; couragiously, with assurance that God would give them a blessed issue. The like also did all the chiefs, Commanders &amp; Captaines to there Souldiers. Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (now his highnesse) did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise encourage also his <hi>Wallons,</hi> or new <hi>Geux,</hi> being of his Regiment to doe the like.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Armie was commanded to march to the water side by the breake of day to passe over the Haven with the first ebbe, being then Sr Francis Veres his turne to have the <hi>Avantgard,</hi> which made him carefull not to be wanting in his duty, so as in due time his troupes were at the place appointed, and because the water was not yet passable, he went to his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> to know his further pleasure, whome he found by the bridge with most of the chiefes &amp; Officers of the Armie, where not longe after, newes was brought him, that the Ennemies Armie was passing the <hi>Downes,</hi> and marching towards vs, wherevpon S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> advised his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> that all possible speede must be vsed to passe the Furrs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109084:3"/>
the Ennemy was possessed of the other side of the Haven. His Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> willed him in all things to doe as he saw cause, and calling to him <hi>Count Lodewijck of Nassaw</hi> (who then commanded the Horse as Generall) badd him goe along with Sr <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> and follow his directions, so <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis Vere</hi> left the Prince, and went to his troupes, and as soone as the tyde serued he passed his men, which stood there in three <hi>Battailions.</hi> The Souldiers would haue stripped themselues to have kept their cloaths drie, as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis Vere</hi> willed them when he crossed the haven first, but afterward thought it not expedient, the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie being so neere at hand, and therefore he willed them to keepe their cloaths on, and not to care for wetting them: seeing they should neede none that day or else haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and dryer cloaths to sleepe in that night.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Lodwijck</hi> passed first with his fiue <hi>Cornets</hi> of Horse, whereof two of them were <hi>Harquebussiers,</hi> and advanced towards the Ennemie, and entertayned shirmish with two of the Ennemies troupes, and then followed all the rest, which were scare gott over on the other side of the shore, but they saw the Ennemie stand in full <hi>Battaille,</hi> betweene them and <hi>Ostend:</hi> insomuch that if the Ennemie had but advanced, he might haue preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> from passing his foote over the haven. Now the Ennemy not knowing how many of our men were passed over the haven, because of the great dust, which arose and blinded their sight, made a halte a longe time by the sea shoare, which gaue his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> time &amp; leisure to passe over the <hi>English</hi> &amp; <hi>Frize</hi> Regiments, with his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> 
               <hi>gard,</hi> &amp; Count <hi>Hohenloes,</hi> all commanded by <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis Vere.</hi> Then followed the <hi>French</hi> Regiments, the <hi>Walloues,</hi> &amp; <hi>Swissers,</hi> which made the Battaile (as is said) commanded by Count <hi>George Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard of Solmes,</hi> and after them almost all the rest of the horse. The Regiment of Count <hi>Ernest, Gistelles</hi> &amp; <hi>Huchtenbrookes</hi> made the Reere. The Regiments of <hi>Gistelles,</hi> and <hi>Vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke,</hi> which were vnder the Conduct of Count <hi>George Everard of Solmes,</hi> were left before the Towne of <hi>Nieuport,</hi> to block it vp, with charge to stand vpon their gards, and vpon his Ex<hi rend="sup">cies</hi> first order, to beready to passe over the bridge, which was made with boates, and plankes ouer the haven of <hi>Nieuport:</hi> how the Armie was disposed into the <hi>Vantgard, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile</hi> &amp; <hi>Reere,</hi> as yow haue heard already. When the troupes of the Vauntgard were passed <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis Vere</hi> left the footemen standing ranged in their order, betwixt the Downes, or <hi>Sandhills</hi> and the sea, and with the horse he advanced towards the Ennemie, whome wee discouered a farre of comming towards vs alonge the sea side, not to engage a skirmish, or fight, but to choose a fit place to attend them in, which was now the onely advantage wee could by industrie gett of the Ennemie: for by situation of the Countrie, that skill and dexterity wee presumed to exceede our Ennemies in (which was the apt agile mo- of our <hi>Battaillions)</hi> was vtterlie taken from vs: for the space betwixt the sea, and the <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills,</hi> or <hi>Downes,</hi> was commanded by the Sandhills, which consisted of many heads, reared and commaunding one an other, conteyning so much bredth in most places, that our troupes could not occupie the whole, and every where so confusedly packed together, so broken, &amp; steepe, that our troupes could neither discouer what was done a stones cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, nor advance forward in any order to second one another if neede required. And on the other side of the Downes towards the firme land, if the whole bredth were not possessed, the Ennemy might passe to the Haven of <hi>Nieuport,</hi> where our bridge, and most of our shipping yet lay on the dry ground, and so to spoyle and burne them in our <hi>View.</hi> To prevent then all these inconvementes, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> went to finde out a place, where the hills, and Downes stood in a manner divided, with a hollow bottome narrow and the hills higher to the sea side, &amp; North, then towards the Iland, &amp; South part, which ranne cleane thwart from the sea sands to the Iland, the Downes being there also of no great bredth: so that wee might conveniently occupie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with out front, &amp; commaund the sea shoare, and the waye that laye betwixt the lowe Iland, &amp; the foote of the Downes on that place which was on the higher side of the bottome, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> resolued to attend the Ennemy there, and therefore causing his troupes to advance, drew from the whole <hi>Avantgard</hi> about a 1000 men, to wit 300 English, the Princes guard; &amp; such other companies as vsuaily march with it 250 and of the <hi>Frizons</hi> 500, which were muskettiers, two troupes consisting of shott; and pikes, the English and 50 of his Ex<hi rend="sup">cies</hi> guard they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109084:4"/>
on the topp of the hill that lay more advanced then the rest, which being steepie, and sandie was not easely to be encountred, &amp; in the topp so hollowe, that the men laye co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the hills on the other side, &amp; might shoote from it, as from a <hi>Bulwarke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iust behinde this hill some 100 paces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, was another farre more higher, on the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, whereof S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> placed 200 men of the troupe of the gard, in which also (with a litle labour of the Souldiers,) they laye in a good covert, these two hills ioyned together with a ridge somewhat lower then the foremost hill, which endwaies laye East, and West, and broadwaies looked towards the South, and Inlands, and commaunded all the ground passable, on the outside, steepe, loose, &amp; sandie &amp; ill to be encountred, within the hollow he placed 500 Muskettiers, giving charge to the Officers to bestowe their shott onely to the Southwards, when time should serue, which was directly on the right side, and flanke as wee then stood turned towards the Ennemie. Betwixt these two hills on the left hand or flanke, which looked towards the sea, <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis Vere</hi> placed 700 men in covert places for that purpose to be neere the sea sand, that with ease, and good order in an instant, they might breake out into two or foure troupes all which were English.</p>
            <p>The Ennemie ranged their forces to the Northwards, directly on our left flanke, &amp; so they adventured to passe by vs to the other troupes, with intent to leaue them in his eye more Easterly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sands, then on the Inermost of the two hills, which <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis Vere</hi> perceiving, ranged in a Front (with a space betwixt them) the other two troupes of the English. And a pretty distance behinde them, more to the sea-wards ordered the <hi>Frizons</hi> in foure <hi>Battaillions,</hi> two in front with a space to receiue betwixt them one of the other <hi>Battallions,</hi> that stood behinde them. And the files &amp; intervals behinde the troupes, as close one to another as conveniently might bee, to leaue the more space for the ranging of the other <hi>Battaillions</hi> with a compitent distance betweene each division: so that one troupe might not shaddow an other, but that all of them might be in the Ennemies eye in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant: insomuch that the <hi>Avantgard</hi> tooke vp about one third part of the Downes, leaving the rest to be manned by the other troupes, as occasion should require, &amp; on the left hand &amp; the outtermost towards the sea more advanced, were the horsemen placed. This worke was scare done, when as his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with the rest of the chiefs, &amp; Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of the Armie came to the head of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis Veres</hi> troupes, where his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> in the hearing of many putt it in deliberation, whether he should advance towards the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie with his Armie, or attend their comming. Those that spake (as most men in those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses will not seeme fearefull) councelled him to march forwards: for they thought it would daunte the Ennemie much, &amp; make the Victorie more easie, whereas in attending him, he would gather courage out of an opinion of our feare by takeing the oppertunity of our staye, to fortifie vpon our passage to <hi>Ostend,</hi> &amp; so cut of our victuals &amp; retreate. Herevpon, <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis Vere</hi> alledged, that their Armie having bene gathered vp in hast, &amp; brought into a Countrie, where they intended noe such warre, could neither haue provisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of victuals with it, nor any <hi>Magazines</hi> in those parts to furnish them therewith, nor any store in that naked Countrie in the latter end of a yeare could be expected: soo that there was noe feare, that they should setle themselues there, to starue vs, who had store of victuals in our shipping, &amp; the sea open to supply vs with all sailing windes, with the vaine courage they should gett by our supposed feare, after a longe march, &amp; comming vpon vs downe those sandie steepe-hils in the extremity of heate would be wearied, &amp; spent before they could come vnto vs, &amp; then finding vs fresh &amp; lustie, ready to receiue them in the strength of our advantage, in all reason it would turne to their greater confusion &amp; terrour. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted (in their opinion) &amp; as it were with one voice oppossed it: so as in the end (S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere)</hi> was moved to saie, that all the world could not make him to change his opinion: His Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> was pleased to like of it, resolving not to passe any further towards the Ennemy, &amp; for the ordering of things reposed so much trust in S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> that he beleeued they should be well done, without viewing the places, or examining the reason of his doings. But his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> returned to giue order, &amp; dispose of the rest of the Armie, which as the water ebbed, his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> enlarged to the Seawards, next the which the Horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were placed, &amp; sixe peeces of Ordinance advanced, planted in the head of the <hi>Avantgard,</hi> having the advantage both of the winde, &amp; the Sunne on our side, &amp; gaue order to Mons <hi>Warmont,</hi> &amp; Mons. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venvord,</hi> that they from our men of warr, should giue fire with their Ordnance vpon the Ennemies <hi>Battallions,</hi> that stood vpon the strand. In this order wee stayed, &amp; the Ennemie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109084:4"/>
(though stil in our sight) moved not forwards for the space of two howers, &amp; then (rather turning from vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> advancing) they crossed the <hi>Downes,</hi> &amp; rested there two howers at the foote of the Iland, which confirmed their opinions, that he would lodge there. But wee found reasons to the contrarie out of their proceedings to keepe vs from wavering: for it was probable, that the Ennemie was harryed out, &amp; tyred with that nights march &amp; daies travell. And seing wee were passed the Haven of <hi>Nieuport</hi> (to haue hindred, or prevented vs, was the greatest cause of his hast) whilst also he saw vs stirring, &amp; ordering our troupes he might hope, that wee that were fresh, now passed &amp; engaged in fight, would advance the rather, to have the helpe of our troupes which were with <hi>Couut Ernest,</hi> if perchance he were retyred to <hi>Ostend,</hi> towards which the neerer wee were to fight to that place, it might be of more advantage vnto vs, or else if wee had heard of their defeate, then wee might be drawne on to revenge. But when he sawe that wee stood &amp; held our place, not moving out of the hope, that they were not provided to make any longe staye, for the reasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, &amp; might resolue to refresh themselues a litle &amp; then to advance towards vs: seing that side was for that purpose more advantagious, then the bare sea sands &amp; withal wee considered, that they made a halt to rest their footemen (which were all ould exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Souldiers, &amp; to that daye vnfoiled in the feild) they would attend rather the growing of the tyde, which was then at the lowest ebb, that the scopes of the sand might be lesse spacions &amp; seruisable for Horsemen. Now about halfe floude, they crossed the Downes againe to the seasands, &amp; marched forwards, sending some light horsemen farre before the troups to discover, one of which (as wee supposed) suffred himselfe to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who brougt newes to his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>, &amp; tould him alone that <hi>Count Ernest</hi> was defeated, and that he would presently giue him battaile, augmenting the number, braverie, &amp; resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The losse of our men being vnderstood before, wee were carefull to haue few present at the heareing of this prisoners report, whose mouth being stopped by the Princes order, not with sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they hearing it bewrayed it, both in word &amp; countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the souldiers</p>
            <p>The Ennemie advancing neerer, &amp; neerer their Horsemen came in the head of their trouppes in a compitent distance, to haue bene drawne to a fight, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> would willingly haue advanced the Horsemen of our <hi>Vantgard</hi> neere vnto them, &amp; with some choise &amp; well mounted men, haue beaten in their <hi>Carabines</hi> &amp; shit mishers to their grosse, with purpose if they had bene over charged againe to haue retyred in hast, with a sett <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantgard</hi> of Horse, betwixt the sea &amp; the <hi>Vauntgard</hi> of foote, &amp; having drawne them from their foote vnder the mercy of our Ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce would haue engaged the rest of our horse, to haue charged, &amp; followed them resolutely.

               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> over this charge, &amp; therefore was not by him putt in execution, who choose rather as the Ennemie advanced leisurely: to retreate likewise towards our foote. This councill of his takeing noe better effect, &amp; the Horsemen nowe comming within the reach of our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Sr <hi>Francis Vere</hi> made the motion to haue them discharged, which was liked, &amp; so well spent, that wee made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> scatter their troupes, in somedisorder, &amp; fly for safety, which had doubtlesse given vs the victorie, without any more adoe, if our Horsmen had bene ready &amp; willing to haue taken the advantage of this occasion: Their footemen out of our reach kept on their way alongst the sands, &amp; the soner to requite vs, advanced their Ordinance a good distance before them, and shott roundly at vs, and did some hurt. The water now growing very high, wee &amp; they were both forced to strengthen our <hi>Front,</hi> &amp; the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of purpose, as aforesaid was driuen to fight vpon S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Veres</hi> advantage, which he tooke with his foote, in drawing them into the Downes, where all our Horse stood with our <hi>Reere,</hi> herevpon our <hi>Avauntgard</hi> altering order, our <hi>Battaile,</hi> and <hi>Reere</hi> passed into the Downes, &amp; in the same distance backwards, as they had before raunged themselues vpon the sand on the left hand, so as the front of our three bodies of foote, filled the bredth of the Downes, not in any large front, but in the reere one of another, as the narrownesse of the passage enforced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> found a fitt place, on the topp of a hill, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the greene waye which lay on the greene side of the Downes might be comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by our Ordnance, vpon the which hill (by his Ex<hi rend="sup">cies</hi> order) two demy-Canons were presently mounted.</p>
            <p>The Ennemy drawing very neere, then S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> tould the Prince it was nowe time for him to goe to his charge, and asked his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>, if he would command him any

further seruice, he said noe, but to doe as he saw cause, willing vs the chiefes that stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, to advise him in what part of the Armie he should be personnally, wherevnto wee all answered, that for many reasons, he was to keepe in the Reere, all which his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> yeelded to. And so S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> takeing his leue of the Prince, he went into the head of the <hi>Avantgard,</hi> and after he had viewed the readinesse, and order of the seuerall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, the Ennemy now appearing at hand, that he might the better discouuer their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and for the readiest execution of his commaunds vpon all occasions Sr <hi>Francis Vere</hi> after he had encouraged his men in abyding the first brunte, tooke his place in the topp of the foremost hill before mentioned, where he resolued to attend the issue of that daies seruice, aswell for the advantage of the ground he had chosen there to stand vpon his defense, as alsoo because it was an even ground, where he might stirre from place to place (as is vsually and necessarily) for the executing, and performing the duty of a Captaine, where the Countrie lying open and plaine, he should not onely haue the sight of the Ennemie (vpon whose motions in such cases the Councill of execution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend) but also the view of his troupes, and they of him, which might haue caused many vnreasonable, and confused Commaunds, if it had bene otherwise.</p>
            <p>The Ennemies <hi>forlorne hope</hi> of <hi>Harquebusiers,</hi> having gotten vp, to the topp of the hills, and places of most advantage on the other side of the bottome before mentioned, began to shoote from thence at vs, whilst our <hi>Avantgard</hi> approched, who now growing neere at hand, fiue hundred <hi>Spaynards</hi> Pikes, and short mingled without Ensignes, or precise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gaue on vpon the place where S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> stood and very stoutly for the space of a great halfe hower, labouring to enter, and force it, but he succoured it with more store of shott from the topps of the hills. The grosse of their <hi>Avantgard</hi> standing in some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert from the shott, which flew from S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Veres</hi> troupes on the other side of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. In the meane time, the Vauntgard of the Ennemies horse advanced alonge the greeneway so often mentioned, betwixt the hills &amp; the Downes towards our horse, that stood more backwards vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the flanks of our Battell, wherevpon our two peeces of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance were discharged from the topp of the hill to good effect, and well spent, and when they came neere and thwart our right flank, the 500 Frizons Muskettiers, who (as is said) before were onely desired to bestowe their shott that way, did their parts, and so gauled the Ennemie vpon the first proffer of a charge.</p>
            <p>For the Prince seing the Ennemies horse advance, commanded presently <hi>Count Lodwick</hi> to charge them, namely, with his Ex<hi rend="sup">cies</hi> owne troupe, Prince <hi>Henries</hi> and <hi>Count Lodwijcks,</hi> who being seconded by these Horse Captaines <hi>Marcelis Bacx, Paul Bacx,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>La Sael</hi> their troupes, (as you maye see in the figure) brake the Ennemies horse, and putt them to a disorderly retreate. After this the Battell began on all sides, and the Ordnance from both sides played furiously one vpon an other. The fight from the first beginning to the end of the Battaille continewed, not onely in the Downes, but also vpon the shirt of the Downes, and in the bottome on the other side of them with diverse charges. And therefore his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> diuided his men into small troupes and divisions, that he might bring the more men to fight at a time, and to charge the Ennemie when occasion offred it selfe.</p>
            <p>The fight growing hotter &amp; hotter Sr <hi>Francis Vere</hi> giving two Regiments of <hi>Spaynards</hi> their bellie fulls, namely <hi>Don Lewes de Villars,</hi> and <hi>Don Ieronimos de Monroy,</hi> beating their Muskettiers to a retreat. The Ennemie seing that advanced both his <hi>Battell</hi> and his <hi>Reere,</hi> to bring them likewise to fight. His Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> perceiving our men thus engaged in the fight, caused also our Battell to advance, &amp; gaue order to <hi>Count George Everard of Solmes,</hi> to lead it on, who with three <hi>French</hi> divisions of Muskettiers charged two Regiments of Spay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards and Italians. The French Officers that led them on were these Captaine <hi>Du Puy,</hi> Captaine <hi>Du Br<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

The most of these came to handie blowes in the Downes, being the first charge which the French made.</p>
            <p>After this first charge of the Battell, these Horse Captaines, also namely <hi>Contelier, Peter Panny, and Battenburch</hi> charged the Ennemies Foote, the Prince sending Count <hi>Lodwijck</hi> with sixe troupes of Curassiers to second them, being accompained with Count <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rijck</hi>

               <hi>of Solmes.</hi> His Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> gaue order againe that Count <hi>George Edward of Solmes</hi> should giue a second charge with the French, who had the <hi>Avantgard</hi> of our Battell, who were diuided into two troupes, that on the right hand, was led on by Monsieur <hi>Dommerville</hi> Lieutenant Coronell, and that on the left hand by Captaine Sau. This was the second charge the French made, who fought with a Battaillion of the Ennemies Pikes, consisting of two Regiments, the one was a Spanish Regiment commaunded by Don <hi>Alphonzo d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valos,</hi> the other an Italian couducted by <hi>Iasper Sapena Maestro del Campo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Count <hi>George Everard of Solmes</hi> retyring with these French, was once more commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Prince to leade on Prince <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> his brothers the <hi>Wallons</hi> Regiment, called the new <hi>Geux,</hi> commaunded then by his Lieutenant Coronell Monsieur <hi>Markett,</hi> the <hi>Swisser</hi> Regiment also commaunded by <hi>Hans Krick</hi> went on with them, and fought stoutly doeing good seruice. These two Regiments encountred, and fought against <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte,</hi> &amp; the Count <hi>de Bucquoy,</hi> who commaunded the Ennemies <hi>Reere guard,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of three <hi>Walloon</hi> Regiments, and some Irish Companies.

This fight lasted about three howers longe, the Victorie being doubtfull on both sides, sometimes the on side winning, and otherwhiles the other side loosing ground. The Princes Horse in charging the Ennemie putt them often to the worst of it, &amp; our horse had continuall the advantage vpon them, driving some of them to a retreate as fart as <hi>Nieuport:</hi> The Ennemies foote fought with more advantage vpon the Downes then ours, &amp; made the Princes men to quit on downe after an other: so that our Ordinance was in hazard of loosing.</p>
            <p>To returne againe to our <hi>Avantgard,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> gaue order that a hundred men should be sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foremost troupes, which he had layd (as is aforesaid) in the Downes, to haue giuen on vpon the lest flanke of the Ennemie, if they had attempted to passe by vs on the Sand, and as covertly as they could to approch and fall on, vpon the right flanke of those that were in fight with him, when they were come vp, and at hand neere the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, he sent secretly by the hills (where there was a hollow discent) some sixty men more to charge them in their front, which amazed the Ennemie much, and made them run away, our men following them charged and killed them, till they had passed the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, and came to their grosse, from which they disbandied 500 <hi>Spaynards</hi> more (the like number as before) who followed our men, and seized vpon some heights that were in the bottome some what neere vnto vs. Their Pikes standing vnder the shaddow of the hills, they played with their shott from the topp of them vpon our disbanded and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing men. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> to driue them from thence, being loath they should gaine ground vpon him, sent more men out of the same by-waies, from whence he had drawne the first before mentioned, giuing then onely this order, to make good that place. This was a bloodie morsell, which wee stroue for: For whilest our men, and theirs were not covered with the hanging of the hills, as they advanced, or wee chased, so they lay open to the shott, not onely of those that were possessed of those litle Hills, but of the higher also who powred in a great tempest of short amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so as these Souldiers which S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Vere</hi> had sent, hasted for their safety to get the heath side of the hills. The Ennemie also for the like reason abode their comming with the like resolution, and so in a moment as the hills were rounde and mountable, our men can to handie blowes vpon the whole <hi>demy Circle</hi> of them, with much slaughter on both sides: but in the end the Ennemie was forced to retire. In the meane while, the Ennemies Battaile of foote were come vp to the <hi>grosse</hi> of their <hi>Avantgard,</hi> which as it had taken the right hand of the Downes, so the battaile with some distances betwixt them (though in an euen front) having bene well gauld and beaten with our shott, from the topp of the hills, stood all in good covert as the place would afford, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome they sent fresh men to beate ours from those grounds of advantage in the become. As our men began to giue back Sr <hi>Francis Vere</hi> sent new supplies to make good that place in the bottome: sometimes getting otherwiles loosing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109084:6"/>
of ground. The fight was still mainteyned with fresh supplies on both sides, so that <hi>Sr Francis Vere</hi> perceiued (though with the losse of men) yet with this advantage of ground he did not onely beate vpon the <hi>grosse</hi> of the Ennemie, but also gaue fire vpon their loose fighting men, which made the losse farre greater on the Ennemies side, his maine dessigne being so, as to engage their whole force vpon his handfull of men, made him employ his men sparingly, and by peece meale of purpose, to spend and wast the Ennemie (that they should not be able to abide the sight of our other troupes) when they advanced (as is said) the Horsemen of the Ennemies <hi>Battaile,</hi> and ours encountred together, but somewhat more advanced towards the Ennemie. Our men having comfort with the first successe our <hi>Frizon</hi> Muskettiers before mentioned, could not so well fauour our men, but our Horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being putt to a retreate, the Ennemie persuing them, yet were so saluted by our men that they were driven back. The Ennemies <hi>Reerward</hi> now coming vp, with the two other boddies (for so Sr <hi>Francis Vere</hi> termed them, because their coullours remayned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) most of their men being drawne from them and engaged in fight, they attending their Ensignes, advanced boldly on the left hand of their <hi>Battaile,</hi> and spreading the bredth of the Downes, they stood as it were to Sr <hi>Francis Vere</hi> his troupes, rather on the corner of his right flanke, then a Front, and so fronted directly vpon his Ex<hi rend="sup">cies</hi> 
               <hi>Battaile</hi> &amp; <hi>Arreregard,</hi> some Muskett shott behinde Sr <hi>Francis Veres</hi> troupes, towards which it seemed they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to advance first, wee gaue fire to them, as much as wee could from the hills: but when they began to open vpon the <hi>Frizon</hi> Muskettiers, who (as is said before) were onely to bestow their shott on our right side, &amp; till that time had done noe seruice, but against their horse, the <hi>Frizons</hi> gauled the Ennemie exceedingly, which made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stopp suddenly as amazed or a shamed to giue back, seing none to chaze them in a bottome of so small a <hi>covert.</hi> Herevpon they sent out some <hi>shirmushers</hi> alongst the Southermost parts of the Downes: Against which also some loose men were sent from our other bodies: but our Muskettiers, which gave fire vpon them standing, &amp; shott without feare from their rests gauled them most of all. The Horsemen of the <hi>Reeregards</hi> on both sides shewed themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and some bickering was betwixt them, but the Ennemies Horse retyred out of the footemens reach. This was a strange, and an vnusuall fight: For whereas commonly in a <hi>Battaile</hi> the successe of the foote depended most on that of the Horse: Here it was cleane contrarie, for so long as the foote held the place good, the Horse could not be beaten out of the feild (though as it fell out) they might be chazed to them.</p>
            <p>All this while the fight without intermission continued hoter and hoter, betwixt the other two troupes of the Ennemie, and Sr <hi>Francis Vere</hi> his men, each sending fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, as occasion required to maintaine the fight, so that now the whole troupes of the English came to handie blowes in the aforesaid bottome, saving some few that were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the hills, &amp; on the Ennemies side few were idle. Now was the time which Sr <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Vere</hi> saw, to giue the Ennemie a deadly blowe his <hi>grosse</hi> being disbandied, aswell in occupying places of the heath, as takeing advantages to annoy vs, by those that were sent to dispute the places in question, for their onely strength consisted in their loose men, which a few Horse charging on a sudden in the bottome, would then haue putt them to flight, and being followed <hi>pellmell</hi> with our foote, they could neuer haue bin relieued, nor gathered themselues together againe. On the other side, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> knew well (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further succour) their numbers would wearie, and eate out his men in the end. And therefore at once he sent to the <hi>Frizon</hi> Footemen, that were of the <hi>Avantgard</hi> to advance, and withall to his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> to give him to vnderstand how things stood, desiring to send him part of the Horse of the Battell to second him. And seing the Ennemie pressed &amp; gayned ground vpon his men, he sent againe messenger vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> messenger (for men &amp; none coming he imputeth it to the slacknesse &amp; neglect of the messengers.) In the Interim to giue his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the more encouragement, he went himselfe into the bottome amongst them, where ryding vp &amp; Downe, he did in their eyes, and with much adoe entertained fight with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though the Ennemie encroached and gott ground vpon him. At his first comming into the bottome he was shott through his legge, and a quarter of an hower after, he gott an other shott through the thigh of the same legge, which he neuer complained of, nor so much as thought vpon a <hi>Chirurgian,</hi> for he knew if he left that place his men would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109084:6"/>
quaile, he therefore choose rather (not being vsed to haue his troupes foiled) to try the vttermost cast, and not to show them the way to flie, hoping still for the comming of the <hi>Frizons,</hi> and the Horse which he had sent for, but hast was so small, that his men being overlayd with numbers they forsooke the place, not withstanding he did his best ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avour to haue stayed them, hasting along the Sands to our Cannon, &amp; the Ennemie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them hard, he was forced seing them all goe to retreate he with the last came of easely and vnwillingly (God knoweth) &amp; as he went his Horse fell dead vnder &amp; vpon him, having neither Officers, Gentlemen, or servants about him to giue him any helpe, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Robert Drurie</hi> by chance came, and a Gentleman a servant of his called <hi>Higham</hi> (and Sr <hi>Iohn Ogle)</hi> drew him from vnder his Horse, &amp; sett him vp behinde his Master, which helpe came very seasonable for him, the Ennemie being so neere at hand, when he fell, and so by this meanes he was saued out of their clutches, from thence he rode to our <hi>Ordnance,</hi> where finding his brother <hi>Sr Horace Vere,</hi> &amp; most of the Officers that came thether with some 300 Foote, he made them stand from before the mouth of the Ordnance, (which were laden with Musket Bullets) and willed the <hi>Cannoniers</hi> to discharge vpon the Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which swarmed now vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sand, the Canon being discharged made a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and lane amonge the Ennemies Horse and Foote.</p>
            <p>At the same instant his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> sent two Cornets of Horse to him, namely, his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by Captaine <hi>Ball,</hi> and <hi>Generall Vere</hi> his owne troupe commaunded by his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who comming thither, he willed them to giue them a charge, and withall gaue order to his brother S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Horace Vere</hi> to advance with his foote, and send the Ennemy packing. This small number of Horse and foote gathered together on a suddaine, gaue a great charge: for the Ennemie in hope of victorie followed vs closse, and being vpon the Sands, where horse might come to serue, they were soone routed, &amp; cutt in peeces, the rest saved themselues by flight, as they could in the Downes. Our men both Horse and Foote followed them closse at the heeles. Their Battailes where their Ensignes remayned, began then to stirre, &amp; rouse vp themselues, rather for their defense, then to revenge their fellows for they advanced not a whitt. Our men from the topp of the hills (who had kept their places from the beginning) had by this meanes a faire marke to shoote at powred whole volleis of shott vpon them. Our English Officers and Souldiers on all hands, tooke new courage &amp; came vp to fight, and their battailions being very small, &amp; thinne, by reason of the men that had bin sent from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to maintayn the fight, especially their shott (which in these vneuen places were of most seruice) were well pelted with our shott. Our men then pressing hard vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue back: His Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (seing the Victorie inclyning on our side) caused the Battaile to advance, and his Horsemen to make a charge vpon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Vpon which sight the Ennemie (without attending any more blowes was rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and chased out of the feild. In the last charge S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Vere</hi> followed not: for seing the successe vpon the Sands, &amp; knowing that his directions in the prosecution of the Victorie would be executed, he easely gessed that the workes of that day were at an end, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began to take care, and provide for himself, who all this while having bin vndressed, the blood leakeing from him at foure holes, together with a dangerous disease that had held him longe made him extreame weake and faint.</p>
            <p>Our men followed the execution hard, even into the Moorish grounds, as farre as the <hi>Damme,</hi> slew many of the Ennemy, and tooke a great many prisonners, among the rest in the first charge Captaine <hi>Ball,</hi> tooke <hi>Iasper Sapena</hi> before mentioned prisonner, and one of Generall <hi>Veres</hi> Companie tooke <hi>Don Lewes de Villari Maestro del Campo</hi> prisoner. The battell lasted aboue three howers in suspence, with the effusion of much bloode on both sides, sometimes the one side, otherwhiles on the other gayning, or loosing of ground. The <hi>Archduke</hi> himself escaped very narrowly, loosing in this battle aswell slaine, as prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners the most part of the <hi>Chiefes,</hi> and Captaines of his Armie, and the Principall, Lords, Nobles, and Seruants of his Court, as these prisoners. <hi>Don Francisco de Mendoza, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Arragon, Count Sol<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
