            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT will be perhaps objected, upon
the firſt view of this following
Treatiſe, why does this man Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to that which is written by a
<hi>Papiſt?</hi> I anſwer, Both becauſe it is
not <hi>Popery,</hi> but <hi>Gods</hi> truth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſhall ſhame you the more if you
diſobey. Will any of you now that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
the <hi>Proteſtant Reformation,</hi> and
pure <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, at once cry out
againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and all that you think
doth ſavour of it, and alſo wilfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in ſuch ſhameful Practiſes as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
thus honeſtly write againſt? Will
any that pretend to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and to have <hi>Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to be kept pure, come thither in ſuch
a Dreſs a <hi>Papiſts</hi> drive <hi>men</hi> for from
their <hi>Communion!</hi> O, ſelf-condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is commoner than many think!</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56338:4"/>
I have been long blamed my ſelf, for
not preaching and writing more againſt
ſuch ſinful <hi>Faſhions.</hi> My Reaſon was,
that our Hearers have ſtill greater
things to hear of; and moſt that are
guilty of theſe, are guilty of ſo much
greater heart-diſtempers, as muſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
be first healed. Could we bring
them to the true fear and love of <hi>God,</hi>
and ſenſe of their everlaſting concerns,
and the Vanity of the World, they
would eaſilier correct their <hi>Faſhions</hi> of
themſelves. And we have ſo many
quarrelſome Hearers, that I am ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of ſo preaching, as may tempt the
ungodly to think, that ſuch <hi>Faſhions</hi> are
the chief matter in which we differ from
them: It is to the Faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
ſeriouſneſs, and to the love of <hi>God</hi> and
Holineſs, and to the practical Belief of
the life to come, to the contempt of the
oppoſing tempting World, and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of ſinful fleſhly Luſts, and to
love and do good to all men to their
power, and all their life to prepare for
death and judgment; it is to this that
we earneſtly perſwade men. And I am
<pb facs="tcp:56338:4"/>
afraid, leſt when I mention ſome <hi>Faſhion,</hi>
Recreation, or controverted thing, they
ſhould think that this is all our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>But yet no ſin is to be made light of,
eſpecially when it is grown common; and
more, when people otherwiſe ſober are
defiled by it; and yet more, when it is
grown into the reputation of <hi>Innocent,</hi>
and defended againſt all motions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
and moſt of all, after God's
dreadful judgments, yea and while they
ſtill continue.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I have ſaid and written
over and over abundance more againſt
mens <hi>greater</hi> and more dangerous <hi>Pride,</hi>
viz. <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>ſeeming Wiſdom,</hi> of <hi>ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Holineſs,</hi> and of worldly <hi>Greatneſs,
Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> than of theſe
little feminine and childiſh ſorts of
Pride of <hi>Faſhions</hi> and <hi>Apparel:</hi> For I
thought theſe below the temptations of
ſuch as pretend much to Reaſon; and it
irked me to talk much of this in <hi>Books</hi>
or <hi>Pulpits,</hi> to perſons of ſuch childiſh toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſpoſitions, while they and others
wanted the deep ſenſe of thoſe greater
<pb facs="tcp:56338:5"/>
matters, which would beſt call off their
minds from theſe. But being invited
to preface this Treatiſe (tranſlated by
another out of <hi>French)</hi> I ſhall trye your
patience with my (in this kind) unuſual
freedom of ſpeech.</p>
            <p>I muſt ſay, that had I my will, four
ſorts of <hi>Faſhions</hi> ſhould be altered: <hi>viz.</hi>
1. The nakedneſs of Women, treated of
in this Book. 2. Their monſtrous ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity
of Cloth or ſilk that muſt drag af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, or be carried by another, or
fardelled behind them. 3. Their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
late Pride and laced gaudineſs.
4. And eſpecially the monſtrous Periwigs
of men, with ſomewhat like them now
alſo uſed by Women.</p>
            <p>As to the three firſt as ſet together,
beſides what is ſaid in the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
I humbly deſire all that believe the
<hi>ſacred Scriptures,</hi> ſeriouſly to think of
theſe things following.</p>
            <p>1. How unlike is ſuch a Garb to that
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his old <hi>Diſciples?</hi> Is it the
Badge of one that taketh up the Croſs,
or ever well knew a <hi>crucified Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is not the diſcovery of a ſinfully
<pb facs="tcp:56338:5"/>
diſeaſed mind? It is not without a cauſe.
And what inward cauſe would you have
men think that it proceeds from? Out
of the abundance of the heart come out
actions as well as our words: Doth your
inordinate gaudery ſignifie mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
gravity, a continual regard to the
eye of <hi>God,</hi> or a regard to grave and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſons, more than to the eyes of the
proud, worldly, or laſcivious? I know
young people will ſay, <hi>They muſt be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and therefore may invite deſires:</hi>
and I know that <hi>God</hi> hath put ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of natural luſt into Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for the continued propagation of
Mankind: But our higheſt Faculty, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
with all wiſe men, will here claim
the laſt judgment, and the maſtery of
ſenſe, and therefore you ſhould recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
your ſelves principally to mens
<hi>Reaſon:</hi> and our higheſt intereſt (holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſalvation) muſt make all fleſhly
intereſt vail: And therefore if you would
be deſirable to any wiſe man, it muſt be
moſt by wiſdom, meekneſs, and a holy
frame of mind and life; and not by any
thing <hi>contrary</hi> hereto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56338:6"/>
3. <hi>Let but your own conſciences judge
of thoſe words,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Wives
be in ſubjection to your own Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
that if any obey not the word,
they alſo may without the word be
won by the converſation of their
Wives; while they behold your chaſte
converſation coupled with fear; whoſe
adorning let it not be that outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning
of plaiting the hair, and of
wearing of Gold, and of putting on
of Apparel, <hi>(that is a curious Dreſs)</hi>
but let it be the hidden man of the
heart, in that which is not corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
even the ornament of a meek and
quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of
God of great price: For after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the old time, the holy Women
alſo who truſted in God adorned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>4. Do you not croſs your own deſigns;
which is, <hi>to be valued?</hi> If pride and
vanity be a <hi>diſgrace,</hi> why will you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
diſgrace your ſelves? If you hear
one ſay of you, Yonder goeth a proud, a
vain, or an empty perſon, you would
take it ill: And have <hi>Actions,</hi> your <hi>own</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56338:6"/>
               <hi>Actions,</hi> no tongues nor ſenſe? Say not
that of your ſelves which you cannot
bear from others: Pin not ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
on your own backs or breaſts: Or
if you will needs go your ſelves a wooing,
keep to theſe few reaſonable Rules:
1. Let it not be your every days work,
and that in the <hi>open Streets</hi> and
<hi>Churches.</hi> 2. Let not married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
go ſo, that are provided already.
3. Teach not your Children to go ſo, that
are not marriageable.</p>
            <p>5. Poor ſouls, you lay ſnares (as this
Treatiſe tells you) for your ſelves as
well as others! If you become a bait to
ſenſual men, they will gape after you,
and become alſo ſnares to you: and when
their flatteries have won upon your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and facil minds, what have you got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by it? If you eſcape the damning
ſin of Fornication, perhaps you have won
a ſenſual Husband, who may ſhortly
hate you, and make you weary of your
life, or by the like allurement grow as
fond of others, as he was of you.</p>
            <p>6. Will you but think what that <hi>Fleſh</hi>
is which you are adorning? When the
<pb facs="tcp:56338:7"/>
Surgeon ſhall diſſect your Corps, and open
your loathſome Entrails, or when it is
laid out for the Coffin, or laid to rot in
a darkſome Grave, where then is Naked
Beauty, or the glory of your Ornaments?
Do you not ſtill foreſee this day? How
can you be ſo blinded, or caſt aſleep, as
to forget it? What a change will the

<hi>London</hi> was in its Ruines; can you

Pits, and yet be as vain and proud as

<hi>Common Poverty?</hi> and is all this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to take us down? Doth not <hi>God</hi>
rather call us to humbling, and fasting,
and ſackcloth in our repentance?</p>
            <p>8. Are not you (among other unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
perſons) the <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> of our

conſiderate men in fear, leſt ſo impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

you, that have ſo long cryed down your

the many years warning of faithful
<hi>Preachers</hi> in witneſſing againſt you.</p>
            <p>10. And is it not a horrid aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Pride and Superfluities, that at

periſh for want of neceſſary food? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
all, or ſome of theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſhould quickly and eaſily reſolve all
ſober ſerious <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to be no more
conformable to the Pride of ſinners, nor
<pb facs="tcp:56338:8"/>
to deſire to wear the <hi>Badge</hi> of their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
or folly.</p>
            <p>Were I not very backward to ſay much
of ſuch matters, I ſhould fully tell, at
leaſt our ordinary <hi>Citizens,</hi> my mind;
that will preſume to imitate the <hi>Great
ones</hi> and <hi>Gallants,</hi> in the <hi>Faſhion</hi> of
monſtrous <hi>Periwigs.</hi> I ſpeak not againſt
the uſe of ſuch as are like a modeſt mans
hair, worn for any neceſſary lawful uſe.
But I confeſs I think that ordinary <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>
ſhould bethink them in a time
when thouſands are in diſtreſſing wants,
whether the price of theſe <hi>Periwigs,</hi> and
ſuch other vanities, would not be more
comfortably reviewed at laſt, if it had
been given to relieve the needy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt of the Objections that you uſe to
make are anſwered in the following
Book. One only I will adde, and anſwer.
I hear ſome ſay,</hi> If religious people go
not in the common <hi>Faſhions</hi> of the
Times, they will be taken for <hi>humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts;</hi>
and worſe than ſo, for ſuch as
are diſtinguiſhing themſelves from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to make a Party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There can no duty be done,
<pb facs="tcp:56338:8"/>
or ſin avoided, which ſome men may not
turn to matter of Calumny. 2. There
is no Reaſon for this Objection here: As
the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and conformable <hi>Clergy</hi> go
in a Dreſs that's plain and grave, and
countenance none of theſe immodeſt or
monſtrous <hi>Faſhions,</hi> ſo many of the <hi>Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
go ſoberly and gravely, without any
note of differing Parties. 3. The truth of
the caſe I fear is here, Pride maketh men
loth to be accounted of the lower or poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſort; and therefore what ever <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion</hi>
the Richer and Ruling ſort take up,
is imitated as far as they are able by the
Lower; even by Servants, and by ſome
that are in want.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhould be guilty of this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Exceſs, who borrow and live on other
mens Money, it is a heinous aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their ſin and ſhame. And if any
ſuch fall into poverty, it greatly harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
men againſt compaſſionating or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
them, when they lived in the
Garb of the rich before. And its juſt
with <hi>God,</hi> that they that muſt needs
have Superfluities, ſhould want Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56338:9"/>
I wiſh the <hi>Readers</hi> to make ſo much
uſe of this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of a ſober <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as
the evidence of truth therein be ſpeaketh.
And I humbly offer theſe two Motions to
all that regard my judgment.</p>
            <p>1. That all religious ſober perſons, men
and women will <hi>agree</hi> to avoid all <hi>immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Faſhions,</hi> and groſs Superfluities and
Gawdery, and not to affect Conformity in
Apparel with them that are contrary
minded; but imitate the ancient decent
Gravity.</p>
            <p>2. That yet none take occaſion by this to
expect that all Perſons ſhould be attired
alike: nor grow too cenſorious of thoſe that
continue ſome <hi>Faſhions</hi> which we could
wiſh they did reform, becauſe we may be
ignorant of their caſe and reaſons; and
if they are inſufficient, we muſt remember
that Education, Prejudice, Company, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Temptations, may ſeduce well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Perſons in ſuch Matters. But a Soul
truly devoted to <hi>God,</hi> and willing to know
his Will, and to do it when we know it, is
of abſolute neceſſity to our Salvation.</p>

               <p>IF they would but attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſider all theſe things, I am
certain they would themſelves
diſapprove of their conduct,
which has been condemned by
the firſt of Sinners, and which
apparently adds ſomething to the
malignity of corrupted Nature.
But we muſt indeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them by their own proper
judgement. Is it not true that
they would blame a Woman
whoſe cunning and artificiall
words lead to filthineſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity,
and who would declare
her ſelf in ſuch a looſe and open
manner, though ſly and witty,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56338:35"/>
that ſhe ſhould engage thoſe in
a prophane Love, who would
but hearken to her Diſcourſe?
how then can they be exempt
from blame, who do ſhow their
Breaſts and Shoulders at ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
a rate, ſince they cannot
poſſibly be ignorant, that that
nakedneſs muſt needs be much
more powerful than words, to
excite the motions of Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence?
for who does not know
that the Eyes are the guides of
Love; and that it is through
them, that it moſt commonly
ſteals into our Souls? If the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
ſometimes makes uſe of the
Ear to ſeduce our Reaſon, he
does almoſt alwayes make uſe of
the Eyes to diſarm it, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch
our hearts. Who is there
but knows, that Words vaniſh
with their ſound in an inſtant,
and whatever efficacy they have
to inſpire into us diſhoneſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
yet they want duration
to be able to engrave them deep
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56338:36"/>
into our minds? But a naked
Breaſt and bare Shoulders are
continually ſpeaking to our hearts
in ſtriking and wounding our
Eyes; and their language as dumb
as it is, is ſo much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
as it is not underſtood,
but by the mind, and the mind is
pleaſed with the underſtanding
it. To conclude, who knows not
that the Diſcourſes of a Woman,
if they are a ſhock to purity, do
yet ſhock us againſt our wills,
and give us a ſecret diſguſt, and
a kind of averſion and contempt
for her that utters them? But
the beauty of a Neck which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to our Eyes hath nothing
which repells it, hath nothing
but what attracts and allures us.
We begin to look upon it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repugnance, we continue to
behold it with pleaſure, we ſee
it afterwards with emotion: and
as it does not ceaſe ſpeaking to us
in its way and manner, nor ceaſe
ſolliciting us, and being pleaſing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56338:36"/>
to us, it at laſt triumphs over our
liberty, after it has abuſed and

Women who make themſelves
to be ſeen in that poſture, are
more blameable than thoſe who
by their impure and laſcivious
Diſcourſes endeavour to ſeduce
men to Libertiniſme, not onely
becauſe they ſurpriſe more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

the moſt debauched Women dare
not do by their Diſcourſes; but
alſo becauſe, to get them Adorers,
they make uſe of an addreſs that
is ſo much the more dangerous,
as it is more engaging and proper
to inſpire Love, to which wiſe
and prudent perſons are expoſed
by hazard, what precaution ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56338:37"/>

without preſumption believe they
will not conſent to any thought
that ſhall be againſt purity, when
by the nakedneſs of their Breaſts,

ſentiments in the hearts of many

a little of the fault which one
cauſes others to be guilty of, and
therefore they cannot be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chaſte, if they favour impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

their boaſts of having a horror
for it. Do not they know by their
own experience, that corporal
Beauty is only fit to awaken Luſt
in us, that it eaſily excites and
augments all the Ardours of it;
and to ſpeak the Language of the
Fathers, that it invites us to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Volupty,</hi> and provokes us to
diſhoneſt Love? and are they
ignorant that their own Beauty
may become as fatal to them in
inſpiring and ſwelling them up
with vanity, as to thoſe who
thereby are inflamed with Love?
for who can believe that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhews her Neck and Breaſts

You are the ſword which hath

               <p>IT IS no difficult thing to
judge which ſide they ought to
follow, if they are but reaſonable
creatures, and mean to be happy
in the Marriages they aſpire to.
And we may be ſure of this, that
they may be ſo, they ought to
keep their Arms covered, their
breaſts conceal'd, and their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not expoſed to the view of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56338:77"/>
men, ſo far ſhould they be from
ſhewing them as now they do.
Men make a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between a Curtiſan, or a
light woman, and a Wife; they
love that nakedneſs in thoſe whom
they look upon as the former, but
do extremely diſapprove of it in
thoſe whom they deſire to make
their Wives. Nothing more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
them in a Maid, than a modeſt
gravity, and a natural beauty,
without Art, and ſtudied wayes
of ſetting it out. 'Tis only their
irregularity and their paſſion that
ſometimes approves of Womens
naked breaſts and ſhoulders; their
reaſon and their prudence always
condemns it; they know that
that proceeds from one and the
ſame principle of being deſirous
to look upon a fair Neck, and of
affecting to ſhew it: and as they
are ſenſible by themſelves that it
is moſt difficult to behold it inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently

judge that Maid who is ſo pleas'd
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56338:78"/>
with having it ſeen by them, not
to be ſo innocent as ſhe would
fain appear, and be thought for.
And as they cannot doubt but this
is a great ſign of piety and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a young man, when he
bluſhes at the ſight of a naked
neck, and avoids the looking on
it, they are convinc'd that a Maid
is pious and devout, when ſhe is
aſham'd to uncover her breaſts,
and therefore keeps it equally
from her own ſight, and that of
others too.</p>

to have them go ſo; which
is not a thing ſo eaſie as they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine.
A husband is not leſs
jealous of the purity of his wife,
than of his own honour; and as,
if he be prudent, he does never
indanger himſelf to loſe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
ſo there is not any likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that he ſhould deſire his

her Innocence. A husband is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
intereſſed for the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

he may very well ſee
that ſhe is much to blame, when
ſhe dreſſes her ſelf according to
the vain modes of thoſe women
who wholly give up themſelves
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56338:83"/>
to ſenſuality and fleſhyneſs. A
huſband, ſays <hi>Tertullian,</hi> does ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well know what are the
charms of his wife; and there is
no neceſſity for her to ſhew him
them every hour; and perhaps he
ought to wiſh that ſhe does not
by her naked breaſts diſcover to
all the world thoſe which ought
not to be common but to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>

               <p>THERE is likewiſe a vaſt
difference between what a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
ſuffers and allows of, and
what he deſires. A huſband that
is honeſt, and has a kindneſs and
affection for his wife, may permit
her without any inquietude, or
complaint to go with her neck
bare; but it does not follow
therefore that he deſires and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it. And yet if this huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
does not declare expreſsly
to his wife that he will have her
go ſo uncovered, but he only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erates
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56338:83"/>
it, ſhe is to blame to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge
for her defence the will of
her huſband, ſince that inſtead of
conforming her ſelf through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

be only to pleaſe her huſband,
that ſhe goes with naked breaſts,
why does ſhe unveil and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them in any other preſence

the third place, we will ſuppoſe
alſo that her huſband ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

ſo through pure obedience to
make herſelf innocent; but ſhe
ought to do it with ſome ſecret
repugnance, knowing the danger
to which ſhe expoſes her ſelf: and

on the contrary, ſhe does it with
Joy and pleaſure, it is an evident
ſign that ſhe is leſs thoughtfull of
obeying the will of her huſband,
than of ſatisfying the paſſion ſhe
has to appear beautiful, and ſo to
inſpire love. When her huſband
commands her ſomething that
thwarts and croſſes her Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

ORDER
OF THE
Vicars General of the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick
of Tholouſe, the See be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vacant. Againſt naked Arms, Shoulders,
and Necks, and the indecency

            <p>THE <hi>Vicars</hi> General of the
Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe</hi>
the See being vacant: to all
thoſe whom theſe preſents ſhall come,
greeting. Among all the irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and abuſes whereby the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath indeavoured in the firſt Ages
of the Church, to corrupt the purity
of the cuſtoms of the faithful, there
hath been none againſt which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Fathers</hi> have exerciſed their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and ſpoken with ſo much heat
and vigour, as againſt the vain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
<pb facs="tcp:56338:88"/>
and indecent dreſſes of
Maids and Women. Thoſe very
ſame irregularities have deſcended
to us, and as if the ſucceſſion had
purchaſed them a right and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to ſhew themſelves, they appear
with an Audaciouſneſs as is only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to ancient crimes. We ſtill
behold <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Maids and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who forgetting the Renuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they have made in their Baptiſm,
before the face of the <hi>Church,</hi> of
all the pomps and vanities of <hi>Satan,</hi>
and violating all the Laws of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
do employ their whole addreſs,
and time to bedeck their heads with
borrowed hair, and ſollicitouſly to
be laying ſnares, by the nakedneſs of
their Arms and Necks, to catch and
ruin thoſe Souls which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
hath redeemed by his blood. We ſee
them with an exceſs of Luxury, and
with an immodeſty we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
even in <hi>Heathens,</hi> to appear
in publick after ſo ſcandalous and
ſhameleſs a manner, that to Judge
of their Intentions by the Liberty of
<pb facs="tcp:56338:88"/>
their wanton and languiſhing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
by the form and dreſs of their
habits, and by all thoſe other vain,
and bewitching braveries, we cannot
refrain but we muſt judge them cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal;
ſince that according to the
opinion of one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> they are as ſo many fatal
ſwords that give a ſpiritual death to
the Souls of Libertines, who are
ſmitten and wounded by their Eyes,
and who become the miſerable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimes
of defilement and uncleanneſs.
As this Spirit accompanies them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, they are not contented (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Language of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet)
to lift up the Enſign of their
proſtitutions in the ſtreets, in the
walks, and in other publick places;
but they likewiſe come by an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
temerity and blindneſs, to
brave even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> at the feet
of his <hi>Altars,</hi> and to violate as it
were the immunity of <hi>Churches,</hi>
darting by the nakedneſs of their
Arms and Necks the fire of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
Love into the hearts of the
<pb facs="tcp:56338:89"/>
faithful who are retired there, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Sanctuary conſecrated to prayer
and holineſs.</p>
            <p>THOSE very Tribunals of
penance, which ought to be wet with
their tears; and the holy Table, where
the food of <hi>Angels</hi> ought not to be
diſtributed but to thoſe that are
cloathed with the nuptial Robes of
Innocence and Humility, are ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſly
profaned by thoſe pompous gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
of the <hi>Devil,</hi> And by the world's
Liveries, which they make to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over <hi>Chriſtian</hi> modeſty.</p>
            <p>ALL theſe diſorders, which are
but too publick, joyned to the voice
of Miniſters, whoſe complaints are
great and loud to us, not ſuffering us
any longer to remain in ſilence, we
have judg'd it fit, and to be our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to ſtop an evil which every day
grows and gets new ground among
us.</p>
            <p>FOR theſe cauſes therefore, and
to keep from this Dioceſs the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
with which the Juſtice of
<hi>God</hi> does commonly chaſtiſe publick
<pb facs="tcp:56338:89"/>
Scandals, and the propharation of
holy things, we injoyn all <hi>Secular</hi>
and <hi>Regular Confeſſors</hi> upon pain
of ſuſpenſion, to deny the Sacraments
to thoſe who come thither with their
naked Necks, and Arms, and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and whoſe nakedneſs ſhall not
be modeſtly conceal'd by ſuch ſcarfes
or other dreſſes that are not to be
ſeen through: of which nakedneſs of
arms, or neck or ſhoulders, as of a
publick Sin and Scandal, we reſerve
to our particular ſelves the <hi>Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as to thoſe who after this <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
ſhall continue in ſo damnable
a cuſtom as that is.</p>
            <p>WE forbid likewiſe both maids
and women of all conditions, upon
pain of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> to come
into the <hi>Churches,</hi> and to preſent
themſelves at the Sacraments in
that immodeſt and indecent habit, to
cauſe their gowns to be held up there,
and to place themſelves among the
<hi>Prieſts.</hi> And becauſe the Laws of
Holy <hi>Church</hi> are ſo little obſerved,
and oftentimes prove ineffectual, by
<pb facs="tcp:56338:90"/>
reaſon of the ſtubbornneſs of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
moſt of whom are leſs touched
with the motives of their duty, than
with the fear of temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
we exhort and conjure, by
the mercy of <hi>God,</hi> thoſe to whom his
Providence hath committed the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Authority of Juſtice for exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Diſcipline, to renew the force
and efficacy of thoſe Decrees, which
their zeal and piety have oftentimes
cauſed them to make upon the like
occaſions for the better obſervance of
the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> that ſo
not only the material Temples may
not be prophaned by thoſe indications
of Luxury and Vanity; but alſo
that the living Temples of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi>
may be edified in every place,
by the example of a truly <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
modeſty and humility.</p>
            <p>WE further Order all the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi>
and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> ſuperiours
of the <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Regular</hi> houſes
of the City and <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> to be ſtrict
