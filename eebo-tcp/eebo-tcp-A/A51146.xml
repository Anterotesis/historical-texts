            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Gouvernment</hi> was originally Instituted by <hi>God,</hi> &amp; <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> forme of it chosen and submitted to by <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And it hath been the Glory of <hi>England</hi> above most other Nations, that the <hi>Prince</hi> had all intrusted with him that was necessary either for advanceing the wellfare of the people, or for his own protection in the discharge of his Office, &amp; with all stood so limited &amp; restraines by the fundamental Termes of the <hi>Constitution,</hi> that without a violation of his own Oath, as well as the Rules, &amp; measures of the <hi>Government,</hi> he could do them no hurt, or exercise any act
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62823:2"/>
of <hi>Authority,</hi> but through the administration of such hands, as stood obnoxious to be punished in case they transgressed. So that according to the <hi>primitive Frame</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> the prerogatives of the Crown, &amp; priviledges of the subject, were so far from justling one another; that the rights reserved unto the <hi>People,</hi> tended to render the <hi>King</hi> honorable &amp; Great; and the prerogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives setled on the <hi>Prince,</hi> were in order to the subjects protection &amp; safety.</p>
            <p>But all humane things being liable to pervertion, as well as decay; it hath been the fate of the <hi>English Government,</hi> to be often changed, &amp; wrested from what it was, in the first setlement &amp; Institution. And wee are perticularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to say, that all the boundaries of the Government have of late been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp; nothing left unattempted. for turning our <hi>limited Monarchy</hi> into an <hi>absolute Tyranny.</hi> For such hath been the transactions of affaires within this Nation for severall Years last past, that tho the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> &amp; <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes</hi> of the people, were fenced &amp; hedg'd about, by as many <hi>Laws,</hi> as the Wisdome of men could devise, for their preservation against <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power;</hi> our <hi>Religion</hi> hath been all a long undermined by <hi>Popish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,</hi> and our <hi>Priviledges</hi> ravished from us by fraud &amp; violence. And more especially, the whole course &amp; series of the Life of the present <hi>Usurper,</hi> hath been but one continued conspiracy against the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> &amp; rights of the <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For whosoever considers his contriving <hi>the burning of London;</hi> his Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a consederacy with <hi>France,</hi> and a <hi>Warr</hi> with <hi>Holland;</hi> his somenting the <hi>popish Plot;</hi> and incouraging the <hi>Murther</hi> of <hi>Sr. Edmund-Bury-Godfry</hi> to Stifle it; his forging <hi>Treason</hi> against <hi>Protestants;</hi> &amp; <hi>suborning witnesses</hi> to sweare the <hi>Patriots</hi> of our Religion &amp; liberties out of their Lives; his hireing execrable Villaines to assassinate the late <hi>Earle of Essex;</hi> and causing severall others to be Claudestinly cut off in hopes to conceale it; his advising and procuring the <hi>Prorogation</hi> and <hi>Dissolution</hi> of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> in order to prevent enquiry into his Crimes, &amp; that he might escape the <hi>justice</hi> of the Nation: such can imagine nothing so black and horrid in it selfe, or so ruinous &amp; destructive to Religion, and the Kingdome, which we may not expect from him, upon his having <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded</hi> the <hi>Throne;</hi> and <hi>usurped</hi> the Title of a King. The very <hi>Tyrannies</hi> which he hath exercised, since he natched the <hi>Crown</hi> from hi Brothers head, do leave none under a possibility of flatering themselves, with hopes of safety either in their consciences, persons, or Estates.</p>
            <p>For in defiance of all the Laws &amp; Statutes of the <hi>Realme,</hi> made for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Reformed Protestant Religion,</hi> he not only began his Usurpation and pretended Reign, with a bare faced avowing himselfe of the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> but hath call'd in muititudes of <hi>Preists</hi> &amp; <hi>Iesuits</hi> (for whom the Law makes it <hi>treason</hi> to come into the Kingdom) and hath impower'd them to exercise their

               <hi>Idolatries,</hi> and besides his being dayly present at the worship of the <hi>Mass,</hi> hath publickly assisted at the <hi>grossest Fopperios</hi> of their superstition.</p>
            <p>Nor hath he been more tender in trampling upon the <hi>Laws</hi> which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our <hi>Properties,</hi> seeing by two Proclamations, whereof the one requires the collecting of the <hi>Customes,</hi> &amp; the other the continuing that part of the <hi>Excise</hi> which was to expire with the late Kings death, he hath violently &amp; against all the Laws of the Land broken in upon our <hi>Estates.</hi> Neither is it any extenuation of his usurpation &amp; Tyranny, that he is countenanced in it by an <hi>extra Judiciall opinion of seven or eight suborned</hi> &amp; <hi>forsworne Judges:</hi> that rather declaring the greatness and extent of the conspiracy against our Rights, and that there is no meanes left for our releife, but by <hi>force</hi> &amp; <hi>Armes.</hi> For advancing those to the <hi>Bench,</hi> who were the scandal of the <hi>Barr;</hi> and Constituting those very men to <hi>deelare</hi> the <hi>Laws,</hi> who were accused &amp; branded in Parliament for <hi>perverting them;</hi> Wee are precluded all hopes of redress in <hi>Westminster-Hall:</hi> and through packing to gather by <hi>false returnes,</hi> new <hi>Illegall Charters,</hi> &amp; other corrupt meanes, a company of men which he intends to stile a <hi>Parliament;</hi> he doth at once deprive us of all expectation of <hi>succour,</hi> where our <hi>Ancestors</hi> were wont to find it: and hopes to render <hi>that</hi> which ought to be the peoples <hi>fence</hi> against <hi>Tyranny,</hi> &amp; the conservators of their <hi>Liberties,</hi> the meanes of subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all our <hi>Laws,</hi> &amp; of establishing his <hi>Arbitraryness,</hi> &amp; confirming our thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

            </p>
            <p>And it is not for any <hi>personall injuries</hi> or private discontents, nor in pursuance of any corrupt Interest, that wee take our swords into our hands; but for

               <hi>Vindicating</hi> our <hi>Religion, Laws,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rights,</hi> and rescueing our <hi>Country</hi> from ruin &amp; destruction: and for preserving our selves, Wives &amp; Children, from <hi>Bondage</hi> &amp; <hi>Idolatry;</hi> wherefore before God, Angels, &amp; Men, wee stand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from, &amp; do charge upon our <hi>Enemies,</hi> all the slaughters and devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that unavoidably accompany a <hi>Intestine Warr.</hi>

            <p>Now therefore Wee do hereby solemnely <hi>declare</hi> &amp; <hi>proclaime Warr</hi> against <hi>JAMES DUKE of YORK,</hi> as a <hi>Murderer,</hi> and an Assassin of Innocent men; <hi>A Popish Usurper</hi> of the Crown; a <hi>Traytor</hi> to the <hi>Nation;</hi> and <hi>Tyrant</hi> over the <hi>People.</hi> And wee would have none that appeare under his <hi>Banners,</hi> to statter themselves with expectation of forgiveness; it being our firme resolution to prosecute <hi>him</hi> &amp; his <hi>adherents,</hi> without giving way to <hi>Treaties,</hi> or <hi>Accommodations,</hi> untill wee have brought <hi>him,</hi> &amp; <hi>them,</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo what the <hi>Rules</hi> of the Constitution, &amp; the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the Realme, as well as the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature, Scripture,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nations,</hi> adjudg to be the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to the <hi>Enimies</hi> of God, Mankind, their Countrey, and all things that are honorable, Vertuous, &amp; good.</p>
            <p>And thô wee cannot avoid being sensible, that <hi>too Many</hi> have from <hi>Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, Covetousness,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ambition,</hi> cooperated to the subverting Religion, &amp; inslaving their Country; Yet Wee would have none from a <hi>despaire</hi> of finding Mercy, persever in their <hi>Crimes,</hi> nor continue to pursue the ruin of the Kingdom.

            </p>
            <p>And that Wee may both Governe our selves in the pursuit of this <hi>Glorious Cause</hi> where in Wee are ingaged, and give encouragement to all that shall <hi>assist us</hi> in so righteous &amp; necessary an Undertaking: Wee do in the <hi>Presence</hi> of the <hi>Lord who knows the secrets of all hearts,</hi> &amp; is the Avenger of Deciept &amp; Falsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ood, <hi>Proclaime</hi> &amp; publish <hi>what</hi> Wee aim at, &amp; forthe obtaining <hi>Where of</hi> Wee have both determined to Venture &amp; are ready to lay down our lives.
