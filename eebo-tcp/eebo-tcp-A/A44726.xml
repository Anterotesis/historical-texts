            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable, PHILIP Earle of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> and <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, and one of His Majesties most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privy Counsell, &amp;c.</head>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis Letter requires no Apology, much lesse any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but may expect rather a good reception, and thanks, when your Lordship hath seriously perused the contents, and ruminated well upon the matter it treats of, with your second and third thoughts, which usually carry with them a greater advantage of wisedome: It concernes not your body, or temporall estate, but things reflecting upon the noblest part of you, your Soule, which being a beame of Immortality, and a type of the Almighty, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more precious, and rendreth all other earthly things to be but bables and transitory trifles. Now, the strongest tye, the solemnest engagement and stipulation that can be betwixt the Soule and her Creator, is an <hi>Oath.</hi> I doe not understand common tumultuary rash oaths, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an ill habit, or heat of passion upon sudden contingencies, for such oaths bind one to nought else but to repentance: No, I mean serious and legall oaths, taken with a calm prepared spirit, either for the asserting of truth, and conviction of falshood, or for fidelity in the execution of some Office or binding to civill Obedience and Loyaltie, which is one of the essentiall Parts of a Christian. Such publick oaths legally made with the Royall assent of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107350:3"/>
whom they receive both legalitie and life, else they are invalid and unwarrantable; as they are religious acts in their own nature, so is the taking and observance of them part of Gods honor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; there can be nothing more derogatory to the high Majesty and holinesse of his name, nothing more dangerous, destructive, &amp; damnable to humane souls, then the infringment and eluding of them, or omission in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them. Which makes the <hi>Turks,</hi> of whom Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in this particular may learn a tender peece of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to be so cautious, that they seldome or never administer an oath to Greek, Jew, or any other Nation; and the reason is, That if that Party sworn doth take that Oath upon hopes of some advantage, or for evading of danger or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and afterwards rescinds it, they think themselves to be involved in the Perjury, and accessary to his damnation: Our Civill Law hath a Canon consonant to this, which is, <hi>Mortale peccatum est ei praestare juramentum, quem scio veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similiter violaturum; 'Tis a mortall sin to administer an Oath to him who I probably know will break it</hi>; To this may allude another wholesome saying, <hi>A false Oath is damnable, a true Oath dangerous, none at all the safest.</hi> How much then have they to answer for, who of late years have fram'd such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable coercive generall oaths, to serve them for engines of State, to lay battery to the Consciences and Soules of poor men, and those without the assent of the Soveraign, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite point blank to former Oaths they themselves had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: these kind of <hi>Oaths</hi> the City hath swallowed lately in grosse, and the Country in detaile, which makes me confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beleeve, that if ever that saying of the holy Prophet, <hi>The Land mourns for Oaths,</hi> was applyable to any part of the habitable earth, it may be now applied to this desperate Island</p>
            <p>But now I come to the maine of my purpose, and to those <hi>Oaths</hi> your Lordship hath taken, before this distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107350:3"/>
time, which, the world knowes, and your Conscience can testifie, were divers; They were all of them Solemn, and some of them Sacramentall <hi>Oaths</hi> (and indeed, <hi>every So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath among the Ancients was held a Sacrament:</hi>) They all implyed, and imposed an indispensible fidelity, Truth and loyalty from you to your Soveraigne Prince, your Liege Lord and Master the <hi>King:</hi> I will m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke some instances: <hi>Your Lordship</hi> took an oath when Knight of the Bath, <hi>To love your Soveraigne above all earthly Creatures, and for His Right and Dignity to live and dye:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the oath of Supremacy you swear <hi>to beare faith and true alleagiance to the Kings Highnesse, and to your power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all Iurisdictions, Priviledges, Preheminences, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities belonging to His Highnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship took an oath when Privie Counsellor, <hi>to be a true and faithfull Servant unto Him, and if you knew or understood of any manner of thing to be attempted, done, or</hi> spoken <hi>against His Majesties Person, Honour, Crown, or Dignity, you sweare to let, and withstand the same, to the uttermost of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and either cause it to be revealed to Himselfe, or to others of His Privy Counsell:</hi> The oaths you took when Bedchamber man, and L. Chamberlain bind you as strictly to His <hi>Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship</hi> may also call to memory when you were installed <hi>Knight of the Garter,</hi> (whereof you are now the oldest living, except a <hi>K.</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi>) you solemnly swore <hi>to defend the Honour, and Quarrels, the Rights and Lordship of your Soveraigne</hi>: Now the Record tells us that the chiefest ground of instituting that <hi>Order</hi> by that heroicke Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, was, That he might have choice gallant men, who by <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> should adhere unto him in all dangers, and difficulties, and that by way of reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he should protect and defend them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which made <hi>Alfonso</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> so much importune <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107350:4"/>
Eight to install him one of the Knights of the Garter, that he might ingage King <hi>Harry</hi> to protect him against <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, who threatned then the conquest of <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How your <hi>Lordship</hi> hath acquitted your selfe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these Oaths, your Conscience (that bosome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord) can make the best affidavit; Some of them oblige you <hi>to live and dye</hi> with King <hi>Charles,</hi> but what <hi>Oaths</hi> or any thing like an <hi>Oath</hi> binds you <hi>to live and dye</hi> with the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> as your <hi>Lordship</hi> often gives out you will, I am yet to learne: Unlesse that House which hath not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer as much as to administer an <hi>Oath,</hi> (much lesse to make one) can <hi>absolve</hi> you from your former <hi>Oaths,</hi> or haply by their omnipotence <hi>dispence</hi> with you for the observance of them. Touching the <hi>Politicall</hi> capacity of the King, I feare that will be a weak plea for your <hi>Lordship</hi> before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of Heaven, and they who whisper such Chimeras in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your eares abuse you in grosse; but put case there were such a thing as politicall capacity distinct from the personall; which to a true rationall man is one of the grossest Buls that can be, yet these forementioned <hi>Oaths</hi> relate most of them meerly unto the <hi>Kings Person,</hi> the individuall Person of <hi>King Charles,</hi> as you are His domestick Counsellor, and cubicular Servant.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord,</hi> I take leave to tell your <hi>Lordship</hi> (and the Spectator sees sometimes more then the Gamester, that the world extreamly marvels at you, more then others, and it makes those who wish you best to be transformed to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That your <hi>Lordship</hi> should be the first of your Race who decerted the <hi>Crowne,</hi> which one of your Progenitors said, he would still follow, though it were thrown upon a hedge: Had your Princely Brother been living, he would have been sooner torne by wild horses, than have binded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, or abandoned the <hi>King</hi> his Master, and fallen to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107350:4"/>
such grosse Idolatry as to worship the <hi>Beast with many heads.</hi> The world also stands astonished, that you should confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to bring into the bowels of the land, and make Elogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums of that hungry people which have been from all times so crosse and fatall to the English Nation, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to your <hi>own</hi> honour: Many thousands doe wonder that your <hi>Lordship</hi> should be brought to persecute with so much animosity and hatred, that reverend <hi>Order</hi> in Gods Church which is contemporary with Christianity it selfe, and whereunto you had once designed, and devoted one of your dearest Sonnes so solemnly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> if this Monster of Reformation (which is like an infernall Spirit, clad in white, and hath a cloven head as well as feet) prevailes, you shall find the same destiny will attend poore <hi>England,</hi> as did <hi>Bohemia</hi> which was one of the Flourishingst Kingdoms upon this part of the earth; The Common People there, repin'd at the Hierarchy and riches of the Church, thereupon a Parliament was pack'd, where Bishop were demolished; What followed? The Nobles and Gentry went down next and afterwards the Crown it selfe; and so it became a popular confus'd Anarchicall State, and a Stage of bloud a long time; so that at last, when this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got had done working in the braines of the foolish people, they were glad to have recourse to Monarchy againe, after a world of calamities; though it degenerated from a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Kingdome to an Elective. Me thinks, my Lord, under favour, that those notorious visible judgements which have fallen upon these Refiners of reform'd Religion should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beguile your Lordship, and open your eyes: For the hand of heaven never appeared so clearly in any humane actions: Your Lordship may well remember what became of the <hi>Hothams,</hi> and Sir <hi>Alexander Cary,</hi> who were the two fatall wretches that began the War first, one in the <hi>North,</hi> the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107350:5"/>
other in the <hi>South; Your Lordship</hi> may be also pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what became of <hi>Brooks</hi> the Lord, and <hi>Hambden</hi>; the first whereof was dispatched by a deaf and dumb man out of an ancient Church which he was battering, and that sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also, for he fell stone dead in the twinkling of an eye; Now, one of the greatest cavils he had against our <hi>Lythirgie</hi> was a clause of a Prayer there against <hi>sudden Death,</hi> besides the fagge end of his Grace in that journey was, that if the design was not pleasing to God, he might perish in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For the other wiseaker, he be sprinkled with his bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and received his death upon the same clod of earth in <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham shire,</hi> where he had first assembled the poore Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people like so many Geese to drive them gagling in a mutiny to <hi>London,</hi> with the Protestation in their Caps, which hath been since torn in Flitters, and is now grown ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solet and quite out of use. Touching <hi>Pym</hi> and <hi>Stroud,</hi> those two worthy Champions of the <hi>Vtopian</hi> cause, the first being opened, his stomack and guts were found to be full of pellets of bloud; the other had little or no brain at all left in his skul being dead, &amp; lesse when he was living: For <hi>Hollis</hi> who carried the first scandalous Remonstrance (that work of night, &amp; the verdict of a sterv'd jury) to welcome the <hi>King</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi> and was the <hi>first</hi> of the <hi>five</hi> Members who were impeached by his Majesty; he hath been since, your Lordship knowes, the chiefe of the <hi>Eleven</hi> Members Impeached by themselves, but with this difference, That <hi>they</hi> had justice against him, though the <hi>King</hi> could get none: But now that St. <hi>Hollis</hi> with the rest are a kind of Runnagates beyond the Seas, scorn'd by all mankind, and baffled every where, yea, even by the <hi>Boors of Holland,</hi> and not daring to peep in any populous Town but by owle-light.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I beleeve your <hi>Lordship</hi> hath good cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the same kind of riotous Rascals which rabled

            <p>My Lord, 'tis high time for you to recollect your selfe, to enter into the private closet of your thoughts, and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them all to counsel upon your pillow; consider well the slavish condition your dear Countrey is in, weigh well the sad case your liege Lord and Master is in, how He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reav'd of His Queen, His Children, His Servants, His Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and of every thing in which there is any comfort; observe well, how neverthelesse, God Almighty works in Him, by inspiring Him with equality and calmnesse of mind, with patience, prudence, and constancy; how He makes His very <hi>crosses</hi> to stoop unto Him, when His <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:107350:7"/>

            <p>Consider that acts of Loyaltie to the Crown, are the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest columns to beare up a Noblemans name to future ages, and register it in the temple of immortality. Reconcile your self therfore speedily unto your liege Lord and Master, think upon the infinite private obligations you have had both to <hi>Sire and Son:</hi> The Father kiss'd you often, kisse you now the <hi>Sun</hi> lest <hi>He</hi> be too angry; <hi>And Kings,</hi> you will find, my Lord, <hi>are like the Sun in the Heavens, which may be clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a time, yet is he still in his Spheare, and will break out again, and shine as gloriously as ever</hi>; Let me tell your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> that the people begin to grow extream weary of their Physitians, they find the remedy to be far worse then their former disease; nay, they stick not to call some of them meer Quacksalvers, rather then Physitians; Some go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and say, they are no more Parliament, then a Pye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Court at <hi>Bartholomew-faire,</hi> there being all the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall parts of a true Parliament wanting in this, as fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of elections, freedome of Speech, fulnesse of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>

nor have they any Head at all; Besides, they have broken all the fundamentall rules and priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and dishonoured that high Court more then any thing else: They have ravish'd <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which they are sworne to maintain, taken away our birth-right, and transgressed all the Laws of heaven and earth: Lastly, they have most perjuriously betrayed the trust the <hi>King</hi> reposed in them, the trust their Countrey reposed in them; so that if reason and Law were now in date, by the breach of their Priviledges, and by betraying the double trust that is put in them, they have dissolved themselves <hi>ipso facto,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how many thousand times, notwithstanding that monstrous grant of the <hi>Kings, that fatall Act of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>; And truely, my Lord, I am not to this day satisfied of the legality (though I am satisfied of the forciblenesse) of that Act, whether it was in <hi>His Majesties</hi> power to passe it or no; for the Law ever presupposeth these Clauses in all Con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
