            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But as he was faire, ſo was he well made of bodie, no Knight more gallant and ſéemely, nor none more repleat with vertue: therefore hée was much bemoned both of men and women that ſawe him paſſe by. And becauſe Earle <hi>Amerie</hi> was a big boned man, a valiant and an expert Knight in armes, none ſtronger in all the Kinges Court, he was inward with the King &amp; wel-beloued: euerie one greatly pityed that he was ſuch a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, for a worſe could not be found in any Realme, hée had great truſt in his owne ſtrength, and little regarded <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> thinking hee ſhould not long endure againſt him.

Then <hi>Huon</hi> who was wearie of trauaile, and what for famine and for heate, the which he and his companie had endured two dayes without bread or meat, ſo that he was ſo féeble that he could ride no further, and then he began pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyouſly to wéepe, and complayned of the great wronge that Kinge <hi>Charlemaine</hi> had done vnto him, and then <hi>Garyn</hi> and <hi>Gerames</hi> comforted him, and had great pitie of him, and they knew well by the reaſon of his youth, hunger oppreſſed him more then it did to them of greater age. Then they alighted vnder a great Oake, to the entent to ſearch for ſome fruit to eate, they glad thereof let their horſes goe to paſture. When they were thus alighted, the Dwarfe of the Fayry Kinge <hi>Oberon</hi> came ryding by, and had on a Gowne ſo rich, that it were maruaile to recount the riches and faſhion thereof, &amp; it was ſo garniſhed with precious ſtones, that the clearneſſe of them ſhined like the Sonne.

Alſo he had about his necke
<pb facs="tcp:4519:39"/>
a rich Horne hanging by two Laces of gold, the Horne was ſo rich and faire, that there was neuer ſéene any ſuch, it was made by foure Ladies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fayries in the Iſle of <hi>Chafalone,</hi> one of them gaue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horne ſuch a propertie, that whoſoeuer heard the ſound thereof, if he were in the greateſt ſickeneſſe in the world, he ſhould incontinent be whole and ſound: the Ladie that gaue this gift to the Horne, was named <hi>Glorian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> The ſecond Ladie was named <hi>Tranſlyna,</hi> ſhe gaue to this Horne another propertie, and that was, whoſoeuer heard this Horne, if he were in the greateſt famine of the worlde, he ſhould be ſatisfied as well, as though he had eaten al that he woulde wiſhe for, and ſo likewiſe for drinke as well, as though he had droonke his fil of the beſt wine in al the world. The third Ladie named <hi>Margala</hi> gaue to this Horne yet a greater gift, and that was, whoſoeuer heard this Horne, though he were neuer ſo poore or feeble by ſickneſſe, he ſhould haue ſuch ioy in his heart, that he ſhould ſinge and daunce. The fourth Ladie named <hi>Lempatrix,</hi> gaue to this Horne ſuch a gift, that whoſoeuer heard it, if he were an hundred dayes iourneys of, he ſhould come at the pleaſure of him that blew it farre or néere.</p>
               <p>Then King <hi>Oberon,</hi> who knew well, and had ſéene the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene Companions, he ſet his Horne to his mouth, and blew ſo melodious a blaſt, that the fourtéene Companions being vnder the Trée had ſo perſit a ioy at their hearts, that they al roſe vp and began to ſing and daunce.

Then <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> laughed at him and ſaid: Sirs, all you ſit down here in the meadowe, and haue no doubt but all that I will doe is done by the puiſſance of our Lord God: then <hi>Oberon</hi> began
<pb facs="tcp:4519:43"/>
to wiſh, and ſaide vnto <hi>Huon</hi> and his companie: Sirs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe vp quickly, the which they did, then they looked before them, and ſawe a faire and a rich Pallaice garniſhed with Chambers and Halles, hanged &amp; bedded with rich cloathes of ſilke beaten with gold, and Tables ready ſet full of meat.

               <p>
                  <hi>Oberon</hi> ſat at the tables end vpon a bench of Iuorie, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly garniſhed with gould and precious ſtones, the which ſeat had ſuch vertue giuen vnto it by the Fayrie, that whoſoeuer by any ſubtil means would poyſon him that ſhould ſit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: aſſoone as he ſhould approach néere to the ſeat he ſhould fall downe ſtarke dead. King <hi>Oberon</hi> ſat thereon richly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled, and <hi>Huon</hi> who ſat néere vnto him began to eate a great pace, but <hi>Gerames</hi> had ſmall appetite to eate, for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued that they ſhould neuer depart thence: when <hi>Oberon</hi> ſawe him he ſaid, <hi>Gerames</hi> eate thy meat and drinke, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as thou haſt eaten, thou ſhalt haue leaue to goe when thou liſt. When <hi>Gerames</hi> heard that, he was ioyfull, then he began to eate and drinke, for he knew well that <hi>Oberon</hi> would not doe againſt his aſſurance. All the companie did well eate and drinke, they were ſerued with all thinges that they could wiſh for. When <hi>Huon</hi> ſawe how they were all ſatiſfied and repleat, and had well dyned, he ſaide to Kinge <hi>Oberon.</hi> Sir, when it ſhall be your pleaſure, I would you ſhould giue vs leaue to depart. <hi>Huon,</hi> (quoth <hi>Oberon</hi>) I am right well content ſo to doe, but firſt I will ſhewe you my iewels: then he called <hi>Clariand</hi> a Knight of the Fayrey, and ſaide, Fréend goe and fetch to me my Cup, he did his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and when <hi>Oberon</hi> had the Cup in his hand,

he ſaid vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> Sir, behold well, you ſée that this Cup is nowe voyd and emptie: that is true Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon.</hi>) Then <hi>Oberon</hi> ſet the Cup on the Table, and ſaide vnto <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>: Sir, behold the great power that God hath giuen mée, &amp; that in the Fayrie I may doe what is my pleaſure: then hée made ouer the Cup the ſigne of a Croſſe thrée times, and incontinent the Cup was full of wine, and then he ſaid.

Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I thanke you, but I am in doubt that I am not worthy, nor of valour to drinke thereof, nor to touch the Cup, I neuer heard of ſuch dignitie as this Cup is of: but Sir, knowe for truth, I haue béen confeſſed of all my ſinnes, and I am repentant and ſorrowfull for that I haue done, and I doe pardon and forgiue all the men in the world, whatſoeuer iniurie hath béene done vnto me, and I knowe not that I haue done wronge to any creature, nor I hate no man: and ſo hée tooke the Cup in both his handes, and ſet it to his mouth, and droonke of the good wine that was therein at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I ſhall right well beware thereof, and nowe Sir I require you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs to depart. Abide yet, (quoth he to <hi>Huon</hi>) yet I haue another iewell, the which I will giue thée, bicauſe I thinke there bee truth and noblenes in thée: I will giue thée a rich Horne of Iuorie, the which is full of great vertue, &amp; which thou ſhalt beare with thée, it is of ſo great vertue, that if thou be neuer ſo farre from me, aſſoone as thou bloweſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Horne, I ſhall heare thée, and ſhalbe incontinent with thée, with a hundred thouſand men at armes for to ſuccour and ayd thée. But one thinge I commaund thée on the payne of looſing of my loue, and on ieopardie of thy life, that thou be not ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſound the Horne, without thou haſt great néede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for if thou doe otherwiſe, I vowe to God that created mée, I ſhall leaue thée in as great pouertie and miſerie as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer man was, ſo that whoſoeuer ſhould ſée thée in that caſe,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:45"/>
ſhould haue pitie of thée. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I ſhall right well beware thereof, now I deſire you let me depart. I am content, (quoth <hi>Oberon</hi>) and God be thy guide. Then <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> tooke leaue of the Kinge <hi>Oberon,</hi> and truſſed vp all his baggage, and did put his Cup into his boſome, &amp; the Horne about his necke: thus they all tooke their leaue of King <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> &amp; all weeping embraced <hi>Huon,</hi> who had maruaile why he wept and ſaid, Sir, why doe you wéepe? Fréend, (quoth <hi>Oberon</hi>) you may well know, you haue with you two things that I loue dearely, God ayd you, more I cannot ſpeake to you.</p>
               <p>Thus the fourtéene Knightes departed, and ſo they road foorth about fiftéene Leagues or more, then they ſawe before them a great déepe Riuer, and they could finde no guide nor paſſage to paſſe ouer, and ſo they wiſt not what to doe, then ſuddainly they ſawe paſſe by them a ſeruant of King <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> bearing a rod of gold in his hand, and ſo without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any word, he entred into the Riuer, and tooke his rod &amp; ſtroke the water therewith thrée times, then inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water withdrew a both ſides in ſuch wiſe, that there was a path that thrée men might ride a froont, and that done he departed againe, without ſpeaking of any word. Then <hi>Huon</hi> and his companie entred into the water, and ſo paſſed thorowe without any danger, and when they were paſt they looked behind them, and ſawe the Riuer cloſe againe, and ran after his old courſe. By my faith, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I thinke we be enchaunted, I beléeue ſurely King <hi>Oberon</hi> hath done this, but ſéeing we be thus ſcaped out of perill, I truſt from henceforth we ſhall haue no more doubt. Thus they roade foorth together ſinging, and oftentimes ſpake of the great maruailes that they had ſeene King <hi>Oberon</hi> doe, and as they road, <hi>Huon</hi> beheld on his right hand, and ſawe a faire mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe well garniſhed with hearbes and flowers, and in the middeſt thereof a faire cleare Fountaine: then <hi>Huon</hi> roade thether, and alighted, and let their Horſes goe to paſture, then they ſpread a cloath on the gréene graſſe, and ſet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſuch meate as Kinge <hi>Oberon</hi> had giuen them at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, and there they did eat, &amp; drinke ſuch drinke as they found in the Cup. By my faith (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) it was a faire aduenture for vs when we met <hi>Oberon,</hi> and that I ſpake to him, he hath ſhewed me great tokens of loue, when he gaue me ſuch a Cup, if I may returne into <hi>Fraunce</hi> in ſauegard, I ſhall giue it to <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> who will make great ioy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and if he cannot drinke thereof, the Barons of <hi>Fraunce</hi> will haue great ſport thereof. Then againe he repented him of his owne words, and ſaid, I am a foole to thinke or to ſay thus, for as yet I cannot tell what end I ſhall come to, the Cup that I haue is better worth then two Cities, but as yet I cannot beléeue the vertue to be in the Horne as <hi>Oberon</hi> ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) whatſoeuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fall, I will aſſay it, and ſo tooke the Horne and ſet it to his mouth, and blewe it ſo loud that the wood rang: then <hi>Gerames</hi> and all the other began to ſing and to make great ioy. Then <hi>Garyn</hi> ſaid, Faire Nephewe blowe ſtill, and ſo <hi>Huon</hi> blew ſtill with ſuch force, that <hi>Oberon</hi> who was in his wood about fiftéene Leagues of, heard him clearely, and ſaid: Alas my fréends, I heare my fréend blowe, whome I loue beſt of all the world, alas what man is ſo hardy to doe him any ill, I wiſhe my ſelfe with him with a hundred thouſand men at armes, incontinent he was nere to <hi>Huon</hi> with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand men at armes.

When this crye was made, there was no Begger, Vacabound nor Ribauld, Iugler, Minſtrell, old nor yong, but by great flockes they came all to the Prouoſts houſe, in number more then foure hundred, and <hi>Gerames</hi> bought vp bread, meat, fleſh and other victuals, all that he could finde in the Citie, and payed for it: thus the ſupper was dreſſed, and euerie man ſet at the Tables. <hi>Huon</hi> ſerued them with his Cup in his hand, and made euerie man to drinke of that
<pb facs="tcp:4519:48"/>
he put out of his Cup into other pots, and yet euer the Cup was full. When the people had well eaten and dronken the good wines, and were well chaſed in their braines, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſing, and ſome to ſleepe at the Table, and ſome did beat their fyſts vpon the boards, that it was maruaile to ſée the life that they led: whereof <hi>Huon</hi> had great ioy. The ſame time the Dukes Steward came into the Towne, to buy his Maiſters Supper: but he could neither find bread nor fleſh, nor no other victuals, whereof he was ſore diſpleaſed, and then he demaunded the cauſe, why he found no victuals as he was accuſtomed to doe?

Then the <hi>Paynim</hi> in great deſpight went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice vnto the Duke, and ſaid. Sir, I can get nothing in the Towne for your Supper, there is a young man lodged in the Prouoſts houſe, that hath bought vp all the victuals, to giue a Supper to all the beggers, vacabounds and ribaulds that can be found in the Towne.</p>
               <p>When the Duke vnderſtood that, he was ſore diſpleaſed, and ſwoore by Mahound, that he would go ſee that Supper: then he commaunded all his men to be readie in harneſſe to goe with him, and as he was going out of his Pallaice, a Traytor who had ſtollen priuily out of the Prouoſts houſe, whereas he had been at ſupper with other, ſaid to the Duke: ſir know for troth, there is in your Prouoſts houſe a knight, who hath giuen a Supper to all people that would come the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo there is no begger, no ribauld nor other that would ſup, but are come thether, and Sir, this Knight hath a Cup Letter worth then all this Citie, for if all the people betweene Eaſt and Weſt ſhould dye for lacke of drinke, they ſhould haue all ynough, for as often as you will emptie the Cup, it will be full againe incontinent. When the Duke heard that, he had great maruaile, and ſaide, ſuch a Cuppe

were good for him, and ſwoore by Mahound that he would haue that Cup: let vs go thether, for my will is to haue that Cup, and all thoſe Knights ſhall looſe their horſes and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, I will leaue them nothing.</p>
               <p>Then he went foorth with thirtie Knights, and reſted not vntill he came to the Prouoſts houſe, and founde the gates open. When the Prouoſt perceiued him, he came to <hi>Huon</hi> and ſaide: Alas Sir you haue done ill, héere is come the Duke in great diſpleaſure, if God haue not pitie of you, I cannot ſée how you can eſcape without death. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) diſmay you not, for I ſhall ſpeake ſo faire, that he ſhall be content: then <hi>Huon</hi> with a merrie chéere came to the Duke, and ſaid: Sir, you be welcome. Beware, (quoth the Duke) come not néere me, for no chriſtian man may come into my Citie without my Licence, wherefore I will thou knoweſt, that you ſhall all looſe your heads, and all that you brought hether. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) when you haue ſlaine vs, you ſhall win thereby but little, and it were great wrong for you ſo to doe. I ſhall tell thée, (quoth the Duke) why I will ſo do, it is bycauſe you be chriſtian men, therefore thou ſhalt be the firſt, ſhewe me on thy faith, why haſt thou aſſembled all this companie héere to Supper? Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I haue done it bicauſe I am going to the red Sea, and bicauſe theſe poore men will pray to God for me, that I may ſafely returne: Sir this is the cauſe that I haue made them to ſup with me. Well, (quoth the Duke) great folly haſt thou ſpoken, for thou ſhalt neuer ſée faire day, you ſhall all looſe your heads. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) leaue all this, I pray you and your comapanie ſit downe, and eate and drinke at your pleaſure, and I ſhall ſerue you as well as I can, and then Sir if I haue done any wrong, I will make you amends in ſuch wiſe that you ſhall be content: for if you doe me any hurt, it ſhall be to you but a ſmall conqueſt. Sir, me thinks if you will do nobly, you ſhould ſomewhat forbeare vs, for as I haue heard ſay, you were once chriſtened. Then the Duke ſaid vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> thou haſt ſayd well, I am content to

ſup, for as yet I haue not ſupped. Then the Duke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded euerie man to be diſarmed, and to ſit downe at the Table, the which they did, and <hi>Huon</hi> and <hi>Gerames</hi> ſerued them, and they were well ſerued at that ſupper: then <hi>Huon</hi> tooke his Cup and came to the Duke and ſaid. Sir, ſée you not héere this Cup, the which is voyd and emptie? I ſée well (quoth the Duke) there is nothing therein. Then <hi>Huon</hi> made the ſigne of the croſſe ouer the Cup, and incontinent it was full of wine, he tooke the Cuppe to the Duke, who had great maruaile thereof, and aſſoone as the Cuppe was in his handes, it was voyd againe. What, (quoth the Duke) thou haſt enchaunted mee? Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I am none Enchaunter, but it is for the ſin that you be in, ſet it down, for you are not worthy to hold it, you were borne in an euill houre. How art thou ſo hardy (quoth the Duke) to ſpeake thus vnto me? I repute thee for a proud foole, thou knoweſt well it lyeth in my power to deſtroy thée, there is no man dare ſay the contrarie, yet I pray thée tell me thy name, and where thou wert borne? and whether thou goeſt? and of what kinne thou art? Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) for any thinge that may fal vnto me, I wil not hide my name nor kindred: therefore Sir, know for troth, I was borne at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Gerone,</hi> and am Sonne to Duke <hi>Seuin,</hi> who is dead ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares paſſed.

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, why haſt thou taken in this Citie any other lodging but mine? ſhewe mée whether thou wilt goe? Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I am going to <hi>Babilon</hi> to the Admirall <hi>Gaudiſe,</hi> to doe to him a Meſſuage from King <hi>Charlemaine</hi> of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſlewe his Sonne there: ſo he ſhewed his Vncle all his aduenture, and how the king had taken away his Land, nor ſhould he haue it againe, vntill he had done his Meſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the Admirall. Faire Nephew, (quoth the Duke) in like wiſe I was baniſhed the Realme of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and ſince I haue denyed the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſince I married héere in this Countrey a great Ladie, by whome I haue

Then <hi>Gerames</hi> priuily ſayd vnto him, Sir, if you goe thether, you may perhaps repent your ſelfe: ſo it may well be, (quoth <hi>Gonder</hi> the Prouoſt.) Then <hi>Huon</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to truſſe vp all their geare, and to make readie their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and tooke with him his Cup, but he left ſtill his Horne with the Prouoſt.

then <hi>Geffrey</hi> went into a Chamber, whereas there was two Hundred Armours hanging, when he came thether, he ſaid within himſelfe. Alas good Lord, this villaine Traytour would ſlay the Sonne of his Brother, who when I was in <hi>Fraunce</hi> did me once a great courteſie, for I had béene dead &amp; ſlaine if Duke <hi>Seuin</hi> his Father had not ſuccoured me: it is reaſon for that he did then to mée, to render againe ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnto his Sonne, God confound mee if he hath any ill for me, but I ſhall rather cauſe the falſe Duke to buy deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the treaſon that he would doe vnto his Nephewe.

Why (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) will you then that I tarrye vntill I be ſlaine? ſurely I will blowe it without any longer tarying, and ſo he blewe it ſo ſore that the bloud came out of his mouth, ſo that all that were in the Pallaice began to ſinge and to daunce, and the Duke and al ſuch as were at the ſéege about the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, could not reſt but fell to ſinge and to daunce. Kinge <hi>Oberon,</hi> who as then was in his citie of <hi>Momur,</hi> ſaide on high: Ah I heare my fréend <hi>Huons</hi> Horne blowe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I knowe well he hath ſome buſineſſe in hand, wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:4519:52"/>
I wiſhe my ſelfe there as the Horne was blowne, with an Hundred Thouſand men well armed. He had made no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner his wiſh, but he was in the Citie of <hi>Tormont,</hi> whereas he and his men ſlewe downe the <hi>Paynims,</hi> that it was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile to ſée the bloud run downe the Stréetes like a Riuer. King <hi>Oberon</hi> made it to be cryed, that as many as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Baptiſme, their liues ſhould be ſaued, ſo that thereby there were many that were chriſtened. Then King <hi>Oberon</hi> came to the Pallaice, when <hi>Huon</hi> ſawe him, hee went and thanked him of his ſuccour at that time of néede. Fréend, (quoth <hi>Oberon</hi>) as longe as you beléeue and doe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, I ſhall neuer fayle to ſuccour you in all your affaires.</p>
               <p>Thus all that were in the Towne and would not beléeue in God, were ſlaine. Then the Duke was taken &amp; brought to the Pallaice vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> when he ſawe his Vncle taken, he was ioyfull, and then the Duke ſayd: Faire Nephewe, I require you haue pitie of me. Ah vntrue Traytour, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) thou ſhalt neuer depart hence aliue, I ſhall neuer reſpite thy death; then with his ſword he ſtrooke off his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles head, then he made his bodie to be hanged ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wals of the Towne, that his ilneſſe might alwayes be had in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, and to be an example to all other: thus that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was deliuered from that Traytour.</p>

When <hi>Huon</hi> heard that, being affrayd, he ſaid: Sir, mee thinkes you ſaye great wronge, for in all things to my power I will obſerue your commaundement. Fréend, (quoth <hi>Oberon</hi>) ſéeing thou wilt doe ſo, remember then thy promiſe, and I charge thée vpon paine of thy life, &amp; looſing for euer my loue: that thou be not ſo hardy, as to take the way to the Tower of <hi>Dunother,</hi> the which is a maruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great Tower ſtanding on the Sea-ſide. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> cauſed it to be made, and therein I was longe time nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, thou neuer ſaweſt ſo faire a Tower, nor better garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Chambers and glaſſe windowes, and within hanged with rich Tapeſtrie.

Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) if all the men nowe liuing ſhoulde forbid mee to goe thether, I would not obay them, for you knowe well, I departed out of <hi>Fraunce</hi> for none other thing, but to ſearch the ſtrangeſt aduentures, and I demaund no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to find aduentures, therefore ſpeake no more to the contrarie, for ere I ſléepe I will fight with the Gyant, for though he be more harder then yron, yet I ſhall ſlay him, or he mée: and you <hi>Gerames</hi> &amp; all the other, abyde you héere in this meadowe vntill I returne againe.

                  </gap>layles, he beheld them well, and thought it was in a manner impoſſible to enter without death. Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider hereon with himſelfe, how King <hi>Oberon</hi> had ſhewed him the troth, and thought without the aide of the grace of God, it were impoſſible to enter, whereuppon he beheld all about, if there were any other place to enter, at laſt he ſaw neere to a piller of marble, a Baſon of gould faſt tyed with a chaine, then he approached neere thereto, and drew out his ſword, wherwith he ſtrake thrée great ſtroaks on the Baſon, ſo that the ſound thereof might well be heard into the Caſtle. Within the Tower there was a Damſell called <hi>Sibilla,</hi> when ſhe heard the Baſon ſound, ſhe had great maruaile thereat, then ſhe went to a window, and looked out and ſaw that <hi>Huon</hi> would enter, whereuppon ſhe went backe againe and ſaid, ah good Lord, what knight is yonder without that would enter? if the Gyant awake, anone he will be ſlaine, for if there were a Thowſand Knights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhould all ſoone be deſtroyed: ſurely I haue great deſire to know what he is, and where he was borne, for as me ſéemeth he ſhould be of Fraunce, to know the troth I wil goe to the window againe, to ſée if I may haue of him any knowledge. Then ſhée went out of her chamber, and went to a window néere to the gate, and looked out and ſaw <hi>Huon</hi> all armed abiding at the gate, then ſhe beheld the blazure of his ſhield, wherein was portrayed thrée croſſes of gould, whereby ſhe knew well he was of Fraunce. Alas quod ſhée, I am but loſt if the Gyant know that I haue béene héere,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:54"/>
then ſhe returned againe in haſt, and went to the Chamber dore whereas the Gyant lay and ſlept, and ſhe perceiued hée was yet a ſléepe, for he rowted that it was maruaile to héere. Then ſhe returned againe quickly to the gate, and opened a wicket, out of the which there yſſued ſuch a wind, that if cauſed the two men with their flayles to ſtand ſtill in reſt, when ſhée had opened the wicket, haſtily ſhée returned into her Chamber, and when <hi>Huon</hi> ſawe the little wicket open, he aduaunced himſelfe &amp; entred, for the two men with their flayles were in reſt, then hée went further thinking to finde them that had opened the wicket: but hée was ſore abaſhed when he could finde no creature, there were ſo many Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that he wiſt not whether to goe to finde that he ſought for. Thus he ſearched all about, and at laſt hée ſawe about a Pillar fourtéene men lye dead, whereof hée had great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and ſaid, that he would returne backe againe, then he went out of the Hall and came to the gate, wéening to haue found it open: but it was cloſed by it ſelfe, and the men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine did beat with their flayles. Alas, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) nowe I ſée well I cannot eſcape from hence, then he returned into the Caſtle, and hearkened about, and as he went ſearching carefully, he heard the voice of a Damſell pitiouſly wéeping. He came there as ſhe was, and humbly ſaluted her, and ſaid: Faire Damſell, I cannot tell if you can vnderſtand my lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage or not, knowe of you I would, wherefore you make this great ſorrowe? Sir, (quoth ſhe) I wéepe becauſe I haue of you great pitie, for if the Gyant heare within (who is yet a ſléepe) hap to awake, you are but dead &amp; loſt. Faire Ladie, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I pray you ſhew me what you be, and where you were borne? Sir, (quoth ſhée) I am Daughter to <hi>Guinemer,</hi> who in his time was Earle of Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> &amp; am Néece to Duke <hi>Seuin</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> heard that, right humbly he kiſſed her, and ſaide. Madame, knowe for troth, that you are my néere Kinſewoman, for I am Sonne to Duke <hi>Seuin</hi>: I pray you ſhew me what aduenture hath brought you into this Caſtle.
<pb facs="tcp:4519:55"/>
Sir, (quoth ſhe) my Father had deuotion to ſée the holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and he loued me ſo well, that he would not leaue me behind him, and as we were on the Sea néere to the Citie of <hi>Eſcalone</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> there aroſe a great tempeſt vpon the Sea, that the winde brought vs néere vnto this Caſtle, and the Gyant being in his Tower, ſaw vs in great danger of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; that we were driuen into this Port, he came downe out of his Pallaice, and ſlewe my Father, and all them that were with him except my ſelfe, and ſo brought me into this Tower, whereas I haue béen theſe Seauen yeares in great diſtreſſe and miſerie.

And I thought to paſſe this way, to fight with him and deſtroy him, and to deliuer the Countrey of him, and I haue left my companie héere by in a Valley to tarie for me. Deare Coozen, (quoth ſhe) I haue great maruaile that you would take on you ſuch a folly, for if ye were Fiue hundred men together well armed, yée durſt not all abide him if hée were armed with his armour, for none can endure againſt him, therefore Coſin I counſell you to returne backe againe ere he doe awake, and I ſhall open you the wicket, ſo that you ſhall paſſe out without any danger.</p>

Ah Coſen quoth ſhée, then I ſée well both you and I are deſtroyed, but ſéeing it is thus, I ſhall ſhew you the chamber whereas he ſléepeth, and when yée haue ſéene him, yet then yée may returne. Firſt goe into this chamber that you ſée héere before you, wherein yée ſhall find bread and wine and other victuals, and in the next you ſhall find clothes of ſilke, and many rich iewels, then in the third chamber yée ſhall find the foure Gods of the <hi>Paynims,</hi> they be all of fine maſſie gould, &amp; in the fourth yée ſhall find y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyant lying a ſléepe on a rich bed: then ſir if ye were of my mind, I would counſell you to ſtrike of his head ſléeping, for if he awake, you cannot eſcape without death.

Then <hi>Huon</hi> departed from the Ladie, his ſword being in his hand and his helmet on his head, and his ſhield about his necke, and ſo entred into the firſt chamber, and then into the ſecond and third, wheras he ſaw the foure Gods: when he had well regarded them, he gaue each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſtroake with his ſword, and then he entred into the chamber whereas the Gyant lay
<pb facs="tcp:4519:56"/>
ſléeping, <hi>Huon</hi> noted him aduiſedly, and the bed that he lay on, the which was ſo rich, that the valew thereof could not be prized, the curtaines, couerings, and pillowes were of ſuch riches, that it was great beautie to behould them.

                  <hi>Huon</hi> had well regarded all this, and well conſidered of the Gyant, who was xvij. foote of length, and his body fourniſhed thereafter and all his other members, but a more fowler &amp; hideous creature was neuer ſéene, with a great head, great eares, and a camelled noſe &amp; eyes burning like a candle. Ah good Lord (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I would King <hi>Charlemaine</hi> were héere to ſée vs twoo fight, for I am ſure then ere he departed, my peace ſhould be made with him. Lord god, I humbly require thée to be my ſuccour againſt this enemy, for if it be not thy good pleaſure, againſt him I can no while endure. Then <hi>Huon</hi> fiercely aduanced foorth, and made the ſigne of the Croſſe, caſting in his mind what he might doe, for he thought if he ſlew him ſléeping, it ſhould be a great reproch to him, and it would be ſaid that he had ſlaine a man dead, whereupon he ſaid to himſelfe: ſhame haue I if I touch him ere I haue defied him, then <hi>Huon</hi> cryed out aloud and ſaid: Ariſe thou heathen hound, or elſe I ſhall ſtrike off thy head. When the Gyant heard <hi>Huon</hi> ſpeake, he awaked fiercely, and beheld <hi>Huon,</hi> and roſe vp ſo quickly, that in riſing he brake the bedſted that he lay vpon, then he ſaid to <hi>Huon.</hi> Frend, they that ſent thée hether, loued thée but little, nor doubted not me. And when <hi>Huon</hi> heard the Gyant ſpeake french, he had great maruaile and ſaid, I am come hether to ſee thee, and it may be ſo, that I haue done it vnaduiſedly. Then the Gyant ſaid, thou ſayeſt troth, for if I were armed as thou art, Fiue hundred men ſuch as thou art could not endure me, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould all die, but thou ſeeſt I am naked, without ſword or weapon, yet for all that I doubt thée not. Then <hi>Huon</hi> thought in himſelfe, that it would be a great ſhame to him, to aſſaile a man without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or weapon, wherefore he ſaid: Goe and arme thée, or

incontinent I ſhall ſlay thée. Fréend quoth the Gyant, this that thou ſayeſt, procéedeth of a good courage &amp; of courteſie. Then he armed him, and tooke in his hand a great fawchin, and <hi>Huon</hi> was withdrawne into the Pallaice abiding for the Gyant, who tarried not long but came to <hi>Huon,</hi> &amp; ſaid: where art thou, behould me héere ready to deſtroy thée, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thou make good defence? yet I deſire thee tell me what thou art, to thintent that I may (when I haue ſlaine thée) tell how I haue ſlaine ſuch a one, that by his folly came to aſſaile me in myne owne Pallaice.

Then the Gyant went to his coffer, and tooke out the Armour, and came to <hi>Huon</hi> and ſaid: See, heere is the good armour, I giue thee leaue to aſſay to put it on thy body. Then <hi>Huon</hi> tooke the Armour and went back a little, and put off his owne armour, and tooke that belonging to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyant, and incontinent did it on his bodie, then haſtily he put on his helmet, and tooke his ſhéeld &amp; ſword in his hand, and deuoutly thanked our Lord God of this great grace.

againe the good Armour that is now on my bodie, firſt I ſlay thée, &amp; then, as for thy Ring that thou praiſeſt ſo much: I will likewiſe haue it whether thou wilt or not. When the Gyant had well heard <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſaw that in no wiſe he could get againe his Armour: he was then ſorowfull, and becauſe he ſaw how <hi>Huon</hi> reprooued him, therewith he was ſo ſore diſpleaſed, that his eyes ſéemed like twoo burning candels, then he yet demaunded of <hi>Huon,</hi> if he would doe none otherwiſe.

And I thée quoth the Gyant, for all the Armour thou canſt not endure againſt me. Then the Gyant approched to <hi>Huon,</hi> and lift vp his fawchin thinking to haue ſtriken him, but he fayled, for the ſtroke glent, and the faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin light vpon a piller, and entred into it more then twoo foot, then <hi>Huon</hi> (who was quicke and light) behoulding the maruaylous ſtroke, quickly ſtept foorth with his good ſword in his hand, and ſeing how the Gyant had his fawchin ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king faſt in the piller, he ſtrake the Gyant on both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armes néere to his hands in ſuch wiſe, that he ſtrake off both his hands, ſo that they with the fawchin fell downe to the earth. When the Gyant felt himſelfe ſo ſore hurt, with paine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he gaue a maruaylous crie, ſo horrible, as though all the Towre had fallen to the earth: whereat the Damſell <hi>Sibylla</hi> being in her chamber, was ſore abaſhed, ſhe went out of her chamber and found a ſtaffe by the way, ſhe tooke it vp in her hands, and came to the Pallaice whereas ſhe heard the cry, and met the Gyant flying away to ſaue himſelfe, but the Damſell well aduiſed, when ſhe ſaw that he fled, ſhe caſt the ſtaffe betwéene his legges, ſo that thereby he fell to the earth, and <hi>Huon</hi> who came after him with his ſword in his hand, he haſted him, &amp; gaue the Gyant many a great ſtroke, and the Gyant cryed out ſo high, that it was very terrible to heare him. Then <hi>Huon</hi> lift vp his ſword, and gaue him ſuch a ſtroake in the necke, that his head flew to the earth, then

                  <hi>Huon</hi> wiped his ſword, and put it vp into the ſheath, and he came to the head thinking to haue taken it vp, and to haue ſet it on the height of the Towre, but the head was ſo great and heauy, that he could not remooue it nor tourne the bodie, then he ſmiled and ſaid. Ah good Lord, I thanke thée of thy grace, that thou haſt giuen me the puiſſance to ſlay ſuch a creature, would to god that this body and head were nowe in the Pallaice of <hi>Parys,</hi> before <hi>Charlemaine</hi> Kinge of Fraunce, ſo that he knewe that I haue ſlaine him.

Then when they came to land, <hi>Huon</hi> was ioyfull, and <hi>Mallaborn</hi> ſaid: Right déerely ſhall I aby the time that thou wert borne, or that euer I knew thée, for the intent to doe thée pleaſure, I ſhall endure yet x. yeares like a Beaſt in the Sea, and xxx. yeares I haue béen ſo already, ſo that my time is in all xl. yéeres. I haue great pitie of thée, for there is no man borne of a woman, that knoweth the ill and pouertie that ſhall fall héereafter to thée, and I ſhall ſuffer much for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue that I haue to thée: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I ſhall take it in patience.

as thou makeſt any lye, thou ſhalt looſe the loue of king <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>: thus God be with thée, for I may no longer tarrie. So he went againe into the Sea, and <hi>Huon</hi> tarried there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, recommending himſelfe to our lord god, and ſo tooke the way to the Citie, and there entred in without let of any man. So ſoone as he was entred, he met a M. <hi>Paynims</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hawking, another M. coming homeward, and a M. horſes led to be new ſhod, &amp; a M. coming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhooing, than he ſaw a M. men playing at the Cheſſe, &amp; another M. that had played and béen mated, &amp; another M. talking &amp; deuiſing with Damſels, and another M. comming from drinking of the Admirals wine, and another M. going thether. When <hi>Huon</hi> all armed had gone a great ſpace in the Citie, he had great maruaile of that he had ſeene, and that he had met ſuch multitude of people. And he ſtudied thereon ſo much, that he forgat the Gyants Ryng on his arme, and the men that he met had great maruaile of him to ſée him goe all armed a foote, and yet he went ſtill forward. Alas poore vnhappie <hi>Huon,</hi> that could not remember the Gyants Ring about his arme, for lacke of remembrance thereof, he ſuffered after ſo much trouble, that there is no humane tongue can tell it, as yée ſhall heare hereafter. At laſt he came into a great place before the firſt gate of the Pallaice, whereas there ſtoode a great Vine trée ſet vpon bricke pillers of diuers colours, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the which the Admirall <hi>Gaudiſe</hi> one day in the wéeke would come thether, and vſed to giue audience to all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. When <hi>Huon</hi> had regarded all this, he came to the firſt gate of the Pallaice, &amp; there he cryed to the Porter &amp; ſaid. Friend, I pray you open the gate, and the Porter ſaid, with a good will, if thou be a Sarazin thou ſhalt enter. Then <hi>Huon</hi> (as vnaduiſed, and forgetting himſelfe, and not once thinking on king <hi>Oberons</hi> commaundement, or of the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Ring about his arme, the which if hee had ſhewed foorth, hee ſhoulde not haue néeded to haue made any lye) when hee had heard the <hi>Paynim</hi> demaund whether he were a Sarazin or no: he ſaid yes, than the Porter ſaid, than may

So <hi>Huon</hi> paſſed the firſt bridge and gate, and when he came to the ſecond, he remembred himſelfe how he had broken king <hi>Oberons</hi> commaundement, wherewith he was ſo ſorowfull at his hart, that he wiſt not what to do, and ſware the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he would neuer lye more.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thee, open this gate, for I muſt enter. When the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heard him ſpeake ſo fiercely, he ſaid, who is it, that the firſt Porter was ſo hardy to ſuffer to enter in at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt gate? I ſhall ſhew thee quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> ſéeſt not thou this Ring, the which is a token that I may paſſe and goe whereas me liſt.

When <hi>Huon</hi> was thus paſſed the thrée bridges, then he remembred how he had made a lye at the firſt bridge, and ſaid to himſelfe. Alas, what ſhall become of me, ſeeing I haue ſo lightly broken my promiſe to him that hath done ſo much for me? alas, I forgot the Ring that was about mine arme, how be it, I truſt that <hi>Oberon</hi> will not be diſpleaſed for it, ſeeing I did it not wilfully, but that I forgat it: I truſt he will take no more regard to this déede, then he did when I blew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Horne without any cauſe, thus <hi>Huon</hi> paſſed the thrée gates of the Pallaice.</p>

Then they all anſweared with one voice, that hee ſhould be ſlaine aliue incontinent. Then ſtept foorth an old ancient Admirall of Six ſcore yéeres of age, who was of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admirals priuie counſell, and he ſaid. Sir Admirall, yée may not doe thus, for the loue of this good day, the which is the feaſt of Saint Iohn, according to our law, there is none ought to die on that day, but Sir, reſpite his life for a whole yéere, and then ſhalbe the feaſt of your Gods, on that day ye ought to deliuer xj.

ſéeing it is ſo that ye giue me this counſell, and that of right mine Aunceſtors haue euer accuſtomed the ſame: I will not doe the contrarie, but it ſhall be as ye haue ſaid.

Then <hi>Gerames</hi> entred into the ſhip, and tooke all that they found there and bare it into the Tower, and then they went to dinner and made great ioy for that aduenture, and after dinner <hi>Gerames</hi> ſaid.

But ſirs if yee will be ruled by me, we ſhall doe like true men: we haue as now in this port a good ſhip well fourniſhed with euery thing, and we haue heere gould and ſiluer plentie, and we ſhall ſoone vittaile our ſhip, and then let vs take the Sea, and neuer reſt ſayling vntill wee heare ſome newes of our Lord <hi>Huon,</hi> &amp; if we doe thus, then

Then without taking of any longer reſpite, they anſwered all with one voice, that they were readie to accompliſh all that he had deuiſed. So they tooke gould and ſiluer and all their riches, and bare it into the ſhippe, and fourniſhed it with wine, biſket, ſalt fleſh, &amp; artillerie, and when their ſhippe was garniſhed, they put in their horſes and their armour, and they all xiij.

Sir (quoth <hi>Gerames</hi>) when I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him, I left him in good health, and he ſaluteth you by me, and hath ſent heere to you xij. french men by me, the which were taken vpon the ſea, as they were going on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to the holy Sepulchre of Chriſt in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and he deſireth you to put them in priſon, vntill the day of Saint Iohn the Baptiſt, at which day you muſt make the feaſt of your Gods, and then to bring them into the meadow heere without, and there tye and binde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtakes, and let your Archers ſhoot at them, to thintent to know who ſhooteth beſt.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4519:69"/>When <hi>Gerames</hi> heard that, he had neuer before greater ſorow at his heart, for then (hearing of the death of <hi>Huon</hi>) his diſpleaſure &amp; anger was ſo great, that he had néere hand runne vpon the Admirall, and he was ſo vexed in his mind, that he tooke vp a ſtaffe that lay by him, and gaue each of the French men ſuch ſtroakes on their heades, that the blood ran downe: but they ſuffered it and durſt not ſtirre, they were in ſuch feare of the Admirall, but they curſed <hi>Gerames</hi> for his ſtroakes, who did it for the nonſt. And when the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſawe how hee had well beaten the frenchmen, he ſaid: Faire Nephew, it ſeemeth well by you that you loue theſe chriſtian men but little.

Thus then <hi>Gerames</hi> departed from the Admirall, and led with him the xij. french priſoners, beating them till he came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and none of them durſt ſpeake one word, but to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they curſed <hi>Gerames.</hi> And as they went towards the priſon they met with the Lady <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> and ſhe ſaid, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, I am right ioyfull of your comming, but if I durſt truſt you, I would ſhew you a ſecret matter, ſo that you promiſe not to diſcouer me. Couſin quoth <hi>Gerames,</hi> by the faith that I owe to my god Mahound, ye may well ſhew me your will and pleaſure, for if mine eyes were to be drawne out, I ſhal neuer diſcouer you. And when the Damſell heard that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſhe ſaid. Deare Couſin, it is a v. months paſſed ſince there came to my Father the Admirall a french knight, with a meſſuage from king <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> who called himſelfe <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> who when he had done his meſſuage, hee ſlew a Paynim king as he ſat at the table by my Father, &amp; after came &amp; kiſſed me thrée times before my Fathers face, and after that ſlew many Sarazins, wherefore at laſt hee was taken Priſoner, and put in priſon whereas he is yet, howbeit I made my Father beléeue that he is dead with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:69"/>
yet deere couſin he is as yet aliue, and as well ſerued of meat and drinke as my father is. When <hi>Gerames</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Damſell <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> he was both ſorowfull &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, for he thought that the Damſell did it to deceaue him, and to cauſe him to ſhew forth the ſecretnes of his minde, &amp; bicauſe he was in doubt thereof, he paſſed foorth and made no manner of anſweare to the Damſell, but came to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and put in the Priſoners rudely, and the Damſell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned right ſorowfull in that ſhe had ſhewed ſo much of her minde to <hi>Gerames</hi> whome ſhe tooke for her Couſin. When <hi>Gerames</hi> had put the xij.

Ah good Lord Ieſu Chriſt ſuccour vs, for thou knoweſt well, this that wee ſuffer we haue not deſerued, but it is for the loue of our yong Lord <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> we haue loued him ſo well, that now wée be loſt for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sir quoth one of them, true it is that v. moneths paſſed, there departed from vs a young knight, with whome wee came out of the Realme of Fraunce, and he was borne in Fraunce, and ſonne to a noble Duke, called Duke <hi>Seuin</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> this Knight ſlew <hi>Charlot</hi> ſonne to King <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> by miſaduenture, wherefore hee was baniſhed out of the Realme of Fraunce, and ſent by king <hi>Charlemaine</hi> to do a meſſuage to the Admirall <hi>Gaudiſe,</hi> and he is dead in priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it is ſhewed vs, and ſir wée came to ſéeke for him, &amp; are betrayed by one of our owne companie.</p>

Sir the French men that I brought, are faſt in priſon and well bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Faire Nephew quoth the Admirall, they haue had but an euill neighbor of you. Then <hi>Gerames</hi> went into his chamber, and ſtudied how he might fourniſh the Priſoners with vittailes, &amp; did ſo much that he had ſufficient, and when night came, he went with his vittailes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for he might do there what he liſted, for euery man was ready to doe him any ſeruice. When he came to the priſon dore, he ſent euery man away and taried there alone, and he had not béen there longe, but that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals daughter came thether. When <hi>Gerames</hi> ſaw her, he wiſt not what to thinke, but ſaid. Faire couſin, I pray you ſhew me what you doe heare at this houre? Déere couſin quoth ſhee, the great truſt that I haue in you, hath made me to come hether, bicauſe to day I diſcouered to you all my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and what I am intended to doe. Therefore let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, that you would leaue the law of Mahdund, and receiue the chriſtian faith, and then to goe with mee into Fraunce together with theſe Priſoners, and we ſhall well find the manner how to depart, and we will take with vs al the priſoners that ye haue put in priſon.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Gerames</hi> had heard the Lady, he was right ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for then he knew well that ſhee went not about to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crie him, but that ſhe did it of good heart and good will that ſhe bare to <hi>Huon,</hi> howbeit, hee thought that hee would not

diſcouer himſelfe to her, vntill the time he knew the troth of <hi>Huon,</hi> wherfore he anſwered the Damſell angerly and ſaid. O thou falſe and vntrue maide, how art thou ſo hardy as to ſpeake or thinke thus? ſurely the Admirall thy Father ſhall know it aſſoone as he commeth out of his chamber, and then ſhalt thou be burned and the Frenchmen hanged. Alas Sir quoth ſhee, yet I pray you let mee goe into the priſon with you, to thintent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may ſée <hi>Huon</hi> once yet before I die, for the loue of whome I am content to die, for if he die I will not liue one day after, therefore let me once take my leaue of him.

Ah my true louer, bleſſed be the houre that I found you, then they all clipped and embraced him, when the Lady ſaw their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſaluting ſhe was ioyfull, for then ſhe ſaw well, that her intent ſhould be more ſurely compaſſed, &amp; then ſhe came to <hi>Huon,</hi> &amp; demaunded if they were his ſeruants that made ſo great loue together? Madame quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> ſurely all theſe that be heere be my men, boldly ye may truſt them, for there is none of them but that they ſhall do your commaundment. <hi>Huon</hi> quoth the Damſell, their comming pleaſeth me right well, then <hi>Huon</hi> ſaid to his companie.

therefore my hart cannot loue him, if he did otherwiſe, I would purchaſe to him none ill for all the good in the world, but I ſhall ſhewe you what yee muſt doe. When it is the houre of midnight, I ſhall bring you all into my chamber, whereas I will prouide Armour for you all, and there yée ſhall all be armed, then I ſhall bring you into the Admirall my Fathers chamber, whome yee ſhall find ſléeping, and there yee may ſlay him, and as for mee, I will bee the firſt that ſhall ſtrike him, and when he is ſlaine, then ſhall wée depart ſurely.</p>

For that (quoth the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim) I am the more ſorowfull, and yet againe ioyfull, in that Mahound hath done mée the grace, to haue power to reuenge his death: but if thou wilt beléeue and worſhip my God Mahound, and forſake thy beléefe and goe with me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my countrey I ſhall make thée ſo great a Lord, that of all thy kinne there was neuer any ſuch. And I ſhall giue thée my ſiſter in mariage, who is a foote greater than I am, and is as blacke as a cole.

               <p>Then they went a ſunder to take their courſes, and they ran each at other and met ſo fierſly, that their ſpeares brake in péeces, and the encounter was ſo rude, that by force of the

Then <hi>Huon</hi> ſaid, Paynim thou wert vnhappie when thou cameſt hether, thou mighteſt haue béen content with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of thy Brother, and not to come hether to haue as much thy ſelfe, for thou ſhalt neuer ſée faire day more.</p>
               <p>When the Gyant ſaw him ſelfe hurt, he had great feare and ſaid: Curſed be he of Mahound that forged thy ſwoord, I had rather I had béene bound to haue paid a great ſumme of money to haue ſaued my life, than to be ſlaine héere: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I yéeld my ſelfe to thée, take héere my ſwoord, I pray thée doe me no hurt.

But (quoth he) the Admirall <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laffer</hi> hath taken them from vs by force, and hath taken our ſhippe, and ſlaine all your men that were within it, ſo that none eſcaped but I alone. When king <hi>Iuoryn</hi> vnderſtood the Mariner, he ſaid.

               </p>
               <p>Sir, our aduice is, that yée ſhould ſend one of your ſecret meſſengers to the Admirall <hi>Galaffer,</hi> and commaund him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent to ſend you your Néece, and to make amends for that he hath ſlaine your men, and that he ſend you word by writing, what cauſe hath mooued him thus to doe, and if it be ſo, that pride doth ſo ſurmount in him, that hee will not obey your commaundements, then by a iuſt quarrell ye may goe and make warre vpon him, and take from him all his lands that he houldeth of you. When <hi>Iuoryn</hi> vnderſtood his Lords, he ſaid, Sirs I perceaue well your opinion is good, and then a Meſſenger was appointed, and his charge giuen him, and ſo he departed and rode ſo long till he came to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falerne</hi> where he found the Admirall <hi>Galaffer,</hi> whome he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in the name of Mahound, and then hee declared his Meſſuage at length, but aſſoone as <hi>Galaffer</hi> had heard his meſſuage, he ſaid. Friend, goe and ſay to king <hi>Iuoryn,</hi> that as for the deliuerance of his Néece, I will not doe it, and as for his men that are ſlaine, it was through their owne folly, and as touching that I ſhould come to him, I will not come to him, let him do what he can, but if he come to aſſaile me, I ſhall defend as well as I can. When the Meſſenger heard that, he ſaid.

Caſtle, but he will put them all to flame and fire, nor leaue you one foot of land, but alſo if he may take you, ye ſhall die a ſhamefull death.</p>
               <p>When the Admirall ſaw how hee was defyed, hee was more inflamed then a burning fire-brand, and ſaid to the meſſenger. Go and ſay to thy Lord, that I ſet nothing by his threatning, and if I may know when hée commeth, I ſhall do him that honour, that I will not abide till hée enter into my country, but I will méete with him before, and ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from me, that if I can take him, I ſhall ſoone ryd his ſoule out of his body.

Sir, I require you lette vs goe to the warres with them. <hi>Solater</hi> quoth <hi>Mouflet,</hi> beware what thou ſayeſt, for where as warre is, I would not come there for any thing. Thus they went foorth vntill they came to <hi>Mombrance,</hi> and went ſtraight to the Pallaice, whereas they found King <hi>Iuoryn</hi> and all his Barons, when the Minſtrell ſaw him, hee ſaluted him in the name of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, and ſayde.

Admirall <hi>Galaffer,</hi> and for any Meſſuage that I can ſend to him, he will not ſend her backe to mée. But by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith that I owe to my God Mahound, I ſhall make him ſuch warre, that the memorie thereof ſhall bee had an Hundred yeares héereafter. For I ſhall leaue him neuer a foote of Land, but I ſhall bring all into fire and flame, and cleane deſtroy him, and in the deſpite of his téeth, I will ſée my Neece <hi>Eſclere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and if I may get her, I ſhall cauſe her to be ſtriken al to péeces, and burne her into aſhes, for my Brother is dead by a Villaine of Fraunce, vppon whome ſhée was amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> heard him ſpeake of his Lady, his heart roſe, &amp; made promiſe in himſelfe, that ere the moneth was paſt, he would goe and ſée her, and find the meanes how to ſpeake with her. Then King <hi>Iuoryn</hi> called <hi>Mouflet</hi> the Minſtrell, and ſayd: Fréend, I pray thée doe ſome thinge to make mée merrie, for by reaſon of the diſpleaſure that I haue had, my ioy is loſt therefore it were better for me to take ſome mirth, then to bee long in ſorrow. Sir, (quoth <hi>Mouflet</hi>) I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to doe your pleaſure, then hée tooke his Vyoll, and playd thereof in ſuch wiſe, that it was great melodie to heare it, for al the Paynims that were there had great ioy and mirth, and made great feaſting, when <hi>Huon</hi> heard it, he ſaid. Good Lord I require thée, that this great ioy may turne to mée, as to heare ſome good newes of her who I deſire ſo ſore to ſée. When the Minſtrell had finiſhed his ſong, the Paynims did of their cloathes, and ſome gaue him their Gownes, &amp; ſome their Mantles, hee thought himſelfe right well happie that could giue the Minſtrell any thing. <hi>Huon</hi> had ynough to doo to gather together the cloathes that were giuen him, and hée put them into his Male, whereof <hi>Huon</hi> was ioyfull, bicauſe he ſhould haue the one halfe.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Iuoryn</hi> beheld <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſayd vnto them that were about him, great dammage it is that ſo faire a younge man ſhould ſerue a Minſtrell. Sir, (quoth <hi>Mouflet</hi>) be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed though this young man doe ſerue me, hee hath cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:4519:88"/>
ſo to doe, for when your Brother was dead, I departed from thence to come hether, &amp; by the way I found a great Dake, vnder the which I ſat downe to reſt me, and there by was a great Fountaine faire and cleare, there I ſpread abroad a Towell on the graſſe, and ſet thereon bread and ſuch meate and drinke as I had, and the ſame time this young man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued and came vnto mee all naked, and prayed me for the loue of Mahound to giue him ſome of my bread, and ſo I did and cloathed him as you ſée, and I did ſo much for him, that he promiſed to ſerue mée, and to beare my Fardell and my Harpe, and moreouer, when I came to any paſſage of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee would caſt me in his necke as light as though I had béen nothing, (he is ſo ſtrong) and beare me ouer.

Yet Sir (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I pray you let mee ſhew farther what I can doe, and then aſſay mee at your pleaſure. By Mahound quoth the king, I am content that thou ſhalt ſhew all that thou canſt doe. Sir quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> I can right well arme me, and ſet the helmet on my head, and beare a ſhield &amp; ſpeare, and runne and gallop a horſe, and when it commeth to the point where ſtrokes ſhould be giuen, yée may well ſend foorth a worſe than I. Alſo Sir, I can right well enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ladies chambers, to embrace and kiſſe them, and to doe them any ſeruice. Friend quoth <hi>Iuoryn,</hi> by that which I heare by thée, thou canſt doe more things than ſhould turne to good, but to prooue thée, I ſhall cauſe thee to be aſſayed at the play of the Cheſſe: I haue a faire Daughter, with whome I will that thou ſhalt play, vpon condition, that if ſhe winne, then thou ſhalt looſe thy head, but if thou canſt mate her, then I promiſe thée that thou ſhalt haue her to thy wife, to repoſe with her at thy pleaſure, and a C. markes of money therewith.

                  <pb facs="tcp:4519:89"/>
I would be glad to forbeare that enterpriſe. By Mahound quoth the king, it ſhalbe none otherwiſe, come thereof what will.</p>
               <p>In the meane ſeaſon that this Bargaine was making, a Paynim went into the Ladies chamber, and ſhewed her how there was with the king her father a young man, who had made promiſe, how he ſhould play at the Cheſſe with her vpon condition, that if he loſt the game, hee ſhould then looſe his head, and if he chaunced to win, then he to haue you to his wedded wife, and a C. Markes of money. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame quoth he, I aſſure you he that ſhall play againſt you, is the faireſt man that euer I ſaw, pitie it is that he ſhould be a varlet to a Minſtrell as he is. By Mahound quoth the Ladie, I hould my Father a foole, when he thinketh that I ſhould ſuffer a man to die for winning of a game at Cheſſe. Then <hi>Iuoryn</hi> ſent for his Daughter by twoo Kings, who brought her to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King her Father, then <hi>Iuoryn</hi> ſaid. Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thou muſt play at Cheſſe with this young Varlet that thou ſeeſt héere, ſo that if thou winne, then he ſhall looſe his head, and if he winne, then I will that hee ſhall be thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to doe with thee at his pleaſure. Father quoth the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſéeing this is your pleaſure, it is reaſon that I doe it whether I will or not. Then ſhee beheld <hi>Huon,</hi> whome ſhee ſaw to be right faire, and ſaid to her ſelfe. By Mahound, for the great beautie that I ſee in this young man, I would this game were at an end, ſo that I were his wedded wife.</p>
               <p>When then Ladie was come, their places were made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, then ſhee and <hi>Huon</hi> ſat downe, and king <hi>Iuoryn</hi> and all his Barons ſat downe about them to ſée them play, then <hi>Huon</hi> ſaid to the King. Sir I require you, that you nor none other doe ſpeake in our game, neither for the one partie nor for the other. Friend quoth the King, haue no doubt thereof, and for more ſuretie, the King cauſed to be proclaymed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out all his Pallaice, that none ſhould be ſo hardie as to ſpeake one word vpon paine of death. Then the Cheſſe were made readie, and <hi>Huon</hi> ſaide: Ladie, what game will yée
<pb facs="tcp:4519:89"/>
play at? Friend quoth ſhe, at the game accuſtomed, that is to be mated in the corner, then they both began to ſtudie for the firſt draught, there were Paynims that beheld <hi>Huon,</hi> but he cared not for any of them, but ſtudied on his game, the which they had begun ſo, that <hi>Huon</hi> had loſt moſt parte of his Pawnes, wherewith he changed colour and bluſhed as redde as a roſe. The Damſell perceiued him, and ſaid, Friend, whereon doe yée thinke? yee are almoſt mated, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non my Father will ſtrike of your head. Madame quoth he, as yet the game is not done, great ſhame ſhall your Father haue, when yée ſhall lye all night in mine armes, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a ſeruant to a poore Minſtrell.</p>
               <p>When the Barons heard <hi>Huon</hi> ſay ſo, they began all to laugh, and the Ladie, who was ſo ſurpriſed with the loue of <hi>Huon,</hi> (in regard of the great beautie that ſhe ſaw in him) that ſhe forgat all her play to thinke of him, whereby ſhe loſt the game, whereof <hi>Huon</hi> was right ioyfull, and called the King and ſaid. Sir, now may yée ſée how I can play, but if I would ſtudie but a little more, I could mate your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereas I liſt. When the King ſaw that, he ſaid to his Daughter. Ariſe, curſed be the houre that I begate thee, for great diſhonour haſt thou now done to me, that heretofore haſt mated ſo many great men, and now I ſee heere before my face, that a Minſtrels varlet hath mated thée. Sir quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> trouble not your ſelfe for that cauſe, as for the wager that I ſhould winne therby, I am content to releaſe it quite, let your Daughter goe into her chamber, and ſport her with her Damſels at her pleaſure, and I ſhall goe and ſerue my Maiſter the Minſtrell. Friend quoth the King, if thou wilt ſhew me this courteſie, I ſhall giue thée an hundred Markes in money.</p>
               <p>Sir quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> I am content with your pleaſure, and the Ladie went her way ſorowfull, and ſaid to her ſelfe. Ah falſe ſainted heart, Mahound confound thee, for if I had knowen that thou wouldeſt thus haue refuſed my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, I would haue mated thée, and then thou hadſt loſt thy

Thus the matter paſſed till the next day, then king <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorin</hi> made proclamation through out all the citie, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man ſhould be armed and mounted on their horſes, and that it was his minde to ſet forward towards his enemies. Then euerie man armed them and mounted on their horſes, many helmets glittered againſt the ſunne, and many trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets &amp; drums began to ſound, ſuch brute was made within the citie that it was maruaile to heare it.</p>

Sir I require you to let mee haue a horſe and armour, that I may goe with you to the Battaile, and then ſhall yee ſée how I can aid you. Friend quoth <hi>Iuoryn,</hi> I am content that ye goe with me. Then the King commaunded one of his Chamberlaines to deliuer him a horſe and armour, and the Chamberlaine ſaid. Sir, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware what yee doe, for oftentimes ſuch flying vagabounds are of a light courage, if he haue a horſe and armour, he may aſſoone goe to your enemies part, as to kéepe with you, and neuer truſt me, but he is ſome counterfeit varlet. When the King heard him ſay ſo, he ſaide, it may well bee, yet let him haue a good armour, and helmet and ſhéeld, and let his horſe be but of a ſmall valew, to the intent that he ſhall not goe farre of though he would.</p>
               <p>The ſame time there was a Paynim, that heard the king
<pb facs="tcp:4519:90"/>
grant, how <hi>Huon</hi> ſhould haue armour, he went to his houſe, and tooke out of his coffer an old ruſty ſword, and brought it to <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſaid Frend, I ſée wéell yée haue no ſword to aid your ſelfe withall, and therefore I giue you this ſword, the which I haue long kept in my coffer: the Paynim did giue it to <hi>Huon</hi> in a mockery, for he thought the ſword to be but of a ſmall value. <hi>Huon</hi> tooke the ſword, and drew it out of the ſheath, &amp; ſaw letters written thereon in french, ſaying, how this ſword was forged by <hi>Galams,</hi> who in his dayes forged thrée ſwords, &amp; that ſame ſword was one of the three, and the ſecond was called <hi>Durandell,</hi> and the third <hi>Courtayn.</hi> When <hi>Huon</hi> had read the letters, he was right ioyfull, and ſaid to the Paynim. Friend, for this good ſwoord that yee haue geuen mee, I thanke you, and I promis you if I may liue long, I ſhall reward you with the double valew therof. After that <hi>Huon</hi> had this ſword there was brought vnto him a good Armour, helmet, ſhéeld, and ſpeare with a ruſty head, <hi>Huon</hi> cared little for it, by reaſon of the great deſire that hee had to come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place whereas hee might ſhew his ſtrength &amp; vertue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was brought to him a leane horſe pilled, with a long necke and a great head. When <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw that horſe, he tooke him by the brydle, &amp; leapt vpon him without any foote in the ſtirrop, in the ſight of a M. Paynims that were there preſent, &amp; ſome ſaid it was not well done to giue him a horſe, the which could not ſerue nor aid him in time of need. When <hi>Huon</hi> was mounted on his leane féeble horſe, hée was ſorowfull, for well hee perceaued how they mocked him, and ſaid ſoftly to him ſelfe, Ah yee falſe Paynims, if I may lyue a yeere, I ſhall quitte your mockes.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> rode foorth with others, but for all that hee could doe with his ſpurres, the horſe would goe but his own ſoft pace, wherat diuers Paynims mocked him. Thus king <hi>Iuoryn</hi> departed from <hi>Mombrance</hi> with his great armie, and tarried in the fields for his men, &amp; when they were all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, then hee departed and tooke the way to <hi>Anfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerne,</hi> the which was diſtant of but foure leagues, and when

By Mahound, it is a goodly ſight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould yonder young man ſitting on the horſe <hi>Blanchardyn,</hi> how well he becommeth his armour, a goodlier man cannot be found, nor a more hardie: for the laſt day he ſlew <hi>Sorbryn</hi> the valianteſt knight in all Pagany, and alſo wanne his good horſe. But yet I am diſpleaſed with him, for that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he played with me at the Cheſſe, he was not ſo hardy as once to embrace and kiſſe me, if he had, I would haue loued him in ſuch wiſe, that if he had required of me my loue, I would not haue refuſed him, though my father had ſworne the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie an hundred times: thus the Ladies and Damſels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed together, but <hi>Huon</hi> ſet little thereby. Thus king <hi>Iuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryn</hi> and his men iſſued out of the Citie of <hi>Mombrance,</hi> and came to the fields and then roade foorth toward <hi>Anfalerne,</hi> &amp; at the laſt came before the gates of the citie, and there orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them in battaile array, and <hi>Huon</hi> who had great deſire to attaine to renowne, came to the gate with his ſpeare in his hand, and cried alowd to them that were on the walles, and ſaid. Where is <hi>Galaffer</hi> your Lord? goe and ſhew him, that he come and Iuſt againſt him that hath ſlaine his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and that I will ſerue him in like ſort if I may méete with him in Battaile, or elſe he ſhall deliuer to me the faire <hi>Eſcleremond.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Galaffer</hi> was néere by, and heard what <hi>Huon</hi> ſaide, and knew well that it was he by reaſon of the horſe <hi>Blanchardyn,</hi> whereof he was right ſorowfull, &amp; ſaid to <hi>Gerames.</hi> Friend, I ſhal ſhew you héere him that hath done me al this ill, now I ſhall ſée if yée will kéepe promiſe with me. Sir quoth <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rames,</hi> take no care, for by the faith that I owe to God, I ſhall render to you both the horſe and the man, to doe with them at your pleaſure. Then <hi>Gerames</hi> yſſued out all armed, well horſed, and tooke a good ſpeare in his hand, hee was a goodly knight of his age, puiſſant of bodie, and in his time
<pb facs="tcp:4519:97"/>
greatly redoubted, and when he was on his horſe, hee ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched himſelfe in his ſaddle in ſuch wiſe, that his ſtirrops ſtretched out a long handfull or more, he was greatly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Paynims that ſaw him, and then the Admirall <hi>Galaffer</hi> commaunded euery man to be armed, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was armed richly. Then the gate was opened, and <hi>Gerames</hi> was the firſt that iſſued out with his company, when he was without the citie, he ſtrake his horſe with his ſpurres, ſo that he was a great ſpace before all his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, with his ſpeare in his hand &amp; his ſhield about his necke, and his white beard hanging downe on his breſt vnder his helmet. Nowe when <hi>Huon</hi> on the other part ſaw <hi>Gerames</hi> comming, hee ſpurred <hi>Blanchardyn,</hi> and came againſt <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rames,</hi> and ſo they met together without any word ſpeaking, and ſtrake each other on their ſhéeldes, ſo that all was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but their armour was ſo good that they tooke no hurt, but their ſpeares brake to their handes, and the ſhiuers flew vp into the ayre, and the ſtroakes were ſo rude, that both the knights &amp; horſes fell to the earth, but they aroſe againe, and gaue each other great ſtroakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerames</hi> who was expert in déedes of armes, tooke his ſword with both his hands, and gaue <hi>Huon</hi> ſuch a ſtroake on the helmet, that perforce he was faine to ſet one of his knées to the earth the ſtroake was ſo heauy, and if it had not béen by the grace of God, he had béene ſlaine, and <hi>Huon</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed with the ſtroake, that he had much adoo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, but ſaid: Ah good Lord ſuccour me, and graunt me that before I die I maye ſée the faire <hi>Eſcleremond.</hi> Theſe words he ſpake openly, for he thought that <hi>Gerames</hi> had not vnderſtood him, for he little thought that it had béen <hi>Gerames</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fought with him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came to <hi>Gerames</hi> with his ſword in his hand to haue béen reuenged, for he neuer before recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuch a ſtroake as <hi>Gerames</hi> had giuen him. But <hi>Gerames</hi> vnderſtood <hi>Huon</hi> by his words and knew him, and therwith caſt downe his ſword to the earth, and had ſuch ſorow that he could not ſpeake a word. When <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw that, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
<pb facs="tcp:4519:98"/>
greatly why he caſt his ſword to the earth, and then <hi>Huon</hi> would not touch him, but ſaid. Paynim, what is thy mind to doe? wilt thou haue peace or elſe fight with me? Ah ſir quoth <hi>Gerames,</hi> come foorth and ſtrike of my head, for well I haue deſerued it ſéeing I haue ſtricken you ſo rudely, but I knew you not, whereof I am very ſory. When <hi>Huon</hi> heard him ſpeake, anon he knew well that it was <hi>Gerames,</hi> wherof he had great ioy in his heart for finding of him. The Paynims that regarded them, hadde great maruaile what thing the twoo Champions ment or thought to do. Sir quoth <hi>Gerames,</hi> it behooueth vs ſhortly to determine our buſineſſe, for I ſée on all parts Paynims aſſemble together to behould vs, I ſhall ſhew you what is beſt for vs twoo to doe, leape you vpon your horſe, and I ſhall leape on mine, then I ſhall take you, and lead you perforce as my priſoner to the Citie of <hi>Anfalerne,</hi> and there ſhall yée ſée your Loue <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> who will haue great ioy with your comming, and ſhée will tell you other newes. Friend quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> I ſhall doe as yee deuiſe, then they leapt on their horſes, and <hi>Gerames</hi> came to <hi>Huon</hi> and laid hand on him, as though he tooke him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and ſo led him toward the citie of <hi>Anfalerne,</hi> and his companie followed him, and when king <hi>Iuoryn</hi> ſawe how <hi>Gerames</hi> had led away <hi>Huon</hi> as Priſoner, he began to crie &amp; ſaid: On forth yée Sarazins, how ſuffer you this yong man to be led away as a Priſoner to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of <hi>Anfalerne?</hi> I ſhall neuer haue ioy at my heart if ye ſuffer him thus to be ledde away.</p>
               <p>Then the Sarazins daſhed into the preaſſe to haue reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Huon,</hi> and on the other part the Admirall <hi>Galaffer</hi> came &amp; met <hi>Gerames</hi> and <hi>Huon,</hi> and then <hi>Gerames</hi> ſaid to him: Sir, goe and fight with your enemies, behould heere the young man that ſlew your Nephew <hi>Sorbryn,</hi> I ſhall lead him into the citie and ſet him in ſure priſon, and then I ſhall ſhortly retourne againe to you to fight againſt king <hi>Iuoryn.</hi> Friend quoth <hi>Galaffer,</hi> I require you ſo to doe, and aſſoone as yee haue ſet him in priſon retourne againe. <hi>Gerames</hi> departed
<pb facs="tcp:4519:98"/>
from the Admirall, and went to the citie with <hi>Huon</hi> and his xiij. companions with him, when they were entred into the Citie, they lifted vp the bridges and cloſed the gates, in the Citie there was no man of warre, for all were in the field with the Admirall againſt king <hi>Iuoryn,</hi> there were none but women, children &amp; ould folkes, and when that <hi>Gerames</hi> and <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw how they were ſtrong ynough for them in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they went into the ſtréetes and cried Saint Dennis, and ſlew all that they met aſwell old men, as women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo that within a ſhort ſpace they had cleane wonne the towne. Many Paynims fled and leapt into the dikes, and brake neckes, armes, and legges, then they went into the Pallaice, and there they found the faire <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> &amp; when <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw her, he did of his helmet, and ranne and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her, and when the Ladie ſaw that it was <hi>Huon,</hi> the ioy that ſhee had was ſo great that it was maruaile to ſée it, there was ſuch ioy at their méeting that it cannot be recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Huon</hi> and the Ladie embraced &amp; kiſſed each other many times, and ſhe ſaid.

La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> I ought greatly to loue and cheriſh you, and I am right ioyfull that it hath pleaſed God that I haue now found you in good health and proſperitie, for a more truer man than ye be there is none liuing.</p>
               <p>When all the companie had made their ſalutations one to another, they went to dinner and were richly ſerued, for there was great plentie in the citie, and the Sarazins were without the Citie, wheras they fought and ſlew each other, there was ſuch ſlaying on both parts, that the fieldes were couered with dead men and fore wounded, many a horſe ran about the field and their Maiſters lying dead, theſe twoo Kings fought one againſt the other puiſſance againſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance, and twoo Sarazins that were eſcaped out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Anfalerne,</hi> came to the Admirall <hi>Galaffer</hi> and ſaid.

               <p>When the Admirall <hi>Galaffer</hi> heard that, he was heauy &amp; ſorowfull, and ſaid to his men that were about him.

               <p>Alas quoth <hi>Mouflet,</hi> neuer in all my life haue I done or thought any treaſon, nor knew not that, that I brought to your Court, him that ſlew your brother the Admiral <hi>Gaudys,</hi> who was my Lord and Maſter, therefore Sir, great ſinne it were for you to put me to death, for that I am not guiltie of. Thou lyeſt falſe traitour (quoth <hi>Iuoryn</hi>) and ſo commaunded a thirtie men to leade him to the gallowes, and when they were come thither, they cauſed the minſtrell to mount vp on the ladder.

When <hi>Huon</hi> heard the Minſtrell, hée knew wel that it was <hi>Mouflet</hi> who had béen his maiſter, then hée ſaid to his company.

               <p>Then <hi>Gerames</hi> and al his companions made them ready, and iſſued out of the Caſtle with <hi>Huon,</hi> by a ſecret poſterne, ſo that they that were about the gibet were not aware of of them, till <hi>Huon</hi> and his companie was among them. <hi>Huon</hi> ranne at him that ſhould haue hanged the minſtrell, and ſtrake him with his ſpeare cleane through, and ſo hee fell downe dead, and then <hi>Huon</hi> tooke downe the Minſtrell, and made him to flie away to the poſterne, and his violl about his necke, he that had ſéene him flie away, could not haue kept himſelfe from laughing, for he ranne ſo faſt, that he ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee no old man, but rather of the age of thirtie yéere, and <hi>Huon</hi> and <hi>Gerames</hi> and his companie, ſlew and beate downe all the thirtie Paynimes, ſo that none eſcaped the death. When King <hi>Iuoryn</hi> and <hi>Galaffer</hi> perceiued that there was much adoe about the gibet, they ſayd, Sirs, the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are come out of the Caſtle, goe and looke that ye doe ſo much, that none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enter againe.

               <p>Then <hi>Huon,</hi> who was expert in déedes of armes, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that it was time to depart, he called his men together, and went toward the poſterne, the which with much payne they got in thereat, and ſo they entred in al xiii. companions, but yet they were ſo haſted and purſued, that <hi>Garyn</hi> of Saint <hi>Omer</hi> abode without, and defended himſelfe valiantly: but at laſt he was ſlaine by the Paynims, then <hi>Huon</hi> was right ſorrowfull, when hee ſaw that <hi>Garyn</hi> was not entered into the Caſtle, and pitiouſly complayned for him, and ſayd.

Then <hi>Huon</hi> ſayd vnto <hi>Gerames</hi>: Fréend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> behold yonder commeth a Ship with full ſayle, they will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue at this Port, they be Chriſtian men I ſée well by the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens that the Ship doth beare, for vppon the Maſt I ſée a red croſſe. Sir, (quoth <hi>Gerames</hi>) by all that I can ſée the ſhippe is of Fraunce, and therefore (as I haue ſaid to you before) God will ſend vs ſome good aduenture, &amp; therewith by feare of the Tempeſt, the Shippe came into the Hauen and caſte their anchors.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> approached to the Ship, and demaunded for the Patron, and for the maiſter of them that were in the ſhip, then the Marriners regarded the place whereas they were, and they knew plainly by the great Tower, that they were in the Port of <hi>Anfalerne,</hi> whereof they had great feare, and ſayd one to another. Ah good Lord God helpe vs, for we ſée well wee are but dead, ſéeing wee bée arriued héere in this Port, for wée knowe well, that the Lord of this place is the moſt cruelleſt Paynim betwéen this and the red Sea. Thus they complayned them one to another, and <hi>Huon</hi> (who was néere them) vnderſtood them well, and ſayd. Sirs, haue yée no doubt of death, for yée are arriued at a good Port: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to ſhew me from whence you come, and what yée bée? and they anſweared &amp; ſayd. Sir, ſéeing you can ſpeake French we ſhall ſhew you, ſo that you will aſſure our liues. Sirs, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) haue no feare of death, nor of any hurt that yée ſhall haue, for wee that haue this place in kéeping, are French-men: therefore ſhew vs hardly your entents? Sir, (quoth they) ſince you would know what wée bee, wée are all borne in the Countrey of Fraunce, and one of vs is of Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> and ſome of the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Realme of Fraunce. Fréends, (quoth <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:4519:102"/>
I pray you ſhew me, if there be any among you borne in the Citie of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Sir, (quoth one of them) heere is one in this ſhip that was borne in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> an ould ancient man, I thinke he be of an hundred yeares of age, his name is <hi>Guyer,</hi> and wee are going on pilgrimage for the loue of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to viſit the holy Sepulchre, but fortune by force of Tempeſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea hath cauſed vs to arriue héere, and this Tempeſt hath endured theſe thrée dayes and thrée nights paſſed, whereby wee be ſo wearie and ſo ſore trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that wée can doe no more. Fréend, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I pray you ſhew him foorth, that you ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>Then the Patron of the Ship commaunded, that the old man of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> ſhould come forth, then <hi>Guyer</hi> the Prouoſt came to <hi>Huon</hi> and ſayd.

When <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw him, he knew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent that it was <hi>Guyer</hi> the Prouoſt, and ſayd: Fréend, I require you ſhew mee where you were borne? and what hath mooued you to come hether, ſéeing the great age that you be of? and to ſhew me what is your name? Sir, (quoth he) I ſhall ſhew you the truth, I had a Lord whome I loued en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, hee was Sonne to Duke <hi>Seuin</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and hee was called <hi>Huon,</hi> and it fell ſo out, that after the death of his Father about a Seauen yeares, King <hi>Charlemaine</hi> ſent for him to doe his homage to receiue his Land of him, the young man by the commaundement of his Mother, he and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gerard</hi> with him tooke their way towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and by the way King <hi>Charlemaines</hi> Sonne called <hi>Charlot,</hi> was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a wood by the counſaile of certaine Traytours, and there lay in a waight to haue ſlaine <hi>Huon</hi> and his Brother <hi>Gerard,</hi> but the caſe fell otherwiſe, for <hi>Huon</hi> ſlew <hi>Charlot</hi> not knowing who it was, wherefore Kinge <hi>Charlemaine</hi> bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him out of the Realm of Fraunce, and charged him ere he returned, to goe to <hi>Babilon</hi> to do a Meſſuage to the Admi-<hi>Gaudiſe.</hi> But his Brother <hi>Gerard</hi> aboad ſtill at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to kéepe the heritage, and then the Ducheſſe his Mother was ſo full of ſorrowe, that her Sonne was ſo baniſhed without

by the hand, and the good Prouoſt <hi>Guyer</hi> held his brother <hi>Gerames</hi> by the hand, and ſo all the other twoo and twoo together, then they found y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope ſitting in his throne deuiſing with his Cardinalles, then <hi>Huon</hi> approched and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him humbly. When the Pope beheld <hi>Huon,</hi> he knew him incontinent, and aroſe vp and came to him and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and kiſſed his cheeke, and ſaid. Faire ſonne <hi>Huon</hi> yee be welcome, I pray you ſhew me how is it with you, and ſhew me of your aduentures? Sir quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> I haue endured many euils and troubles ynow and all theſe that are come with me, but (thanked be our Lord god) it is ſo now, that I haue brought with me, the beard and great téeth of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall <hi>Gaudiſe,</hi> and haue alſo brought his Daughter who is heere preſent, and Sir I require you to giue her Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and then I will wed her to my wife. <hi>Huon</hi> quoth the Pope, all this pleaſeth me right well to doe, and the rather ſéeing it is your pleaſure, &amp; I deſire you to tarrie héere with me this night. Sir quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> your pleaſure ſhalbe mine.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Huon</hi> and his companie tarried with the Pope all that night, whereas they made great ioy, and on the nexts morning a Font was made readie, wherein the faire <hi>Eſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remond</hi> was chriſtened without changing of her name, and alſo there was chriſtened <hi>Mouſlet</hi> the Minſtrell, and he was called <hi>Garyn,</hi> and when the Sacrament of Baptiſme was finiſhed, the Pope himſelfe ſaid ſeruice, firſt he confeſſed <hi>Huon,</hi> and aſſoyled him of all his faultes, then hee wedded him to <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> and when diuine ſeruice was ended, then they went all with the Pope to his Pallaice, and there was made the ſolempnities of the Mariage, but to ſhew the maner of their ſeruice, with the meates and drinkes, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> apparell of the Brides, it would be ouer-tedious to rehearſe it. But one thing I dare well ſaie, that there had not béene ſéene of a long time before ſuch a glorious and rich ſeaſt, for the Pope did as much for them as though they had béen his owne Brother and Siſter, the melodie of the Minſtrels that played was ſo ſwéet and delectable, that euery man was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb facs="tcp:4519:106"/>
with the hearing thereof, and ſpecially it was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile to heare <hi>Garyn</hi> the new chriſtened Minſtrell to play, hee played ſo ſwéetlye on his vyoll, that it was geat ioy to heare it.</p>
               <p>Thus there was great ioy in the Popes Pallaice, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as they were well ſerued at dinner, ſo it was better at ſupper, and at night euery man withdrew himſelfe, and the new Brydes lay together in great pleaſure all that night, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning they aroſe and heard ſeruice, and then dined, and then they truſſed vp al their Baggage and charged their Somers, Mules, and Mullets, and ſadled their horſes, and then <hi>Huon</hi> and <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> went and tooke their leaue of the Pope, and thanked him for the honour and great courteſie that he had ſhewed them. Sir quoth the Pope, if it would pleaſe you to tarrie longer heere with me, my goodes and my houſe ſhould be at your commaundment. Sir quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> I cannot render ſufficient thankes to your Holines for the good that yée haue done to vs: But Sir, longer I cannot tarrie, for the great deſire that I haue to accompliſh the reſt of my buſineſſe, therefore Sir, I recommend you to our Lord God. The Pope kiſſed <hi>Huon,</hi> and tooke <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> by the hand: thus they tooke their leaue, and at their departing, the Pope ſent to them a Somer charged with gold, and cloathes of ſilke, and thus they departed from <hi>Rome.</hi>

The fayre <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> who was wearie of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, was in her chamber apart, and diuers other of her company with her, whereas ſhe ſupped and lay that night. <hi>Huon</hi> was ſomewhat troubled, becauſe his brother had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his wife the daughter of a Traytour, thus they wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and ſate them downe to ſupper, where they were richly ſerued: and at another table ſate the Prouoſt <hi>Guyer</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rames</hi> his brother, and diuers other Barons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerard</hi> beheld the Prouoſt, whom hee vtterly hated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee went to ſeeke for <hi>Huon.</hi> Hee ſware to him ſelfe, that if hee might once goe out of the Abbey, that he ſhould bee the firſt that ſhoulde looſe his life, and hee did eate and
<pb facs="tcp:4519:110"/>
drinke but little for thinking to accompliſh his ill Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. When they had ſupped, they aroaſe from the board, and their bedds were made readie. Then <hi>Huon</hi> called the Abbot apart, and ſayd: Sir, I haue brought hether with me great riches, I will leaue it héere with you to keepe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till my returne, and I pray you for any manner of thing that may fall, deliuer it vnto no man liuing, but all onely to my ſelfe, and if God giue me the grace to returne, your part ſhall bee therein. Sir, (quoth the Abbot) all that you take mée to keepe ſhall bée ſafely kept to your behoofe, and I ſhall doe ſo that you ſhall bée content: then hee went to bed and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> with him, where <hi>Gerard</hi> ſayd, Brother if you thinke it good I ſhall call you vp betimes, for it ſéemeth that to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the day will be hot. Brother, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>Thus they lay together in one bed, but the Traytour <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> had no lyſt to ſleepe, for the great deſire that he had to be reuenged of his Brother, who neuer did him any treſpaſſe, but alas why did not <hi>Huon</hi> know his entent? if hée had, the matter had not gone ſo to paſſe. At laſt the houre came that the Cockes began to crowe, then <hi>Gerard</hi> awooke <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſaid: Brother, it were good for vs to ariſe for anone it will be day, it is good to ride in the coole, but the ill Traytour, his thought was otherwiſe. When <hi>Huon</hi> heard his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he roſe vp, and euery man aroſe vp and made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, Sir quoth <hi>Gerames,</hi> how is it that yée be ſo haſtie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from hence? I pray you let me ſléepe a little longer. Sir quoth <hi>Gerard,</hi> that is ill ſaid, for he that hath buſineſſe to doe that toucheth him néere, ought not to ſléepe nor reſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his buſineſſe be finiſhed. By my troth quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> my Brother ſaith troth, for I haue a great deſire to ſpeake with King <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> then euery man truſſed vp their things and tooke their horſes, and the faire <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> was readie and mounted on a ſtately mule, and ſo they all tooke their leaues of the Abbot, who was right ſorowfull that they would depart ſo early. Then the gates were opened, and
<pb facs="tcp:4519:110"/>
ſo departed Fourtéene in a companie, and <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> made the Fiftéene, and <hi>Gerard</hi> rode before to lead them the right way that he would haue them to ride, and <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſumptuouſly apparelled rode very ſoberly, and ſhe came to <hi>Huon</hi> and ſaid. Sir, I cannot tell what ayleth me, but my heart is ſo ſore troubled, that all my bodie trembleth. Madame quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> be not diſmaid, nor haue any feare, for yée be in a good countrey, where by the grace of god, yée ſhall be ſerued like a Princeſſe and Ladie of the countrey, and with thoſe wordes ſpeaking, her Mule ſtumbled on the one foot before, ſo that ſhée had néere hand a great fall, then <hi>Huon</hi> approched to her, &amp; tooke the bridle of the Mule in his hand &amp; ſaid, Faire Ladie haue yée any hurt? No Sir (quoth ſhée) but I had almoſt fallen.</p>
               <p>By my faith quoth <hi>Gerames,</hi> we haue done very ill, for that wée departed from the Abbey before day light. Sirs quoth <hi>Gerard,</hi> I neuer ſaw men ſo fearefull for ſo ſmall a cauſe. Sir quoth <hi>Gerames,</hi> I know not why yée ſpeake it, but if I might councell yée, we would not goe one foot far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but returne againe to the Abbey till day light. By god quoth <hi>Gerard,</hi> it were great folly to returne againe now for the ſtumbling of a Mule, I neuer ſaw men ſo fearefull, let vs ride foorth and make good chéere, I ſée the day beginneth to appeare. So they road foorth vntill they came to a croſſe, whereas there was foure wayes, this was about a League from the Abbey. Then <hi>Huon</hi> reſted and ſayd: Loe, héere is the border of the Territorie of the Abbey of Saint <hi>Mauriſe,</hi> and this one way is to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the which way I will not ride, for ſo I haue promiſed to King <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> to whome I neuer yet falſed my faith, if I did, it ſhould bee the cauſe that I might looſe my Signiorie, and this other way goeth to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; this other way before vs is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right way into Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the which way I will ride and none other. So they road foorth and all their companie, and within a while they were néere to the wood, within a bow ſhoot whereas the Traytour <hi>Gybouars</hi> lay in ambuſhment.</p>
               <p>

Brother, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I haue great maruaile of this that you ſay, you knowe well that in the Abbey of Saint <hi>Mauriſe</hi> I haue left Twentie Somers char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with fine gould, and I haue ſaide vnto you, that your part ſhall bée therein as much as mine, nor I ſhall haue no penny but that one halfe is yours.

When <hi>Huon</hi> vnderſtood his Brother, his bloud roaſe into his face, for hée ſawe well his Brother ſearched all that he could to fall at debate with him, and <hi>Gerames</hi> who was ſage and wiſe, perceiued anone that the matter was like to goe euill, and ſayd vnto <hi>Huon.</hi> Sir, graunt to <hi>Gerard</hi> your Brother his demaund, you are both young inough to conquer Landes. <hi>Gerames,</hi> (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I am content that he ſhall haue <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> or <hi>Gerone,</hi> let him take which hee liſt.

                  </gap>udely that hee ouerthrew cuppes and diſhes vpon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Naymes</hi> quoth the King, you haue done ill thus to doe. Sir quoth Duke <hi>Naymes,</hi> I haue good cauſe thus to doe, and I haue wondrous great maruaile that I ſée you ſo doted, I am in ſuch ſorrow thereby, that I am néere hand out of my wits: how is it that you be come into the Citie of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for to eate and to drinke, and to take your eaſe? you néede not to haue gone out of France for that, for you had meate and alſo good wines ſufficient at home in your owne houſe. Ah right Noble and worthie Emperour, what meane you to do? it is no ſmall matter to iudge to death one of your twelue Peeres, &amp; it is not poſſible to giue any true iudgement, when you and we are full of wine and ſpices. But Sir ſayd the Duke, by the Lord that mee fourmed, that whoſoeuer this day doth eate or drinke wine, as long as the life is in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, I ſhall neuer loue him. <hi>Naymes</hi> quoth the King, I am content with your will.</p>
               <p>Then the King commanded that the table ſhould be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; commanded incontinent <hi>Huon</hi> to be taken out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and brought before him, they that had commiſſion to doe it, went to the priſon, and there they tooke out <hi>Huon</hi> and his wife <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> and old <hi>Gerames,</hi> and they were all three brought before the King and his Barons. <hi>Huon</hi> ſawe

where King <hi>Charlemaine</hi> ſate among all his Lordes, and they all aroſe when they ſaw <hi>Huon</hi> and his companie ſo pale and ill coloured, by reaſon of the noyſome priſon that his brother had put them in, and <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> and old <hi>Gerames</hi> were greatly regarded: and when the Pledges ſawe <hi>Huon</hi> before the King, they ſaid.

Sirs (quoth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King) I hold you quit, you may go from hence forth where you pleaſe, for <hi>Huon</hi> cannot now ſcape our handes, then <hi>Huon</hi> kneeled downe before the King right humblie, and when Duke <hi>Naymes</hi> ſaw him, the drops fell from his eyes, and ſayd to the king. Sir I require you giue <hi>Huon</hi> audience, and heare what hee will ſay. I am content quoth the King, let him ſay what hee will, then <hi>Huon</hi> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on his knées ſayd.</p>
               <p>Sir, in the honour of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, I firſt crie mercie to God, and to you and to all your Barons I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine me of that falſe traitour that I ſée there, who was my brother, if there had béene any faith or troth in him, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in all the world cannot be found ſo cruell and falſe a Traytour, for <hi>Cayne</hi> that ſlew <hi>Abell</hi> his brother, was neuer ſo falſe nor ſo cruell. When all the Lords heard <hi>Huon,</hi> they al beganne to weepe, ſaying each to others. Ah good Lord, where is the beautie become that was woont to be in <hi>Huon</hi>? we haue ſéene him ſo faire, that no one could paſſe him in beautie, and now wee ſée him pale and leane and ill colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it appeareth well, he hath not béene alwayes in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Chambers, nor among damſels to ſport and to play with him. Thus they deuiſed of him, and tooke no heede of <hi>Gerard</hi> who was by them. Then <hi>Huon</hi> ſpake againe, and ſayd to the King.</p>
               <p>Sir, true it is, the meſſage that you gaue me in charge to doe vnto the Admirall <hi>Gaudys,</hi> I haue doone to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vttermoſt as you haue commaunded vnto mee, and I haue paſſed the Sea, and came vnto Babilone to the
<pb facs="tcp:4519:118"/>
Admirall <hi>Gaudys,</hi> &amp; there I required of him in the preſence of all his Lords, to haue his beard &amp; foure great téeth. But when he had heard my demaund, he held it for a great folly, and ſo incontinent he caſt me into priſon, whereas I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by famine, if the Admirals Daughter had not béene, whome yée may ſée yonder ſitting by the piller, and alſo by the aid of good King <hi>Oberon</hi> whome I ought greatly to loue, he is a king of the Fairie right puiſſant, and is in the Citie of <hi>Momur,</hi> and he knowing of the perill that I was in, had pitie on me, and came and ſuccoured me in ſuch wiſe &amp; with ſo great a puiſſance, that in <hi>Babilon</hi> he ſlew al ſuch as would not beléeue in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Then he tooke me out of priſon, and then we entred into the Pallaice, and there wee ſlew all ſuch as wee found there. Then I went to the Admirall <hi>Gaudys</hi> and ſtrake off his head, and then I cut off his beard, and opened his mouth and drew out foure of his great téeth, and when I had them, then I deſired king <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beron</hi> to aid me, and to finde the meanes that I might ſafely bring the Beard and Téeth to your preſence, and to ſhew me where I might beſt kéepe them. Then the good king <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beron,</hi> by the grace of our Lord God and by the puiſſaunce that God had giuen vnto him, he cloſed them within the ſide of <hi>Gerames,</hi> ſo that they could not be perceiued, and Sir know for troth, ye neuer heard of ſuch a man. Now when I ſaw that I had fourniſhed your meſſuage, I retourned, &amp; tooke with me the faire Ladie <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> Daughter to the foreſaid Admirall <hi>Gaudys,</hi> and the Twelue gentlemen that went with me out of Fraunce, who alwaies haue béen with me. And Sir, if I ſhould ſhew you the great paines and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerties that I and they haue ſuffered, it would be too long to rehearſe, but I may well ſay, if the grace of God had not been, I had neuer come hether againe, if I had had x. liues I could neuer haue eſcaped the death. Next after all theſe paines and trauailes that I and they that were with mee ſuffered, by the grace of God we came and arriued at <hi>Rome,</hi> whereas the Pope receiued me with great ioy, &amp; there wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:4519:118"/>
me to <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> the Admiralles daughter, whom you may ſée yonder all deſolate, and full of diſpleaſures, and not without cauſe.</p>
               <p>When the Barons that were there heard the pittious complaints of <hi>Huon,</hi> euerie man of pitie beheld the Lady, who pale and ill coloured ſate ſore wéeping, ſo that ſuch as regarded her, were conſtrained to take part of her ſorrow, there was no man but they began ſore to wéepe, and <hi>Huon</hi> who was before the King, was ſorrowfull to ſée his wife make ſo great dolour. Then hee ſayd vnto the King. Sir, if you will not beleeue my ſaying, ſend to Rome to the Pope to know the truth, if you proue my words contrarie, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelfe to receiue ſuch death, as you and your Barons can deuiſe, if the Pope doe not beare witneſſe of that I haue ſayd, God forbid that I ſhould ſhew you any thing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then truth. I haue ſayd nothing, but hee ſhall ſhew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens that my ſaying is true, and I can ſay more if I would ſhew all, but it is not néedefull that I ſhould make a long ſermon. But Sir, thus as I haue ſhewed you, I did returne from the place that you ſent me to, and Sir know for truth, I came not ſo vnprouided, but that I brought with me great plentie of gould and ſiluer, and my companie came all with mee, and I purpoſed not to reſt in any place till I had ſpoken with your grace, for the great deſire that I had to ſee you, and ſo along I rode till I came to an Abbey heere hard by, a foure leagues hence called Saint <hi>Mauris,</hi> becauſe the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey was of your foundation, and not pertayning to the land of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for I would not haue entred into this towne, becauſe of the commandement that you gaue me.</p>
               <p>Thus I came and lodged me in the Abbey, and the Abbot receiued me with great ioy, and hee ſent word of my being there to my brother <hi>Gerard,</hi> and the traytour came to mee like a falſe traytour, and brought with him but one Squire, whereby now I may perceiue, that in him was nothing but falſeneſſe and treaſon. <hi>Huon</hi> quoth Duke <hi>Naymes,</hi> your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is good, for if he had beene true as he ought to haue been,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:119"/>
he ought to aſſemble the Barons and Lords of the Country, and ſo to haue come with them, and haue receiued you with reuerence and honour. Sir quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> it is true, but the Traytour did otherwiſe, for when hee was come to mee, by great ſubtiltie hee demaunded how I had ſped in my iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and whether I had ſpoken with the Admirall <hi>Gaudys</hi> or not, and declared to him your meſſage, and if I had brought with mee his beard and foure great teeth: and I ſhewed him I had accompliſhed your whole commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the vnhappy Traitour demaunded where I kept them, and I ſhewed him, for I had no miſtruſt in him. Then he ſo exorted mee, that at the houre of midnight hee made me to ariſe haſtily, and mkde me and al my company ready, and ſo leapt on our horſes and rode forth our way, and when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:4519:119"/>
then he bound <hi>Gerames</hi> handes and féete, hurt as he was, as Sir ye may know the truth by him. Then <hi>Gerames</hi> ſtept forth and lift vp his cloake, and ſhewed the king the wound in his ſide, the which euerie man might ſée that was there. Sir quoth <hi>Huon</hi> to the king, when he had done all this, hee ſet vs on three leane horſes, and ſo brought vs into this towne bound hands and féete, and then ſet vs in a déepe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo hath kept vs hetherto with bread and water, and ſo hath taken from vs all the riches that wee brought with vs, and Sir, if hee be ſo hardie to ſay the contrarie, that it is not true that I haue ſayd, let him and <hi>Gybouars,</hi> like tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours as they be, arme themſelues, and I ſhall fight againſt them both, and if I can conquere them both, whereof I haue no doubt (with the aide of our Lord God) then let them haue as they haue deſerued: and if I cannot ouercome them, nor make them to ſhew the truth, I will that then incontinent you cauſe me to be drawne and hanged.</p>

               <p>Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) God forbid that a Kinge of Fraunce ſhould doe ſo great a crueltie. My Lord, I crie you mercie, for Gods ſake doe not to mee ſo great an out-rage, for you may knowe right well that perforce I was brought hether, and therefore great King, I require you let mee haue right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true iudgement. By my faith <hi>Huon,</hi> (quoth Duke <hi>Naymes</hi>) it is but a ſmall requeſt that you make, for your right is ſo cleare, that if reaſon may be ſhewed to you, there is no man can ſay the contrarie, but that your Lands ought to bee rendred vnto you franke and frée, and your Brother <hi>Gerard</hi> to bee hanged and ſtrangled.

But Sirs if ye thinke it good, let vs all put the whole matter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Duke <hi>Naymes</hi> of <hi>Bauyer,</hi> and all that hee will ſay, let vs agrée thereto, then all the Lords accorded together, and ſayd how the Earle of <hi>Chalons</hi> had ſayd right well. Then they came to Duke <hi>Naymes,</hi> and deſired him that he would take the charge of that matter vpon him, and whatſoeuer he did, they were all agreed thereto: when the Duke heard them, he ſtood ſtill a certaine ſpace, and beganne to ſtudie on the matter, and tooke all the tenne Peeres to counſell with him.</p>
               <p>And when the faire <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> ſaw <hi>Huon</hi> her huſband in that danger, among them with whom he ſhould haue béene in ioy, then ſhe beganne ſore to wéepe, and ſayd.

King <hi>Charlemaine</hi> will not beléeue that you haue béene in the Citie of <hi>Babylone,</hi> and yet ſurely there you haue beene, for I ſaw you there ſlay my Father the Admirall <hi>Gaudys,</hi> and tooke his beard, and drew out of his mouth foure of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt teeth, great pitie it were if you ſhould die for your truth and faythfulneſſe, but the thing that moſt feareth me, is that I ſée none that be héere likelie to be a Noble man, except the King, (who is chiefe of all other) and yet me thinkes hee is full of falſhood, for I ſée none other but he that ſéekes your death. But I promiſe to God, that if hee ſuffer you to haue this wrong and thus to die, I ſay then as for my part, that <hi>Mahound</hi> is better worth then your King <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:4519:122"/>
it be ſo that you receiue death without a cauſe, I will neuer more beléeue in your king, but renounce his law, and beléeue in <hi>Mahound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were many Lords and knights that heard the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies words, whereof they had ſuch pitie, that the moſt part of them beganne to wéepe. And when <hi>Huon</hi> heard his wife, he turned toward her, and ſayd. Ladie I deſire you to leaue your ſorrow, and truſt in God almightie, who ſo oftentimes hath ſuccoured vs, you know not what he will doe, let vs bee content with his good pleaſure. Thus with ſuch words <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> appeaſed the fayre <hi>Eſcleremond.</hi> And Duke <hi>Naymes,</hi> who was in counſell with the other Peeres, ſayd to them. Sirs I haue great ſorrow at my heart bicauſe of theſe two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſo that I cannot tell what counſaile to find: I deſire you all in this waightie matter to counſaile me, and ſhewe mee your opinions therein. Sir, (quoth the Lords) other counſaile you ſhall not haue of vs, for we haue layde all the matter vppon you, to doe therein what it ſhall pleaſe you. Sirs, (quoth the Duke) to diſſemble the matter auayleth not, but ſince that <hi>Huon</hi> muſt paſſe by iudgement, how ſay you, ſhall he be hanged or drawne? Sir quoth <hi>Gaulter,</hi> who was the firſt ſpeaker, mée thinkes he can eſcape none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Ah Traytour quoth the Duke, thou lieſt falſely, for it ſhall not follow after thy councell, whether thou wilt or not, there is no man this day that ſhall be ſo hardie as to iudge him to die, therefore Sirs yet ſhew me againe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yée will agrée to my councell. Sir quoth they, wée haue laid the charge vpon you, the which we will all abide by, but whoſoeuer was glad, <hi>Gaulter</hi> was ſorowfull &amp; angrie, for he would haue conſented to the death of <hi>Huon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then all the Barons right ſad and penſiue went out of the counſell Chamber, and they could find no manner of wayes how to ſaue <hi>Huon,</hi> but they all prayed to God to aide and ſuccour him. And <hi>Huon</hi> ſeeing the Barons comming ſo ſadly together, thought that the matter was not at a good poynt, whereby hee beganne ſore to weepe: when <hi>Eſclere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4519:122"/>
and <hi>Gerames</hi> ſaw the ſorrow that <hi>Huon</hi> made, they had great pitie thereof. Then <hi>Huon</hi> beheld Duke <hi>Naymes,</hi> for he knew well all the matter lay in his hands, he feared greatly the iudgement that ſhould be made vpon him and ſaid. Thou very God and man, as I beléeue verily that thou didſt die on the holy croſſe to redeeme vs all, and that on the third day thou didſt riſe from death to life: I require thee humbly in this great neede to ſuccour me as truely as I am in the right, for more wrong no man can haue. Then the Duke <hi>Naymes</hi> of <hi>Bauier</hi> came to the king, and ſayd. Sir, will it pleaſe you to heare what we haue deuiſed? Yea quoth the king I deſire nothing elſe to know. Well Sir quoth the Duke, then I demaund of you, in what place of your Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thinke you to iudge one of your Peeres of Fraunce? <hi>Naymes</hi> quoth the King, I know well you be a Nobleman, and all that you ſay is to deliuer <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> but I will ye know, all ſhall not profite him. Then the Duke ſayd, Sir to ſay ſo ye doe great wrong. Therefore ſir regard well in what place you will haue one of your Peeres iudged, if you know not where it ſhould be done, I will ſhew you. In your Realme are but three places to doe it in: The firſt is the Towne of Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> the ſecond is <hi>Orleance,</hi> and the third is <hi>Paris,</hi> and therefore Sir, if you will proceede vpon <hi>Huon</hi> by iuſtice, it is conuenient that it bee done in one of theſe three places, for here in this town he cannot be iudged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naymes</hi> quoth the King, I vnderſtand well why you ſay this, I well ſee and perceiue, that you entend to none other end, but to deliuer and quit <hi>Huon</hi>: I had thought to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him by the order of iuſtice, to the intent that none of you ſhould haue reprooued mee, therefore I ordained that he ſhould haue beene iudged by you that bee the Péeres of France, and I ſée well you haue done nothing therein, and therefore as long as you liue, you ſhall meddle no more with that matter, but by the beard that I beare on my chinne, I ſhal neuer dine nor eate meat after this dinner, til I ſée him hanged and drawne, for all your bearing of him againſt me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4519:123"/>
Then he commanded the tables to be ſet vp, and when <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> vnderſtood the king, he was ioyfull thereof in his hart, but he made no ſemblance of ioy, becauſe of the Lords that were there preſent. When <hi>Huon</hi> and <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> had heard how the King had ſworne the death of <hi>Huon,</hi> the dolorous weepings and teares that they made were ſo extreame, that hard it were to declare it, and <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> ſayd to <hi>Huon.</hi> Ah Sir, now I ſee well that great pitie it ſhall be the departing of vs two, but if I had a knife, I would not abide your death, but firſt I ſhoulde ſlay my ſelfe before this falſe and vntrue king. Her complaints were ſo pitifull, that moſt part of the Lords wept for pitie, and the old <hi>Gerames</hi> ſorely wept and ſayd: Ah good Lord God, in what howre was I borne? in great dolour and paine haue I continued my youth, and now in mine age thus ſhamefully to die? Thus all three made ſuch ſorrow, that it would haue made a hard heart to lament. All three thought no otherwiſe but to die, becauſe they had heard King <hi>Charlemaine</hi> make ſuch promiſe, but that which God will ſaue, no man can let: and god ſaue the good king <hi>Oberon,</hi> for king <hi>Charlemaine</hi> ſhalbe forſworne, as ye ſhal heare hereafter. Now let vs leaue ſpeaking of this pitious companie, and ſpeake of the noble king <hi>Oberon</hi> of the Fayrie, who as then was in his wood.</p>

               <p>Sirs, (quoth the Kinge) I remember nowe the vnhappie <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> who is returned from the farre parts, and he hath paſſed by <hi>Rome,</hi> and there hath taken his Wife in mariage, and is confeſſed of all his ſinnes, for the which ſinnes he hath béen by me ſore puniſhed.

He is now in the Pallaice at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> &amp; his Wife the fayre <hi>Eſcrelemond</hi> and the old <hi>Gerames,</hi> with fetters on their feete, being in great ſorrow, and king <hi>Charlemaine</hi> is ſet at dinner, and hath made his oath to hang <hi>Huon,</hi> but yet whether hee will or not, he ſhall be periured, for I will goe to my Fréend <hi>Huon</hi> and helpe him at his neede, therefore I wiſh my Table and all that is thereon, neere to King <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaines</hi> Table, and ſomewhat aboue his about two foot hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp; alſo I will, bicauſe I haue heard ſay, that often times of a little Caſtle commeth a greater: therefore I will that

Huon</hi> beheld the Table, &amp; had great ioy when he ſaw it, then he lifted vp his hands to heauen and thanked our Lord God, that hée would viſit ſuch a poore ſinner as hee was ſaying: Ah Kinge <hi>Oberon,</hi> in many great needs haue you ſuccoured me. Therewith arriued King <hi>Oberon</hi> in the Citie, whereof the Burgeſſes &amp; the Commons were greatly abaſhed, when they ſaw ſuch a number of men of war enter into their citie, without any knowledge before. When king <hi>Oberon</hi> was within the Towne &amp; all his company, he ſaid to his Lords: Sirs, looke that you ſet good watch at euery gate, ſo that no man go out, the which they did diligently, for at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie gate they ſet x.M. men. Then King <hi>Oberon</hi> tooke the way to the Pallaice, and at the gate he left x.M. men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them vpon payn of their liues, that they ſhould not ſuffer any man to paſſe out, and alſo he commanded, that if they heard him blow his Horne of Iuorie, that incontinent they ſhould come into the Pallaice to him, &amp; ſlay all ſuch as they ſhould find there. Then king <hi>Oberon</hi> went vp into the
<pb facs="tcp:4519:124"/>
Pallaice, and many of his Lords with him, he was richly apprrelled in cloath of gold, and the border thereof was ſette with rich precious ſtones, goodly it was to behold, for a fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer little perſon could not be found: hee paſſed iuſt by King <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> without ſpeaking of any word, and went ſo néere to him, that he ſhouldred him ſo rudely, that his bonnet fell from his head. Ah good Lord quoth <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> I haue great maruaile what this dwarfe may be, that ſo rudly hath ſhouldred me, and almoſt ouerthrowne my table, he is fierce when hee thinkes ſcorne to ſpeake to me, howbeit, I will ſee what hee will doe, I cannot tell what hee thinketh to doe, but me ſeemeth hee is right ioyfull, and alſo he is the fayreſt creature that euer I ſaw. When <hi>Oberon</hi> had paſſed by the King, he came to <hi>Huon</hi> and wiſhed the fetters from all their féete, and led them before <hi>Charlemaine</hi> without any woord ſpeaking, and cauſed them to ſit downe with him at his own table that he had wiſhed thither: then he tooke his cup, and made thereon thrée croſſes, then incontinent the cup was ful of wine, then King <hi>Oberon</hi> tooke it, &amp; gaue it to <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> to drinke, and then to <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Gerames,</hi> and when they had all three dranke well, he ſaid to <hi>Huon.</hi> Friend ariſe vp, and take the cuppe and beare it to King <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> and ſay vnto him, that he drinke to you in the name of peace, if hee refuſe it, hee did neuer ſuch a follie in all his life. King <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> who ſate néere to them at his owne table, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring king <hi>Oberons</hi> words, wiſt not what to thinke, and ſo ſate ſtill and durſt not ſpeake one word, for the great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes that he ſaw there, and no more durſt none of his men, for they were ſo abaſhed, that there was none there but that gladly would haue béene a hundred leagues thence. But whoſoeuer was afrayde, <hi>Gerard</hi> was not verie well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> roſe from <hi>Oberons</hi> table, and tooke the cuppe, and went therewith to king <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> and deliuered it to him. The king tooke it, &amp; durſt not refuſe it, as ſoone as it was in his hands it was drie &amp; voyde, &amp; not a drop of wine therin.

Fellow quoth the King, you haue inchaunted me. Sir quoth <hi>Oberon,</hi> it is becauſe you are full of ſin, for the cup is of ſuch dignitie, that none can drinke thereof without he be a noble man, and cleane without deadly ſinne, and I know one that ye did not long agoe, the which as yet you were neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed of, and if it were not to your ſhame, I ſhould ſhew it héere openly, that euery man ſhould heare it. When the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charlemaine</hi> heard King <hi>Oberon,</hi> hee was abaſhed, and afraid that King <hi>Oberon</hi> would haue ſhamed him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: then <hi>Huon</hi> tooke againe the cuppe, and then incontinent it was full of wine againe, and then <hi>Huon</hi> bare it to Duke <hi>Naymes,</hi> who ſate next to <hi>Charlemaine. Naymes</hi> tooke the cup and dranke thereof at his pleaſure: but all the other could not touch the cup they were ſo full of ſinne. Then <hi>Huon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to king <hi>Oberon,</hi> and ſate downe by him, then <hi>Oberon</hi> called to him Duke <hi>Naymes,</hi> and commanded him to riſe from <hi>Charlemaines</hi> table, and to ſit downe by him at his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the which Duke <hi>Naymes</hi> did, for hee durſt not ſay nay. Then <hi>Oberon</hi> ſayd to him.

Sir, I ſée well to hide the troth cannot auaile mée, therefore true it is, I went to the Abbey of Saint <hi>Mauriſe</hi> to ſée my Brother <hi>Huon,</hi> and <hi>Gybouars</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Fortie men at armes, wee departed from this Citie and layde our ambuſhment in a little wood about twoo Leagues from this Citie, to watch when my Brother <hi>Huon</hi> ſhould paſſe by that way. <hi>Gerard,</hi> (quoth King <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>) ſpeake out hyer that you may the better be heard, and that euerie man may heare the treaſon &amp; falſeneſſe that you haue done vnto your Brother. Sir, (quoth <hi>Gerard</hi>) I wote not what to ſay, for I haue done ſo ill and falſely againſt my Brother, that more ill I could not doe, and I am aſhamed to recount it. But to ſay truely, that before it was midnight, I made my Brother to riſe and to depart from the Abbey, and when wee came néere the place where as my Father in law <hi>Gibouars</hi> was with his ambuſhment, I began to ſtriue with my brother ſo highly, that <hi>Gibouars</hi> might heare mee, who when he heard me ſpeake, he brake forth of his ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ranne at my brothers companie, and ſo ſlew them all, except theſe three that be here, then we tooke the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and did caſt them into the Riuer of <hi>Gerone,</hi> then wee tooke <hi>Huon</hi> and his wife, and the old <hi>Gerames,</hi> and bound their handes and féete, and blindfolded their eyes, and ſo brought them on thrée leane horſes into the Citie, and I tooke out of the ſide of old <hi>Gerames</hi> the beard and foure great téeth, the which (if it pleaſe you) I ſhall fetch from the place where I left them.</p>

of the Abbot and Couent, where the treaſure was that my Brother had left there, and that hée ſhould deliuer it to me, bearing him in hand that my Brother <hi>Huon</hi> had ſent for it.

Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi> to King <hi>Oberon</hi>) humbly I require you, that of your grace you will pardon my Brother <hi>Gerard</hi> all the ill that he hath done againſt me, for he did it by <hi>Gybo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uars,</hi> and as for me, héere, and before God I pardon him, and Sir, if you will doe thus, I ſhalbe content therewith. And to thentent that we may vſe our liues from henceforth in good peace and loue, I will giue him the halfe part of my Lands &amp; Signiories, and Sir, in the honour of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, haue pity of him.

I wiſh by the puiſſance that I haue in the Fayrie, that here beneath in the meadow there be a paire of Gallows, and all iiij. thereon hanged.

               <p>After that king <hi>Oberon</hi> had ended his words, and ſhewed the Emperour <hi>Charlemaine</hi> of all his eſtate, he called <hi>Huon</hi> and ſayd.

and pardon you of all mine ill will, and put all rancour from mée, and from hencefoorth I retaine you as one of my Péeres. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) of this I thanke God and your grace. Then the Emperour <hi>Charlemaine</hi> clipped and kiſſed <hi>Huon,</hi> in token of peace and loue.</p>
               <p>When the Lords ſaw that, they wept for ioy, and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God that the peace was made, and eſpecially Duke <hi>Naymes</hi> was ioyfull: then within a while diuers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords departed from the Court.

               <p>Now the Emperour knew not for what entent his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Raoull</hi> had deuiſed that tournay: Alas he did it but to find the place to ſlay <hi>Huon,</hi> to thintent to haue his wife <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleremond.</hi> Then Duke <hi>Raoull</hi> aſſembled his Barons, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialle ſuch as he had perfect truſt in, he ſhewed them at large the cauſe why he had aſſembled all the people to goe to the

Therefore Sirs quoth he, I will that yée ſweare to me the death of <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for I will that yée and I put all our vttermoſt to ſlay him, and then I will wed his wife, of whome I am ſo amourous, that I cannot ſléepe nor take any reſt. The ſame time that they thus made promiſe and ſware the death of <hi>Huon,</hi> there was among them a var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let with Duke <hi>Raoul,</hi> who in his youth had ſerued <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>: now when he vnderſtood, that if <hi>Huon</hi> came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tournay, there hee ſhould be murdered: as priuily as he could, he departed from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>yenna,</hi> and neuer reſted vntill hee came to the Citie of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> whereas he found Duke <hi>Huon</hi> in his Pallaice with his Lords, who had béen before aduertiſed, that there ſhould be held a great Tournay at <hi>Mayence</hi> in Almaine, and he deuiſed with his Lords how to goe thether.</p>
               <p>The ſame time the Varlet came thether, and humbly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Duke <hi>Huon,</hi> who ſaid to him: Friend where haſt thou béen ſo long? Sir quoth the Varlet, I come now from <hi>Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> in <hi>Auſtrich,</hi> where Duke <hi>Raoul</hi> who is Lord thereof, hath proclaymed a Tourney in euery Countrey, but Sir, if you goe thether, you ſhall bée ſlaine, for this Tourney is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed for none other entent, bicauſe it is too well knowne, that there can bee no hye déedes of armes done in any place, but that you will bee preſent at it. And when they haue ſlayne you, then Duke <hi>Raoul</hi> will haue the Ducheſſe your Wife in mariage: therefore Sir, (for Gods ſake) aduiſe you well that you come not there, in as much as you loue your life, for you cannot eſcape, there be twentie Thouſand men that haue ſworne your death, therefore if you enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tourney, you can neuer eſcape the death, and I haue heard Duke <hi>Raoul</hi> ſweare, that when he hath ſlaine you, hée will keepe all your Landes. When Duke <hi>Huon</hi> had heard the Varlet, hee ſware by God and made a ſolemne promiſe, that Duke <hi>Raoul</hi> ſhould dearely buy his falſe treaſon.</p>
               <p>Then the Ducheſſe <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> knéeled downe before <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and ſayd: Deare Lord, I deſire you to forbeare your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:4519:132"/>
thether at this time, for I haue heard often repeated, that this Duke <hi>Raoull</hi> is puiſſant and hath great Lands, &amp; beſides is Nephew to the Emperour of <hi>Almaine,</hi> and alſo I haue heard ſay, that a faller Traytour there is none ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in this world. Madame quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> I haue well heard you, but by the Lord that fourmed me to his Image, though I ſhould looſe halfe my landes, yet will I goe to ſée the Traytor, what, thinketh he to abaſh me with his threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings? If I may méete him at the Tournay, or in any other place where ſoeuer it be, though he had with him ten Thowſand men of armes, and that I had alonely but my ſwoord in my hand, I ſhall ſlay him whatſoeuer ſhould fall thereof, and let our Lord God do with me as it ſhall pleaſe him: I ſhall neuer haue ioy at my heart till I haue ſlaine him.</p>
               <p>When the Ducheſſe heard <hi>Huon</hi> how he would doe none otherwiſe, and that ſhée could not let him of his enterprize, ſhe was ſorrowfull and ſaid. Sir, ſéeing it is your pleaſure, reaſon it is that I muſt be content, but yet Sir I deſire you to take with you x.M. men well armed, to thintent that ye be not found vnprouided: ſo that if ye be aſſayled, yet yée may be of ſufficient puiſſance to reſiſt your enemies, and that it will pleaſe you to ſuffer me to goe with you, and I will he armed with my ſhéeld and ſwoord by my ſide, and if I may méete Duke <hi>Raoull,</hi> I ſhall giue him ſuch a buffet, that I ſhall ſtrike him from his horſe, for I am ſo diſpleaſed with him, that there is no ioynt in me but in trembleth for anger, and I ſhall neuer haue ioy at my heart till I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of him. When <hi>Huon</hi> heard the Ducheſſe his wife, he was well comforted, and began to laugh and ſaid. Faire Ladie, I giue you great thankes for your wordes, but yee are too farre gone with child to ride armed, it is a vij. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths paſt ſince yée were firſt with child, then <hi>Huon</hi> made to be proclaimed in all his lands, that euery man ſhould be readie to goe with him to the Tourney at <hi>Mayence.</hi> The Dukes entent was anon knowen throughout all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:132"/>
ſo that it being ſpread abroad, the brute therof came to the hearing of the Duke <hi>Raoull,</hi> and when he heard that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> would come to the Tournay hee was not a little ioyfull thereof, then hee ſware he would go and ſée <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> in the guiſe of a Pylgrime, and then hee putte on a beggers garment, and tooke a ſtaffe and a wallet, hée ſhewed his intent to them of his priuie Councell, they would haue ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his going, but they could not.</p>
               <p>Thus he apparelled himſelfe like a beggar, and with an hearbe rubbed on his face and handes, that ſuch as had not ſéene him otherwiſe apparelled, could not haue knowne him, hée was ſo foule and blacke, then he deſired his men to kéepe ſecret his enterpriſe. Then hee departed from <hi>Vyenna,</hi> and neuer reſted till hee came to the Citie of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and ſo went vnto the Pallayce, where hée founde <hi>Huon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Barons making great chéere and feaſt, for vnto him were come diuers Lords and Knights, deuiſing of the Tourney that ſhould be holden at <hi>Mayence.</hi> Thus <hi>Raoull</hi> came before <hi>Huon,</hi> and deſired him for the honor of our Lord God to giue him ſome meat and almes. Friend quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> thou ſhalt haue inough, but I pray thée tell me from whence thou commeſt, and whether thou wilt go, and of what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie thou art.

               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> was readie, he leapt vpon his horſe without any ſtirrop, cleane armed as he was, and after ſtretched him ſo in his ſtirrops, that the leathers ſtrained out thrée fingers, he was a puiſſant Knight armed or vnarmed, and greatly to be feared, hee tooke leaue of his men, and left them wéeping in that Citie of <hi>Coleyn.</hi> Then hee road towards the Citie of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and ſo long he road that he had a ſight of the Citie, and then he ſaw about in the meadow many Tents and rich Pauilions, pitcht vp with pummels of fine gould ſhining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sunne. <hi>Huon</hi> behelde them well, and ſo paſſed foorth and entred into the Citie, whereas he ſaw euerie ſtréet full of Knights and Squiers, abiding there vntill the day of the Tourney. <hi>Huon</hi> paſſed foorth vntill he came to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, whereas hee founde the Emperour and his Nephewe <hi>Raoul,</hi> whom <hi>Huon</hi> loued but little, as he ſhewed well ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after as yée ſhall heare.</p>

                  <hi>Huon</hi> might haue tarried too long, for the Emperour and his men went and armed them, &amp; <hi>Huon</hi> who ſaw well, that hée could not long endure without great perill of death, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with his ſword round about him, he withdrew backe

Well quoth the Emperour, but your force nor your defence cannot auaile you any thing againſt <hi>Huon,</hi> nor againſt his men. But I ſhall ſhew you what yée ſhall doe, yée ſhall ſend quickly to <hi>Huon,</hi> and deſire him in my name to ceaſe ſlaying of my men, and that there may be a truce had betwéene him and me, for the ſpace of halfe a yéere, for within that time I hope to finde ſome other treatie that hee and I might be friendes: and if he refuſe this, then I ſee none other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die but that wée ſhall be all ſlaine or taken, and then he will cauſe me to die in ſome noyſome priſon. Sir (quoth his knights) we ſhall doe your commaundement, but we feare sore that we ſhall not be heard. Sirs quoth the Emperour, goe to him and doe the beſt yée can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4519:141"/>Then they returned to the battaile, whereas they founde their companie readie to flie away, for they were neere all ſlaine and taken, the Knights from the Emperour came to <hi>Huon,</hi> and deſired him in the name of the Emperour that he would ceaſe the battaile, and ſound the treatie, and they would do likewiſe in the ſame manner, and that there might be a firme truce betweene them for halfe a yeere, and in that ſeaſon they truſted that ſome good wayes would be found, that the Emperour and hee might be good friendes together. Sirs (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) if the Emperour your Maſter had mee in that danger which he is in, hee would not ſuffer me to ſcape aliue for all the gold in the world, howbeit, I am content that he haue truce for halfe a yeere, the which I ſhall ſurely kéepe on my part, and if I be aſſayled, I ſhall defend mee, and if ſo be that hee come to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to aſſayle mee, by the helpe of God and my good friendes, I ſhall doe the beſt that I can. But if he will haue peace with mee, and pardon mee his diſpleaſure, for the death of his nephewes, I ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to make peace, and I ſhall make amends for al wrongs, though I was not the beginner.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> cauſed the retrait to bee ſounded, and in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo did the Almaynes, who had thereof great ioy: it came to them at a good poynt, for elſe all had béene ſlaine or foyled. When he had the vpper hand, now that he purſued ſtill his chaſe, for then he might haue had an end of that warre, and neither ſhield nor ſpeare more broken, whereas after many a man was ſlaine, and was the cauſe that the Citie of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> was loſt, and the fayre <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> taken and ſet in priſon in the Citie of <hi>Mayens,</hi> and <hi>Huon</hi> ſuffered ſo much paine and trouble, that no mortall man can ſhewe it. Thus as you haue heard <hi>Huon</hi> granted the truce, and ſo both parts withdrew, whereof the Emperour and his companie were right ioyfull. Then <hi>Huon</hi> called his companie, and ſhewed <hi>Gerames</hi> and his Lords how he had graunted truce to the Emperour for halfe a yeere, and therefore I charge you all not to breake the peace: the Emperour was glad when hee
<pb facs="tcp:4519:142"/>
heard it, for he knew well hee had ſcaped a great daunger. Then he charged all his men on paine of death, that they ſhould not breake the truce. And Sirs (quoth he) I pray you make readie a litter that I may be carried to <hi>Coleyne,</hi> for the paine that I féele in my legges cauſeth all my bodie to tremble, and when I come there, I will tarrie till I bee whole. Sir (quoth his Lords) your commandement ſhal be done, then they layde the Emperour in a litter, ſore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning the loſſe and death of his nephewes and Lordes that were ſlaine, and his legge gréeued him ſore. Then <hi>Huon</hi> ſayd to <hi>Gerames,</hi> Sir thanked be God we haue vanquiſhed the Emperour, and ſlaine many of his men, therefore it is good that we returne now to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> I haue great deſire to ſée my wife <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> who thinking long for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, I am ſure ſhee is ſorrowfull that I haue tarried ſo long Sir (quoth <hi>Gerames</hi>) if ye haue great deſire to returne, ſo haue al other of your ſeruants, they would gladly ſee their wiues and children, and ſome would ſée their louers.</p>

ſaw them, he had great maruaile from whence they ſhould come ſo haſtily. Then he ſayd to his men: Sirs, I perceiue cléerely we be betrayed, for if I had pleaſed, the Emperour nor his men could not haue eſcaped, he hath falſely betrayed me, ſince vnder the colour of truce they come to ſet newly vpon me.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Huon</hi> ſayd by the Emperour without cauſe, for hée knew nothing thereof, nor that any ſuccour ſhould haue come to him. Sirs (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) let vs reſt here, and tarrie till they come néerer to vs, then let vs ſet on them with ſuch haſte, that they ſhall not know what to doe. Sir (quoth his men) haue no doubt, wee ſhall not faile you for feare of any death, we truſt to ſlay ſo many, that the earth ſhall bee couered with the dead bodies of your enemies. <hi>Huon</hi> ordered his battaile, and the Prouoſt of <hi>Coleyne</hi> comforted his men, ſaying: Sirs, our Emperour is diſcomfited by <hi>Huon</hi> and his companie, who be yonder abiding before vs, they thinke to depart in ſauegard, but they haue no power to doe ſo, for the moſt part of them are ſore hurt, and their horſes ſore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, wherefore they ſhall the ſooner be diſcomfited. Then the Prouoſt and his men ranne quickly vpon <hi>Huon</hi> and his men, there beganne a fierce battaile, wherein many a moſt valiaunt man lay on the earth dead, and at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie firſt brunt there were ſo many ſlaine, that the whole fielde was couered with dead and maimed men: ſome were ouerthrowne without any hurt at all, and yet they could neuer riſe, becauſe of the great preaſe of the horſes that did runne ouer them. <hi>Huon</hi> who was very full of ire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had thought that vnder the colour of truce he was aſſayled, he ranne fiercely at a knight, who had doone verie great hurt among his men, it was he that went to <hi>Coleyne</hi> for that ſuccour, and <hi>Huon</hi> ſtrake him cleane through the body with his Speare, ſo that he fell downe dead to the earth.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> cryed his crie to call his men together, hée layd on the right ſide and on the left, ſo that hee did cutte

of armes and legges, and raced their helmets from their heades, he ſéemed rather a man of the Fayrie then a mortall man. But he had much to doe, for his men who had fought all the day, were ſore trauayled and wearie, howbeit they defended them ſelues right valiantly, and ſlew ſo many of the Commons of <hi>Coleyn,</hi> that the bloud ran on the ground in great ſtreames, and the Emperour who iſſued out of the wood in his Lyttour, when he came into the field, he heard the brute and crie of the Battaile, wherewith he was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed.

Goe to him and command him that incontinent he goe to <hi>Huon,</hi> to make amendes for his treſpaſſe, and if he will not doe it, I charge you incontinently to ſlay him. When the Emperour had giuen his commaundement to one of his knights, he rode as faſt as he might to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prouoſt, who was right ſorrowfull, for that he had loſt foure thouſand of his Commons, &amp; the knight was ſlain that came to him.

Fayre Lady (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) thanked bee our Lord God I am in good health. Sir (quoth ſhee) of your comming I am right ioyous, and I deſire you to ſhew me of your aduentures. Madam (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) know for truth I haue béene at <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> whereas I found the Emperour, and with him Duke <hi>Raoull</hi> his nephew, who had proclaimed a tourney, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was aduertiſed of my comming, his intention was that if he had found me there, hee had concluded with his men to haue ſlaine mee, but by the grace of God I haue done ſo much, that in the preſence of the Emperour his vncle, and all them that were there preſent, I ſtrake off his head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he made his auaunt, that as ſoone as he had ſlaine me, he would haue had you to his wife, and all mine heritage.

               <p>Thus I departed from them, and went and lay all that night at <hi>Coleyne,</hi> whereas I found my men, whom I had left
<pb facs="tcp:4519:144"/>
there when I went to the Emperours Court all alone, the next day I departed, but I was not gone farre out of <hi>Coleyn,</hi> when the Emperour and tenne thouſand men mette me in the way, whereas they had lien in a little wood in waite for me. Then they ranne at me and at my men, there was a great battaile on both parts, and many ſlain and wounded: but I did ſo much by the grace of God &amp; my good company, that I ouercame them, and I ſlew two of his nephews, and I bare the Emperour to the earth, and when he ſaw that the loſſe of the battaile ranne on his ſide, he ſent to mee then a meſſenger to haue truce for halfe a yeere, the which I gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe I thought I had doone him diſpleaſure inough, as in ſlaying of thrée of his nephewes.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue at large heard here</hi> before, the manner and cauſe why this war was mooued, betweene the Emperour of Almaine and <hi>Huon</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the which after the Truce was expired, &amp; that the Emperour was hole of his thigh that <hi>Huon</hi> had broken: he publiſhed the war againe, and ſent ouer all his Empire, that euerie Duke, Earle, Baron, Knight and Squier ſhould come to him, and Souldiers from all parts, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Moneth they were to be at the Citie of <hi>Mayence,</hi> to the entent to make warre vppon <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement was publiſhed, and ſuch diligence was made, that by the day appointed, euerie man was come to the City of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and lodged in the Citie, and in Pauilions about the Citie: there were aſſembled more then fortie Thouſand, and all men well appointed for the warre. When this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour who was named <hi>Tirrey</hi> ſaw them, he was verie ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſore threatned <hi>Huon,</hi> and made promiſe to all his Barons that hee would neuer returne into his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, vntill hee had firſt ſlaine <hi>Huon,</hi> who hadde doone him ſo great damage.</p>
               <p>Then hee commaunded his Conſtables and Marſhals to be readie to depart the next day, &amp; to take the way towardes <hi>Coleyne</hi> with all his Artilerie and carriage, the which was done. The next day the Emperour entred into the feeld, &amp; ſo road towards <hi>Coleyne,</hi> and when the Emperor was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a League, then there met with him the old <hi>Sauarie</hi> his Brother: who was Father to Duke <hi>Raoul</hi> ſlaine by <hi>Huon.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4519:147"/>
when theſe two brethren met together, there was great ioy made betwéene them. But then Duke <hi>Sauary</hi> beganne to wéepe, and ſayd to his brother the Emperour. Sir of your comming I am right ioyfull: But when the pitious death of my deare beloued ſonne your nephew <hi>Raoull</hi> commeth to my minde, there is no member of me but for dolour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure trembleth, nor I can neuer haue perfect ioye at my heart, as long as he that hath done mee this diſpleaſure li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</p>
               <p>This Duke <hi>Sauary</hi> was a noble man, but betwéene him and his ſonne <hi>Raoull</hi> was great difference: for the Duke <hi>Raoull</hi> was the vntrueſt Traitor that euer liued: the which wickednes procéeded by the Ducheſſe his mother, who was daughter to <hi>Hurdowin</hi> of Fraunce, the moſt vntrueſt and falſeſt Traytour that as then liued in the world. When the Emperour heard his brother ſpeake, the teares fell from his eyes, and he embraced him &amp; ſayd. My right deare brother, your dolour much diſpleaſeth mee, for your dolour is mine, and thereof I will haue a part, and if ye haue much ioy, my part ſhall likewiſe be therein. But it is not poſſible for vs to haue him againe for whom we make this ſorrow.

Thus as you haue heard, the Emperour and Duke <hi>Sauary</hi> entred into the Citie of <hi>Coleyne,</hi> whereas they were receiued with great ioy, and ſo rode to the Pallayce, and there they ſupped. I will make no long rehearſall of the good chéere that they made there. Then after Supper they went to their reſt, and the next morning roſe and heard ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and tooke a ſop in wine, &amp; then departed out of <hi>Coleyne.</hi> It was a goodly hoaſt to behold, they and their carriage and their artillerie reached foure leagues of length.

                  </hi> was beſieged by the Emperour of the high Almaynes, and by his brother the Duke <hi>Sauary</hi> with a great number of men. Then <hi>Huon</hi> iſſued out, and when hee was paſt the port, hee made haſte, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſurpriſe his enemies, for at that time the Emperour was ſet at dinner. Then <hi>Huon</hi> and his companie all at once daſht in among the tents and Pauillions, and beate them down to the earth, ſo that they that were within were much abaſhed, for they thought verily that <hi>Huon</hi> durſt neuer haue iſſued out of the Citie againſt him and the great number that hee was of. <hi>Huon</hi> layd on round about him, ſo that who ſoeuer met with him, had no néede of a leches craft. Alſo the old <hi>Gerames</hi> did maruailes, and ſo did the Bourdeloies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a rich tent and Pauillion was beaten to the ground, and they within ſlaine and all to behewen, and <hi>Huon</hi> who was mounted on a good horſe, met a Knight of the Emperours houſe, and he gaue him ſuch a ſtroke with his ſword, that he cloue his head to the teeth, and then he ſtroke another, that his head, helme and all fell to the earth, they that ſawe that ſtroke were ſore abaſhed.</p>
               <p>The Emperours men aſſembled together by heapes, but by the mightie proweſſe of <hi>Huon,</hi> anon they were againe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:149"/>
for he was ſo doubted and feared, that none was ſo hardie to approach néere him. The crie and voyce mounted ſo high, that the Emperour who was at dinner, when hee heard them crie, he roſe from the table and demaunded what noyſe it was? Sir (quoth a knight) who was fledde and ſore hurt, know for truth that your enemie <hi>Huon</hi> is iſſued out of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and hath done ſo much hurt, that he hath ſlaine a quarter of your hoſte, and without that you doe reſcue your men verie ſhortly, your loſſe is like to be excéeding great, for I haue ſéene <hi>Huon</hi> your enemie mounted vppon your good horſe, whereon he doth great maruailes, for there is none that méeteth him but he is ſlaine, he is ſo cruell and hardie. When the Emperour heard the knight, he ſwet for diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and incontinent he armed him, and iſſued out of his tent, and mounted on his horſe, and found his men readie. Then he ſaw <hi>Huon</hi> mounted on his good horſe, whereon hee ſayd to his men. Sirs I require you at this time putte to your paines, that I may be reuenged on my enemie, who before my face yonder killeth my men, he is ſo valiant, that whomſoeuer he ſtriketh with a full ſtroke, is but dead, great domage it was when he ſlew my nephewes, whoſoeuer can deliuer him to me quicke or dead, ſhall be my friend for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and I will ſhew him that courteſie, that <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> who is ſo fayre, I ſhall giue her vnto him in marriage, and all the Court of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſuch as heard the promiſe, made them ready for the couetouſneſſe of that gift: But ſome haſted ſo much to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the Emperours will, that it was too late after for them to repent. It is an old ſaying, that an ill haſte is not good, ſome haſted ſo much, that afterwards bought it too déere, as you ſhall heare héere. After theſe wordes ſpoken by the Emperour, ſuch as deſired to accompliſh his will, ranne in altogether into the Battaile againſt the Burdeloyes, where was great ſlaughter made on both parts. <hi>Huon</hi> who had great deſire in his heart to ſlay his enemies, did ſo much by his proweſſe, that hee reculed his enemies to their tents,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:150"/>
and it had béene ill with them if Duke <hi>Sauary</hi> had not reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued them, he with his great proweſſe made them to recouer againe the fielde, and there was a ſore battaile on both the parts. The old <hi>Gerames</hi> that day ſlew many a man, but hée aduentured himſelfe ſo farre forth among his enemies, that his horſe was ſlaine vnder him, ſo that hee was conſtrained to fall to the earth, and then hee was taken and led to the Emperours tent, and great fetters clapt vpon his legges: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las that <hi>Huon</hi> had not knowne thereof, if he had, he ſhould not haue béene ledde away without great loſſe. But he was in the Battaile doing maruailes in armes, he held his ſword in his hand, tainted with bloud and braines of men that hee had ſlaine, there was none ſo hardie that durſt approach néere vnto him, he cryed ſtill <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to draw his men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and daſhed into the greateſt preaſe, and ſtrake on all parts, in ſuch wiſe, that his enemies ſtill gaue him place, for none durſt abide his ſtrokes.</p>
               <p>Now the preaſe was ſo great of the men of Duke <hi>Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> that he had great paine to breake in among them, hée fought ſo, that hee ſéemed rather a man of the Fayrie, or a Spirit, then a mortall man, euerie man had great maruaile of the proweſſe that hee and his companie ſhewed. Then came againſt him the old Duke <hi>Sauary,</hi> with a burning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be reuenged for the death of his ſonne <hi>Raoull.</hi> And <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> perceiued him well, and made ſuch haſte, that the Duke had no leyſure to giue the firſt ſtroke, for <hi>Huon</hi> gaue him ſuch a ſtroke with his ſword, that hee cutte a quarter of his ſhield cleane off, and the ſtroke glyded to the horſe necke by ſuch vertue, that it ſtrake off the horſe head cleane, ſo that thereby the Duke fell to the earth, and if he had not béene wel ſuccoured, he had béene ſlaine, but there came to him ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, that whether <hi>Huon</hi> would or not he was ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and mounted vpon a new horſe. When <hi>Huon</hi> ſawe that he was eſcaped, he called vpon our Lord God, and ſayd. Ah good Lord, if I tarrie héere long, I ſée well that my force ſhal but little profit me, for there be twentie againſt one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4519:150"/>Then hee called certaine of his Lordes that were about him, and ſayd. Sirs, I perceiue well our force cannot long endure, therefore it is better to depart betimes, then to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie too long. Sir (quoth they) as it ſhall pleaſe you, ſo then they turned them towardes <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> a ſoft pace, and <hi>Huon</hi> did as the ſhepheard doth goe behinde his ſhéepe, ſo went hée with his ſword in his hand, defending his companie from his enemies, right ſorrowfull and angrie for the loſſe that he had that day, for in the morning when he departed from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> hee had twentie thouſand of good fighting men, and at his returne he ſawe well that he had not aboue foure thouſand, wherewith he was ſore diſpleaſed, and oftentimes by the way turned and returned to his enemies. At laſt hee met with a Knight named <hi>Iozeram,</hi> and gaue him ſuch a ſtroke, that he fell downe dead to the earth, whereof the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Tyrrey</hi> was ſore diſpleaſed: for hee was his coſin germaine, and after that he ſlew foure other Knights of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</hi> Then he returned againe after his men, and ſo ledde them forth ſtill as the ſhepheard doth his ſheepe, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turned and returned vpon his enemies, ſo that there was none ſo hardie that durſt approach néere him.</p>
               <p>Therewith thither came the Emperour, richly armed with armes imperiall, and mounted vppon a puiſſant horſe. Then hee cryed, on forth my Barons, take héede that this traitour <hi>Huon</hi> ſcape not away, if I may haue him in my hands, all the gold in the world ſhall not redeeme him from hanging. <hi>Huon</hi> who heard the Emperour ſayd: Ah falſe olde dotard, thou lyeſt falſely, I was neuer traitour. Then the Emperour ranne at <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſtrake him on the ſhield, and ſtrake it cleane through, and the ſpeare brake all to péeces: but <hi>Huon</hi> with his ſword ſtrake the Emperour on the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, ſo that the circle ſette with ſtone and pearle was beaten to the earth, and if the horſe had not ſwarued, the Emperour had not ſcaped aliue: neuertheleſſe the ſtroke light ſo on his ſhoulder, that the ſword pierced the maile, &amp; gaue him a déep wound, &amp; further the ſword deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to the bow of the ſaddle,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:151"/>
ſo that the horſe was ſtroken nigh aſunder in two péeces, and ſo the Emperour and the horſe fell downe to the ground together, ſo that if he had not béene reſcued by the Almaines he had béene ſlaine. <hi>Huon</hi> was ſorie when he ſaw the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſo ſcaped with his life, then he turned and rode towards <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> after his men, who tarried ſtill for him, and <hi>Huon</hi> did ſo much by his proweſſe, that for all the Emperour and his men he entred into the Citie of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as then hee knew not that the olde <hi>Gerames</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner, ſo thus as you haue heard Duke <hi>Huon</hi> entred into <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> with foure thouſand men, of whom the moſt part were ſore hurt, then he rode to the Pallaice, and there alighted. Then he looked about him, and was ſore abaſhed when he ſaw not <hi>Gerames</hi> by him, then he demanded if any man knewe where hee was. Sir (quoth a Knight named <hi>Gallerance</hi>) know for truth that hee is taken priſoner, and is in the hands of your enemies, for to haue ayded him I was wounded in thrée places, and néere hand ſlaine, I employed my force to haue ſuccoured him, but I could finde no remedie. When <hi>Huon</hi> heard that, hee prayſed greatlie <hi>Gerames</hi> force and vertue, and greatly complained and ſaid. Alas that I had not knowne of his taking ere I returned, I would ſooner haue dyed, but that at the leaſt I would haue taken ſome man ſufficient to haue redéemed him againe out of danger. A lamentable thing it was to heare Duke <hi>Huon,</hi> what ſorrow hee made for his friend <hi>Gerames,</hi> but his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints could not auaile him, his Lords ſayd, Sir by the grace of God you ſhall haue him againe ſafe and aliue. Sirs quoth <hi>Huon,</hi> it ſhall be a great aduenture without they put him to death.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> mounted vp to the Pallaice, whereas he met <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> his wife, whom hee kiſſed and embraced manie times. Sir (quoth the Ladie) I pray you ſhew mee of your newes. Ladie (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) they be but poore and dolorous, for of twentie thouſand men that I had with me out of this Citie, I haue brought home aliue but foure thouſand, and
<pb facs="tcp:4519:151"/>
yet the moſt part of them before wounded, and beſide, the old <hi>Gerames</hi> is taken priſoner, who hath ſuffered before this time ſo many paines and trauailes for my ſake. Alas Sir quoth the Ladie ſore wéeping, I had rather you had beléeued me, and that you had gone and ſought for ſuccour of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who would not haue fayled you, but would haue come with you with ſo much people and puiſſance, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſhould not haue durſt to haue abiden you. Madame (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) ſpeake no more thereof, for the loſſe of as much as tenne Cities be in value, I would not haue gone thither, nor to none other part for any ſuccour, nor yet will not, till that I ſée mée more oppreſſed then I am as yet, I might well be reputed for a coward and recreaunt, thus to abandon my Citie, I had rather be diſmembred into pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then for feare I ſhould leaue you, it would be greatlie to my reproch in the Courts of hie Princes, and when I come there, to be marked with the finger for that great default. Sir (quoth <hi>Eſcleremond</hi>) your pleaſure is mine, ſince that you wil haue it ſo, but I am right ſorrowful for the old <hi>Gerames,</hi> who is priſoner in the tents of your enemies, who hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for your ſake many great pains and pouerties, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but ſory when I remember him.

that I depart out of this world. Then the Emperour called vnto him a Knight, and ſaid: Sir <hi>Othon,</hi> I will that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent you take three Thouſand men, and take theſe Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and hang them vp all vppon the Gallowes that were made yeſter-night late, and if it bee ſo that <hi>Huon</hi> yſſue out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looke that you quit your ſelfe valiantly, and if you haue néed of any ayd, take my horne and blow it, for I haue ready ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ten Thouſand men to ſuccour you if need bée.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Othon</hi> heard the Emperour, hee was right ſorrie to haue that euill office, for in his youth hée was brought vp in the houſe of Duke <hi>Seuin</hi> Father to <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſomewhat he was of his kin, but as then hee had ſlaine a man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fled from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and came and ſerued the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at <hi>Mayence,</hi> wherefore he was right ſorrowfull to haue that Commiſſion: then hee ſayd vnto the Emperour. Sir, mée thinkes you doe ill to cauſe them to die ſo haſtily, better it were to abide to ſée what end your warre will come vnto, and alſo if it fortune that any of your Lords to be taken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, for one of them you might recouer him againe, and if you ſlay them, then if any of your Barons happen to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they ſhall die of like death: and therefore Sir, if you wil beléeue me, you ſhall forbeare ſlaying them at this time, and Sir, if you will giue me licence, I will doe ſo much to Duke <hi>Huon,</hi> that for the offence that he hath done vnto you, hee ſhall make you amends at your owne pleaſure, and hee ſhall goe vnto ſome holy Pilgrimage, to pray for the Soules of your Nephews, and other of your lords that he hath ſlain, and he to haue with him two Hundred men in their ſhirtes, and ſo to goe to the holy Sepulchre at his owne charge and coſte, and hee to hould of you all his Landes, and to doe you homage.</p>
               <p>Then the Lordes that were there preſent, all with one voice ſayd vnto the Emperour: Sir, the counſaile that ſir <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi> hath giuen vnto you, is worthy to bee beleeued, wée all agree thereto, and deſire you ſo to doe, but when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour heard them, he was ſorowfull and ſore diſpleaſed.

(quoth <hi>Othon</hi>) you may ſurely know, if you hang any of them that be taken, if <hi>Huon</hi> happen to take any of your men, hee ſhall neuer eſcape vnhanged and drawne.

               <p>
                  <hi>Gerames</hi> went before with the haulter about his necke ſore weeping, and all his companie after him, ſo that at the laſte they came to the place of execution, where the Ladders were ſet vp, and then the hang-man came vnto <hi>Gerames</hi> and ſaid: Come on thou old Dotard, thou haſt liued long inough, thou ſhalt no more ſee him whome thou loueſt ſo well, and I hope ſhortly he ſhal beare thée company wauing in the wind. When <hi>Gerames</hi> heard him, he beheld him fiercely and ſayd: Ah thou vnhappie Villaine, if one of my handes were looſe, thou ſhouldeſt neuer ſée faire day more, how art thou ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to ſay or to thinke ſo villainous a worde, of the beſt and

moſt valiantſt Knight now liuing? Then <hi>Othon</hi> came to them, and hearing the hangman how hee reuiled <hi>Gerames,</hi> he ſayd. Ah thou baſe ſlaue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinkſt thou not that this knight hath not inough to ſuffer though thou doſt not reuile him? if thou thy ſelfe were in that caſe that they be in, and they in the citie of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> thou wouldeſt ſoone repent thy ſaucie words, and therewith hee lift vp a ſtaffe that he had in his hand, and ſtrake the hangman therewith, that he fell down to the earth: then hee ſayd. Ah thou falſe theefe, doe thine office and ſpeake no words: whereupon the hangman durſt ſpeake no more, but then he tooke <hi>Gerames</hi> by the halter that was about his necke, and ſo mounted vpon the ladder and <hi>Gerames</hi> after him, who made pittious complaints for <hi>Huon</hi> his good Lord.</p>
               <p>The ſame time that <hi>Gerames</hi> mounted vpon the firſt ſtep of the ladder, they within the Citie vpon the walles percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, and ſaw euidently, that without the priſoners were ſpéedily reſcued, their liues were loſt, then they ſaid to <hi>Huon.</hi> Sir, if you tarrie any longer, your men ſhall be all hanged, for yonder wée ſée one of them is mounted on the ladder, who hath a beard as white as the ſnow. When <hi>Huon</hi> heard that, he was ſore diſpleaſed, and ſayd. Ah good Lord, I know ſurely that it is my true friend <hi>Gerames,</hi> whom they would firſt put to death, therefore Sirs, I require you quickly let vs iſſue out at the gate, for if <hi>Gerames</hi> bee not preſently ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, the Traitours will putte him to death, but if that I may come time inough, his perill ſhall bee dearely ſolde to them. Hereupon <hi>Huon</hi> with ſeuen thouſand fighting men, iſſued out at the gate ſo fiercely, that the earth ſeemed to groane vnder them, their horſes made ſuch a thundering, and ſo within a ſhort ſpare (by a ſecret way) they came to the place whereas the gallowes ſtood. <hi>Huon</hi> was the firſt that arriued there, and he marked well the hangman that ſhould haue hanged <hi>Gerames,</hi> and gaue him ſuch a ſtroke with his ſpeare, that he ranne him through, ſo that hee fell from the ladder dead, ſo was <hi>Gerames</hi> reuenged of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iniury
<pb facs="tcp:4519:155"/>
that hee had done to him before: then <hi>Huon</hi> ſaide, <hi>Gerames</hi> come downe of the Ladder, and arme you in ſome armour of them that ſhall bée heere ſlaine. <hi>Gerames</hi> thanked our Lord God, and came downe the ladder, and then thether came <hi>Huons</hi> companie, who vntyed all the other Priſoners: then began a ſore Battaile, the <hi>Almaines</hi> would not fly, the which <hi>Huon</hi> ſéeing, cried to them and ſaid: Yée falſe Traytours, your deaths are iudged, deare ſhalbe ſould to you the offence that yée haue done vnto mee, when yée would ſlay thus my men with ſo villainous a death, better it had béen for you to haue been at <hi>Mayence,</hi> hidden in the laps of your Mothers and Louers.</p>
               <p>When they vnderſtood <hi>Huon,</hi> anon they knew him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were ſore abaſhed, then <hi>Huon</hi> met with a Knight of <hi>Almayne,</hi> and ran him cleane through, and ſo hée ſerued thrée other, then he drew his ſword wherewith he did great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes, for ere he ceaſed, he ſlew fourteene, and alſo his men did maruailes in armes, ſo that within a ſhort ſpace the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> were diſcomfited, ſo that none eſcaped away aliue, except Sir <hi>Othon,</hi> who valiantly defended himſelfe. But when he ſaw that his force would not helpe him, hée yéelded himſelfe to <hi>Huon,</hi> and gaue him his ſword, and cryed him mercie, and ſayd. Sir, I beſéech you ſlay me not, but haue pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie on me, and I promiſe you faithfully, that againſt my wil I came hither, but I was forced ſo to doe by the Emperour, and firſt I deſired reſpite. Inſomuch that the Emperor was ſore diſpleaſed with me, I intreated for a peace to haue been made betwéene you and him, but my words could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. Sir I am your kinſman, &amp; was brought vp in Duke <hi>Seuin</hi> your fathers houſe, and there I ſerued a maiſter who did beate mee, and when I felt my ſelfe ſtrong and of age, I was diſpleaſed that he did beate me ſo without a cauſe, &amp; I ſlew him &amp; fled away, and came to <hi>Mayens,</hi> and euer ſince I haue ſerued the Emperour, who is come hither to beſiege you. Friend (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) feare not your death, but I pray you from hence forth ayde and ſerue mee, as ye ought to doe
<pb facs="tcp:4519:155"/>
to your louing friend. Sir quoth <hi>Othon,</hi> God ſhame mee if I doe the contrarie, but I ſhall ſerue you truely as long as life is in my body.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> came to the foote of the ladder, whereas hee found <hi>Gerames</hi> as then not vntied, <hi>Huon</hi> embraced and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him often times, and ſayd. Right déere friend, I am right glad at my heart when I ſee you whole of body, and then hee went to the other and loſed them, and vnbound their eyes, and ſayd. Sirs arme your ſelues with the harneſſe of them that bee dead, for a man that is armed hath the aduantage of others that bee not armed. It was néedfull for them to be armed, God defend them from euill, for anon after they had ſo maruailous a reencounter, that they had neuer the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the other tenne thouſand men came to reuenge them that were dead, they hoped to haue come time inough, but they fayled, for they came too late, <hi>Huon</hi> had taken of al them their truage. When <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw that he had done that which he came for, he returned him towardes the Citie, but he was ſo purſued, that he was neere ſurpriſed and ſtopped from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Citie. When <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw his enemies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, he cryed aloude to his men, ſaying. Sirs, let vs turne vpon them that come toward vs, to the intent that they ſhall not make their auaunts, that they haue cauſed vs to flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before them: then hee and all his men turned againſt their enemies with a moſt valiaunt courage, and at that méeting many ſpeares were broken on both parts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a knight borne to the earth, that had neuer the power af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reléeue themſelues, there was ſuch a ſlaughter on both parts, that it was pittie to ſée them. And great maruaile it was to ſee <hi>Huon,</hi> how he beate downe his enemies, &amp; claue helmets, and raſed them from the heads of his enemies: hee dealt in ſuch wiſe, that no Almaine durſt abide his ſtrokes he was ſo doubted and feared, hee made the thicke preaſe to breake a ſunder, and flie away before him, and by him was Sir <hi>Othon,</hi> who that day did many a noble deed of armes, for next <hi>Huon</hi> (aboue all other that day) hee bore the price.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4519:156"/>Finally, <hi>Huon</hi> and <hi>Othon</hi> and his other men did ſo much, that the <hi>Almaines</hi> were chaced to their Tentes, and many ſlaine in the chace and ſore hurt, ſo that they neuer road vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon horſe-backe after.

                  </gap> then thirtie Thouſand <hi>Almaines</hi> as faſt as they can: ſo when <hi>Huons</hi> company ſaw them, they doubted greatly, and not without cauſe, for they had beene before at two great ſkirmiſhes, whereby they and their horſes were wearie and ſore trauailed, the which was no maruaile, ſo by the counſaile of <hi>Huon,</hi> they returned a falſe gallop toward their Citie, and the <hi>Almaines</hi> were at their backe, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them ſo quickly, that more then fiue Hundred <hi>Almaines</hi> entred into the Citie with them of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> But they that kept the gates that day were wiſe and diſcreet, for as ſoone as they perceiued that <hi>Huon</hi> and his company were entred, and with them about fiue Hundred of their enemies: they woulde keepe their gates no longer open, for feare that their enemies ſhould haue entred with too great a number, ſo that for haſt they cut aſunder the cord y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> held vp the Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Then they returned to their Tents, complaining for the great loſſe and damage that they had ſuſtained that day, by

the high proweſſe of <hi>Huon</hi> and his men, and alſo they that were entred into the Citie were ſore abaſhed, when they ſawe themſelues encloaſed within the Citie. When <hi>Huon</hi> perceiued it, he had great maruaile, that they were ſo entred in among his men, for he knew not thereof, and yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was the laſte that entred, then hee ſayde.

So when they were returned, the Emperour demaunded what tydings, and how they had ſpedde, and if they had not taken <hi>Huon</hi> quicke or dead.

and deſtroyed. Sir (quoth they) ſéeing it is your pleaſure, yée may do as you thinke beſt. Sirs, (quoth the Emperour) I will that yée aſſemble all mine hoaſt, and ſend to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hée bring all his men, &amp; then with all our puiſſance we will aſſaile the Citie, and that none be ſo hardie as to recule back vntill the Citie be taken: this was proclaymed through the Hoaſt, and euery man was readie to aſſaile the Citie, and the cheefe Captaine was Duke <hi>Sauary,</hi> who brought all his men in good order to the dikes, well fourni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ladders and other neceſſarie things pertaining to aſſault.</p>
               <p>The ſame time <hi>Huon</hi> and his men were vnarmed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dinner, but when he heard the noiſe and crie without, he tooke a ſop in wine, and armed him &amp; all his men, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man went to the walles to their defence, and <hi>Huon</hi> &amp; old <hi>Gerames, Othon,</hi> and <hi>Barnard</hi> a valiant knight mounted on the towre ouer the gate, and the <hi>Almaines</hi> on euery part entred into the dikes, and rayſed vp many a ſcaling ladder to the walles, but they within caſt them downe, ſo that they had no power to riſe vp againe, for there was caſt downe vpon them earth, timber and ſtones. Fierce was the aſſault that the <hi>Almaines</hi> made, &amp; they within made noble defence, for <hi>Huon</hi> and <hi>Gerames</hi> ſhot ſo with their croſbowes, thar at euery ſhoote they ſlew ſome man or ſore wounded him, and long endured this aſſault, ſo that finally the <hi>Almaines</hi> were conſtrained to recule backe a bow ſhoote, whereof they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were very ioyfull.</p>
               <p>Then the Emperour <hi>Tirrey</hi> being ſorrowfull and full of rage, came to his men, and rebuked them ſhamefully, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding them that incontinent they ſhould returne again to aſſaile y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie, ſaying that they ſhould not faile to winne it. Then the <hi>Almaines</hi> (to pleaſe their Lord) retourned in great haſt with their ladders &amp; pikes, and came into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dikes whereas then there was no water, &amp; rayſed them vp to the walles: but they were no ſooner vp, but they within beat them downe againe, and put them in danger of their liues,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:158"/>
for they caſt downe Timber, ſtones, and faggots, with fire and hoat oyle and lead vppon them, ſo that the aſſailants were faine perforce to recoile backe, and they within ſhot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes ſo thicke, that it ſeemed like ſnowe. The Emperour was ſore diſpleaſed and Duke <hi>Sauary,</hi> when they ſaw none other remedie, many were ſlaine and ſore hurt, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and <hi>Sauary</hi> his Brother ſeeing that they could nothing profite, ſounded the retrait, and ſo returned to their Tents, ſore diſpleaſed for their great loſſe that they had, for they loſt that day more then two Thouſand men, lyinge dead in the feeld and in the Dikes, and more then thrée Thouſand ſore hurt.</p>
               <p>Then Duke <hi>Sauary</hi> ſayd to the Emperor: Sir, me thinks it is but folly to aſſaile this Citie, it is ſtrong, and well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with men and good Knightes to defend it, wherefore we may well perceiue, that without great damage we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not winne it, without it be by famine, for hee that is Lorde thereof is hardy and cruell, and to be feared and doubted, for he is expert in armes, wherefore it is impoſſible to take the Citie perforce. When the Emperour vnderſtoode him, hee was right ſorrowfull, and made againe newe promiſe, not to depart thence, vntill hee had <hi>Huon</hi> at his pleaſure. <hi>Huon,</hi> who little ſet by the threatnings of the Emperour, went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Pallaice, and ſaid to his men: Sirs, we ought great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thanke God for the defence of our Citie, many <hi>Almains</hi>

Thus <hi>Huon</hi> and his men deuiſed together, howbeit, they were ſore greeued, for at the beginning they were about twentie Thouſand men, &amp; then they were not aboue ſix Thouſand.

Now of their comming by the way I make no mention, but ſo long they trauailed, that they came within a League of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and when the Emperour knew thereof, he had great ioy, and mounted on his horſe with other Lords with him, and road &amp; met them, and ſpake to them and made them good cheere. Thus his force encreaſed, &amp; <hi>Huons</hi> diminiſhed daily, often times <hi>Huon</hi> iſſued out vpon his horſe called <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phage,</hi> &amp; made daily many great Skirmiſhes, ſometime hée wan, and ſometime hee loſt, he ſlew many <hi>Almaines,</hi> ſo that they all feared him, for there was none that durſt abide him, his horſe was ſo cruell, that none durſt approach néere him without he were ſlaine, &amp; <hi>Huons</hi> men quit them valiantly, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they loſt at one time, they wan iij. times for it: but their force could not long endure, for their enemies were ſo many &amp; they ſo few, &amp; they had made ſo many iſſues, that they had loſt many of their company, for of xx.M. they were left but v.C. men, wherof <hi>Huon</hi> was ſorowfull. Now when he ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had but v.C. men, he called to him <hi>Gerames, Othon, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> &amp; <hi>Richard,</hi> ſaying.

Sir, (quoth they) wee thinke your aduiſe right good, and it were good to knowe if hee will agrée thereto or not. Then <hi>Huon</hi> called <hi>Habourey</hi> his Meſſenger, and commaunded him that incontinent he ſhould goe to the Emperour, and ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: that if it bee his pleaſure to heare ſpeaking of any peace, I ſhall (quoth he) condeſcend therto, and to make him amends at his pleaſure, for the wronge and damage that I haue done vnto him and his men. Alſo ſhew him, how that I will become his man, and doe him homage for all the Landes that I haue, the which I was woont to hould of the King of Fraunce: but ſéeing I haue no ſuccour from him, I am driuen perforce to purchaſe for my profit in ſome other place.

               <p>The almightie God, who on the Croſſe dyed to ſaue all humane kinde, kéepe and defend from all ill the Emperour &amp; all his Barony: Sir, Duke <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> ſendeth to you ſalutation and good amitie, requiring you in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of god, that he may haue peace with you, by that hee will become your liege-man, and doe you homage and hould his Landes of you, and will deliuer quite the fiue Hundred men of yours that he hath in priſon in the Citie, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, hee offereth himſelfe and a Hundred Knights to paſſe the Sea this next Lent, and to goe to the holy Sepulchre, to pray to our Lord God for the ſoules of your Nephewes that

When the Emperour <hi>Tyrrey</hi> had wel heard <hi>Habourey</hi> the meſſenger, he became as red as a brand of fire, and regarded the meſſenger fiercely, and ſayd. Auoyd my ſight thou falſe varlet, but that I doubt to be reprooued, I ſhould cauſe thée to be hewen in peeces, but a meſſenger ought not to be touched for any words that hee can ſpeake, but ſay to thy Lord, that by him and by his meanes I haue loſt more then twentie thouſand men, beſide my thrée Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes &amp; my yonger brother, but by the Lord that died on the Croſſe to redeeme vs all, I will neuer haue peace with him, till I haue him at my pleaſure, nor neuer returne thou againe hither to mee, nor none other, vpon any ſuch meſſage.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Habourey</hi> the meſſenger heard the Emperour, hee was in great feare, and would gladly haue béen in <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> then he departed without any more ſpeaking, and reſted not till hee came to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where hee went to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, wheras he found Duke <hi>Huon,</hi> then he ſayd.

Then hee mounted vppon his good horſe, and he opened the gate, and yſſued out as priuily as hée might, and tooke the way to the meadow and came thether: and <hi>Huon</hi> then cried and ſayde. Ah ye Villaines this paſturage is mine, I come to challeng it, in an euill houre yee put your beaſts heere to paſture, yee ſhall make me amends, for all the beaſts that I find héere in my paſture, I will goe and pound them, and if the Emperor will haue them, hee muſt buy them and make amendes for their forfaite, and yee that bee the Keepers ſhall dearely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide it.</p>
               <p>When the kéepers heard <hi>Huon</hi> ſpeake, they had great feare, and they thought to haue gone and taken their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſo to haue defended themſelues: but <hi>Huon</hi> and his companie gaue them no leyſure ſo to doe, for <hi>Huon</hi> with his ſpeare ſtrake one ſtarke dead, and after he ſlew the ſecond, then the third, and fourth, and ſo ſlew very many as long as his Speare held: then hée ſet his hand on his ſword, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he claue aſunder healmets and ſheelds, and beat down men on euerie ſide, and <hi>Gerames, Othon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Richard</hi> did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie valiantly, and ſo much did <hi>Huon</hi> and his men within a ſhort ſpace, that the twoo Hundred men that kept the beaſts were all ſlaine, except one who eſcaped, and ranne to the Emperours hoaſt, where he ſhewed the Emperour, how <hi>Huon</hi> and his men were iſſued out of the Citie and that all the kéepers of the beaſtes were ſlaine, and the beaſts taken and driuen into the Citie.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> heard the Pilate, hee beganne to weepe and complaine for his wife and his deere daughter, whome he had left in the citie of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in great daunger to be taken. For he ſaw well then, that hee could not returne for the ſpace of a whole yeere with any ſuccour: howbeit, hee left not his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, then hee commaunded his ſeruaunts to diſcharge all his baggage and victualles out of the one ſhippe into the other, and when the newe ſhippe with the newe Patron was readye in all things, <hi>Huon</hi> entred into it. Then the new Patron deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the old marriner, the cauſe why they came thither, and from whence they came. Sir, quoth hee, true it is, wee came from the citie of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the which ſtandeth vpon a notable riuer, and when we were entred into the ſea, a ſore winde roſe vpon vs, in ſuch wiſe, that wee were conſtrained to abandon our ſhippe to the winde and weather, and fortune of the ſea, the which hath brought vs hither.

When <hi>Huon</hi> vnderſtood the cauſe of their comming thither, he was right ſorrowfull, and ſore diſpleaſed if he could haue amended it. But his diſpleaſure could not helpe him, but rather hinder him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he lette it paſſe, and ſo tooke leaue of his firſt Patron, and lift vp their anthors and ſayles, and when they

               <p>But ere that they came there, they ſuffered much paine, for there aroſe vppon them ſuch a winde and tempeſt, that they were forced to auayle their ſayles.

They were in this torment for the ſpace of ten dayes, in all the which time they neuer ſawe the cleereneſſe of the ſunne, for the great darkeneſſe that was there as then, the which did verie greatly annoy them.

Thus <hi>Huon</hi> complained, ſayling in the Sea in feare of his life, and thus they were in the daunger of this Gulfe fiue weekes, and neuer coulde ſee lande, whereof they were in great feare, often times they prayed to our Lord to haue pity of them.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> deſired the Patrone to mount vp to the Maſt, to ſee if he might ſee any land, and the Patrone who great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired ſo to doe, anone hee mounted vp, and regarded on all parts, to ſee if hee might eſpy any land. At laſt he ſaw a farre off an hye rocke, and on the height thereof they ſawe a thicke wood, and at the entrie of the wood hee ſawe a little houſe, whereof hee thanked God, and deſcended downe and ſhewed <hi>Huon</hi> what hee had ſeene, and ſayd. Sir, yonder a farre off I haue ſeen a great Rocke, and on the height there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a great thicke wood, and therein I haue ſéene a little houſe or hermitage, the houſe is white, I cannot tell what it is, but by the grace of God ere it be night, wee ſhall land there and refreſh our ſelues. When <hi>Huon</hi> heard that, hee was right ioyfull and thanked God: then they drew to that Port, and had good wind and a freſh, wéening to haue come thether the ſame night: but they ſayled foure daies and foure nights, and could come no neerer to the wood then they were before, whereof they had maruaile, for it ſeemed to them euer, that the wood and the houſe roaſe vp higher and higher, and then they could not tell whether they went, for if they had known, they would not haue gone thether for al the gold in the world, for if God had not had pitie of them, they were all likely to haue beene loſt, for the place that they ſawe a farre of was a Caſtle, and therein cloaſed the Rocke of the <hi>Adamant</hi>: the which Caſtle was dangerous to approach, for if any Ship

come neere it, and haue any yron nayles within it, and that a ſhippe come but within the ſight thereof, the <hi>Adamant</hi> will draw the Shippe vnto him. And therefore in thoſe parts the Shippes that ſayleth by that Sea, are made and pinned with woodden nayles, and without any manner of yron, otherwiſe they be loſt and periſhed, for the propertie of the <hi>Adamant</hi> is to draw yron to him.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Huon</hi> and his company were there the ſpace of ſixe dayes, going and ſayling about the Rocke of the Caſtle of the <hi>Adamant</hi>: But if they had had a good wind the firſt day, they had arriued euen at the white houſe that they ſaw firſt in the wood, the which was the faireſt and moſt richeſt houſe in the world, within the which was ſo much gould and riches, that no man liuing could eſteeme the value thereof, for the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars within that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alſo hee looked about him and behelde the Caſtle, the which was ſo faire and rich, that there was none ſuch throughout all the world. Then hee thought to ſend thether one of his companie, for to know what people were within the Caſtle, but hee ſawe well that there was no way to enter, but by a ſtraight way of thrée Hundred and fourſcore gréeces of height, the way was ſo ſtraight and narrow, that no man but one at once coulde mount vp the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, he had great maruell &amp; was ſore troubled in mind, when hee ſawe no man comming from the Caſtle.

Alas, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) nowe I ſée we be all but dead, for wee haue nothing to eat nor drinke, wherefore wee ſhall die for famine and rage.

liue foure dayes longer. After that hee had made this pitifull complaint, hee beheld the thrée Knights, who rendred vp their ſoules and died through hunger. The pitifull complaints that then he made was pitie to heare, he had no hope to be aided by any mortall man, wherefore he knew ſurely that hee could not liue aboue twoo dayes longer. Then all weeping, hee went from his Knightes that lay there dead, and went to the board of his ſhippe, and looked into the Sea to ſee if hee might eſpie any manner of Shippe comming thether. For hee thought that if any ſhippe came thether of the Sarazins, hee woulde haue ſome victuals or elſe to dye in the quarrell. Thus <hi>Huon</hi> was there alone without any company, ſore weeping and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dead through famine.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> ſawe that no manner of ſhippe was comming thether, hee was right ſorrowfull. Then hee turned him and regarded the Caſtle, the which ſeemed vnto him maruailouſly faire and great, and ſayd. Ah good Lord, how can it be that this faire and rich Caſtle ſhould bee voyd without man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? I haue great maruaile of that ſir <hi>Arnold</hi> ſhewed mee, for he ſhewed me that within the Caſtle there was neither man nor woman, and howe that there ſhould bee a great Serpent, I cannot tell whether it be true or not, or whether hee ſpake it for feare, but by the grace of God (though I ſhall die in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell) I will knowe the troth, for I were as good to die by the horrible Serpent, as to die for hunger. Then hee tooke his good Sword, and put on his helmet, and tooke his ſheeld, and did ſo much with going from ſhippe to ſhippe, vntill hee came to the gate of the land. And then with much paine hee moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp the degrees, and ſo came to the Caſtle, and then he ſat downe and reſted him, and beheld the faire Caſtle, he thought that he neuer ſaw none ſuch before, for the wals and Towers were of fine Alablaſter cleare ſhining, and the Towers richly couered with fine goulde of <hi>Arabia</hi>: when the Sunne caſt his rayes and ſpheares thereuppon, it caſt ſo great a light, that it gaue light a farre off, and when hee had longe beheld it at his pleaſure, hee ſawe the gate the which was faire and rich, that great beautie was to beholde it: for the twoo leaues of the gate
<pb facs="tcp:4519:175"/>
were couered with fine goulde, intermedled with other rich ouerages.</p>
               <p>And on his right ſide he ſaw by the gate a window, and ouer the ſame there was written in Letters of gould, ſaying: <hi>Let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man beware how he entreth into this Caſtle, without hee bee the worthyeſt Knight of all other, or elſe it were folly to aſſay it. For he ſhall find there ſuch aduentures, as if his bodie were harder then a ſtethye of ſteele, yet hee ſhould be but dead and loſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hee bee of that puiſſance, to reſiſte againſte the great Serpent and vanquiſhe him, many men haue aſſayled, that neuer coulde ſpeed, and he that will enter into the Caſtle, behold a little purſe that hangeth on the right hand of the gate, where he ſhall find the key for to open the gate.</hi> When <hi>Huon</hi> had read the writing, hee began ſore to muſe in himſelfe, and ſaid: Good Lord, ſince thou haſt ſaued mee from ſo many perils in time paſt, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly require thee at this time to ayde and ſuccour mee: and to giue me that grace, that I may vanquiſh this horrible Serpent and bring him to the death, for I had rather die in fighting like a valiant knight, then to die for famine.

               <p>Then hee aduaunced him to the Serpent, and gaue him a great ſtroake vppon the haunch behinde, and if hée did but little with his firſt ſtroake, hee did leſſe hurt with that ſtroake, for hee could in no wiſe cut through the Serpents ſkinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was in great feare: and the Serpent when he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtriken caſt his tayle rounde about <hi>Huon</hi> with ſuch force, that hee ouerthrew <hi>Huon</hi> to the earth, yet hee quickly releeued againe. Then he ſaw by the gate a great ſquare Speare with a ſharpe broad head, and then hee put vp his Sword, and tooke the Speare in both his handes, and came with all his force and ſtrength againſt the Serpent, who came and encountred him with open mouth to haue ſwallowed <hi>Huon</hi>

Thus the horible Serpent was ſlaine. When <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw that hee was dead, hee kneeled downe and lift vp his hands to heauen, thanking our Lord God for his grace.

But finally the loſſe fell vpon them, for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and all his men were readie, when <hi>Gerames</hi> ſawe howe
<pb facs="tcp:4519:180"/>
all the hoaſt was mooued, then he ſayd to his companie. Sirs, it is time for vs to retyre backe, for we may tarrie héere too long, yonder commeth the Emperour with a mightie armie to cloſe vs in, it is needfull for vs to make haſte, that wee may goe away in ſafetie. Then altogether in one companie they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and went the way towards <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> But they had not gone farre, ere that they were ouertaken by the Almaynes, &amp; they layd on on all parts with their ſwords &amp; ſpeares. Then <hi>Gerames</hi> turned him to an Almaine, and with his ſpeare ran him cleane through, and in drawing out his ſpeare, hee fell downe dead to the earth, and then he ſtrake another, whome alſo he ſlew. He did ſuch déedes of armes, that ere his ſpeare brake, hee ſlewe fiue of his enemies, whereof the Almaynes were ſore abaſhed. He brake the preaſe in ſuch wiſe, that none durſt approach néere vnto him, right well did <hi>Othon</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> and ſuch as were with him. But when the Duke <hi>Sauary,</hi> who with tenne thouſand men lay in ambuſhment néere vnto the Citie, had heard the greate noyſe and crie, hee ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they within the Citie were iſſued out. When <hi>Gerames</hi> and his companie ſawe howe they were incloſed both before and behinde, they were ſore abaſhed.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Gerames</hi> ſawe that their force and powers could not auayle them, but that either they muſt bee taken or ſlaine, then earneſtly he called vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, requiring him to ſaue and defend his good Lord <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and the Ducheſſe <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> his wife. And he cryed to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie &amp; ſayd. Sirs, I pray you hartily at this time ſhew forth your Proweſſe, and behaue your ſelues ſo valiantly, that this Emperour &amp; Almaines haue no cauſe to make their auaunts, that they haue found vs as men amazed, but let vs ſhew them how our ſwords can cut. Then all together they aſſayled their enemies in ſuch wiſe, that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt brunt the Almaines were conſtrayned to retyre backe, and <hi>Gerames</hi> did ſuch déeds, that none durſt approach néere vnto him. Then the Duke <hi>Sauary</hi> with ten thouſand men came vpon them ſodainely, the which was no equall part, and alſo the Emperour with his great battaile came alſo vpon old <hi>Gerames</hi> and his companie, who
<pb facs="tcp:4519:181"/>
had gotten themſelues into the ſubburbs of the Citie, and a mightie wall behind them at theyr backes, whereas they did ſtand at a bay againſt the Almaines. <hi>Gerames</hi> was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of them, and vnderneath his helmet appeared his long white beard, and the Emperour who had great ſhame, that ſo few men in number ſhould kéepe a baye againſt his highneſſe, and doe vnto his men ſo great damage, he perceiued where the old <hi>Gerames</hi> was, who had oftentimes ſlaine many of his men, and done him ſo mightie damages, that hee thought hee could neuer be reuenged thereof ſufficiently, and thought that if hee ſhould haue ſcaped then aliue, that hee would doe him much more hurt and damage after, and ſayd to himſelfe, that hee had rather die incontinent, then he ſhould not as then bee reuenged on him, and therewith incontinent he couched his Speare and ran at old <hi>Gerames</hi> on the one ſide ere he was aware, ſo that the Emperour ranne him cleane through the bodie, ſo that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knight <hi>Gerames</hi> fell to the earth, and died incontinent: great damage fell that day to <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for he loſt the trueſt and beſt friend that he had. Alas for that pitious iourney that fell that day to them of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> They had good cauſe for to wéepe, alas good Ducheſſe <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> what loſſe haue yee receiued, to looſe him, who was your cheefe comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, ye might haue called him more then father. Ah right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ladie, there neuer came to you a greater miſchiefe, then ye haue by the death of <hi>Gerames,</hi> who lieth dead euen now among the enemies.</p>
               <p>When the Almaines ſawe that <hi>Gerames</hi> was dead, then they fought ſo, that within a ſhort ſpace all them of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> were ſlaine, and not one ſcaped aliue, except <hi>Barnard,</hi> who was on the puiſſant horſe <hi>Amphage</hi>: for the gambaudes and worke that he made, not an Almaine durſt approach neere him, for <hi>Bernard</hi> next vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> was the moſt valiaunt knight of his body, that was as then liuing, for when the Almaines ſawe him vpon that horſe, they chaſed him no further, but they went to theyr tents, and <hi>Bernard</hi> ceaſed not till hee came vnto the gate of the Citie, the which was opened, when hee was entred, and the gate cloſed againe, the Burgeſſes and comunaltie ſaw
<pb facs="tcp:4519:181"/>
how <hi>Bernard</hi> came in all alone, they demaunded of him, and ſayd. Sir, where is your captaine and the old <hi>Gerames.</hi> Then ſore wéeping, he ſhewed them at length the pittious and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous aduenture, the which when they heard, they made ſuch cries and wéeping, that pittie it was for to heare and to ſée them, the bruite and noyſe was ſo great and loud, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> heard it, whereat ſhe maruailed, and ſtood in a great feare. Therewith Syr <hi>Bernard</hi> entred in at the Caſtle gate, and ſo mounted into the hall, whereas hee found the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> who was ſore abaſhed when ſhe ſawe Syr <hi>Bernard</hi> come alone, who ſhewed her the great loſſe that he had ſuſtained that day, wherwith for inward ſorrow ſhe fell down in a ſwound, and ſo lay a long ſpace as though ſhe had beene dead. Then the Ladyes and Damſels ſore wéeping reléeued her, and then ſhee caſt out a great crie, wringing her handes, and tearing her hayre, and ſayde. Ah <hi>Huon</hi> my right déere Lord, this day yée haue loſt your moſt ſorrowfull and dolorous wife and well beloued daughter.</p>
               <p>Then the Ladies, &amp; Damſelles, and other wiues, who had loſt their huſbands, fathers, and brethren, came into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and made ſuch cryes and ſorrow, that the noyſe thereof was heard into the Emperours hoaſt without, and it was ſhewed the Emperour, that the noyſe and brute that was made within the Citie and Caſtle, was for the loſſe they hadde receiued that day. And then they ſayde, that it ſhould be good that the next morning euerie man ſhould be readie to goe and aſſayle the Citie, and ſayd, that if euer they would winne it, the howre then was come. When the Emperour had heard that reaſon, he ſayd that the aduiſe was very good, and that he would that it ſhould ſo be done, hee gaue the charge thereof to his Conſtable and Marſhalles: &amp; ſo the next morninge his hoaſt was readie, and the Emperour commanded to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and then they came before the Citie garniſhed with all things néedfull and neceſſarie for aſſault: and they marched forward, and approached the Citie, and when they came there, they gaue a great crie, and entred into the Dykes, and reared vp their ladders to the walles in diuers places, ſo that they
<pb facs="tcp:4519:182"/>
that were within were ſore afrayd. For within were but Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes and Marchants, who could but little ſkil of warre, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, they mounted vpon the walles, and defended their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But the Citie was ſo ſore aſſayled on all parts, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants wiſt not where to make reſiſtance, the ſhotte of them without ſlew ſo thicke, that none within durſt appeare vppon the walles: whereby they entred perforce into the Citie, and ſlew as many as they mette withall in their entring. And then they went vnto the gate, and opened it, ſo that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and all his Lords entred into the Citie. Then euerie man went abroade in the ſtréetes, to take priſoners, and to ſpoyle mens houſes.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour ſaw hee was Lord of the Citie, hee cauſed it to be proclaimed in euerie ſtreete, that no man on paine of death ſhould wrong any woman, or deflowre anie mayde, nor to breake any Church, nor to ſet any houſe on fire, and alſo ſuch as were in any Church for ſauegard, that they ſhould goe at their pleaſure, without any trouble or danger ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of body or goods, for the Emperour, who was a wiſe Prince, thought in himſelfe, that great damage and pittie it would bee, to deſtroy and putte to ruine ſuch a famous Citie, ſo ſtrong and well furniſhed with Burgeſſes and Marchants. When ſuch as were fledde into ſtrong places for refuge, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Emperours commaundement, euerie man and woman returned to their owne houſes, ſo that there was but little damage done, and that was done by them that entred firſt. When the Lady <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> ſaw how the Citie was taken, ye may bee ſure ſhe was right ſorrowfull. For firſt ſhee ſaw her Citie taken by the enemie, and her ſelfe cloſed within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ill furniſhed with victualles, and much people with her, whereby ſhe ſaw cleerely (without God did ayde her) that her death approched neere. Then pitiouſly ſhe complayned to God and ſayd. Verie God on whome I beléeue firmely, and for whoſe ſake I haue left my firſt miſbeleefe, and forſooke my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and friends to take to my huſband a Chriſtian man, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to receiue thy law, O God I require thee of thy grace to haue pittie vpon mee poore deſolate creature, and to keepe

and defend my deere children from all ill incombrances, for if it be thy pleaſure to ſaue my childe, I am content to abide what fortune it ſhall pleaſe thee to ſend mee, and beſide that, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thy grace to ſaue and keepe <hi>Huon</hi> my deere Lord and huſband.</p>
               <p>Then all wéeping ſhe called vnto her ſir <hi>Bernard,</hi> and ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Right deare Fréend, I can take no counſaile nowe but of you, you ſée well howe our deathes approache, and that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for vs to kéepe and defend this Caſtle againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who hath wonne the Citie, and I doubt if he enter into this Caſtle perforce, wée ſhall bee the firſt that ſhall receiue death, and becauſe I ſée well that I cannot eſcape from hence, I require you my deare Fréend, and by the troth that you beare vnto <hi>Huon</hi> my Lord and yours, that incontinent you take my deare Daughter <hi>Clariet</hi> whome I hold héere in mine armes, and finde ſome meanes that you may depart out of this Citie, and beare her ſtraight to the Abbey of <hi>Cluny,</hi> the which is in <hi>Burgoyne,</hi> and deliuer her into the kéeping of the Abbot there: and recommend me vnto him, hée is Vncle to my Huſband <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and great Vncle to my Childe. Lady, (quoth <hi>Bernard</hi>) I know well that if I be taken here, I ſhalbe vtterly ſlaine: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, if I could ſée or knowe that my abiding héere could aid or ſuccour you, both for mine honour and for the loue of my good Lord and Maiſter <hi>Huon,</hi> I woulde neuer depart hence from you, but my reſiſtance and force is but of ſmall value, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I woulde ſerue you as I am bounde to doe, I am readie ſourniſhed to take vppon mee that aduenture, as to beare your Child away, and to ſet her in ſauegard by the grace of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>When the Ducheſſe vnderſtood <hi>Barnard,</hi> ſhe was well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and as for her ſelfe ſhee regarded neither her life nor death, when ſhee knewe that her Child ſhould be ſaued. Then ſhée deliuered her Childe vnto <hi>Barnard,</hi> to the entent that in the night time hée ſhould yſſue out. Then the Emperour and his Lordes came before the Caſtle: and when the Ducheſſe knewe that, ſhee came to the gate, and at a windowe ſhee deſired to ſpeake with the Emperour, who was there readie preſent and

ſaid. Madame, ſay what you will to mée at your pleaſure: and when ſhée ſawe the Emperour, ſhee ſayd. Sir, I knowe well that you are the head and cheefeſt of all the chriſtened and nobleſt, whereby you are bound to defend and to kéepe from ill all noble men and women, I that am the Daughter of an high and mightie Emperour, and that for the loue of my good Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, haue forſaken mine owne falſe bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léefe, to beléeue vppon the Chriſtian faith: Sir, I require you (for his ſake that made and created you) to haue pitie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of mée, and of all thoſe that be héere with mée, &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite our liues, and to put from you all rancour and malice, and pardon them that nothing had to doe with the beginning of this warre.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour hadde heard the reaſonable requeſt of this faire Ladie, hee caſt from him all the mortall hate that hée had vnto her, and vnto them that were within the Caſtle with her. Then hée mooued with pitie and compaſſion of the noble Ladie, aunſweared and ſayde: Madame, for the loue of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, I repell from mée all my diſpleaſure, ſo that you render vnto mee this Caſtle, and to put it vnder mine obeyſance to vſe it at my pleaſure, and to yéelde your bodie as my Priſoner, and all thoſe that be within, and thus you ſhall haue all your liues ſaued. Sir, (quoth the Ducheſſe) laude and praiſe bee giuen to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for this grace that you ſhewe vnto mée and to my companie. Then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour went backe, and made expreſſe commandement throuh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Citie, that no man ſhould bée ſo hardy, as to doe any hurt or iniurie to any manner of perſon within the Citie, but to ſuffer euerie man to abide in their owne houſes peaceably without killinge, whereof the Burgeſſes and communaltie of the Citie, were right ioyfull.

Madame (quoth the Emperour) all this that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire heere, I promiſe to performe: but you, and all ſuch as be with you ſhall bee my priſoners. Sir (quoth the Ducheſſe) my life and my bodie, and all ſuch as be here with mee, I put them in the ſauegard of God and of you.</p>
               <p>Then ſhe deſcended downe, and came into the hall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſhe found her company making great ſorow each to other, for they knew not where euer they ſhould méet againe or not. Then the Ducheſſe commaunded to open the gate, the which was doone immediatly. Then the Emperour and all his Lords entred into the Caſtle, but hee would not goe into the hall, till he had all the Ladyes and other brought out, to the intent that they ſhould make no requeſt to him, and he ordained a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Knights of the moſt auncient men of his hoaſt, and then be deliuered the Ducheſſe, and ſixe Ladyes with her, and al the other priſoners, as well they that were within the Caſtle, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hadde beene taken before at diuers ſkirmiſhes, &amp; ſent them ſtraight to the Citie of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and ſette them all in priſon in Towres and other places, but the ducheſſe was putte all alone in a ſtrong towre, within the which there was a déep

Then the Emperour being in the Caſtle of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> ſent ouer all the Countrey, that all ſuch as were aliue ſhould come and do their homage vnto him, and take their Landes of him, the which they did according to his commaundement. Then hée made his Prouoſts and Officers to doe iuſtice both in the Citie and Countrey: and after that the Emperour had béene there eight dayes, he went out of the Citie, and road and tooke poſſeſſion of <hi>Blames</hi> and <hi>Gerone,</hi> and ſet there his Officers, and when hee hadde full poſſeſſion of al the Countrey, hee left Keepers in the Countrey, and ſo returned to the Citie of <hi>Mayence,</hi> whereas hee was receiued with great ioy and triumph.

<pb facs="tcp:4519:186"/>
Arch vaulted richly, painted with gould and azure, vnder the which ſtoode a riche chayre, and therein a couſhin of cloath of gould, bordered with pearles and precious ſtones. <hi>Huon</hi> who was wearie of walking, ſat downe in the chaire to reſte him. Then he beganne ſore to muze, caſting downe his lookes to the earth, and by reaſon that his long Mantle had ſwept the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away from the pauement, there appeared letters of gould written vpon the pauement, &amp; he red them, and the tennour of them was: <hi>Whoſoeuer reads this Letter, ſhall find that vnder this pauement, there is a Celler with victuall both bread, fleſh, and wine, and of all ſundry meats for man or woman to eate of.</hi> But the Letters ſayd, that whoſoeuer ſhould enter into this Celler, except he be without deadly ſinne: as ſoone as he toucheth any of the meat, ſuddainly he ſhall die. When <hi>Huon</hi> had read all the Letters, hee hadde great maruaile and feare, and thought within himſelfe, that when hée departed from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> hee was confeſſed before his Prieſt died, and ſince that time hee could not remember any thinge that hee had committed that ſhould bee deadly ſinne: and then hee made his prayers to our Lord God deuoutly ſore weeping, and when hee had ended his prayers, as hee kneeled vppon his knees before the chaire, hee ſawe hanging vppon the ſide of the chaire a little key of gould, he tooke it vp in his hand, and beganne to muze on the writing that ſayd: <hi>Whoſoeuer enters into this Caſtle, though they be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt and wiſe or noble Knightes, yet they ſhall not knowe well what to doe.</hi> Then he ſaid vnto himſelfe, rather then I ſhould die for famine, it were better to die ſhortly then longe to endure in this hunger and thirſt.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> recommended himſelfe to the ayd and helpe of almightie God, and tooke the key and opened a little wicket and drew the dore vnto him. Then he looked downe into the Celler, the which was as cleare, as though the Sunne in the middeſt of the day hadde entred in at the windowes, and ſo hee went downe about Seauen-ſcore greeces: then hee regarded on the right hand, and ſaw a great Ouen with twoo mouthes, the which caſt out a great cleareneſſe, then he ſaw néere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Ten faire young men, they were all of the Fayrie, foure

               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> had well aduiſed them, he had great maruaile, and came and ſaluted them, ſaying: Sir, I pray to our Lord God to ſaue you and all your companie, and when they heard <hi>Huon</hi> ſpeake, they gaue vnto him no manner of anſweare, but beheld each other, and when <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw that none of them wold make him any anſwere, he was ſore abaſhed and greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his mind: howbeit he ſayd.

               <p>Then they anſweared <hi>Huon</hi> right fiercely and ſaid: Ah thou falſe and vntrue Knight, for to demaund any ſuch thing of vs, at this time I ſhall ſhewe you, but afterward, by mee nor by none other of my company, you ſhall neuer heare word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

<pb facs="tcp:4519:187"/>
and with many Shippes and Galleys, they came and layde ſeege before this Caſtle, and lay at the ſeege a long ſpace, and could not hurt it the value of one pennie, ſo long they lay héere, that they were ſore diſpleaſed therewith, and ſo they thought to depart home into their owne countreys, but by reaſon that their ſhippes were nayled with yron nayles, they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from hence, for the <hi>Adamant</hi> ſtone that by nature draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the yron vnto him, and ſo they lay heere ſo longe, that they al died miſerably for famine and rage, for no ſhippe can depart from hence without it be pinned with nayles of wood, and not of yron. And whereas you demaund, from whence commeth the Treaſure that is heere within this Caſtle? Knowe for a troth, that it was the riches that theſe thrée Kinges lefte in their ſhippes when they dyed, the which Treaſure after that they were dead, <hi>Caeſar</hi> cauſed it to be brought into this Caſtle, and before hée dyed, hee deliuered vnto mee the kéeping of this Caſtle and Treaſure. And I and Fortie other of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, are heere condemned by the Fayrie to abide heere vnto the end of the world. Nowe when that tidinges came to the knowledge of the noble Kinge <hi>Oberon,</hi> that his Father <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſlaine, and murdered within the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> by them whome hee truſted well, King <hi>Oberon</hi> tooke ſuch diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he made promiſe and aſſurement, that hée would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come heere more, and no more he hath done: for he thought if he ſhould haue come hether againe, that hee ſhould haue dyed for ſorrow, for the great loue that he had vnto his Father <hi>Iulius Caeſar.</hi> And ſince you will knowe my name, I am called <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riadas,</hi> and this Caſtle is called the <hi>Adamant.</hi> Nowe I haue ſhewed you the troth of your demaund, and one thing I ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, you ſhall neuer depart from hence as long as you liue, without you flye in the ayre as a bird doth flye: nowe I haue ſhewed you your deſire.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> vnderſtood him, he was right ſorrowfull: and ſo after hee had well eaten and drunken at his owne pleaſure, hee tooke his leaue and departed, and came vnto a dore of a chamber, and ſawe Letters of goulde written ouer the dore, whereby hee had knowledge where the key was, hee tooked it
<pb facs="tcp:4519:188"/>
and opened the dore and entred into the Chamber, and ſawe how that all the Chamber was made of Chriſtall, and painted richly with gould and Aſure, and there was the protraiture of all the Battailes of <hi>Troy,</hi> and all the déedes of <hi>Alexander</hi>: and vppon the pauement was ſpread abroad, Roſes, flowers, and hearbes ſwéete ſmelling aboue all other ſauours in the worlde, and in the Chamber there were diuers birdes flyinge about, ſinging ſo maruailous ſweetly, that great ioye and melodie it was to heare them: the riches and great beauty of that cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber could not bee deſcribed. <hi>Huon</hi> had maruailous great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to behould it, and there hee ſawe a Table ſet full of meate, and there by ſtood great pots of gould garniſhed with precious ſtones full of wine, there was no meat in the world but that there it was readie: <hi>Huon</hi> had good appetite to eate, for he had eaten but little before, by reaſon of the talking that he had with <hi>Gloriadas</hi>: and then two young men brought him a Baſon of gould broadered with pearles to waſh his hands, and another brought him a Towell to wipe his handes. Then <hi>Huon</hi> ſat downe at a rich Table, the which was bordered with precious ſtones, the cloath that lay vpon the Table was of ſilke richly wrought, <hi>Huon</hi> did eate his meate, for hee hadde good appetite thereto, a goodly young man carued for him, and another bare his Cuppe, many folkes there was, to haue done ſeruice vnto any creature liuing in the world, and hée ſpake vnto them, but none would anſweare him one word, wherewith hee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie and ſore diſpleaſed: but when he ſaw that there was none other reamedie, hee did let it paſſe and forgat it, becauſe of the ſwéete melodie that the bird<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus <hi>Huon</hi> was there a whole Moneth, and tooke ſuch pleaſure there, that hee recouered his heath, and ſtrength, and beautie, greatly hée was annoyed that there was no man there that would ſpeake one word vnto him: oftentimes hee wiſhed himſelfe at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> with a hundred Thouſand men at armes to giue battaile vnto the Emperour who had done him ſo much dammage.

               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw them arriue, all wéeping hee complayned for them, for he ſaw well that they were all loſt, and that they ſhoulde neuer depart from thence, when the Shippe was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the Marchants within it called vppon Mahound to ayde and to ſuccour them, and the Maiſter of the Ship ſtood vp and went a ſhoare, and looked towards the Caſtle, and ſawe <hi>Huon</hi> where hee ſtood leaning in a window: whereof they had great ioy, thinking that they were arriued at a good Port, ſuppoſing that he that they ſawe there before them, had beene the Lord of the Caſtle, becauſe he was ſo maruailous richly aparelled, and then they ſaluted <hi>Huon</hi> in the name of Mahounde their God.

               <p>Then the Maiſter trembling ſaid, Sir know for troth, that I am of the countrey of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and dwelling in the Citie of <hi>Luyſarne,</hi> and they that are come hether with me, are all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and are come from the citie of <hi>Acre,</hi> and there wée charged our ſhippe with Marchandize, and we had a maruaylous good wind vntill wée were paſſed the ſtraites of <hi>Morrocco,</hi> and that wée were néere to our owne countrey, and then ſuddenly a great tempeſt aroſe and tooke vs, and draue vs off from the coaſt of our owne Countrey a great diſtance, and this tempeſt hath continewed theſe twentie daies paſt ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely, that wée were faine perforce to abandon our ſhippe to the raging of the Sea and winde, euen as the ſhippe would goe at aduenture, but at the laſt by good fortune wée chaunced to arriue by a great rocke and there wee caſt anchor: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> hadde well heard the Biſhoppe and vnderſtood him, his bloud changed, and embracing him ſweetely, he ſaid: Sir, you are my Coozen, &amp; I am <hi>Huon,</hi> who paſſed the ſea and went to the Admirall <hi>Gaudiſe,</hi> and ſlewe him, and ledde away with me his Daughter the faire <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> who was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto me by our holy Father the Pope, and I haue left her in the Citie of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in great pouertie and miſerie, beſieged by the Emperour of <hi>Almaine,</hi> I beleeue ſurely that ſhe is taken by this time. When the Biſhop heard <hi>Huon,</hi> hee began ſore to weepe, and <hi>Huon</hi> embraced and kiſſed him, and ſayd.

               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> tooke him by the hand, and brought him into the Pallaice and through the Chambers, the Biſhoppe was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abaſhed to ſée the riches that he ſaw there. Then they went downe into the Seller, the Biſhop beheld the manner of euerie thing, and had great maruaile that none of them that hee ſawe there would not ſpeake any word, hee paſſed by them with <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and ſaluted them, and then he entred into the rich Chamber, whereas the Table was readie and Seruants to giue them
<pb facs="tcp:4519:191"/>
water, and they all thrée ſat downe: and then <hi>Huon</hi> ſayd vnto the Biſhoppe. Coozen, I coniure you by the Sacrament that you haue receiued, that you nor your Chaplaine be ſo hardy as to eat one morſell of meat, if any of you bee in any deadly ſin, if you be, incontinent confeſſe you to your Chaplain, and hee vnto you: for if you doe otherwiſe, you ſhall no ſooner eate one morſell, but incontinent you ſhall die.</p>
               <p>When the Biſhop had well heard and vnderſtood <hi>Huon,</hi> hée hadde great maruaile and ſaid: Coozen, by the grace of God I féele my ſelfe in good eſtate not to abide death, for when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Rome,</hi> both I and my Nephewe were confeſſed of the Pope, and aſſoyled of all our ſinnes, and ſince wée entred into the Sea wee haue committed no ſinne. Then <hi>Huon</hi> ſayd: Cozen, ſeeing that you be both in this caſe, you may eate and drinke at your pleaſure, and ſo they did, for they had great néed thereof, they all thrée were richly ſerued, they had euerie thing as they wiſhed for, the Biſhoppe and his Nephew did eat and drinke, and they were greatly abaſhed of the great riches that they ſaw there, and they were rauiſhed at the ſwéet ſinging of the birds, and the hearbes and flowers that were there ſpreade abroade ſmellinge ſo ſwéetely, that they thought themſelues in Paradice, and they had great maruaile to ſee the Seruants to ſerue them ſo peaceable, but they would neuer ſpeak one word, they woulde gladly haue demaunded the cauſe why, but <hi>Huon</hi> hadde expreſly charged them that they ſhoulde make none in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie.</p>
               <p>Thus they paſſed their dinner in great ioy, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> waſhed theyr hands &amp; aroſe vp from the Table, and the Biſhop and his Chaplaine ſayde grace deuouſly. Then <hi>Huon</hi> tooke the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe by the hand, and ſayde: Cozen, wee will goe vp into the Pallaice, and then you ſhall goe downe into your Shippe, and ſhew them without they will die incontinent, let them be chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened, and dreſſe vp Tubbes with water of the Sea, and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe you it and chriſten them therein, and I ſhall come after you with my ſword and cleane armed, to the entent that if they refuſe thus to doe, I ſhall ſtrike oft their heades.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4519:192"/>Then <hi>Huon</hi> armed himſelfe, and went after the Biſhoppe and his Nephewe downe to the ſhippe, and when they came there, they found <hi>Elinas</hi> the Maiſter of them, who had preached ſo much vnto the Sarazins, that hée had conuerted them all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Tenne, they bare him in hand that they were glad to bee chriſtened, but theyr thoughtes were otherwiſe, for they Ten had concluded in their courages, not to renounce the Lawe of Mahomet, for to beleeue vppon Ieſus Chriſt, but they were content to be chriſtened, to the entent that they would not die there for famine.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> and the Biſhop was come vnto them, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſayd: Sirs, I require you all to ſhew me your intention, that if with a good heart not coloured, you will become chriſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and beléeue on the Law of God the Father, and of his Son our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and leaue the falſe and deteſtable Lawe of Mahound, the which is nothing woorth. Sir, (quoth they all) ſhortly deliuer vs, for wee bee ſo hungrie and thirſtie, that we are almoſt famiſhed, the which ouer-preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs ſo much, that we can no longer endure nor ſuffer it: and when <hi>Huon</hi> had well heard them, he humbly thanked our Lord God, and had great ioy thereof, and the Biſhop and his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine confeſſed them all, and aſſoyled them of all their ſinnes, and in twoo great veſſels chriſtened them all. Then they all cryed vppon <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſayd: Sir, for the loue of our Lord God giue vs ſome meate. Sirs, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) you ſhall haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent ynough, ſo that you ſhall bee ſatiſfied. Then <hi>Huon</hi> and the Biſhop and his Chaplaine all thrée went into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and charged vpon their neckes meat ynough, and brought it into the Shippe, and cauſed all the Marchants to ſit downe, and the meat was ſet before them, and the wine powred out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cuppes, among other ſat the tenne Sarazins, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the chriſtendome faintly and falſely, and at the firſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that they did put into their mouthes, ſuddainly they died: the other Marchants when they ſawe that, they were greatly abaſhed, and regarded each other, and durſt not approach to touch the meat, for they had thought that they ſhould haue all died. Sirs, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) be not diſmayed nor abaſhed at this,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:192"/>
for theſe tenne men that are dead, did baptize themſelues but all onely to ſaue their liues and to haue meate, and not with a good conſcience, nor for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of almightie God, who hath all mens heartes at his pleaſure: therefore be not afraid, eate and drinke at your eaſe, for yee ſhall want nothing, but haue all thinges at your wiſh.</p>
               <p>When the other Marchants vnderſtood by <hi>Huon,</hi> how that they that died were no true Chriſtian men, they were greatly abaſhed, and ſo fell to theyr meate and drinke: and when they had eaten and drunken at their pleaſures, they aroſe and tooke all the riches that were in the Shippe and carried it vp into the Caſtle, and when they came there, they had great ioy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to beholde the Hals and rich Chambers that were there: ſo much gould and ſiluer and other riches they ſawe there, that they hadde thereof great maruaile. Then they beheld the rich beddes, and Chambers apparelled whereas they might reſt them: and then they ſawe the faire Garden ſo pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to behold, that the more they regarded it, the fairer it ſeemed vnto them, the place was of length and breadth a bowe ſhoote and more. And when the houre came for ſupper, then <hi>Huon</hi> ledde them downe into the Seller, and after into the rich Chamber, whereas there was meat and drinke plentie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Supper they went againe into the Pallaice, and lay in the rich beds that they found there readie, and in the morning the Biſhop and his Chaplaine did ſing Maſſe before <hi>Huon,</hi> and all the other that were there preſent, and when they woulde eate, they went to the place accuſtomed, and there they founde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes readie euerie thing that they deſired or wiſht for, in the day time they would bee in the Garden to ſport them, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Biſhop preached vnto them, and confeſſed them of all their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thus they were there all together the ſpace of one Moneth in great pleaſure and ſolace, but whoſoeuer had ioy, <hi>Huon</hi> had none, for his abiding there greatly greeued him, for oftentimes hee would complaine for his Wife the faire Ladie <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> and for his Daughter <hi>Clariet,</hi> and ſayde.

               <p>
                  <hi>Huon</hi> beheld the <hi>Griffen</hi> well, and ſaw how that ſhe flew to the white Rocke.

               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> felt himſelfe hurt and lay vppon the earth, hee called vppon God for ayd and ſuccour, for hee thought that he ſhould neuer haue riſen more, and wiſhed himſelfe at that time that hee had taried ſtill in the Caſtle of the <hi>Adamant</hi> with his companie, who for ſorrowe that they had when <hi>Huon</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſhippe, they durſt not abide the comming of the <hi>Griffen,</hi> but went and did hide themſelues in the Caſtle, and <hi>Huon</hi> who was ſore wounded with this fifth <hi>Griffen,</hi> roſe vp as well as he might, and came to the <hi>Griffen,</hi> who was ready to deſtroy him with his beake and nailes.

                  <hi>Huon</hi> had no ſooner ſpoken thoſe words, but a winde aroaſe with ſo great a Tempeſt, that hee thought then ſurely to haue beene caſt away. Then he ſaw comming againſt him great barres of yron red hoat, that fell downe from on high into the Riuer before <hi>Huon</hi> in ſuch ſort, that when they fell into the water, by reaſon of the heat of the barres troubled ſo the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that fearfull it was to behold it. Thus <hi>Huon</hi> was a great ſpace, before he could paſſe the Gulfe, the which was ſo perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and the Shippe went ſo ſore by force of the wind, ſo that the ſhippe went out of the middeſt of the ſtreame, and was neere to the Land, ſo that the Ship was grounded, and could goe no further.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw and perceiued that the Shippe was vpon the grounde, hee thought then ſurely to haue béene drowned. Then hee tooke an anchor and put it into the water, to knowe how many foote the water was of déepeneſſe, and hee found it but fiue foote. Then hee tooke one of his anchors and caſt it
<pb facs="tcp:4519:200"/>
a ſhoare, and then drewe by the coard, vntill the ſhippe came neere to the bancke-ſide, then hee yſſued out of the Shippe and leapt a land, and then hee ſawe ſuddainly about him a great clearneſſe, whereof he was greatly diſmayed and abaſhed, and wiſt not what to thinke: then hee ſawe before him that all the grauell in the water were mingled with precious ſtones, and when <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw that, he tooke a ſcoope and caſt into the ſhippe ſo much of thoſe precious ſtones, that it gaue as great a light as though tenne Torches hadde beene burning, and ſo much of this grauell <hi>Huon</hi> did caſt into the Shippe, that hee was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of labour, and when hee ſawe the Shippe ſufficiently char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, then hee entred againe and drewe vp the anchor, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed ſo ſore, that hee brought againe the ſhippe into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the ſtreame, then the ſhip went ſo faſt that a bird could not haue followed it.</p>
               <p>Thus he was tenne dayes before he could paſſe that Gulfe, and thus day and night hee ſayled with great feare, and ſore oppreſſed through hunger and thirſt, for hee had nothing to eat nor drinke but fruit, ſo that thereby hee was waxed ſo feeble, that he could ſcarce ſuſtaine himſelfe vppon his feete, and vpon the eleauenth day at the Sunne riſing, hee ſawe appeare the clearneſſe of the day light, and then he was out of the darknes, and entred into the Sea of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the which was ſo pleaſant and peaceable, that great pleaſure it was to behold it, and then the Sunne aroſe and ſpread abroad his ſtreames and ſpheares vppon the Sea, whereof <hi>Huon</hi> was ſo ioyfull, as though he had neuer felt paine nor feare: then a farre off hee ſaw appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him a faire great Citie, and in the hauen therof there were ſo many ſhippes and Galleys, that their Maſtes ſeemed to bée a great Forreſt, whereof <hi>Huon</hi> hadde ſuch ioy at his heart, that he knéeled downe lifting by his hands vnto Heauen, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thanking our Lord God that hee had ſaued him from this perilous Gulfe.</p>
               <p>This Citie was called the great Citie of <hi>Thauris</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Lord thereof was a puiſſant Admirall, who had made to be proclaimed and publiſhed, that all manner of Marchaunts by land or by Sea that would come to his Citie, ſhould haue frée
<pb facs="tcp:4519:200"/>
going and frée comming without lette or diſturbance, either in their bodies or goods, whether they were chriſtian men or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razins, ſo that if they loſt the worth of a penny, they ſhould haue againe foure times the value thereof, and the ſame time that <hi>Huon</hi> came and arriued at that Port, was the day of their frée Feaſt: wherefore there was ſo much people of diuers Landes, that they could not well bee numbred. When <hi>Huon</hi> was come into the Port, hee caſt his anchor neere vnto the bancke-ſide, and was right ioyfull when hee ſawe himſelfe that he was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the firme land: and then hee had great deſire to knowe in what place hee was arriued in, and whether hee was arriued at a good Port or no?

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue heard heere before,</hi> howe after the taking of <hi>Bourdeaux, <hi>Barnard</hi>
                  </hi> who was Cozen vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> had borne <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Huons</hi> child into <hi>Burgoine,</hi> and deliuered her to bee kept with the good Abbot of <hi>Cluny.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Barnard</hi> had taried there the ſpace of eight dayes, he was wearie with being there, and vpon a day hee ſayde vnto the Abbot. Ah Sir, I would at the taking of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> I had béen ſlaine with my Cozen <hi>Gerames,</hi> for when I remember my good Lord <hi>Huon,</hi> my heart fayleth mee in ſuch wiſe, that it is great paine for mee to beare the ſorrow that I endure, and afterward when I remember the Ducheſſe <hi>Eſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remond</hi> his Wife, who endureth ſuch miſerie that it is pitie to thinke thereof, doubleth the ſorrowe and greefe that I haue at
<pb facs="tcp:4519:201"/>
my heart. Alas, what ſhall <hi>Huon</hi> ſay, if hee returne and find his Citie taken, his men taken and deſtroyed, and his Wife in Priſon in great pouertie and miſerie? I feare mee that hee will die for ſorrowe. Alas, I ſée all that I haue is loſte for the loue of <hi>Huon</hi> my Lord, for the which I care little for, if hee bee in ſafetie aliue, and that hee may returne againe, and I am in great diſpleaſure, that wée can heare no newes of him ſince hée departed from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> I ſhall neuer reſt as longe as I liue vntill I haue found him, or heare ſome certaine newes of him. Cozen, (quoth the Abbot) if you will enter into this enqueſt, you ſhould doe mee great pleaſure, and for the great deſire that I haue had, that you ſhould goe this Voyage, I will giue you a Thouſand Florents towardes your iourney. Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) I thanke you.</p>
               <p>Then the Abbot deliuered him the money, and <hi>Barnard</hi> made him readie to depart the next day, and ſo hee did, and tooke his leaue of the Abbot and departed, and reſted not vntill hee came to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enyce,</hi> whereas hee found Galleys readie to goe to the holy Sepulchre, whereof hee was right ioyfull, and ſo ſayled foorth vntill they came to the Port <hi>Iaffe,</hi> whereas hee went a ſhoare with other Pilgrims, and euer as he paſſed by the other Ports, he euer demanded for <hi>Huon,</hi> but he could neuer find any man, that coulde ſhewe vnto him any manner of newes of him, and then he departed from the Port <hi>Iaſte</hi> and went vnto <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> whereas he taried eight dayes. Then when hee had done his Pilgrimage, he tooke forth his iourney vnto <hi>Kayre</hi> in <hi>Babilon,</hi> and when he came to <hi>Gaſere,</hi> which ſtandeth at the entring of the Deſarts, hee met with many Marchants, who were going to the frée Feaſt which was holden in the great Citie of <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> Then hee thought to demaund of them whether ſo much people were going, and all in one companie, and he ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Marchant of <hi>Geanes,</hi> and demaunded of him whether ſo much people went together in one companie, for they were to the number of ſix-ſcore Marchants chriſtian men, and hee. Then the Marchant ſaide: Sir, as mee thinketh by you, you are of the Countrey of Fraunce, I ſhall ſhew you whether we goe: Sir, within this eight dayes the frée Feaſt ſhalbe at the
<pb facs="tcp:4519:201"/>
great Citie of <hi>Thauris,</hi> whereas there ſhall come a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Marchants, as well Chriſtian men as Sarazins, as wel by land as by Sea, and there is nothing in this mortall world but there you ſhall find it, and heare of all manner of newes, from all the parts of the world.</p>
               <p>Nowe I haue ſhewed you whether wee are going, I pray you ſhewe mee whether you would goe and whome you doe ſeeke for? Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) knowe for troth that I am of the Realme of Fraunce, and I doe ſéeke for a Knight who is Lord of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and is called <hi>Huon,</hi> and it is longe ſince I departed out of my Countrey, and I could neuer heare any thing of his life nor death. Sir, (quoth the <hi>Geneuoys</hi>) if euer you ſhall heare of him, (if you will beléeue mée) you ſhall goe with vs into the Realme of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to the frée Feaſt at the great Citie of <hi>Thauris.</hi> Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) in a good houre I haue met with you, I ſhall not leaue your companie vntill you come there, to ſée if God will ſend mee ſo good fortune as to find him that I ſeeke for.</p>
               <p>Then the Marchants departed, and road all together vntill they came vnto the great Citie of <hi>Thauris,</hi> and when they were lodged, they went about their marchandize whereas they ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Thus <hi>Barnard</hi> was eight dayes in the Citie going heere and there, euer enquiring newes for him whome he ſought for: and vppon a day he went down to the Port vnto the Sea-ſide, whereas many Shippes and Galleys lay at anchor, and as hée looked about, he ſaw neere to the Sea-ſide a little proper Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell maruailouſly faire, and the neerer he came vnto it, the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and richer it ſeemed, for he ſaw great clearneſſe and ſhining within it, by reaſon of the rich ſtones that were therein, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had great maruaile, and eſpecially becauſe hee ſaw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Shippe but one man cleane armed, hee wiſt not what to thinke, but he thought that he was chriſtened: then he approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neere to the Shippe and ſaluted <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſayde. Sir, God giue you good aduenture, for me thinkes you bee a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man. Fréend, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) God ſaue thée, me thinkes by thy ſpeach, that thou wert borne in the good Countrey of France, by reaſon that thou ſpeakeſt French, for I haue great

ioy when I heare that language ſpoken: and fréend, I require thée to ſhew me where thou wert borne, and what thou ſéekeſt for heere?</p>
               <p>Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) ſéeing you will know of my buſineſſe, I ſhall ſhew you, as he that is right ſorrowfull and heauie, and little ſhall you winne thereby when you doe know it, but ſéeing that it is your pleaſure, I ſhall ſhewe you the troth. Sir, I was borne in the good Citie of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> whereas I haue left my houſe and heritage, to ſéeke for my good Lord ſomtime Lord of the ſame Citie, and he was called Duke <hi>Huon,</hi> who went from <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to ſéeke for ſome ſuccour whiles the City was beſieged, and ſo it is, my Lord <hi>Huon</hi> returned not, nor it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee knowne where he is become, and becauſe the Citie at his departing was beſéeged by the Emperour of <hi>Almaine,</hi> and the Citie but ill fourniſhed with victuall to maintaine it long, and alſo it was ſo ſore beaten with Engins, that the Emperor wanne the Citie perforce, and ſlew all thoſe that my Lord <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> had lefte there, except thrée Hundred, the which were taken Priſoners by the Emperour, and led into the Citie of <hi>Mayence,</hi> with the noble Ducheſſe <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> wife vnto my good Lord <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſhee is kept in a ſtraighc Priſon, whereas ſhe ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her dayes miſerably, whereof my heart is in ſuch ſorrowe and gréefe, that when I remember them, it neere hand ſlayeth my heart.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> hadde well heard and vnderſtood <hi>Barnard,</hi> hee knew him well, but hee had no power to ſpeake any word vnto him, his heart was ſo full of ſorrow and gréefe, for that his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen <hi>Barnard</hi> had ſhewed him, and the chéefeſt of his ſorrow was for the trouble of his wife the faire Lady <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> who was in great perill of death. Thus <hi>Huon</hi> was a great ſpace, and could ſpeake no word for ſorrow and gréefe, and wiſt not what to doe: and alſo hee ſaw his Coozen <hi>Barnard,</hi> who hadde taken great paines to ſearch for him, whereof hee had ſuch pitie, that the teares fell from his eyes.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaw that the Knight gaue him no anſweare, and beheld vnder the ventaile of his helmet, the teares of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fell downe from his eyes, hee was thereof ſo diſmayed and
<pb facs="tcp:4519:202"/>
abaſhed that he wiſt not what to ſay. Then hee ſayde: Sir, mee thinkes you are a Chriſtian man, and becauſe I ſee and perceiue in you that you are a man, that hath beene in many places and Countreys: therefore I deſire you to ſhewe mee, if you heard euer any manner of ſpeaking of my good Lord <hi>Huon</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> whome I haue ſought for in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys both by land and by Sea, and I could neuer heare any certaine tidings of him, whereof I am right ſorrie, for if I can heare no word of him by you, I will neuer hope more to haue any knowledge of him: I thinke I ſhall haue ſome knowledg by you if he be aliue, for if I knowe nothing by you, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſéeke him further, but I will goe into a Deſart vnto ſome ſolitarie place, and there to doe penance, and to pray vnto God for my good Lord <hi>Huon,</hi> and to pardon me of all my ſinnes and offences, and I require you in the name of our Lord and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt, to ſhewe mee what you bée? and where you were borne? and from whence you come, that hath brought in your ſhippe ſo great riches, for I knowe certainly, that in all Fraunce cannot bee found the value of ſo great riches: nor the puiſſant <hi>Charlemaine</hi> coulde neuer aſſemble together ſuch riches as you haue in your Shippe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> had well heard <hi>Barnard,</hi> hee ſayde: Freend, I haue great maruaile of that I heare you ſay, for in my Shippe I knowe neither gould nor ſiluer, nor none other thing but my bodie and mine armour. Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) beware what you ſay, for the riches that I ſee in your Shippe, if you will ſell it, you may fill againe your ſhippe with monney, if you will beleeue me, the Treaſure and riches that you haue brought in your Shippe, the value thereof cannot bee eſtéemed. When <hi>Huon</hi> heard that, he had great maruaile and was right ioyfull, then he looked downe into the bottome of the Shippe, and ſaw the rich ſtones there lying among the grauell, the which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tooke heede of before, for when he did caſt it into his Ship, hee thought all had beene but grauell to ballaice his Shippe withall, that it might ſayle the more ſurely. Then <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayd: Sir, I pray you hide it not from mee, where haue you had this Treaſure and in what Countrey? all the ſtones that
<pb facs="tcp:4519:203"/>
bee there I knowe the vertue of them all, for ſince I came out of my Countrey, I was a whole yeare with the beſt Lapidarie and knower of ſtones that was in all the world, and he taught me his Science: Sir, ſurely the place whereas you had them in is of great dignitie. Freend, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I ſhall ſhewe you the troth, fortune brought me by the Gulfe of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as as I ſuffered much paine and trouble, but thanked be God, I eſcaped from that hard aduenture, the force of the winde that came out of the Gulfe, draue my Shippe out of the ſtreame to the land, and when I ſawe that I was ſo néere to the land, I went out of the ſhippe and tooke a ſcoope, and therewith I did caſt into the ſhippe ſome ſtore of the grauell that lay by the ſea ſide, to ballays my ſhippe therewith, not knowing that any precious ſtones had beene amonge the grauell: and when I thought that I caſt in ſufficient, I entred againe into my ſhip, and ſo ſayled foorth more ſurely then I did before, there I had theſe ſtones that be in this ſhippe: the which yée ſay be of ſo great value.</p>
               <p>Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) I pray you wherefore ſerueth yonder foote of a great Foule or beaſt, that I ſee hange yonder in your Shippe, I cannot tell whether it be of a Foule or of a Dragon, for it is a fearfull thing to behold. Fréend, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) anone I ſhall ſhew you, but firſt I pray you ſhewe mee, what vertue and bountie are in theſe ſtones, the which you haue ſo much praiſed: and alſo to ſhew me vnto whome this noble Citie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth. Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) this Citie is called <hi>Thauris,</hi> whereof is Lord a rich Admirall, who is Lord of all <hi>Perſia</hi> and of <hi>Media,</hi> who when hee ſhall bee aduertiſed of your comming hether, he will haue of you Tribute as hee hath of other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and as for your ſtones, twoo of them that I ſée yonder if you giue them for your Tribute, hee will bee well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: and Sir, I ſhall aid you in your marchandize to the beſt of my power, the Admirall is a noble man in his Lawe, and of great credence. Fréend, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I thanke you for the courteſie that you ſhew mee: but Sir, I pray you ſhew me the ſtones that be of ſo much vertue, I would haue the beſt laid apart from the other. When <hi>Barnard</hi> heard howe <hi>Huon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb facs="tcp:4519:203"/>
him to ſhewe the vertue of the ſtones, then eſpecially hee ſhewed <hi>Huon</hi> ſixe ſtones, and he drew them out from the reſt, and laide them vppon <hi>Huons</hi> ſhéeld, and ſo choſe out Thirtie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhewed them all vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſayd. Sir, theſe Thirtie ſtones that I haue layde vppon your ſheeld, are of ſo great value, that there is neither King nor Emperour that can pay the value of them, and eſpecially of fiue of them: and when <hi>Huon</hi> heard that, he was right ioyfull. Then hee would hide no longer himſelfe from <hi>Barnard,</hi> and alſo becauſe of the great heat that hee was in, he did put off his helmet, the which hee kept on all that ſeaſon, becauſe he would firſt know of <hi>Barnard</hi> ſome tidings ere hée would be knowne vnto him, for hee knew his Coozen <hi>Barnard</hi> well ynough at his firſt comming vnto him.</p>

Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) the fiue that lyeth there by themſelues haue great vertue, this ſtone is of ſuch great vertue, that he that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it vppon him cannot bee poyſoned, alſo it is of ſuch digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and woorth, that whoſoeuer doe beare it, may go and come thorow fire without féeling of any heate, though hee were in a hot burning Oue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, alſo if a man fall into the water, hauing this ſtone about him, hee cannot ſinke nor drowne: Sir, this is the vertue of this firſt ſtone.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> tooke it and kept it for himſelfe: and then <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> tooke vp another and ſayd. Sir, heere is another ſtone of ſuch vertue, that a man bearing it about him, can haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hunger, thirſt, nor colde, nor ſhall not waxe elder by ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neither in bodie nor viſage, but he ſhall euer ſeeme to bée of the age of Thirtie yeares, nor faſting ſhall not impaire him. Then <hi>Huon</hi> tooke that ſtone and put it into his bagge, and ſaid that hee would keepe that ſtone for himſelfe. Well, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) Sir, heere is another of ſuch bountie and vertue, that he that beareth it cannot bee hurt in armes, nor vanguiſhed by his enemies, and if any of his kinne were blind, and touch but his eyes with this ſtone, incontinent he ſhall ſée againe, and if the ſtone be ſhewed vnto a mans eyes, he ſhall incontinent bée blind, and if a man be wounded, doe but turne this ſtone in the
<pb facs="tcp:4519:205"/>
wound, and incontinent he ſhall be whole.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> heard that, hee was right ioyfull, and ſaid that hee would keepe well that ſtone. Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) heere is another, the which hath ſo great vertue, that if a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bée neuer ſo ſicke, ſhewe them but this ſtone, and inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent they ſhall be whole of any manner of maladie, and alſo if a man were cloſed in priſon, in chaines and fetters, handes and feet, doe but touch them with this ſtone, and the chaines ſhall breake, and alſo if any man haue any cauſe to be pleaded in any Court before any Iudge, be his matter rightfull or wrongfull, hee ſhall winne his cauſe whether it bee for Landes or Goods, and alſo if a man haue this ſtone in his hande and cloſe it, hee ſhall bee inuiſible and may go whereas he liſt and ſhall not bee ſeene. And you ſhall ſée the proofe, for as he had this ſtone in his hand, he cloſed it, and incontinent he was inuiſible, ſo that <hi>Huon</hi> could not ſee him, whereof he was not content, for he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leaſt that hee had loſt his Coſen <hi>Barnard</hi> foreuer, and ſayd: Ah good Lord, thou haſt giuen mee the grace to find my cooſen <hi>Barnard,</hi> who ſhould haue kept me companie vntill I had retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into mine owne countrey, and now I ſee well that I haue loſt him.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Barnard</hi> hearde <hi>Huon,</hi> hee laughed, and <hi>Huon</hi> who heard him, groaped all about with his armes abroad, vntill at laſt he embraced him, and held him faſt, and when <hi>Barnard</hi> felt that, hee opened his hande, and then <hi>Huon</hi> ſawe him againe, whereof hee was right ioyfull, and bleſſed him at the vertue of that ſtone, and tooke it and layde it vp amonge the other in his bagge, and ſayd how that he would keepe that ſtone eſpecially, becauſe it was of ſuch a woonderfull great vertue.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Barnard</hi> did chooſe out the ſtones one from another, and there were ſo many good ſtones, that the value of them coulde not be eſteemed: then hee turned vp the bottome of the grauell to ſeeke out the beſt, and among other hee did chooſe out a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouncle,</hi> the which caſt out ſuch a light, as though twoo Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had beene light. <hi>Barnard</hi> tooke it and deliuered it vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſaid: Sir, bee you ſure that whoſoeuer beares this ſtone vppon him, may goe drie footed vppon the water, as ſure
<pb facs="tcp:4519:205"/>
as though hee were in a Veſſell, and alſo if a man goe in the darke night, he ſhall ſée as well as though he had the light of ſixe Torches, and if a man bee in battaile, hauing this ſtone about him, hee cannot bee ouercome nor hurt, nor his horſe weari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus as they were deuiſing together, there came vnto them diuers Marchants Sarazins, who with great maruaile beheld this little ſhippe, and they ſawe it ſo faire and rich, and ſo wel garniſhed with precious ſtones, that they thought that all the marchandize that were in the Hauen, was not halfe the value and woorth of that they ſawe there, then they approached vnto the ſhippe and ſaluted <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſayde: Sirs, is it your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſell vs any of your ſtones, wee are heere diuers Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that will bee glad to buy of them, if yee pleaſe? Sirs, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) as for mée, as this day I will ſell none vntill to morrow in the morning, and then if it pleaſe yée, you ſhall haue of them: therewith the Marchants held their peace and ſpake no more, but there came ſo many Sarazins and Paynims to behold the Shippe, that great maruaile it was to behold them: ſo that the newes thereof ſpread abroad in the City, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall was aduertized thereof, who incontinent accompanied with his Lords, came to the Port ſide, whereas this Ship lay at anchor.</p>
               <p>When the Admirall was come thether, he beheld the Ship, the which hee thought faire and rich, and how that there was neuer Kinge nor Emperour that euer behelde any ſuch, and it ſhined ſo cleare by reaſon of the ſtones, that the Admirall and all ſuch as were with him, thought that it had been the Sunne ſhining in the middeſt of the day. Then hée approached vnto the ſhippe, and found there <hi>Huon</hi> and <hi>Barnard,</hi> the Admirall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted them, and ſaid: Sirs, it appeareth well that you be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men, it is conuenient that you pay mee the Tribute that is accuſtomed to be payd in this Citie. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) it is good reaſon and right, that we pay you as we ought to doe. Sir, heere is twoo ſtones the which I giue you, and I deſire
<pb facs="tcp:4519:206"/>
you to take them in woorth: the Admirall tooke the ſtones and beheld them well, and ſaid. Fréend, nowe you may goe and come into this Citie, to make your marchandize at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to your moſt profite and gaine, for the guift that you haue giuen me is to me more acceptable, then if you had giuen mee the value of foure of the beſt Cities in all this Countrey, right ioyfull was the Admirall, for hee knewe well the vertue of the ſtones, the one of them was of ſuch bountie and dignitie, that the bearer thereof could not bee poyſoned, nor no treaſon could be done nor purpoſed, comming in the preſence of him that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this ſtone, but incontinent the dooer ſhould fall downe dead: and the other ſtone had that vertue and dignitie, that the bearer thereof coulde neuer bee periſhed by fire nor water, nor deſtroyed by yron, for though hee were all a day burning in a hot Ouen or Fournace, hee ſhould not looſe one haire of his head, nor periſh in the Sea. Fréende, (quoth the Admirall) the courteſie that you haue done vnto mee this day ſhall be well rewarded, I will and commaund that throughout my Realme as well of <hi>Perſia</hi> as of <hi>Media,</hi> that you ſhall goe at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſell your Marchandize, and no man ſhall let nor trouble you: but one thinge I would deſire of you to ſhewe mee, what aduenture hath brought you hether? and of whence you bee, and of what Countrey? and in what place you haue founde theſe ſtones, whereof you haue ſo great plentie? howbeit I vnderſtand your language, whereby I knowe that you bee French-men, longe agoe I was in Fraunce and dwelt there, and ſerued in the Court of Kinge <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> and was neuer knowne, and I haue great maruaile where you haue found ſo many goodly ſtones, it is neere hand a Hundred yeares ſince I was guirded with a Swoord: but I neuer ſawe ſo rich ſtones heere before.</p>

Then Duke <hi>Huon</hi> tooke vppon him heart and courage, and with the Mall vppon his necke hee marched foorth fiercely: then hee called the enemy and ſaid. Oh thou that kéepeſt this Veſſell and paſſage, paſſe me incontinent ouer this Sea, and ſet me a land vpon the other ſide. When the Diuell ſawe <hi>Huon</hi> with the Mall vppon his necke, and ſpeaking ſo fiercely, hee ſaid: What art thou? whether wilt thou goe? or what doeſt thou ſeeke for héere? or how art thou ſo bold to come hether? thou ſhalt neuer goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but I ſhall caſt thee into the Sea or ſtrangle thée, and then beare thy Soule into Hell.</p>

Hold thy peace thou Foole, for I am <hi>Cain,</hi> for whome thou haſt taried héere ſo long, I came euen now out of the rowling Tunne vpon the Mountaine, haſt thée and paſſe mée ouer this arme of the Sea, for I ſhall find neither man nor woman that beléeueth in Ieſus Chriſt, but I ſhall ſlay him, to the entent that hell may be filled with their ſoules. When the Féend heard <hi>Huon</hi> ſay ſo, he had great ioy, and ſaid. <hi>Cain,</hi> why haſt thou made me tarie héere ſo long as I haue don? I am ioyfull of thy comming, for I could neuer haue departed out of this place, without thou haddeſt béen deliuered out of the Tunne: therefore <hi>Cain</hi> come on thy way, enter into this Ship preſently, and I ſhall bring thée whereas thou wilt be, gladly I will paſſe thée ouer the Sea, to the entent that thou ſhouldeſt ſlay Chriſtian men and Sarazins, to haue their Soules into

               <p>When the Souldan ſawe his menne ſo ſlaine, he was right ſorrowfull and ſore diſpleaſed, and ſayde vnto the Admirall of <hi>Dorbrey</hi>: I may well curſe the day and time that I beléeued you, for by you I haue loſt my banner, and I ſée my men ſlayn, for if I had ordered my battailes before, this miſchiefe had not hapned, nor that which is apparant to fall, and then the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan couched his Speare, and ſtrake therewith a Knight who was great Maiſter of the houſe of <hi>Perſia</hi> in ſuch wiſe, that the Souldan ranne him cleane through, and ſo he ſerued the ſecond, third, and fourth, and when his Speare was broken, he drew out his Sworde and did therewith great dammage, great crie and noyſe was made when the battailes ioyned, there might haue béene ſeen many horſes running abroad in the field, tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their bridles after them, and their maiſters lyinge in the field amonge the horſe féete, and a horrible thinge it was to ſee and to heare the complaints and cries, that the wounded men made among the horſe féete, hauing no power to relieue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but there died and finiſhed their dayes miſerably, great crie made the Sarazins and Perſians that fought together, and eſpecially whereas <hi>Huon</hi> fought and ſearched the Rankes, and brake the great preaſſes, he beat downe and confounded al that came before him, ſo that none durſt abide before him, for by that time hee had ſlaine ſixe of the Kinges, and fiue Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals

beſide many other, ſo that the noiſe and crie came to the hearing of the Admirall of <hi>Dorbrey,</hi> who did great diſtruction among the Perſians, ſo that it was an horrible thing to ſée and behold, and when hee heard how that there was a Knight that did great dammage and hurt among them, and had ſlaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Kinges and Admirals, hee ſaid vnto a Paynim who had brought vnto him thoſe tidings and newes.

               <p>Then the Giant beheld <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſawe howe hee made the Paynims to retire backe, and then hee ſtrake his Mare with his ſpurres, and <hi>Huon</hi> who well perceiued and ſawe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, feared him: howbeit, he refuſed him not, but came with his Sword in his hand then againſt the Sarazin, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razin (who bare a great hatchet vppon his necke) ſawe <hi>Huon</hi> comming, and ſtrake at him, but as God would haue it he miſt him, for if the ſtroake had lighted vppon h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Huon</hi> felt himſelfe ſo taken, he cryed and called vppon our Lord God, and prayed him to haue pitie and compaſſion of <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> his Wife, for hee ſawe well that his life was determined.

happen to come hether, thy life is loſt: therefore I counſaile thée to depart and ſaue thy ſelfe, or elſe thou art but dead. Then the Souldan and about Twentie men with him departed, and tooke the way by the Sea-ſide to goe towards <hi>Acres,</hi> the which as then appertained vnto the Sarazins, and <hi>Huon</hi> who was mounted vppon the puiſſant Mare, beating downe his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo that none durſt abide his ſtroakes, and the Admirall of <hi>Perſia</hi> following him, regarding that by the hye proweſſe of <hi>Huon</hi> his enemies were confounded and diſcomfited, and ſaw well how that there was no humane bodie that had any power to reſiſt againſt him, and eſcaped without death: then hee ſayd vnto all his Lords and to <hi>Barnard.</hi> Sirs, (quoth the Admirall) yonder before you yee may ſée maruailes and thinges incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be declared, for you may ſée that there is none ſo puiſſant and ſtrong that can reſiſt againſt my Fréend <hi>Huon,</hi> I would to God that he were vnmaried, then hée ſhould neuer depart from mée, for I woulde then giue him my Daughter in mariage, I ſhall bee verie ſore diſpleaſed and diſcomforted when hee ſhall depart from me.</p>

then foure Leagues, and the Admirall had great maruaile that he could not ouertake nor heare any thing of <hi>Huon,</hi> who chaced ſtill the Souldan and followed him ſo long, that <hi>Huon</hi> found the Souldan all alone, for his men could not follow him ſo faſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Horſes were ſo wearie that they coulde not goe no further, the Souldan road vppon a puiſſant and a goodly horſe, and <hi>Huon</hi> who followed him vppon the puiſſant Mare, anon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertooke him, and when he came néere to the Souldan, he ſaid. Oh thou traiterous Souldan, great ſhame and reproach thou maiſt haue, when thou flyeſt away thus all alone without any company, turne thy ſhéeld againſt mée, or elſe I ſhall ſlay thée flying. When the Souldan had well heard <hi>Huon,</hi> hee hadde great maruaile and was greatly feared, for hée knew well that it was he by whome he had receiued ſo great loſſe and damage, and by whome many Kinges and Admirals had béene ſlaine, and thought to himſelfe, if hée returned not, that hee ſhould bee ſlaine, wherefore he tooke courage to himſelfe, ſeeing that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was alone aſwell as he, and alſo hee thought, that it ſhould not be long before he was ſuccoured with ſome of his men that followed him: and therefore like a hardy Knight he turned his horſe head towards <hi>Huon,</hi> who fiercely ranne one at another, and gaue each other great ſtroakes. But it had béene vnto the Souldan but ſmall profite if hee had not béene reſcued by his men, for if they had not come when they did, <hi>Huon</hi> had ſlaine him: but thether came about fortie Knightes Sarazins, and they all ranne at <hi>Huon,</hi> who was ſore diſmayed and abaſhed when he ſawe himſelfe ſo incloſed with his enemies: howbeit, hee might haue ſaued himſelfe well ynough if he had liſted to haue fledde away, but for any feare of them hee would not flye, and he dealt ſuch ſtroakes amonge them, that there was none ſo hardy that durſt approach néere vnto him, ſo ſore they feared him, for hee ſtrake none with a full ſtroake, but that his head was clouen to the braines or to the teeth, ſo that hee needed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no Surgeon.</p>
               <p>When they ſawe that they could not take nor ſlay him, they were right ſorrowfull and angrie: then the Souldan cryed and ſayd. Sirs, vppon him, great ſhame it is vnto you all, when
<pb facs="tcp:4519:229"/>
by the bodie of one man you are ſo put barke, and you ſée well that he hath no ſuccour, goe and ſlay the Mare that hee rydeth vppon with ſpeares and darts, then he ſhall be ſoone ouercome, and you know well that it is he whome I haue ſuffered at my great loſſe and dammage, it is he that hath ſlaine my men, and by him I haue loſt the Battaile, if he eſcape from you, yée ought neuer to be ſéene in any Princes Court. When the Paynims and Sarazins had well vnderſtood their Souldan, then they ſore oppreſſed <hi>Huon,</hi> who did great maruailes in armes, but his puiſſance &amp; vertue ſhould but little haue auailed him, if he had not béen ſhortly aided &amp; ſuccoured, and alſo by reaſon of the rich ſtones and pearles that were vppon him: then the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims and Sarazins who of fortie were left aliue but twentie eight, they ſaw well that they could not ouercome <hi>Huon,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they ſlew the Mare firſt that hee road vppon: therefore they caſt at her Darts and Iauelins in ſuch wiſe, that finally they ſlew her vnder him, whereof <hi>Huon</hi> was right ſorrowfull and ſore diſpleaſed, and was as then in great feare of his life, then he called vppon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to haue pitie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of his ſoule, for he ſaw that his life was at an end, and ſaid. Deare Lord Ieſus Chriſt, I pray thee by thy ſwéet mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to haue pitie and compaſſion of my Wife <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> who is in great perrill and pouertie for the loue of mee, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſert of her part, and alſo I recommend into thy ſauegard my litle Daughter <hi>Clariet.</hi> After that <hi>Huon</hi> had made his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnto our Lord God, he tooke his ſhéeld and his ſword in his hand afoote, and he ſaw where there grew a buſh, he went the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſet his backe thereunto, that the Sarazins and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims ſhould not come behind him, and ſo he ſtood at a bay like a wild Boare baited with Houndes, there was not ſo hardy a Paynim or Sarazin that durſt aſſayle him, they caſt at him ſpeares and darts, but they could neuer hurt his fleſh, he coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe ſo well and ſo ſurely with his ſheeld, that nothing could pierce him.</p>
               <p>The Souldan ſéeing that nothing could hurt him, he ſaid to his men: Ah yée falſe and vntrue Cowards, of Mahomet be yée curſed, when yée cannot ſlay nor take one man alone, and then
<pb facs="tcp:4519:230"/>
the Souldan approached vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> and gaue him a great ſtroake, ſo that he brake his ſheeld in two peeces, whereof <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> then was in great feare of death. Then the Souldan drew backe, and looked behind him into the playnes of <hi>Rames,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the great Battaile had beene: and then hee ſawe comming the Admirall of <hi>Perſia</hi> with twentie Thouſand men, and they came to ſeeke for <hi>Huon,</hi> and when the Souldan ſawe that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour was comming vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> the which he knew by reaſon of the great baner of <hi>Perſia:</hi> then the Souldan ſaid vnto his men.

Néere vnto them was the ſea-ſide, about a League from <hi>Iaffe</hi> the way towardes <hi>Surrey,</hi> there was ready a Galley, the which the Souldan had ſent the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Citie of <hi>Eſcalonne,</hi> the Souldan road thether, and his men left and did forſake <hi>Huon,</hi> who was right wearie and could not long haue endured, nor had not endured ſo longe but for the vertue of the riche ſtones and pearles that were about him. The Souldan to ſaue his life, hee and his men did ſo much, that they came vnto the place whereas the Galley was, and entred into it in as great haſt as they could by any meanes for the ſauegard of their liues, and they did forſake their horſes vppon the Sea-ſide.</p>

Then all the Lordes and Barons aduiſed together, and ſo amonge them was diuers opinions and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, howbeit, they departed euerie man to their owne lodging, becauſe they had day of anſweare, and the next day following: thus the day paſſed without any thinge done, and at night eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man went to reſt, except ſuch as had the charge of the watch that night, who went not to bed as is the order and cuſtome of the warres. <hi>Huon</hi> taried all that night in the Admirals Tent, and about the houre of midnight <hi>Huon</hi> dreamed in his ſleepe, and thought that he was at the Citie of <hi>Mayence</hi> in priſon, and

ſawe the Emperour of <hi>Almaine</hi> take <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> his Wife out of priſon, and ſhe ſéemed vnto him pale and leane and ill colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and howe ſhee was in her Kirtle, and her haire hanging about her ſhoulders, and ten men leading her out of the Town to be burnt, and he thought that ſhe made pitious complaints for <hi>Huon</hi> her Huſband, and for <hi>Clariet</hi> her Daughter. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hee thought that he ſaw paſſe through the ſtreets three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Genlemen, who had beene taken at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> when the Citie was taken, and he thought that he ſaw diuers Gallowes made, and howe the Emperour had ſworne to hang them all, ſo that hee thought that hee was right ſorrowful and ſore grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his mind, to ſee that companie led toward their deaths, for in his ſleepe hee thought verily that all this had beene true and that he could not helpe it.</p>
               <p>Thus as <hi>Huon</hi> was in this paine ſleeping, he gaue an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crie, ſo that the Admirall and <hi>Barnard</hi> awoake therewith in haſt, thinkinge it had beene their enemies that had entred to haue ſlaine them: then they heard <hi>Huon</hi> ſay. Oh good Lord, I pray thée euen for thy Sons ſake and by thy pittie and grace to ſuccour and comfort my good Wife, for certainly I cannot tell but my heart thinketh, that the falſe Emperour will cauſe her to die and all the other Priſoners. Then the Admirall and <hi>Barnard</hi> aroſe vp and came vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> and had well heard his complaints, and ſayd. Ah Sir, diſcomfort not your ſelfe, nor giue no faith nor credence to dreames, for the Emperour will neuer doe ſuch a villany, as to put to death ſo noble a Ladie, it is nothinge but your thought and remembraunce that you haue dayly, the which in the night repreſenteth vnto you ſlée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Ah Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I cannot beleeue but that my Wife hath ſomewhat to do. Alas too long haue I taried here, but if your warres were at an end I would gladly go my way, for I ſhall neuer haue ioy at my heart vntill I may knowe the troth. Then they aroſe for it was day, and the appointed houre was come that al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords of the counſaile ſhould aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Admirals Tent, and euerie man ſat downe vppon benches well couered with cloath of gold, and other rich clothes of ſilke, and when they were there aſſembled, the Marſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe

Sir Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, wee haue communed together, and debated the matter at length, and wee haue had diuers opinions, but wee bee all concluded to ſay nothing, vntill that <hi>Huon</hi> who is there by you hath ſhewed firſt his opinion, what hee thinketh is beſt to bee done in this matter, for it is good reaſon that hee bee heard to ſpeake firſt, and then the Admirall beheld <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſayd.

               <p>After this diſcomfiture they returned to the Abbey of <hi>Cluny,</hi> whereas they were receiued with great ioy of the Abbot and of the Couent, then the Lord of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ergier</hi> ſhewed the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of their diſcomfiture, and then the booties were deuided amongeſt them that had wonne, and all the men of warre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted except a Thowſand men, whome the Abbot retayned for the ſauegard of the towne of <hi>Cluny,</hi> who made many ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes
<pb facs="tcp:4519:236"/>
with the Emperours menne. And after this diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the newes thereof was preſently brought to the Citie of <hi>Mayence</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Tirrey,</hi> who was right ſorrowfull for the death of his Nephew who was his ſiſters ſonne, by reaſon of the ſorrow and great diſpleaſure that he had, for hee was thrée dayes after before he would come foorth of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and on the fourth day he ſent for all his Lords and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and to them he made his complaints, how by the occaſion of Duke <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> he had loſt foure of his Nephews and his Baſtard ſonne, and ſaid. I ought greatly to be grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when I cannot bée reuenged of <hi>Huon,</hi> I thinke hee ſhall neuer returne againe, but ſéeing it is ſo that I can take no ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of him, I ſhall take it vppon his Wife <hi>Eſcleremond,</hi> and vppon the thrée Hundred Priſoners that I brought out of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> but by the ſame Lord that made and fourmed mee to his ſemblance, I ſhall neuer haue ioy at my heart nor eate nor drinke, vntill I haue ſeene <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> burnt in a fire, and the thrée Hundred priſoners hanged and ſtrangled, and I wil that each of you knowe, that he that ſpeaketh to me firſt to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, I ſhall hate him euer after. When the Lords had well heard the Emperour make that promiſe, there was none ſo hardy that durſt ſpeake one woord: then the Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in haſt great plentie of thornes to be caried out of the Citie, vnto a little Mountaine there beſide, and there by to be reared vp certaine Gallowes, to hange thereon the thrée Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Priſoners.</p>
               <p>All this was done as hee commaunded, for more then tenne Load of thornes were caried out to burne the noble Ladie <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleremond,</hi> and ſhe was ſent for out of the priſon by foure hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the Priſoners with her were brought into the Citie, and all to bée beaten by the way. When the noble Ladie ſaw how ſhee was dealt withall, ſhee pitiouſly complained for her good Huſband <hi>Huon,</hi> and for her Daughter <hi>Clariet,</hi> and ſaide. Ah my right ſwéet Lord and Huſband <hi>Huon,</hi> at this time ſhall bee the departure of vs two, and then ſhee called vppon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, praying him by his grace and pity to bring her ſoule into Paradice: thus crying and complayning, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:4519:237"/>
Ladie was ledde through the Towne, and then Ladies and Burgeſſes and Maidens of the Citie ranne to their windowes and dores, and beheld the dolourous and pitifull companie lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towardes their deaths: then they ſayd a high. Ah right noble Ladie, where is become the great beautie that you were woont to bee of? for now your Viſage is pale and diſcoloured that was woont to be ſo faire, and nowe ſo loathed and diſfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, where is become your faire haires that nowe bee ſo blacke and rugged, for the great pouertie that you haue endured? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las noble Ladie, great pitie and compaſſion we haue to ſée you in this eſtate if we could amend it: thus as this Ladie was led through the Towne, ſhe was bemoned of them that ſawe her, the three Hundred Gentlemen were alſo led forth, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Tirrey</hi> and his Lords road after them, for his deſire was to ſee the noble Ladie burnt, and the other Priſoners hanged: hee made haſt, becauſe of the ſorrow that hee had for the death of his Nephewe and of his men, who were newly ſlaine by the meanes of the Abbot of <hi>Cluny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they were yſſued out of the Citie of <hi>Mayence,</hi> Duke <hi>Hildebert</hi> a néere kinſman of the Emperours, was comming into the Citie the ſame time that the Ladie was ledde foorth, and hée ſawe how rudely they dealt with the Ladie: and when he ſawe her, he knew well that it was the faire Ladie <hi>Eſclere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> but when hee ſawe her at that point, the water was in his eyes, and he ſayd vnto them that ledde her. Sirs, go not too faſt, vntill I haue ſpoken with the Emperour, the which they did gladly. When the noble Ladie <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> had well heard and vnderſtood the Duke, ſhee had ſome little hope, ſhee turned her eyes towards him, &amp; ſayd. Ah right noble Prince, haue pittie and compaſſion of mee, for I haue done nothinge whereby I ſhould deſerue to die. When the Duke had well vnderſtood her, he had ſuch pitie that he could ſpeake no word, his heart was ſo full of ſorrowe, and then he road as faſt as he might to méet with the Emperour, and paſſed by the thrée hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred priſoners, and had great pity and compaſſion of them, and ſo he came vnto the Emperour all wéeping, and ſaid. Ah right noble Emperour, I require you in the honour of the paſſion
<pb facs="tcp:4519:237"/>
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, haue pitie and compaſſion of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourous companie, that are likely to die this day, remember that it is nowe in the holy time of Lent, wherefore I require you to reſpite their liues vntill it be paſt Eaſter, and Sir, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I require you, for all the ſeruice that I and mine haue done vnto you, graunt me but this requeſt for my reward, the which is both reaſonable and iuſt, great wronge you doe to reuenge your anger vppon this noble Ladie, you haue chaced her out of her Countrey, Landes and Signiories, the which you hold in your handes, and take the Reuenewes and profits thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you bee not ſufficed with this, I doubt that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt will be ſore diſpleaſed with you. When the Emperour had well heard the Duke his Cozen, hee ſtoode ſtill and ſpake haſtely, and ſayd. Faire Coozen, I haue well heard you, and therefore I anſweare you in briefe wordes, how that if all the men that bee in mine Empire, and all the Prieſtes and Friers were here, and did preach vnto me a whole yeare, deſiring me to reſpite this Ladies death and the other that be with her: I would doe nothing for all them, and therefore ſpeake no more to me in that matter, for by the beard that hangeth vnder my chinne, ſince I cannot haue <hi>Huon</hi> her huſband at my will, I ſhall neuer eat nor drinke vntill I haue ſéene her burnt and the other perſons hanged. For when I remember the death of my Nephewes and of my deare Sonne, the which haue béen ſlaine by <hi>Huon,</hi> there is no member in my bodie, but that trembleth for ſorrow and diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>When the good Duke <hi>Hildebert</hi> vnderſtood the Emperour, hee had great ſorrowe at his heart, and departed without any word ſpeaking and without any leaue taking, but returned from thence, and hee became full of yre and diſpleaſure, then the Emperour <hi>Tirrey</hi> cryed with a hye voyce and ſayde, howe that he would ſhortly diſpatch the matter, to ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady burnt, and ledde to the hill whereas the fire was readie. When the Ladie perceiued the place whereas ſhee ſhould die in, ſhee caſt out a great crie, and made a pitifull complaint to our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and ſayd. Ah right ſweet Lord Ieſus Chriſt, thou knoweſt that for the loue of thée I am chriſtened, to beléeue in
<pb facs="tcp:4519:238"/>
thy Lawes wherein I will liue and die, and I ſée well that my dayes are but ſhort, and thou knoweſt well that there is no cauſe wherein I haue deſerued death: therefore I require thee humbly to haue pitie and compaſſion of my Soule, and that thou wilt vouchſafe to kéepe and preſerue my Huſband <hi>Huon,</hi> and my Daughter <hi>Clariet.</hi> Thus as yee haue heard the noble Ducheſſe <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> made her complaints, her handes bound and kneeling vppon her knées before the ſtake, abiding for the houre of her death. Nowe let vs leaue to ſpeake of this noble Ladie, vntill we haue occaſion to returne againe: and ſpeake of the noble King <hi>Oberon</hi> and of his companie.</p>

Ah Sir, (quoth the Duke of <hi>Auſtrich</hi>) it hadde beene better for you to haue beleeued Duke <hi>Hildebert</hi> your Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen: knowe ſurely, that you haue greatly diſpleaſed our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſince that you would doe ſuch cruell iuſtice in the holy time of Lent. Thus after theſe two Knights of the Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hadde reſcued the good Ladie and the other Priſoners, they tooke them and the Ladie and brought them vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and ſhewed themſelues openly, and when they were in the preſence of the Emperour and the Priſoners with them, and the Emperour ſaw that there were but twoo Knightes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vppon horſe-backe, hee ſet little by them, and ſaid. How are you ſo bolde and ſo hardy, to deliuer and to take out of my mens handes thoſe that are condemned to die by iuſtice? and beſides that you haue ſlaine many of my men, and nowe bringe them into my preſence whom I haue condemned to die: where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore I will that you well know, that before I eat or drinke you and all they ſhalbe hanged, and the Ladie <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> burned,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:240"/>
nor I ſhall not depart from hence vntill I haue ſeen you all dye the death.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Gloriand</hi> and <hi>Mallabron</hi> lifted vp their viſors, and ſhewed their faces, and they ſéemed vnto all them that ſawe them, that they neuer ſawe before two ſo faire Knightes in all their liues. Then <hi>Gloriand</hi> ſayde vnto the Emperour: Sir, of you nor of your threatninges wee make thereof but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: but Sir, knowe for troth, that the noble King <hi>Oberon</hi> commandeth you by vs, in as much as you feare your life, that you bee not ſo hardy, any further to doe any ill or iniurie, nor commaund to bee done vnto this noble Ladie that is heere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor to theſe other Priſoners, vntill Eaſter day bee paſt. And alſo Kinge <hi>Oberon</hi> commaundeth you, that you doe keepe this Ladie in your houſe, cloathed and apparelled, and as well gouerned, and to bee accompanied with Ladies and Damſels to ſerue her honourably, as well as if ſhe were your owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Daughter, and that in like wiſe theſe Priſoners to be new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrayed and ordered, aſwell as other Knights of your houſe, and Sir, we warne and charge you, that in this that wee haue ſayd, that you do not the contrarie for any thing that may fall, for if you do otherwiſe, there is no mortall man ſhall ſaue your life: thus the right noble Kinge <hi>Oberon</hi> commaundeth you to doe, who is Soueraigne Lord and Gouernor of all the Realme of the Fayrie.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour <hi>Tirrey</hi> had well heard theſe Knightes of the Fayrie thus ſpeake vnto him, and ſawe howe they were armed with their Swordes in their handes, taynted with the bloud of his Almaynes, hee had great feare and beheld his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and ſayde. Sirs, I pray you to giue me ſome good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile in this ſerious buſineſſe, wee haue well heard much ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of King <hi>Oberon,</hi> and of his great Acts and déeds: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I feare him much, yée may wel ſée what two of his knights haue done, they haue reſcued them that I haue condemned to die, and ſlaine diuers of my men. Alſo you heare, what word he ſendeth me by his two Knights, that I ſhould keepe this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and the other Priſoners honourably, and that I ſhould not be ſo hardy, to put them to any danger vntill Eaſter be paſſed.
<pb facs="tcp:4519:240"/>
Then an ancient knight ſayd: Sir, know for troth that King <hi>Oberon</hi> is puiſſant and wiſe, for there is nothing in the world but that he knoweth it, and alſo as often as hée liſt, hee can bee whereas he will wiſh himſelfe, and with as great number of people as hee liſt: and therefore Sir beléeue ſurely, that if you doe otherwiſe then he hath commaunded you to doe, theſe twoo knightes of his that be héere preſent, haue puiſſance ſufficient to deſtroy you, and Kinge <hi>Oberon</hi> to ſit ſtill at home: therefore Sir mine aduiſe is, that you anſweare theſe two knights, that all that Kinge <hi>Oberon</hi> hath commaunded you to doe by them, that you will doe it ſurely: and then all the other Lordes gaue the Emperour the ſame counſaile. When the Emperour had well heard and vnderſtood his Lordes and Barons, he turned him vnto the two Knightes of the Fayrie, and ſaid. Sirs, yée ſhall ſalute me to King <hi>Oberon</hi> and ſay, that as for me, I ſhall doe euerie thing as hee hath commaunded me to doe to the beſt of my power. Sir Emperour, (quoth <hi>Gloriand</hi>) if you will doe as you ſay, the king will take you for his Fréend, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon we commend you to God.</p>
               <p>Thus the two knights departed, ſo that the Emperour nor none other perſon knew not where they were become, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euerie man had great maruaile and were ſore abaſhed. And thus <hi>Gloriand</hi> and <hi>Mallabron</hi> within a while came to the City of <hi>Momur,</hi> whereas they found king <hi>Oberon,</hi> to whome they ſhewed all that they had done.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Owe ſheweth the Hiſtorie,</hi> that after the two knightes of the Fayrie were departed, and vaniſhed away out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Emperour, and that the Emperor was returned into the Citie of <hi>Mayence,</hi> with the ladie <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> and with the other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, whereof the Burgeſſes, Ladies, and Damſels of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had great ioy of their good aduenture, and the Emperour had them into his Pallaice, and deliuered vnto them Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers well dreſt and hanged as it appertained thereunto, and the noble Ducheſſe <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> hadde foure ladies to ſerue her, and ſhe was bathed and waſhed, and new apparelled, as well and as richly as though ſhee had beene the Emperours owne proper Daughter, ſo that within a ſhort ſpace ſhe came againe to her beautie, and to be as faire and well fauoured as euer ſhe was, and in like wiſe ſo did all the other Priſoners, who were kept alſo in faire and rich Chambers and new apparelled, and had their eaſe and pleaſures as other knights of the Emperors Court had. But aſſoone as thrée weekes were paſſed, the great hate that the Emperour had vnto the noble ladie and to the other Priſoners, conſtrained him to take from them the ioy and eaſe that they were in: and turned the ſame into pitifull weepinges and great lamentations. And the Emperour <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi> ſware, that for all kinge <hi>Oberon,</hi> or for any thinge that
<pb facs="tcp:4519:241"/>
he could doe, he would neuer be in peace in his heart, vntill he had ſet all the companie againe intd priſon, and beſides that, he ſware that Eaſter ſhould not bee no ſooner paſt, but that the Ladie <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> ſhould bee burnt and all the other priſoners hanged, and vppon them to take vengeance in the deſpite of <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> who had done him ſo much trouble that hee could not forget it.</p>
               <p>Then hee commaunded to take againe the Ducheſſe <hi>Eſclere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and to put her and all the other priſoners into the priſon againe, the which was done according to his commandement. Then the Ducheſſe <hi>Eſcleremond</hi> and all the other Priſoners were right ſorrowfull, and were in great feare, and ſaide each to other. Alas now our deathes approach, and when that the Ladie ſawe that ſhe was ſet againe in priſon, ſhe began ſore to weepe and complaine for the Duke <hi>Huon</hi> her Huſband. Too longe (quoth ſhee) you tarie, for I ſée none other way but that my death approacheth, for you ſhall not come in time, well may I curſe the houre that euer I was borne, for in all my life I haue had but ſorrowe and heauineſſe and dolours in ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, better it had been for mee to haue béen dead, then to ſpend my life in this darke Priſon, right deuoutly ſhee called vppon our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt to haue pittie and compaſſion of her. Thus was this noble Ducheſſe ſet againe in priſon, and alſo the thrée Hundred Priſoners, whereas they ſuffered great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and pouertie, for other thing had they not to liue by, but Barley bread and cleare water. Now we will leaue to ſpeake of them, and ſpeake of Duke <hi>Huon,</hi> who was arriued at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellis.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S yee haue heard heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> howe <hi>Huon</hi> was at <hi>Marſellis,</hi> and after that hee had iourned there foure dayes, hee made him readie to depart, &amp; bought Mules and horſes for himſelfe, and for <hi>Barnard</hi> and for his companie, and then hee charged his Somers, and vppon one of them hee truſſed the <hi>Griffens</hi> foote, the which was great and horrible, and couered it becauſe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man ſhoulde not ſée it. When hee was readie and euerie thing truſſed, hee departed from <hi>Marſellis,</hi> and roade ſo by his iourneys, that hee paſſed by <hi>Prouence,</hi> and came vnto <hi>Maſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noys,</hi> and vppon a Thurſday at night he arriued at the Towne of <hi>Tournous.</hi> And when they had ſupped, hée called <hi>Barnard</hi> his Coozen, and ſayd. Coozen, I pray you to ſtay héere, for I wil goe to ſée mine Vncle the good Abbot of <hi>Cluny,</hi> and <hi>Clariet</hi> my Daughter, whome I ſore deſire to ſée, and ſhortly I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe vnto you, I will goe priuily diſguiſed, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that I will not bee knowne. Sir, (quoth <hi>Barnard</hi>) ſéeing that it is your pleaſure, we muſt be content. Then they went to bed, and in the Morning <hi>Huon</hi> aroſe vp, and apparelled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe like a Pilgrim, with a ſtaffe in his hand and a bag about his necke, and with great boots vppon his Legges, hee hadde a great beard and long haire: wherefore hee ſéemed well a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime that came out from a farre Countrey, and ſo he had done indéede.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Barnard,</hi> and his company ſawe him ſo apparelled, they laughed and ſaide. Sir, it appeareth well by your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that you are eſcaped out of ſome good place, it ſéemeth to vs, that if you will ſhake your ſtaffe, you will make the money to auoyd out of mens purſes, you are ſo bold a beggar. When <hi>Huon</hi> heard them, hee laughed, and tooke leaue of them, and departed all alone with his bagge about his necke, ſo afoote hée went vntill he came vnto <hi>Cluny,</hi> and then he came vnto the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey gate, and called the Porter vnto him, and ſayd. Fréend, I pray you to let mée enter, then hée opened the wicket and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb facs="tcp:4519:242"/>
                  <hi>Huon,</hi> who ſéemed to him to be a tal and a goodly man, and ſayd. Pilgrime, enter when you pleaſe. Then <hi>Huon</hi> entred in at the wicket, and ſayde vnto the Porter. Fréende, I come ſtraight from beyond the great Sea, and haue kiſſed the holy Sepulchre, and haue ſuffered much paine and pouertie, and becauſe before this time I haue béene héere with the Abbot of this place, therefore I thought that I would not paſſe by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking with him, I pray you to ſhewe mee that courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that I may ſpeake with him, for hée will ſoone know mée. Sir, (quoth the Porter) it ſéemeth vnto mee by your manners, that you ſéeme to be a man of a good place: therefore I giue you leaue to goe into the houſe at your pleaſure, and you ſhall finde our good Abbot in his Hall, whereas hee is communing with his Brethren, certainly, I knowe well that you ſhall bee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnto him, if hee haue of you any knowledge, for a more noble man, courteous, and liberall you ſhall not find vpon this ſide of the Sea. Fréend, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) your courteſie may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile you.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> went into the Hall, whereas hee found the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot with his Brethren, and then hee ſaluted the Abbot and all his Couent. Fréend, (quoth the Abbot) you are welcome, I pray you to ſhewe mée from whence you come? Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I ſhall ſhew you the troth, I come now from beyond the Sea, from the holy City of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> whereas I haue kiſſed the holy Sepulchre, and where our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was quicke and dead, I haue béen in thoſe parts more then Seauen yéeres, and the cauſe why I am come hether to ſée you is this, I found there a young Knight of mine age, named <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and he ſayd that he is your Nephew, and when he ſaw that I would depart from thence to come into his Countrey, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prayed mée to recommend him vnto you: and therefore I am come vnto you to doe his meſſuage, for he and I hath been together in diuers Battailes, and great amitie haue béen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs. When the good Abbot had well heard and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Pilgrim, many teares fell from his eyes and trickled downe his chéekes, when he heard his Nephew <hi>Huon</hi> named, and ſaide. Fréende, I pray you (if it bee true as you ſay) to
<pb facs="tcp:4519:243"/>
ſhew mée the troth if you haue ſéen my Nephew <hi>Huon,</hi> for it is he that I loue beſt in all this world, and deſire moſt to ſée him, and I pray you to ſhewe vnto mée what is his minde, either to returne hether or elſe to abide there ſtill? I would to God that I were in debt to pay a thouſand Markes of gould, ſo that hee were as now héere in this Hall. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) your Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew whome you deſire ſo much to ſée, before a Moneth be paſt he will (by the grace of God) bee héere with you, and Sir, hee ſhewed mée at my departing from him, that he hath a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whom you haue nouriſhed and brought vp, and he charged me greatly that I ſhould deſire of you to ſée her before I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from you, he knoweth not whether ſhe bee aliue or dead, I woulde gladly ſée her if it were your pleaſure. Fréend, (quoth the Abbot) right gladly you ſhall ſée her, I ſhall cauſe her to come hether, and then you may ſée her at your eaſe, and I dare well ſay vnto you, that in all the world you ſhall find no fairer nor a ſweeter creature, nor more wiſer of her age nor better learned, and yet ſhe is but Ten yeares of age.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> vnderſtood the Abbot, you may well know that hee hadde great ioy at his heart priuily, and thanked our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Then the Abbot called vnto him a right notable Knight named Sir <hi>Emerie,</hi> and commaunded him to goe and fetch thether his Néece <hi>Clariet,</hi> the Knight went into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whereas the faire Ladie was with other foure noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who had brought her vp: then Sir <hi>Emerie</hi> ſaluted the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and the other that were with her. When the young Ladie perceiued Sir <hi>Emerie,</hi> ſhe aroſe vp and rendred to him his ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and right humbly ſaying. Sir Knight I am ioyfull of your commig, I pray you to ſhewe mee of your newes and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges. Certainly faire Ladie, (quoth the Knight) hether is come a Pilgrim, who is come from beyond the Sea, and hee hath ſhewed vnto the Abbot your Vncle tidinges of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duke <hi>Huon</hi>: therefore your Vncle deſireth you to come and ſpeake with him. When the Ladie heard ſpeaking of her Father, with all her heart ſhe deſired to knowe ſome certaine tidinges, and then ſhee and her Damſels departed out of the Chamber, and came into the Hall to the Abbot her Vncle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb facs="tcp:4519:243"/>
with twoo notable Knightes, then ſhee entred into the Hall richly apparelled, no man could deſcribe her beautie, for ſhee was ſo well fourmed, that nature her ſelfe could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her, her ſkinne was as white as the flower in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, and coloured like the red Roſe, her haunches lowe, and her pappes ſomewhat ryſing, her throat ſmooth and cleare, her chinne vaunted, her mouth as vermeill as a Roſe, her téeth ſmall and well ranged and white, her face white and well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured mingled white and red, her eyes ſmiling, her chéere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous to behoulde, her noſe ſtraight, her fore-head white, her haire yellowe, and her eares gentle and cloſe, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe the tenth part of her excellent beautie, none could regard her nor looke vppon her but that praiſed and loued her, all her beautie and ſweete demeanour, and great humilitie that was in her, if I ſhoulde héere deſcribe it, it would bee ouer-long to rehearſe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> had well ſéene his Daughter <hi>Clariet</hi> who was ſo faire, hee gladly behelde her without making of any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Then the Abbot tooke his Néece by the hand, and ledde her vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſaid. Pilgrim, how ſay you by her, ſhee hath not beene ſore trauailed nor much come in the Sunne, I haue kept her a long time, and if ſhe be garniſhed with beauty, in like wiſe ſo ſhe is with witte and bountie, ſhee is Daughter vnto Duke <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the man that I moſt loue in this world, I woulde to God that I did ſée him as I doe you nowe, but if God ſend mee life and health, this Ladie ſhall bee richly maried, I will giue her goods that ſhe ſhalbe rich and puiſſant. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I pray to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to giue her good fortune, and that ſhee may bee ſo maried, that her bloud thereby may be lifted vp and exalted: then the faire Ladie <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet</hi> ſayd vnto <hi>Huon.</hi> Sir Pilgrim, I pray you to ſhewe me, if you know any tidings of my Father Duke <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Faire Ladie, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) hee and I together haue beene a long time beyond the Sea, and Companions together, and we ſought the Souldan of <hi>Babilon</hi> that nowe is, it is not hee that was ſet there by <hi>Huon,</hi> after that he had ſlaine the great Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Gaudiſe,</hi> it is another, who ſince that time conquered both
<pb facs="tcp:4519:244"/>
the Citie and the Countrey of <hi>Egipt,</hi> many aduentures <hi>Huon</hi> and I haue ſuffered, but at the end wee diſcomfited the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, and his men are ſlaine and deſtroyed. Pilgrim, (quoth the faire Ladie <hi>Clariet</hi>) I require you to ſhew me if you know, whether my deare Father will returne hether again or no? the which is the thing in the world that I moſt deſire? Faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, (quoth he) I anſweare you, that before twoo Moneths bee paſſed, you ſhall ſée him héere in good health. I pray vnto our Lord God (quoth the Ladie) that it may be ſo, that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer my Mother out of the priſon, whereas ſhee is in great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and miſerie.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> had well heard and vnderſtood his Daughter, he would no longer hide himſelfe, but ſayd. My right deare Daughter, before Auguſt be paſſed, I ſhall deliuer her or die in the paine, for I ſhall make ſuch warre againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Tirrey,</hi> that yet before I die I ſhall ſtrike off his head from his bodie, whatſoeuer fall thereof. When the Ladie heard <hi>Huon,</hi> how he ſayd that hee was her Father, ſhee changed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and bluſhed as ruddie as a Roſe, and thought to her ſelfe by the words that he ſpake, that hee was her Father, whereof ſhe was right ioyfull, and ſaid. Ah Sir, I pray you if you bee Duke <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> my Father, to ſhew me. My right deare Daughter, beléeue it ſurely, for I will no longer hide it from you. When the Ladie heard that he was her Father, ſhe clipped him and Twentie times kiſſed him. Then the Abbot came and embraced him and ſayd. My right deare Nephewe, the ioy that my heart hath of your comming, is to mee ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that I cannot tell whether I dreame or not that I ſée you heere, and then againe hee embraced him, making the greateſt ioy in the world. Alſo there was <hi>Clariet</hi> his Daughter, who embraced and kiſſed him: then all that were in the houſe came thether to make great chéere and feaſting. Faire Nephewe, (quoth the Abbot) I am ſore abaſhed that you be returned with ſo ſmall a companie. Good Vncle, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) it could bee none otherwiſe, I haue had ſuch fortunes vppon the Sea, that the moſt part of my men are dead and periſhed, &amp; ſome by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie, and ſome are returned into their owne Countreys, and
<pb facs="tcp:4519:244"/>
eſpecially they that went with me are abiding at the Rocke of the <hi>Adamant,</hi> and there all be dead by famine, and they that were my Guides to haue brought mee vnto <hi>Euphame,</hi> are in like wiſe dead there.</p>
               <p>Then Duke <hi>Huon</hi> beganne to ſhewe vnto the Abbot all the aduentures that he had, ſince he departed from the noble Citie of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> there were ſome that heard it, that tooke it for a mocke and a lye, he ſhewed of ſo many great maruailes, they thought that the moſt part of them were lyes, and one ſaide to another: Great aduantage haue theſe Vagabounds to lye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they finde no man to ſay them nay, and if any man ſay nay, their anſweare is readie to ſay, go and ſée: then the good Abbot ſayd. Faire Nephew, if I were of the age to beare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, gladly I would goe with you to ayde you to deſtroy this Emperour, who hath done you ſo much ill, I ſhall ſend for ſuch a number of men of warre, and pay them with my Treaſure, the which I haue long time gathered together, and ſhall ayde you to make ſuch war, that it ſhall alwayes be had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, or elſe I would die in the paine and all they that ſhould goe with me, and to cauſe him to make you amends, of all the ils and dammages that he hath done vnto you, yet ſomewhat I haue done alreadie, for it is not long ſince, that one of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Nephewes were ſlaine by my men, and all they that were with him ſlaine or taken, for Nephewe, I haue gathered together a great Treaſure, that I may therewith entertaine a hundred Thouſand men for two yeares, without ſelling or lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pledge any foote of Land appertaining to my Church, but as now I am ſo old that I cannot ride out, for I am a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fourteene yeares of age: and therefore ſéeing that I cannot goe with you, I ſhall abandon vnto you all my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and take thereof as much as it ſhall pleaſe you. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) you make me ſo great an offer, that once before I die, I truſt to render vnto you the double value, by the grace of God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4519:246"/>
Princes mouth (quoth they) neuer yſſued a lye, there was much ioy made, the Tables were ſet and they went to dinner, there ſatte the Abbot and <hi>Huon</hi> and <hi>Clariet</hi> his Daughter: Of their Seruice and meates I will make no rehearſall, for they were richly ſerued. After that they had dyned and grace ſayd, all the Monkes of the Couent came and knéeled downe before <hi>Huon,</hi> and humbly required him of pardon for <hi>Damp Iohan Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer,</hi> who was too haſty to ſpeake, and all was through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of youth and ill aduiſed. When Duke <hi>Huon</hi> ſaw all the Monkes before him vppon their knées, deſiring him to pardon the Monke of his folly, hee ſayd vnto them. Sirs, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to fulfill your deſires, for I am not come hether to trouble any man. When the good Abbot had well heard <hi>Huon</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew pardon his Monke, hee thanked him and ſaid. Sir, by Saint <hi>Bennet,</hi> if you had not pardoned him, he ſhould not haue come out of priſon this yeare. Then the Monkes went to the Priſon, and they ſhewed vnto the Monke that was in priſon, what maruailes were done in his abſence, and howe their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot who was a Hundred and fourtéene yeares of age, was now become of the age of Thirtie yeares. Sirs, (quoth hée) I am glad of my deliuerance, but I cannot beléeue that it is ſo as you ſay, nor I will not beléeue it vntill I ſée it: then hee went into the Hall, whereas the Abbot and <hi>Huon</hi> were together, and when hee ſawe the good Abbot young againe, then hee kneeled downe and cried <hi>Huon</hi> mercie, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>equired him of pardon, the which <hi>Huon</hi> graunted.</p>
               <p>Then there was great ioy, and the Abbot ſayd. Nephewe, ſend for men of warre on all ſides, and I ſhall pay their wages to the number of twentie Thouſand men, for I haue gould and ſiluer ynough, and let vs ſend for all our Fréends, and we ſhall bee a great number of men able to fight with the Emperour, who hath wrongfully and without cauſe diſenherited you, and keepeth your Wife in priſon, whereof my heart is ſo ſorrowfull that I can no longer endure it. Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) if I can finde any other way to come to peace with the Emperour, then my Speare and ſhéeld and no man ſlaine, I would thinke then that I had well ſped, for if I might doe ſo much with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb facs="tcp:4519:246"/>
that he would render vnto me my Landes and Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories, and my Wife and men, and that thereby I might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Liege-man, I would then thinke that I had made an honourable end, for I haue done him great dammage. Faire Nephewe, (quoth the Abbot) I woulde faine knowe by what manner you coulde bring this matter about. Vncle, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) this night I will ſtudie vppon the matter, the which I truſt in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to bringe to a good and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous end.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>fter that <hi>Huon</hi> and the good</hi> Abbot had deuiſed together of diuers things, <hi>Huon</hi> wrote a Letter vnto his men being at <hi>Tournous,</hi> that they ſhould come vnto him to the Abbey of <hi>Cluny,</hi> hee ſent a Gentleman of the Abbey to fetch them, and when hée was come to <hi>Tournous,</hi> and had deliuered his Letters vnto <hi>Barnard,</hi> they made them readie, and truſſed their Somers and departed from thence, and they road ſo longe, that they came in at the gates of the Abbey of <hi>Cluny,</hi> the ſame time <hi>Huon</hi> and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot were leaning out at a window, the Abbot ſaw fiftéene So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers charged, and ſeauen Mules and Mulets, whereof he had great maruaile of whence they were, and ſaid to <hi>Huon.</hi> Faire Nephew, can you tell vnto whome appertaine theſe Somers, or what be they that bringeth them? Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) know for troth that I haue conquered them, and they are mine, and yonder is <hi>Barnard</hi> that doth conduct them, who hath had much paine and trouble before hee could find mee. Faire Nephewe, (quoth the Abbot) great ioye I haue at my heart, that hee hath
<pb facs="tcp:4519:247"/>
ſought you ſo long to find you at the laſt, nor I could not haue ſent a more noble man, you ought greatly to loue him, and alſo he is our Kinſman, and alwayes hee hath beene vnto you true and faithfull. Sir, in him I haue found all that you ſay: and Sir, the great Somer that you ſée yonder with twoo great Coffers well banded, they be full of precious ſtones, and Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els more woorth then foure good Cities, I will leaue them héere with you to keepe for the marriage of my Daughter, and with thoſe words hee kiſſed her. Deare Nephew, (quoth the good Abbot) and beſides that you will giue her, I ſhall depart with her largely of my Treaſure.</p>
               <p>Therewith <hi>Barnard</hi> came thether and all the other of his companie, and when the Abbot perceiued <hi>Barnard,</hi> he came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him right ioyfully with his armes abroad and clipped and kiſſed him, and made vnto him great feaſt and chéere and to all his companie. Then Duke <hi>Huon</hi> and the good Abbot his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the faire Ladie <hi>Clariet</hi> his Daughter, went into their Chamber and diſcharged the Somers, and opened euerie Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. When the Abbot had ſéen the riches that were in them, hee was neuer ſo abaſhed and ſayd. Ah Duke <hi>Huon</hi> faire Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe, I thinke you haue brought hether riches to buy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the whole Realme of Fraunce. Then Duke <hi>Huon</hi> tooke a Coller of gould full of precious ſtones, that the clearneſſe of them illumined all the houſe, and <hi>Huon</hi> did put the Coller a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Daughters necke, and kiſſed her mouth and ſayd. My deare and louing Daughter, I giue you this Coller, I neuer gaue you any thing before, it is ſo rich that the ſtones therein are woorth a Realme or a Duchy. When the Ladie ſaw the rich Coller, ſhée was right ioyfull, and kneeled downe before her Father, and humbly thanked him: then <hi>Huon</hi> ſhewed all his Treaſure vnto his good Vncle the Abbot, and when all had beene ſéene and viewed, the Abbot did put them into the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. Then <hi>Huon</hi> apparelled himſelfe with rich apparell, and he ſeemed then to be a Prince of high degrée, he was ſo faire to behold, that all ſuch as ſawe him had great pleaſure to behould him, there hee made good chéere and feaſting for the ſpace of right dayes, and vppon the ninth day in the Morning, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb facs="tcp:4519:247"/>
from thence priuily, and tooke <hi>Barnard</hi> with him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of any perſon except the Abbot, vnto whom he ſayde. Faire Vncle, I and <hi>Barnard</hi> will depart, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to let no man liuing know of my departing, as long as you can keepe it ſecret, vntill you doe héere from mee ſome tidings. Sir, it ſhall bee done, (quoth the Abbot) and I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the ſauegard of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéech him humbly that you may haue peace with the Emperour <hi>Tirrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Huon</hi> and <hi>Barnard</hi> departed before any man were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and they tooke their way towards the Citie of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and reſted not vntill they came to <hi>Coleyne,</hi> and the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they road vntill they came within a League of the Citie of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and then they entred into a wood, &amp; there they aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Then <hi>Huon</hi> apparelled himſelfe like a Pilgrim in habite hoſe and ſhooes, and he tooke a hearbe and rubbed therewith his Viſage, in ſuch ſort, that hee ſéemed that hee had beene in the Sunne Ten yeares, ſo that he was vnknowne, and <hi>Barnard</hi> that was with him coulde not knowe him by the face, and then <hi>Barnard</hi> laughed: then he tooke his ſtaffe and ſcrippe, and ſaide vnto <hi>Barnard.</hi> Sir, goe your way before into the Citie with our horſes, and take none acquaintance of mee though you ſée me, and take vp ſome ſmall lodging, ſo <hi>Barnard</hi> went on before, and <hi>Huon</hi> faire and eaſily went after him, and ſo entred into the Citie, and hee had with him the Thirtie rich ſtones in his boſome. When hee was entred into the Citie, hee reſted not vntill he came to the Pallaice, and as hee went vp the ſtayres, he met the Steward of the Emperours houſe, vnto whome hée ſayd. Sir, I pray you in the honour of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to giue mee ſome meate, for I am ſo hungrie that I can ſcarce goe vppon my Legges, nor I haue no monney to buy mee one morſell of bread. When the Steward had well heard and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Pilgrim, hee beheld him well, and ſawe howe his ſtaffe ſhaked in his hand, the which he thought had béene with féebleneſſe and pouertie, and hadde of him great pitie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and demaunded of him from whence hee came? Sir, (quoth <hi>Huon</hi>) I come ſtraight from the holy Sepulchre, and I
<pb facs="tcp:4519:248"/>
haue endured much pouertie and miſerie. Fréend, (quoth the Steward) I pray you to tarie for me héere a little ſeaſon, vntil I haue been in the Priſon to carie meat vnto the Ducheſſe <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleremond,</hi> and to the other Priſoners, who crye out through fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and rage that they be in, for if they bee longe in this caſe that they bee in now, they cannot endure it, for the Emperour hath taken ſuch an inward hate againſt her, and againſt them that are in priſon with her, that he hath made promiſe, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as Eaſter is paſſed the Ladie ſhall be burnt, and the other Priſoners al hanged, and this day is Shroue Thurſday, ſo that they haue to liue but fiue dayes, and I am right ſorrie for the noble Ladie, that our Emperour will put her to death without a iuſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Huon</hi> had well heard that, hee hadde no member nor ioynt but that trembled, and he caſt downe his Viſage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne pitifully to wéepe, and ſuffered the Steward to paſſe and ſpake no woorde vnto him, but returned into the Towne, and went and lodged in the Towne right heauie and ſorrowfull: howbeit, he was right ioyfull, in that his Wife was aliue, for he greatly feared that ſhe had been dead. He lodged in a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Burgeſſes houſe, who receiued him wel for the loue of God, but whatſoeuer he had there he could neither eat nor drinke, for the ſorrowe and gréefe that he had at his heart: then hee ſayde vnto his Hoſt. Sir, to Morrowe is good Friday, the which day I thinke the Emperour will giue great Almes. Fréend, (quoth his Hoſt) you may ſurely beléeue, that the Emperour will giue as to morrow great Almes, hee will giue of his goods ſo largely vnto all poore men, that if they come vnto him that day they ſhall bee all ſatiſfied, you ſhall not finde a Prince that doth giue greater Almes, and of one thing I aduertiſe you: the Emperour hath one cuſtome, that the firſt poore Pilgrim that commeth vnto him to morrowe ſhalbee happie, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world be it neuer ſo deare, but if hee demaund it of the Emperour, it ſhall not bee denied him, it muſt bee at the ſame houre and time that the Emperour goeth vnto his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to ſay his Oriſons. When <hi>Huon</hi> had well vnderſtood his Hoſt, he beganne to reioyce, and thought within himſelfe, that
<pb facs="tcp:4519:248"/>
if hee could in any wiſe, hee would bee the firſt that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund Almes of the Emperour, but that ſhould be neither gold nor ſiluer, it ſhould bee his Wife and his men that hee hath in Priſon: and alſo if he may he will aſke therewith his Landes and Signiories.</p>
               <p>Then the Hoſt went to his reſt, and <hi>Huon</hi> abode in his Chamber alone, and ſlept not of all the night, but thought how he might deliuer his Wife, and the other Priſoners that were with her, and all the night he was at his prayers, humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring our Lord God to counſaile and to ayd him to recouer his good Wife <hi>Eſcleremond.</hi> Early in the Morning hee aroſe and made him readie, and tooke his ſcrippe and ſtaffe, and went ſtraight to the Pallaice, and ſat down vpon the greeces where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Emperour ſhould paſſe: at which time the Emperour was newe ryſen, and there were many other Pilgrimes that were there abiding for the Emperours comming, and euerie man coueted to haue the firſt guift, but <hi>Huon</hi> did ſo much by his ſubtiltie, that hee was the firſt that entred into the Chappell, and none other perceiued him, and he did hide himſelfe cloſely in a corner néere vnto the Emperours Oratorie, and there hee ſat ſtill without any word ſpeaking, abiding there for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Emperour.</p>

When the Emperour had made his prayers, hee aroſe and turned him to haue gone into his Oratorie, and <hi>Huon</hi> who had great deſire to bee the firſt, and to haue the firſt guift of the Emperour, hee drewe out of his bagge a rich ſtone, the which was of ſuch vertue, that whoſoeuer did beare it about him could not bee ouercome with his enemie, nor coulde not be drowned nor burnt, the ſtone had ſuch great vertue, that none could eſteeme the value thereof: and beſides that it caſt ſuch clearneſſe in the Chappell, that the Emperour was aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thereat, nor hee knewe not from whence that light ſhould come.

Then <hi>Huon</hi> knéeled downe before the Emperour,

and right humbly thanked him, and deſired him to forgiue him all his treſpaſſes. <hi>Huon,</hi> (quoth the Emperour) God forgiue thée, and as for me, with a good heart I doe pardon you. Then the Emperour tooke <hi>Huon</hi> by the hande, and tooke him vp and kiſſed him verie kindlye, in token of good peace and amitie.

Sir, when I was paſſed that Gulfe, I gathered many precious ſtones, that which I haue giuen you was one of them, the which ſtone is of great vertue: and then I came to the great Citie of <hi>Thauris</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> whereas I found a noble Admirall an old auncient Knight, and he ſhewed to me great courteſies, and I gaue him one of mine Apples to eat, and aſſoone as hee had eaten thereof, he became to be as young as he was when he was but of Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares of age, and I thinke that from thence hether cannot be found a fairer Prince, and hee was before of Six-ſcore and Seauen yeares of age: and Sir, becauſe I deſire with all my heart to haue your good grace, and that good peace and firme may bee had betwéene you and mee, I will giue you the third Apple, the which I kept for my ſelfe, by the which if you doe eat it, you ſhall become againe as young and as luſty and as ſtronge, as you were when you were but of the age of Thirtie yeares.</p>
               <p>The Emperour, when hee heard that the Apple that <hi>Huon</hi> would giue him to eat, ſhould cauſe him to returne to his yong age againe, hee was ſo ioyfull, that hee neuer made ſuch chéere before in all his life to any man as he did then vnto <hi>Huon,</hi> and ſayde, howe that hee would bee his Fréend for euer, and neuer faile him, and ſayd.

When the Traytour <hi>Brohart</hi> ſaw the ſixe Théeues, he was ſore abaſhed, and ſaw well that hée ſhould bee faine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe, then he drew out his ſword, and ſtrake the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Théefe ſuch a blow vppon the head, that hee claue him to the téeth: and when the other fiue Théeues ſaw their Maiſter ſlaine, they were right ſorrowfull and angrie, then they aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Brohart</hi> on all ſides, and hee defended himſelfe ſo well, that before he was ſtriken to the earth, he ſlew foure of them, and in the meane time whiles they fought, the Ladie <hi>Clariet</hi> came to the place whereas the Théeues had béen, and there ſhee ſound meat and drinke plentie: and when ſhe ſaw the meat, ſhe was right ioyfull and thanked God thereof, and did eat and drinke at her pleaſure, and ſhe ſaw that the Théeues had caſt <hi>Brohart</hi>

Oh thou vntrue and falſe Traytour, there is no torment in the world ſo cruell, but that thou haſt deſerued a worſe paine, and therefore by vs thy deſert ſhall be rewarded, then they tooke him and bound faſt his féet, and hanged him vp by the féete vppon a Trée, then they made a fire, and vnder his head they made a great ſmoak, and ſo made him to die in great dolour and paine: thus ended the Traytour <hi>Brohart</hi> miſerably his dayes.

Sir, I beleeue in this world there is not a fairer, ſwéeter, nor more gracious creature, nor none that ſéemeth more to be extract of a higher lineage. The Kinge beheld the Damſell, and ſhe knéeled downe before him. Faire Damſell, (quoth the King) I pray you to ſhewe mee what you bée, and of what lineage, and from whence you come? the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die who was in great feare to name her ſelfe truely, for feare leaſt ſhee ſhould be in ill handes, caſt downe her head preſently &amp; began to wéepe, ſo that the teares fell from her eyes, and ſaid. Sir, I require you deſire no ſuch thing of me at this time, for I knowe not who is my Parents, nor of what lineage I am of. When the King vnderſtood the Damſell, and ſawe howe ſhee wept, hee had great pitie of her, and comforted her as much as hee could: then <hi>Peter</hi> ſhewed vnto the King all that the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb facs="tcp:4519:274"/>
had ſhewed him before, and ſhe was found by the Sarazins (quoth he) whome I haue ſlaine, ſhe was happie that ſhe fel in to my handes, for by the grace of God I ſhall ſée her well mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet foorth.</p>
               <p>Then the Kinge and <hi>Peter</hi> went from the Shippes into the Towne, and cauſed the Damſell to bee brought after them, with twoo Gentlemen into <hi>Peters</hi> lodging, and as ſhee paſſed through the Towne, ſhe was regarded with Ladies and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and they all prayſed her beautie, ſaying one to another, that there was neuer a fairer Ladie borne, nor more likely to be come of a noble bloud. Great feaſting was made in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for the comming home of <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon, and of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that he had brought with him. The ſame time, <hi>Florence</hi> the Kinges Sonne had béene a hunting, and came home, and when hee was in the Towne, and ſawe the ſtréets hanged, and the Ladies and Damſels and other making ſo great ioy and feaſting, he was abaſhed, and demaunded of a Burges, if there were any newe wedding, and wherefore it was that the people made ſo great ioy and feaſting? Sir, (quoth the Burges) the feaſt that is made now and the ioy, is for the comming home of <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon, who hath béene ſo long out, for that God hath ſent him good aduenture, for hée hath wonne and conquered the great Shippe of <hi>Maliga,</hi> wherein was the King of Granado, great riches hee hath wonne, and hee hath ſlaine all the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins that were in the Shippe. Then <hi>Florence</hi> reſted not, vntil he came to his Cozen <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragons lodging, and made him good cheere, and ſaide. Cozen, you are welcome home, and I am right ioyfull of your good aduenture. Sir, (quoth <hi>Peter</hi>) I thanke God I haue had good fortune, and Sir, I ſhall ſhew you one thing that I haue wonne, whereof I am moſt ioyfull: then he ſhewed him the Damſell, who was ſober and ſad, and ſhewed him how hée wanne her. When <hi>Florence</hi> ſaw the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, his heart ſprang for ioy, and the more hee beheld her, the more fairer ſhe ſéemed: and the Damſell beheld him right hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and ſhe thought that ſhe neuer ſaw a fairer young man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor better made nor fourmed of all his members. <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> ſo behelde the Damſell, by reaſon whereof the dart of
<pb facs="tcp:4519:275"/>
loue ſtrake him to the heart, whereof the wounde coulde not be lightly healed, I may well ſay, that in all the world in that time could not be found againe two ſuch perſons, for the great beauty wherewith they were garniſhed could not be deſcribed, for God and nature had forgotten nothing in forming of them, ſwéetly they regarded each other, at that time if <hi>Florence</hi> had knowne, that ſhee had béene the faire <hi>Clariet</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> hee would haue married her incontinent, ſhe was greatly taken in the loue of <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſo was hee with her: then hee deſired with all his heart to knowe what ſhee was, for his heart gaue him that ſhe ſhould be come of ſome noble bloud, and ſayd vnto himſelfe, that hee deſired much to knowe it, and that in all the world there was nothing hee loued ſo well, and thought that without her loue hee could not long endure, thinking to deſire her to take him for her Louer, and that if ſhee refuſed him, that ſhort ſhould be his life, but thought to bee ſo bolde as to ſpeake to her.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Florence</hi> taken with the fire of loue, tooke the faire Damſell by the lilly white hand, and cauſed her to ſitte downe by him: then he drew her a little apart, to the entent that none ſhould heare him, and then hee ſayd. Faire Damſell, you bee welcome into theſe parts, I pray you to ſhew me what you be, and of what Lineage? Sir, (quoth the Damſell) little ſhall you winne when you know the certaine what I am, but ſince it pleaſeth you to know I ſhall ſhew you. Sir, know for troth, I am Daughter to a poore honeſt man of the Countrey, and in times paſt was one of the Chamberers with the Ducheſſe <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleremond</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and Sir, by great treaſon I was ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away, whereby ſince I haue ſuffered much pouertie, ſo that if God and this noble man <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon had not reſcued me, I had beene loſt for euer, and therefore Sir, ſince I am poore and deſolate, I require you in the honor of our Lord God, that you will not require mee of any villanie againſt my bodie and honeſtie, neither in word nor deede, and ſir I beleue ſuerly no more ye thinke to doe, for I had rather be hewen all to péeces, then any creature ſhould haue pleaſure of my bodie without I were maried. Faire Damſell, (quoth hee) I ſweare by God
<pb facs="tcp:4519:275"/>
that mee created, that of mee nor of any other man liuing, you ſhall not be deſired againſt your honour, for I know no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that would require you of any diſhonour, or ſay any thing that ſhould not be agréeable vnto you, but I ſhall make him to die of an ill death, and I will that you know, that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth I will bee your true Louer, and none ſhall make depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of vs two, and if it were ſo that my Father were dead, I would neuer haue other Wife but you. Sir, (quoth the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) I pray you to forbeare ſpeaking of any ſuch wordes, for it were not méete for the Sonne of a King, ſo to debaſe himſelfe, as to ſet his loue vppon ſo poore a Mayd as I am, beware how you ſet your heart to loue, for if the Kinge your Father perceiue any thinge, that you ſhould ſet your loue vppon mee, he would ſoone put me to death, therewith ſhe caſt downe her head, and ſayd to her ſelfe. Ah good Lord, if this young Prince knewe ſurely what I were, it might well be that hee would haue mee in marriage, as yet in all my life, I neuer ſet my loue vppon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon, but this young man whome I neuer ſawe before, it maketh me to thinke that which I neuer thought before, that it maketh my bloud and all my members to tremble, I am in worſe caſe for his loue, then he is for me, therewith ſhee began ſore to wéepe. When <hi>Florence</hi> ſaw her, he was right ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſayde. Faire Damſell, I require you to take mee for your true and faithfull Seruant, otherwiſe I cannot ſée howe I ſhall liue long. Sir, (quoth ſhe) I am well content to graunt you my loue, ſo that your deed and thought be vppon goodneſſe and honour, for if I may perceiue in any manner, that your thought bee otherwiſe, you haue loſt my loue for euer. Faire Loue, (quoth <hi>Florence</hi>) haue no doubt thereof, that euer I ſhall haue any thought of villany againſt you. Thus as yée haue heard was the firſt acquaintance betwéene theſe two Louers, that is to ſay, the faire ladie <hi>Clariet</hi> Daughter to Duke <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and of <hi>Florence</hi> Sonne to the King of Aragon.</p>

               <p>Then the Kinge called vnto him his Cozen <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon, and charged him, that if <hi>Florence</hi> his Sonne came any more to his lodging, that he ſhould incontinent tell him of it, for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (quoth hée) by the faith that I owe vnto our Lord God, if he come thether any more, I ſhall cauſe the Damſell that is in your houſe to be ſlaine. <hi>Florence</hi> was right ſorrowfull, when hee heard to the pleaſure of the Kinge his Father. Thus as the King rebuked his Sonne, there came in a Knight and kneeled downe, and ſayd. Sir, I haue brought you ill tidings, for the King of Nauarre is entred into your Realme, and ſetteth all
<pb facs="tcp:4519:277"/>

When King <hi>Garyn</hi> heard the Meſſenger, he was right ſorrowfull, then hee called vnto him his Cozen <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon, who was his chiefe Conſtable, and ſayd. Sir, make readie our men to reſiſt our enemies, then he called vnto him <hi>Florence</hi> his Sonne, and ſayd. Faire Sonne, take thine armour, and ſhew thy vertue againſt thine enemies, who waſte my Realme, and take vpon thée the chiefe charge, and lead mine Hoaſt, for I haue no puiſſance nor ſtrength to do it, becauſe of the great age that I am of, I haue liued ſo long that I can no more ride: therefore defend thou the Land that thou ſhalt hold after mee, and then thou doeſt as a wiſe man ſhould doe. Father, (quoth <hi>Florence</hi>) by the grace of God I will put no armour vppon my backe to defend your Land, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will giue mee in marriage the faire Damſell that is in my Cozen <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragons houſe, if you will doe me that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, and promiſe mée to doe it, I ſhall deliuer into your hands your enemy as Priſoner, to doe with him your pleaſure, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe looke not that I ſhall doe any thing. When the King ſaw that his Sonne would doe none otherwiſe, then he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all his other men euerie man to arme himſelfe, and to goe and reſiſt his enemies: the which they did incontinent, and they yſſued out into the fields more then tenne Thouſand men, and Sir <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon hadde the leading of them, and they were not out of the Towne aboue twoo Leagues, but they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred their enemies, there were many ſpeares broken, and many a Knight beaten downe to the earth and ſlain, and their bodies lying without ſoules among the horſe féete, right valiantly did Sir <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon behaue himſelfe that day: but hee had not ſtrength ynough ſufficient, for his enemies encreaſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was conſtrained to retire backe towardes the Citie, howbeit, before he entred, he did great loſſe and dammage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>When the Nauarnes ſawe the Aragons retire into the Citie, then they pitcht vp their Tents and Pauillions about the Towne, and when king <hi>Garyn</hi> ſaw his men returned, then he called his Sonne <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſaid. Sonne, take thine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and ayd to defend the Land, the which appertaineth to thée after my deceaſe. Sir, (quoth <hi>Florence</hi>) that will I neuer doe, without firſt you promiſe me, to giue me the faire Damſel in marriage, by that couenant, that I ſhall deliuer into your hands as Priſoner mine Vncle the King of Nauarre. When the King his Father heard him, hee muzed a litttle, and ſayd. My Sonne, I graunt thee thy deſire, ſo that thou wilt deliuer me thine Vncle the kinge of Nauarre, to doe with him at my pleaſure, therefore take thine armour and make thée readie, thine armour is good, and thy ſwoorde is with the beſt, and if thou canſt do as thou ſayeſt, thou ſhalt haue the faire Damſell, howbeit, he ſayd to himſelfe priuily, that he had rather to looſe one of his handes, then a ſtranger ſhould be Quéen after him, for aſſoone as my Sonne (quoth hee) ſhall be yſſued out of the Citie, I ſhall cauſe the Damſell to be drowned in the Sea, for I will not ſuffer her to liue, although I ſhould bee diſenherited for it.

Sir, then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to ſend for my Loue hether, to the entent that ſhe may guird my ſword about mee, whereby I ſhall be the more bold and hardy when I come into the Battaile. The kinge did as his Sonne required, but the Sonne knewe not the Fathers thought, the Kinge ſent twoo knightes for the Damſell, and when ſhee came there, ſhee was greatly regarded of them that were there, for they had neuer ſéen a fairer, nor one that ſéemed to be extract of a hye generation. When <hi>Florence</hi> ſawe her in the Pallaice, his heart roſe vp, and he ranne vnto her and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and kiſſed her, and the Ladie ſuffered him with a good will: wherewith the king had at his heart ſuch ſorrow, that he had neere hand runne vppon them, but he forbare it, becauſe he ſaw his Son readie to goe againſt his enemies, then he helped
<pb facs="tcp:4519:278"/>
to arme his Sonne richly, and in like wiſe ſo did the faire Damſell.</p>
               <p>When king <hi>Garyn</hi> hadde made his Sonne readie, the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell did guird his Sword about him, then the king drew it out of the ſheath, and therewith made him knight, and then his horſe was brought vnto him, and hee leapt lightly vppon him, with his Speare in his hand, and helmet vppon his head, and ſhéelde about his necke. Then <hi>Florence</hi> ſayd vnto the kinge his Father. Sir, I leaue with you my Loue, whome I loue beſt in all this world, I leaue her in your kéeping, for if our Lord God giue me the grace that I may returne, I ſhall bring vnto you mine Vncle the king of Nauarre as a Priſoner. The king graunted vnto his Sonne all that he would deſire, but he knewe not the inward intention that hee was purpoſed to doe. Then the king commaunded Ten of his knights to ſée the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Damſell, and to honor her as much as they might, vntill his Sonne were out of the Citie, and then to drowne her in the Sea, to the entent that neuer more tidinges ſhould bee heard of her.</p>

the gate, and roade towardes the Tents of his enemies, with ten Thouſand good knights and hardy: the Ladies and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels went to the wals of the Citie to behold the young knight. When the Nauarnes ſaw him comming, there came againſt him more then fiftéene Thouſand men, and they came downe in a Valley by couert, to haue cutte him the way betwéene the Hoaſt and the Towne, but the valiant knight Sir <hi>Peter</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon (who was with <hi>Florence</hi>) eſpyed them, and ſo made haſt to be afore them: and when hee ſawe his time to ſet vppon his enemies, <hi>Florence</hi> (who was ſore deſirous to fulfill his promiſe to the king his Father) tooke his Speare, and encountred with a knight with ſuch vertue, that he ranne him cleane through, and with drawing out of his Speare, the Nauarnes fel downe dead, then <hi>Florence</hi> ſayd.

Thus vnder the meadowes of <hi>Courtoys,</hi> was a horrible Battaile betwéen the Nauarnes and Aragons, where there was vpon both partes ſuch ſlaughter, that it was great maruaile to behold it. Anon <hi>Florence</hi> ſword was well knowne, for by the force of his armes he brake the great preaſſes, for vppon whom ſoeuer his ſtroke lighted, hee was either ſlaine or caſt to the earth, euerie man feared him ſo much, that none durſt abide nor approach néere vnto him.</p>

but as long as he liueth, hee ſhall neuer ſee her more whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fall thereof, therefore goe your way, and take and caſt her into the Sea, amonge the greateſt waues that you can finde. When theſe knightes vnderſtood the King, who commaunded them to doe this murder, they were right ſorrowfull at their heartes, but they durſt not ſay nay, nor doe againſt his will, for if they had, they knewe well that they ſhould die, and they knew that there was neither mercie nor pitie in him: therefore they durſt make no ſemblance to the contrarie, they feared ſo much to diſpleaſe him. Then they went and tooke the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell whereas ſhee was. Sirs, (quoth ſhee) what will you doe with mee? wherefore doe you take mée? let mee goe, if you will haue any thing with mee, ſhew mée? They ſayd, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſpeake no more, for your end is come, you ſhall neuer ſee faire day more: and when ſhe ſaw that ſhe was ſo taken with Tenne men, who went threatning to ſlay her, then ſhee caſt out a great crie, and deſired God to ayd and ſuccour her. Then they bound the Damſels handes with a cord, in ſuch manner, that her white tender ſkinne burſt, and they bound her ſo ſore that the bloud dropped out at her nayles. Sirs, (quoth ſhe) I crie you mercie, little ſhall you winne to ſlay mee, you ſhall doe great ſin, ſeeing I haue not deſerued it. Madame, (quoth they) your wordes cannot auaile you, the Kinge will not that you ſhall make auaunt to haue his Sonne in mariage, for you ſhalbe drowned in the Sea whether you will or not, your wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſhall not ayd you. Then foure Ribaulds tooke and bound her, and drew her by the haire of her head, and led her toward the Sea-ſide to haue drowned her, but often times it is ſayd, that which God will haue ſaued, cannot be periſhed.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſeaſon <hi>Florence</hi> was in the Battaile, whereas hee fought with his enemies, and Sir <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon had taken many Priſoners, and hee came vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſayd. Ah Sir, I require you to let vs returne to the Citie, and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that you haue done this day, for yonder you may ſée comming al the whole Hoaſt of the Nauarnes, againſt whom it is not poſſible for vs to endure, for they are more then thrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Thouſand men, and they all hate vs to the death, you
<pb facs="tcp:4519:280"/>
haue done ynough &amp; ought to be content, if they take you, none can ſaue your life. Coozen, (quoth <hi>Florence</hi>) I pray you before I depart, let mee Iuſt once with mine Vncle the kinge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre, whome I haue promiſed to yéeld as Priſoner vnto the king my Father, and thereby I ſhall haue in mariage the faire Damſell my Loue, and for the loue of that faire Damſell I ſhal make many a Nauernoys to looſe their liues. Sir, (quoth <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) ſince you deſire your owne death, I am right ſorrie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but I will no longer tarie héere, for it is not poſſible for vs to tarie héere, without we will bee ſlaine wilfully, and I haue héere many Priſoners, I will go lead them into the Citie, and then I ſhall returne again vnto you, to the entent that if either I or you be taken Priſoner by them, wee may bee redéemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Then <hi>Peter</hi> went to the Citie with all his Priſoners, and when he was come into the Citie, hee heard a great noiſe about the Market place, whereof hee had great maruaile, and went thether, and then hee ſawe there foure foule Villaines, drawing the faire Damſell <hi>Clariet</hi> towardes the Sea-ſide to drowne her. When he ſaw that, hee was neuer ſo ſorrowfull in all his life before, and incontinent did let goe his Priſoners, and drew out his ſword, and cryed vnto them that led the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. Ah yée falſe Théeues, let the Damſell go, whom I brought from beyond the Sea, yée did neuer ſuch folly in all your liues, and therewith hée ſtrake the firſt with his Sword, in ſuch ſort, that his head ſlewe from his bodie, and the ſecond hee claue to the téeth, and the third and fourth hee ſlewe. When the faire Ladie ſaw the Earle <hi>Peter,</hi> right pitifully ſhe beganne to crie, and ſaid. Sir, I require you to haue pitie of me, and help and ayde mee as you haue done before this time, neither Lorde nor Maiſter I haue none but you. Sir for Gods ſake vnbind me, and put me out of this paine that I am in. Then <hi>Peter</hi> went to the Damſell, and cut the cords aſunder wherewith ſhe was bound, and for the ſorrow that ſhe was in, ſhée fell downe in a ſwound: then <hi>Peter</hi> tooke her vp and ſayde. Faire Damſell, be of good chéere, for I ſhall helpe to ſaue you: the faire Ladie wept pitiouſly, and ſayd to her ſelfe. Ah <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> my déere Father, the great paines and pouerties that you were
<pb facs="tcp:4519:280"/>
woont to ſuffer, you haue left mee now Inheritour to the ſame, alas, I know not where you nor my Mother is, I beléeue that I ſhall neuer ſée you more. Then <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon tooke the Damſell by the hand, and led her to his lodging in the Town, then he went to the Pallaice, whereas hee found Kinge <hi>Garyn,</hi> vnto whome he ſayd. Ah thou old doating foole, wherefore, or for what cauſe wouldeſt thou haue ſlaine the Damſell, and ſhe is none of yours, ſhe is mine, I wanne her vppon the Sea and ſaued her life, you can make no claime to her?</p>
               <p>Thus as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake to the King, there entred into the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice two Knights, and they ſayd to the King. Sir, before you is the Earle <hi>Peter</hi> your Coozen, who hath deliuered and reſcued the new-found Damſell, and hath ſlaine the Foure men that ſhould haue drowned her in the Sea. When King <hi>Garyn</hi> ſaw the Earle before him, he ſayd. Why wert thou ſo hardy, as to ſlay my men for dooing of my commaundement? Then hee cried to his men, and ſaide: Sirs, I charge you take this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine héere, who hath done mee this offence, for I ſhall neuer haue ioy at my heart, vntill I ſée him hanged a hye vppon a Rocke. Then his men ſtept forth to haue taken the Earle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and when hee ſawe that he approached néere vnto him, hee drew his ſword, and claue the head of the firſt to the téeth, and he ſlew the ſecond, third, and fourth, he beat downe more to the earth, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other that fled away, ſo that there was none that durſt approach néere vnto him, for they were all vnarmed and hee well armed: then hée came to the King, and ſayd. Ah thou falſe old Dotard, full of ſin and out-rage, how dare you thinke to bee ſuch an out-rage? you are not worthy to beare a crown, your Sonne <hi>Florence</hi> ought to haue it, for a Traytour ought to hould no Realme, full déerely you ſhall abuy the ill will of the Damſell, and the more to make him abaſhed, hee made ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to runne vppon the King with his ſword, who for feare of him ran into his Chamber, and ſhut faſt the dore after him, and the Earle <hi>Peter</hi> ſtanding without, ſore threatned the king, then the King ſaid. Coozen <hi>Peter,</hi> I crye you mercie, if I haue done euill, I am readie to make amendes at your pleaſure, I was ſore diſpleaſed with my Sonne, and therefore I thought
<pb facs="tcp:4519:281"/>
to be reuenged vpon her that hath cauſed all this, I ſhall make amendes, but by the grace of God my Sonne ſhall neuer haue her in marriage to die: therefore I will neuer conſent, that a new-found Damſell ſhould bée Inheritour of ſuch a Kingdome as the Realme of Aragon is. Then Sir <hi>Peter</hi> anſweared and ſayd: Sir beware, blame her no more, bee content with that you haue done alreadie, it may be that the Damſell is of as hy a Lineage as your Sonne, wherefore ſuch time may come that you may be déerely rewarded, peraduenture the Damſell was ſtollen away by ſome ill Tyrant, ſhee hath béen ill entertained with you, when you would ſo cruelly haue ſlaine her. Cozen, (quoth the Kinge) the matter is ill come to paſſe, for her ſake you haue ſlaine many of my men, the which I pardon you, but as for the Damſell, I will ſet her in priſon in a Tower, out of the which ſhe ſhall not depart, and I will ſhew my Sonne that ſhee is drowned in the Sea, and I will kéepe her in priſon till my Sonne hath forgotten her, or elſe hath taken another wife, then I will deliuer her, and ſend her into ſome other Countrey whereas ſhe ſhalbe better entertained.</p>
               <p>When the Earle <hi>Peter</hi> heard the King ſay ſo, he agréed to his ſaying, and thought that aduiſe to bee good, and was content with that he had ſaued her life, then the King opened the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dore, and ſo came into the Pallaice, then he ſent for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and then ſhee was ſet in priſon in a Tower, and the Kinge commaunded to a ſecret Seruant, that hee ſhoulde ſée that the Damſell ſhould want nothtng for her liuing, and charged him vppon paine of his life to kéepe the matter ſecret, and hee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all thoſe that knewe thereof, in any wiſe to ſhewe <hi>Florence</hi> his Sonne nothinge of her. Then hee cloſed vp the dore with ſtone, to the entent that ſhee ſhoulde not yſſue out, and left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing open, but a little windowe towards the Towne of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toys,</hi> wherein her meate was put, other windowes there were opening vppon the fields, the which gaue great ligght into the houſe. Thus the faire Ladie <hi>Clariet</hi> was cloſed vp into the Tower, whereas ſhee hadde good leaſure to wéepe and wayle. Now let vs leaue ſpeaking of the Ladie, and ſpeake of <hi>Florence</hi> who was in the Battaile.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue well heard heere</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how the Earle <hi>Peter</hi> of Aragon departed from <hi>Florence,</hi> and returned into the Citie, for he could not cauſe <hi>Florence</hi> to leaue the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, whereas hee did maruailes, for the loue of the faire Ladie <hi>Clariet</hi> whome he truſted to wed: hee ſlew ſo many of his enemies, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fields were couered with the dead bodies. When the king of Nauarre his Vncle ſawe that, hee was right ſorrowfull to ſee his men ſo ſlaine, then hee came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Florence</hi> his Nephewe, and ſayd. Ah thou vnkind Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe, curſed bee you, I ſhall neuer haue ioy at my heart, as long as I ſee thee aliue, thou haſt done me this day great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, I had rather dye an ill death, then not to be reuenged of thée: wherefore I require thee to Iuſt with me, I challeng thy Land, the which ſhalbe mine, thou ſhalt neuer be Lord thereof. <hi>Florence</hi> anſweared and ſayd: I ſhall not refuſe the Iuſtes, then hee put vp his ſword, and tooke a great ſpeare, and ſo ran againſt the king his Vncle, and the king came againſt him, and they met together ſo rudely, that the Kinges Speare brake all to péeces, but <hi>Florence</hi> Speare was bigge, wherewith he ſtrake the kinge ſo rudely, that hee fell to the earth with his feete vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and he fell ſo ſodenly, that he lay in a traunce, and before hee could bee recouered <hi>Florence</hi> tooke him by the ventale of his helmet, and ſayd. Nauarre, before I ſleepe I ſhal deliuer you Priſoner into the handes of a faire Damſell, whome I loue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, for in all the world there is none like her in beautie, if
<pb facs="tcp:4519:282"/>
you refuſe thus to doe, with my Sworde I ſhall incontinent ſtrike off your head from the ſhoulders: the king ſayd, hee was content to fulfill his pleaſure and to yéeld himſelfe Priſoner. Then <hi>Florence</hi> tooke his Sworde from him, and made him to mount vppon his horſe, and to ride before him towardes the Towne, and deliuered him to the keeping of Tenne knightes, and <hi>Florence</hi> road after with his ſword in his hand all bloudie, the crie and noyſe beganne to bee great among the Nauarnes, they enforced them on all parts to haue reſcued their king, but they coulde not come in time, for by that time, <hi>Florence</hi> was within the gates of the Citie, whereas hee was right ioyfully receiued.</p>
               <p>When the Nauarnes ſawe howe they loſt their labour, and how their king was entred into the Citie, they were right ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, and came before the Barriers and ſkirmiſhed, and wan but little, and ſo returned with ſmall profit, and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the loſſe that they had receiued that day, for the fieldes were couered with dead men. Thus they returned to their Tents and Pauillions, and the Aragons entred into the Citie of <hi>Courtoys</hi> with great ioy, and when they were in the Citie, then <hi>Florence</hi> tooke the king of Nauarre his Vncle by the hand, and led him to the Pallaice, and there alighted and went into the Hall, whereas he found king <hi>Garyn</hi> his Father, who hadde great ioy of his comming. When he ſaw his Sonne <hi>Florence</hi> bring his enemie Priſoner, he embraced his Sonne, and ſayd. My right déere Sonne, I am right ioyfull of your comming. Father, (quoth <hi>Florence</hi>) I haue done ſo much by the ayd of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that I haue taken your enemie Priſoner, whom I render into your handes, to do with him at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Nowe I will that you kéepe your promiſe with mée, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I haue quit mine, now it is time that you deliuer vnto me the Damſell, whom I ſhall make Quéen and Ladie after your deceaſe. When the king vnderſtood his Sonne, he was all in a rage, and ſaid. Faire Sonne, leaue thy folly, and take ſuch a Wife according to thine eſtate, and thinke no more of that new Fondling: for know for troth, I haue cauſed her to be caſt into the Sea, whereas ſhee is drowned. Thou art a Foole to
<pb facs="tcp:4519:282"/>
thinke that I will ſuffer after my deceaſe, that a poore Caitiffe new-found, ſhould bee Ladie and Quéene crowned of ſuch a Realme, beware, in as much as thou thinkeſt to diſpleaſe me, that thou bee not ſo hardy as to ſpeake, or remember any more the new-found Damſell.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Florence</hi> heard the Kinge his Father ſay, howe the Damſell was drowned in the Sea, his bloud mounted into his face, and his heart was ſo oppreſſed and ſo heauie, that he had no power to ſpeake, and ſuch a maruailous colde ſweat tooke him, that there was no vaine nor member in his bodie, but trembled for anger and ſorrow that was in him, ſo that he had no power to ſuſtaine himſelfe, but fell downe to the earth in a great traunce, in ſuch ſort, that euerie man there thought hee had béen dead, and euerie man complayned for him, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the king his Father was right ſorrowfull, and would as then that he had neuer begunne that matter. When <hi>Florence</hi> came againe to himſelfe, hee ſayde. Oh good Lorde, the earth ought to be curſed, when it ſuſtaineth ſuch a trayterous kinge, that hath done ſuch a déede, great perill it is to bee conuerſant with him: then <hi>Florence</hi> looked vppon the knightes about him, and ſayde. Sirs, I require you, for the loue you ought of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to beare me, bring me to the ſame place, whereas ſhe whom I loued perfectly was periſhed and drowned, for other Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher I deſire none, but the ſame that ſhe hath, for the loue of her it ſhall pleaſe me well to bee vnder couert, vnder the waues of the Sea, whereas my Loue is, to the entent that of me there be heard neuer more remembrance.</p>
               <p>Then hee beheld the king of Nauarre his Vncle, whome hee had taken Priſoner, and ſayd. Sir king of Nauarre, thou art my Priſoner, but if thou wilt ayd mee, to bee reuenged of this treaſon that my Father hath done: I ſhall then let thée goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine frée and quit. Faire Nephew, (quoth he) leaue that folly and ſpeake no more thereof, for it toucheth much your honour, and you ſhall be blamed of all them that heare ſpeaking thereof. Sir, (quoth <hi>Florence</hi>) what is that you ſay? you knowe well that you are my Priſoner, and that it lyeth in me whether you ſhall liue or die? Faire Nephew, (quoth the king) I will well
<pb facs="tcp:4519:283"/>
agrée to your wordes, but if you will beléeue mee, beléeue the king your Father, &amp; leaue to doe after your owne will. What? (quoth <hi>Florence</hi>) you know well, that in me it lyeth to ſtrike off your head, without you will agrée vnto my will and pleaſure, the which thing I will doe, except incontinent you ſweare the death of kinge <hi>Garyn</hi> my Father, and that neuer to take peace with him, vntill you haue brought him to the death, vpon this condition I ſhall ſet you in ſauegard: for the Traytour hath deceiued me, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing that I loue beſt in all this world. Then the king of Nauarre ſayd. Déere Nephewe, you are as yet young, I cannot tell whether your wordes and promiſes are ſtable and firme or not, for the youth that I ſée in you, and alſo for the great diſpleaſure that you be in now: and therefore faire Nephew, I haue great feare that you ſhould beguile me. Sir, (quoth <hi>Florence</hi>) God forbid that I ſhoulde bée ſo deceiuable of my promiſe, to promiſe you any thinge and fulfill it not, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhould fall thereof.</p>
               <p>At this time there were but few perſons in the Pallace with the kinge, for all the Lordes and knightes were gone into the Towne to their Lodgings, to refreſh them of their trauaile and wearines: therefore the king was in his Pallaice with a ſmall companie, the which <hi>Florence</hi> had well eſpyed, and there was certaine of <hi>Florence</hi> knightes about him, vnto whome hee ſayd all wéeping. Sirs, incontinent goe and get mee my horſe, and alſo the king of Nauarre his horſe readie at the gate, the which was done, and when they were come, then <hi>Florence</hi> ſayd vnto the kinge of Nauarre his Vncle. Good Vncle, if there bee any courage in you, to be ſafe and out of ſeruage, take this ſword in your hand, and let vs leaue this vnhappie king, to vſe his daies in ſorrow, and come and follow me. Faire Nephew, (quoth the king of Nauarre) I haue great feare that you will beguile me. Sir, (quoth <hi>Florence</hi>) thinke it not, but come after mee, and you ſhall ſée what I will doe: then <hi>Florence</hi> departed, and the kinge of Nauarre with him, they leapt vppon their horſes, and when they were vpon their good horſes, there was no man at that time in the Towne abroad to let <hi>Florence</hi> of his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, but thus they paſſed both vntill they were without the
<pb facs="tcp:4519:283"/>
Towne, then <hi>Florence</hi> ſayd to the king his Vncle. Sir, nowe you knowe well that I haue brought you out of this Towne, and therefore I require you againe, that you neuer take peace with the king my Father, vntill you haue ſlaine him. Faire Nephew, (quoth the king) that which you require me to doe I ſhall fulfill it, and thus I recommend you to God. When the kinge ſawe himſelfe ſo well deliuered, hee was ioyfull, and ſo road vntill hee came to his Hoaſt, whereas his men receiued him with great ioy, and they demaunded how he was eſcaped out of the handes of <hi>Florence,</hi> then the king ſhewed all the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner howe <hi>Florence</hi> deliuered him, whereof they had great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and had great ioy of his comming: and to accompliſh his promiſe to <hi>Florence</hi> his Nephewe, he ſent to all his Realme of Nauarre, to his Fréends and other to come and ayd him. Now wee ſhall leaue ſpeaking of the king of Nauarre, and ſpeake of <hi>Florence</hi> his Nephew.</p>

Oh thou falſe Traytor, thou haſt done ſo much through thine ilneſſe, that I rather deſire thy death then thy life. Then he ſayd to the Knightes that were there preſent: Sirs, I pray you bringe mee to the Sea, and caſt mee therein, in the ſame

When king <hi>Garyn</hi> heard his Sonne ſay ſo, hee was right ſorrowfull, and ſpake fiercely vnto his Sonne, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to take him, and to ſet him in priſon in the Tower, in ſuch wiſe that hee may bee ſure of him, and ſayde. Well I ought to be angrie in my heart, when this boy mine own Son thus dealeth with mee: but by the faith that I owe vnto our Lord God, the diſpleaſure that he hath done vnto mee hee ſhall deerely abuy it, for as long as he liueth, hee ſhall haue no foote of my Land.

Déere Louer, (quoth the faire Ladie) it is ſhe whom you doe loue ſo well, I am yſſued out of the Tower, wherein I haue béene in great miſerie, and I cannot tell what will fall thereof, comfort mee, or elſe I ſhall die héere in great ſorrow. When <hi>Florence</hi> heard the voice of his Loue, he had ſuch ioy at his heart, that he forgat all his dolour, when hee ſaw that ſhee was not dead, then hee ſayd vnto her. Ah my right ſwéete Loue, whether will you goe? for if the King my Father know, that you be eſcaped out of the Tower, incontinent hee will ſlay you, hee will haue no pitie of you, and I cannot ſuccour you. Swéet Loue, I pray you to gather me ſome flowers, and caſt them in at this window, then I ſhall paſſe my dolours the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when I haue in my handes any thing that commeth out of yours. Then the Damſell gathered Roſes and flowers, and did caſt them in to her Louer, whereof <hi>Florence</hi> had great ioy, when hee had receiued them from her, and kiſſed them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times:

Holde your peace, for if you be ſpyed you cannot eſcape the death, I haue great pitie of you both, I pray God to preſerue you, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comfort you. Then they held their peace, and ſo went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, to the entent that they ſhould not bee heard nor ſéene, then there came thether two other watch-men, ſent thether by the King, to ſée if any bodie came to the Tower, to aid or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the two Priſoners, and when they were come néere to the Tower, they ſawe the newe made wall broken, then they ſayd each to other: ſurely the Damſell is fled, and hath broken out of priſon, then they cryed out, and made a great crie and ſayd, the Damſell is fled out of the Tower. When the Damſell (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Garden) heard the noyſe that the Spies made, ſhee was in great feare and doubt, the which was no maruaile, then incontinent as priuily as ſhe could, ſhe went from the Tower, and went to the end of the Garden, whereas there was a hye Rocke, and vnder the Rocke a great water and déepe, ſhee did clime vppon the Rocke, and ſayd.

Right ſwéetly ſhe called vppon our Lord God, and on the holy Ghoſt for ayd and comfort, and ſaide. Alas, if I be taken, I cannot eſcape from the martirdome of death, but ſince it is thus, that we muſt néeds depart for euer, I had rather bee drowned then be taken, therewith ſhee made the ſigne of the croſſe, recommending her

Then the noyſe ran through-out the Pallaice, that the Damſell was eſcaped out of the Tower, in ſuch ſort, that the King was aduertiſed thereof, who was ſorrowfull, and made promiſe that Earle <hi>Peter</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon ſhould looſe all his Lands and goods, for he thought that by his meanes ſhe was eſcaped the priſon.</p>

Sir, you ſhew well by your workes that you haue but ſmall reaſon, to ſuffer thus this poore man to be beaten, and that you would put him to death, for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that he hath done to your Sonne, he hath done therein but as he ſhould doe, and like a true Seruant, you ought the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to loue him, you ſhall doe ill to put him to death, I will that you know, that if you put him to death, I will not ſerue you one day longer, but I will rather goe to the King of Nauarre, and helpe to maintaine his war againſt you. When the King heard him ſo to threaten him, he ſwoore by God that he ſhould repent it, and how there ſhould no man ſaue the Watch-mans life. Then the poore man embraced the Kings Legge, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for mercie, but the King ſware and made promiſe, howe he ſhould bee hanged without mercie. When the Earle <hi>Peter</hi> heard that, he was verie ſorrowfull: the poore man wept, and
<pb facs="tcp:4519:287"/>
beheld the people that were there aſſembled, and deſired them to pray for his ſoule, ſaying, how he ſhould die for ſauing of his Lord, there was many of the poore mans kinred, they knéeled all downe before the King, deſiring him to pardon him, the king anſweared that hee would not. When the Earle <hi>Peter</hi> heard that, he ſayd to the King. Sir, ſurely he ſhall not die, without it be by iudgement as your Lords and Counſaile ſhall ordaine. When the King heard that, he was ſore diſpleaſed, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Citie, and ſet the Watch-man in priſon, then hée went to his Pallaice, and <hi>Peter</hi> followed him, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many other Knightes ſuch as loued him, and in like wiſe ſo did the poore mans kindred. When the Kinge was in his Pallaice, he commaunded a Scaffold to be made, whereon hee would haue the Watch-man to looſe his head. When his Kinſ-men heard that, they cried for mercie, but the king would doe nothing at their deſire. When the Earle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw the ill will of the king, he made a token to the Watch-mans freends, (who were in number about a Hundred and Fiftie) that they ſhould goe to ſuch a Tower, where there was great plentie of Armour, and to breake it vp and to arme them, and ſo they did, and came againe to the Pallaice: and when the king ſaw them comming armed, hee cryed to his men, that they ſhould arme them, and take them that were ſo bolde to come into his preſence all armed, and when euerie man was armed, they came again to the Pallaice to haue taken the Watch-man and all his kindred, but the Watch-man and his Fréendes (who were readie in armour) ſet vpon the kinges men, and alſo <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of Aragon and his companie aided them, ſo that there was ſo great a Skirmiſh in the Pallaice, that it was pitie to ſée it, they cut off armes, legs, and heads each of other. Finally, the king and his men were ſo ſore conſtrained, that of force they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the Pallace and fled away, and the king fled into his Chamber for ſauegard.</p>
               <p>Anon the newes ran in the Towne, that the king was ſore aſſaulted in the Pallaice, and in ieopardie of his life. Then all the Communaltie went and armed them, and ſounded the larum bell, there was ſuch a noyſe and brute, as though all the

world had béen loſt. Then a Spie went out, and ſhewed the king of Nauarre, howe king <hi>Garyn</hi> was aſſembled in his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice within the Citie, becauſe of a Watch-man that the King would put to death, in that hee had deliuered out of priſon <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and the Damſell his Loue. Then the King of Nauarre right ioyfull of thoſe newes, commanded haſtely his men to be readie in Armour, for he ſayd that it was then time or elſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to aſſaile the Citie. Great deſire I haue (quoth he) to bee reuenged of this King, who had wedded my Siſter, whom he hath ſlaine, I ſhall neuer haue ioy at my heart, vntill I bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged: then euerie man armed them, and ſo aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with banners diſplayed, and ſo came in good order toward the Citie to aſſayle it, but when they within the Towne heard the crye and noiſe without, and ſawe their enemies comming towards them, they went and ſhewed it at the Pallaice, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſtrife there ceaſed, and then the king and all his Lordes with all his people yſſued out in Battaile. Then there began a ſore Battaile, and many a man ſlaine and maymed, but there were ſo many Nauarnes, that whether king <hi>Garyn</hi> would or not, perforce they were faine to abandon the Victorie to their enemies, and were faine to retire into the Towne, but their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies followed them ſo néere, that the kinge of Nauarre and his men entred in with them. Then the kinge of Nauarre commanded that none ſhould be ſlain, without they were found in defence, for he ſayd that he cared not, ſo he might be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the king.</p>
               <p>Then the Nauarnes ſpread abroad in the Citie, taking pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, then kinge <hi>Garyn</hi> fled to the Minſter-church, then hee ſtoode in the Church dore to make defence, but it could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile him there was ſo many of his enemies, that he fledde to the hye Aulter for ſauegard, but the kinge of Nauarre (who was entred into the Church) commanded his men to take king <hi>Garyn,</hi> the which they did. Sirs, (quoth king <hi>Garyn</hi>) yée doe me great wrong to take me in this holy place, whereas euerie man ſhould be ſaued aboue all thinges, the houſe of God ought to be refuge for euerie man.

ſayd, he knewe well that he ſayd the truth, and repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſayd. Faire Nephewe, for the offence that I haue committed againſt our Lord God, I ſhall amend it to the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo that you will pardon the Watch-man, that hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my Nephew <hi>Florence</hi> out of your priſon, I ſhall then ſhew you this courteſie for the offence that I haue made, I and all my men ſhall yſſue out of this Citie, without taking of any priſoner, or any manner of goods, for the loue of my Nephewe <hi>Florence</hi> whome I loue entirely, and for the goodnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I ſhall goe to my Tents without, and I will graunt you a Truce to endure for a Moneth, and I promiſe you the Moneth once expired, I ſhall approach againe ſo nere to this Citie, that as long as life is in my bodie, I ſhall not depart vntill I haue taken this Citie and you, whome I take for mine enemie, to haue you as my priſoner, for I ſhall neuer haue ioy at my heart vntill I haue reuenged the death of my Siſter your Wife.</p>
               <p>Then King <hi>Garyn</hi> ſayd. King of Nauarre, of the courteſie and bountie that you ſhewe vnto me I thanke you, and as for the Watch-man, I doe pardon him all mine ill will, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay that you will come ſo néere my Citie to winne it, when that commeth (by the grace of God, and by the helpe of my true Subiects) I ſhall doe the beſt I can to defend my ſelfe and my Citie. Then the King of Nauarre yſſued out of the Church, and leapt vpon his horſe and road to the gate, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there vntill all his men were cleane auoided out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the entent that neither Priſoners nor goods ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the Citie, whereof his men were angrie, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they that were poore, the other cared not greatly, becauſe the two Kinges had béene ſo long fréendes together, wherefore the warre diſpleaſed them, and they were ſorrie that it endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo long. When the King of Nauarre ſaw that all his men were yſſued out of the Citie, then hee withdrewe him into his Tent, and he cloſed in the Citie with a ſiege, abiding vntill the Truce was expired.

When <hi>Florence</hi> perceiued his Loue, and al the Marriners in ſuch feare as they were, hee comforted them the beſt he could, but it auailed not, for the wind draue them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would or not towards <hi>Bongy,</hi> néere to a Citie named as then <hi>Anfalerne,</hi> wheras they were faine to caſt their anchor, in great feare of loozing of their liues. Then there fell on them a Galley, wherein were a Hundred Sarazins, &amp; another great Ship, wherein were more then foure Hundred men, and they all fell vppon <hi>Florence</hi> Shippe. When <hi>Florence</hi> ſawe both the Ship and Galley ſet vppon his Ship, the Maiſter of the Ship and the Marriners began to wéepe, and ſaid vnto <hi>Florence.</hi> Ah Sir, you and we all are loſt, we ſhall be all ſlaues with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razins, yonder Galley and ſhippe are full of Sarazins, and they are ready comming to ſette vppon vs. When <hi>Florence</hi> heard that, he ſaid. Sir, bée not abaſhed, hee whome God will ſaue cannot be periſhed, no mortall man can hurt him, lette vs put our truſt in him, &amp; take ſuch grace as he will ſend vs, the great number of people cannot hurt vs, if God will ayd vs, lette vs ſhewe our ſelues like men, they bee without law and without faith, and we beléeue in God, by whome wee truſt to be ſaued, let vs arme our ſelues, and ſhew our ſelues like men to defend our liues.</p>
               <p>When the Maiſter and the Marriners heard <hi>Florence,</hi> they ſayd. Sir, into the ſauegard of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to you we commit our ſelues: then they all armed them, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man ſtoode at their defence, and <hi>Florence</hi> ſayd. Sirs, let vs
<pb facs="tcp:4519:290"/>
all thinke, that we now doe fight for our liues, and therefore let vs not be abaſhed, euerie man thinke to do his beſt that he can, I loue by amours, behold her here, by whome I am ſo mooued to doe well, and to defend both her and me. Sir, (quoth they) ſhame haue hee that fainteth: then the Ship and Galley came néere to <hi>Florence</hi> Shippe, then the ſhotte of both parts flewe ſo thicke as though it hadde béene ſnowe, there was a great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile betwéene them, great hurt was done with caſting out of barres from the tops, two times <hi>Florence</hi> entred into the Ship of his enemies, whereas he did maruailes, and ſlewe ſo many Sarazins, that the water was red with the bloud of them that were ſlaine on both parts, there was an horrible Battaile, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Florence</hi> men were ſlaine, the good Maiſter was ſlaine, &amp; the moſt part of his men. Alſo from the land there were ſhotte Bombardes and Gunnes at <hi>Florence</hi> ſhip, ſo that thereby, and with the great barres of yron, the ſhippe was ſore impaired, for it was ſtriken thorow in a hundred places, in ſuch ſort, that the Sea entred in with great abundance. When the Damſell ſaw that mortall diſcomfiture, how their company were ſlaine, and their ſhip néere full of water, and ſaw no more perſons left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue with <hi>Florence</hi> but ſix, ſhe was then in great feare, and ſhe thought that ſhee had rather enter into the Sarazins ſhip, then to be drowned in the Sea, ſhee ſawe the Galley, the which lay ioyning to the ſhippe, ſhe leapt into the Galley to ſaue her life.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Florence</hi> ſawe his Loue in the Galley, hée was néere out of his wits for ſorrow, and hee ſawe well, that if he tarried ſtill in his owne ſhippe hée ſhould be drowned, then he leapt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Galley whereas his Loue was, and there he ſlew many a Sarazin, but there was ſo much people, that with force of Darts and ſpeares hée was borne downe, then they tooke and bound his handes ſo ſore, that the bloud ran out at his nailes.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Florence</hi> was taken, and all his men ſlaine and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, except ſome that were taken, then <hi>Florence</hi> wept for pitie of them, &amp; ſayd. Ah my Father, how falſly haue you wrought againſt me, thus by your folly I am in great daunger, I ſhall neuer returne into my Countrey without God helpe me, often times hée beheld his Loue, whome the Sarazins did ſore beate
<pb facs="tcp:4519:290"/>
and ill threaten, whereof <hi>Florence</hi> had ſuch diſpleaſure, that he was néere hand out of his wits. Alas, (quoth he) I ought to be ſorrowfull, to ſee her that I loue beſt ſo ſore beaten and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented before my face. Oh curſed death, why ſuffereſt thou me to liue to ſee this day, that my Loue ſhoulde bee thus dealte with, and yet I cannot helpe nor ſuccour her? therewith hee wept, and ſuddainly fell in a ſwound among the handes of the Sarazins. When the Damſell ſawe her Louer fallen in a traunce, and ſaw him ſo pale of colour, ſhe came vnto him, and ſhe thought ſurely that he had been dead, and alſo the Sarazins ſayd the ſame.

When theſe two Louers were come againe to themſelues, the Sarazins deliuered them both into the Captaines handes, and when <hi>Florence</hi> ſawe his ſwéete Loue by him, hee embraced and kiſſed her ſwéetely, the Captaine <hi>Sorbarre,</hi> when hee ſawe the youth of theſe two Louers, hée had great pitie of them, but hee made thereof no ſemblance, hee tooke them both into the Caſtle with him, and the other Priſoners ſuch as hadde taken them, brought them into diuers Towers, whereas they were kept in great miſerie, for the Sarazins had no pittie of them, becauſe they were chriſtened.</p>

King <hi>Garyn</hi> was ſore abaſhed when he heard the voice, and ſaid. Oh good Lorde, if theſe people that are aſſembled bee ſlaine by my meanes &amp; for me, my ſoule ſhall be loſt for euer. Alas my Son <hi>Florence,</hi> I was ill counſailed when I chaſed you away from me, and I did great ſin when I put you in priſon, I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of my life, it is no matter though I die, and I am more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for you, (my déere Sonne) whome I haue betrayed and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away without a cauſe: alas, by my meanes this Realme will be waſted and deſtroyed, the which you ought to haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me.</p>
               <p>Therewith he ſwounded among his Lordes, ſo that they all thought he had béene dead, whereof they ſore complained, and at laſt the king came againe to himſelfe: then his Lordes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him, and ſo bad him to heare Seruice, and after ſeruice, there appeared ſodenly before him two goodly young Knightes, the one was <hi>Gloriant,</hi> and the other <hi>Mallabron</hi>; they were twoo Knights of the Fayrey: then they all ſmiling ſaluted the King, and ſayd.

When kinge <hi>Garyn</hi> heard the Knight of the Fayrey, hee hadde ſuch ioy at his heart, that hee wiſt not what to doe or ſay, and hee came to the Knight and embraced him all wéeping, and ſaid.

When the king of Nauarre ſaw ſo many people, and ſo many Tents and Pauillions ſo néere him, and that he ſaw the rich and puiſſant Pauillion of Kinge <hi>Huons</hi> with the flambing Dragon, hee was greatly diſmayed. Then he called his Lords and Knightes, and ſaide. Sirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what people yonder are before vs lodging, mee thinkes I neuer ſawe ſo many together in all my life, I wot not what it ſhould be, I am in doubt: then he called vnto him two knights

               <p>When the King of Nauarre vnderſtoode that thoſe knightes nor none other would goe thether, hee was ſorrowfull, and as the king was thus deuiſing, thether came the two knightes of the Fayrey <hi>Gloriant</hi> and <hi>Mallabron,</hi> and <hi>Gloriant</hi> ſayd.

the Damſell is my Daughter, and her name is <hi>Clariet,</hi> and I will you know that ſhe is noble, and yſſued of a royall Lineage, there is none more noble in this Countrey, and ſhe hath bought her deſteny right déerely.

When the dinner was done, the king and all his Lords went into a Garden, whereas the king would kéepe his Counſaile, and when they were all there, and the king ſet in his ſeat, he ſayd. Sirs, you know well I haue no more Children but a Daughter, who hath béene deſired in marriage by diuers kinges and Princes, but I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to marrie her, nor I thought not to marie my ſelfe, for the loue of her Mother whome I ſo déerely loued, but nowe I am minded to marie and to take a Wife, ſo that ſhee bee ſemblable to her that is departed: and therefore I haue ſent for you to ſhew you my will and pleaſure.

Sir, (quoth the Lordes) will it pleaſe you to name her that ſhall be ſo happie. Sirs, (quoth the kinge) it is my Daughter <hi>Ide</hi> whom I will take to my Wife, for the great loue that I had to her mother. When the Lords heard that, they beheld each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bleſſing themſelues at the horrible and deteſtable wordes of the king, and looked on him maruailouſly. Then <hi>Sorbarre,</hi> (who was of the kinges priuie counſaile) began to ſpeake, and ſayd. Ah Sir, God forbid that ſuch a ſhame ſhould come to you, for it is worſe then heathen to him that will polute his owne proper Daughter by himſelfe ingendred, you ſhoulde not bee worthy to ſitte in a royall Chaire, and you ought to bee the mirrour and example to other men how they ſhould liue, will you then breake the Lawe that God hath giuen vs? put from you that crueltie, you ſhall find no man that will praiſe you, in ſo doing or thinking. When the king heard <hi>Sorbarre,</hi> hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him angerly and ſaid. <hi>Sorbarre,</hi> (know for troth) but that I hold my ſelfe much bound vnto you, I would ſtrike off your head, and there is no man that ſpeaketh to the contrarie, but I ſhall put him to death.</p>
               <p>Then all the Lords together ſaide to the king.

When the king heard the will of his Lordes, he ſent for his Daughter haſtely, who came with a ſmiling countenance, not knowing of the vnreaſonable will of the king her Father, and when ſhe came before him ſhe knéeled downe, the king tooke her vp and ſet her betwéene his armes, and kiſſed her more then Twentie times. The Ladie knewe nothing of her Fathers intention, none otherwiſe but
<pb facs="tcp:4519:302"/>
that ſhee thought hee did it, but as a Father ought to doe with his Child: then the Lordes ſayd ſoftly one to another. Oh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie King, his thoughts bée farre vnlike to his Daughters, for if ſhe were here alone, he would diſhonour her although ſhe be his owne Daughter. The King ſéeing his Daughter <hi>Ide</hi> ſo excellent faire, he ſayd to himſelfe, that without hee hadde his Daughter in marriage, he ſhould die with rage, and the King beheld her, and made her to ſit downe by him, and ſayd. My déere Daughter, you are as an Orpheling on the Mothers ſide, wherefore I haue great pitie of you that you haue loſt her, and you reſemble ſo much your Mother, that I thinke when I ſée you in the face, that I ſée her before mee, and therefore I loue you the better, and for this cauſe it is my will to take you to my Wife, for I will haue none other in mariage.</p>

Then the Damſell would haue riſen vp to haue gone from her Father, but the King tooke her by the hand and ſayd. My Daughter, make no daunger nor refuſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my will, for you ſlay me for the loue that I beare you: then all the Lords knéeled downe before the King, and held vp their handes, and deſired the King for his owne wealth and honour, that he would haue pitie of himſelfe and of his Daughter, and
<pb facs="tcp:4519:302"/>
that he would neuer thinke to doe ſuch a déede, for if he did, hée ſhould neuer be ſet by after. When the king heard his Lords, and how they reaſoned with him to haue turned his mind, hee anſweared as a man full of villany and yre, and ſaide, that in deſpight of them all, and whether they would or not, he would haue her to his Wife, and that if there were any ſo hardy as to ſpeake to him to the contrarie, hee woulde cauſe them to die a ſhamefull death, and he ſore rebuked them.

When the Damſell <hi>Ide</hi> was in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe called to her an ancient Ladie, who had béene her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, and then ſhe auoided all other out of her Chamber, and made ſemblance to ſléepe: and when ſhe ſaw that al other were gone, ſhe knéeled downe, and held vp both her hands before the Ladie, and all wéeping ſayde. Ah my right déere Ladie and Miſtreſſe, I come to you as a poore Orpheling without Father or Mother, my Mother is dead as you know well, but he that ſhould bee my Father, would bee my Huſband, the which is a thing that the earth ought not to beare, nor ſuſtaine them that woulde liue in ſuch manner: and therefore (déere Miſtreſſe) counſaile and ayd this poore diſcomforted Orpheling, and help me, that I may bee out of the ſight of him that ought to bee my Father, for I had rather goe into ſome farre Countrey, &amp; there to liue in pouertie, then to end my dayes with him in doing of ſuch a déede, and at the end to bee damned and loſt.

               <p>When the ancient Ladie vnderſtood <hi>Sorbarre,</hi> ſhe was right ioyfull, and thought his counſaile good, and then ſhe departed, and made readie all the apparell belonging to a man: then ſhe came to the Damſell <hi>Ides</hi> Chamber, and ſhewed her the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that was taken betweene her and <hi>Sorbarre.</hi> When the Damſell heard that, ſhe had great ioy at her heart, and ſhe clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and kiſſed her: the Ladie was glad when ſhe ſaw her ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what comforted, and ſayd. Faire Ladie, the Kinge your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ordained a bath for you: therefore goe thether and hath with other Damſels, to the intent that the Kinge doe not ſuſpect any thinge, and when you haue bathed you a certaine

if ſhe might ſhe would take counſaile of him, &amp; ſhe did ſo much, that ſhe fell in acquaintance with ſome of the Almaines, ſo that they were glad to ſee her, ſhe ſéemed to them to be ſo faire and a young Squier, then an Almaine that was there ſayd vnto her. Freend, come hether to me, and ſhew me what thou art? Sir, (quoth ſhe) I am to him that my ſeruice may pleaſe, for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing but to ſerue ſome noble man, but of late I was in Aragon, and there I ſerued a Lord that is dead, wherefore I am come hether for the diſpleaſure that I haue of his death, and I can well ſerue a Gentleman, and kéepe his horſe, and if néed be to driue his Sompter-horſe, and if I come in Battaile or in Skirmiſh with my Maiſter, I thinke hee ſhall haue a worſe then I am in his company. The Almaine hearing her ſo to ſpeake, ſayd: Faire Sonne, that thou ſayſt procéedeth of a good courage, therefore good muſt come to thée, yet I pray thée ſhew mee thy name?

               <p>Thus ſhe then ſerued, that was woont to be ſerued, for ſhee feared if it ſhould be perceiued that ſhe were a woman, it wold be to her trouble, therefore ſhe kept her ſelfe cloſe and ſecret, and ſhe continued thrée dayes with her Maiſter, after the other company were gone towardes Roome, but her Maſter might not depart ſo ſoone as the other did, for his buſineſſe was not readie: &amp; then thrée dayes after they departed to go to Roome, and ſhee was armed after the cuſtome of the Countrey, ſhe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her Maiſter ſo well, that hee prayſed her. So long they road, that they came and approached neere to the Countrey of Rome, ſo that on a day they entred into a great darke Forreſt, wherein lay in ambuſhment about Seauen-ſcore Spaniards, lying there to abide their aduenture, they lay in a darke Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley: and when they ſaw the Almaines, they diſpiſed them to the death and ranne vppon them.

When the Théeues ſaw her, one of them ſayd to his fellowes, I ſee yonder comming a Squier mounted vpon a good horſe, the which ſhalbe ours: and when <hi>Ide</hi> approached to them, ſhee humbly ſaluted the companie and ſayd. Sirs, if it may pleaſe you to let me eate and drinke with you, I will pay for my ſhotte. Fréende, (quoth one of them) is there any man that hath beene your guide in this Forreſt? Sirs, (quoth <hi>Ide</hi>) God hath beene my conduct and none other: then one of the Theeues ſtept forth, and tooke her horſe by the bridle, and ſaid to his companie. Sirs, lay on, ſtrike him downe, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eate nor drinke more, his horſe ſhall not eſcape me. When the Damſell ſaw that ſhe was taken, ſhe was in great feare, &amp; ſhee durſt make no countenance to defend her ſelfe, there were ſo many Theeues vpon her, and ſhe thought to humble her ſelfe which ſhould bee more profit, and ſayd. Sirs, why make you that haſt to ſlay mee? little ſhall yee winne thereby nor looze, hold heere my ſword, I yeild my ſelfe into your handes, and I pray you (in the honour of Ieſus Chriſt) to giue me ſome meat and drinke, for I am ſo hungrie, that I am almoſt famiſhed. Then the maſter Theefe ſayd: Squier, haue no feare to be ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, thou ſhalt haue no more hurt then my ſelfe, but thou ſhalt

Then the Damſell ſate downe with them, and did eat &amp; drinke at their pleaſure: and when they had all eaten and were riſen vp, the Théeues beganne to ſtriue among themſelues, ſaying to their chiefe maiſter, howe hee had done ill that he would not ſuffer them to ſlay the Squier: then another anſweared, &amp; ſaid. how there ſhould be no hurt done vnto him, becauſe hee was ſo faire a young man and ſo courteous, and ſayde, that it ſhould be great dammage to ſlay him, and that it were better to kéepe him ſtill with them, and to learne him to ſteale and to murder men, and if he will not ſo doe, then it were good reaſon to ſlay him.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Ide</hi> vnderſtood the Théeues, ſhe was in great feare, &amp; called vpon our Lord God, praying him humbly in her great néede to ayd and ſuccour her: then the chiefe maiſter demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what was her name, then ſhee anſweared in great feare to bee ſlaine, and ſaid.

Nay, (quoth the maiſter Théefe) that we will not doe, but thou ſhalt tarrie with vs, and learne to be a Thiefe and a Murderer, and if thou wilt not thus doe, with my Sword I ſhall ſtrike off thy head. Sirs, (quoth <hi>Ide</hi>) you would haue me to do a thing that I was neuer accuſtomed to doe, nor none of my Lineage, nor I haue no intention to doe any ſuch workes, therefore I pray you lette me haue my horſe and my ſword, then you doe me great courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and when I am mounted vpon my horſe, if one of you will defie me, and if I defend not my ſelfe from him, then ſtrike off my head. I haue bought my meate and drinke verie déere, if I

ſhould looze my horſe: then the maiſter Théefe ſayd. Becauſe I ſée that thou art ſo hardy, I will wraſtle with thee, vpon this couenant, that if thou caſt me, thou ſhalt be one of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and if thou be caſt to the earth, then I will haue thy horſe and thy Sword, and ſpoyle thee of all thy cloathes. Then <hi>Ide</hi> ſayd: I am content thus to do, ſo that you withdraw your men from me, and ſet my horſe by me, and my ſword tyed to my ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle bowe, for it is a common prouerbe, that a man is taken for a Foole that putteth his truſt in a Theefe. When the Theues heard that, they could not forbare laughing, and they had great deſire to ſee this wraſtling betwixt them, then they withdrew backe, and ſet his horſe there by him: then the noble Damſell <hi>Ide</hi> quickly tooke the Théefe, who thought to haue borne her to the earth, but ſhee drew him ſo ſore to her, that he could ſcarce haue any breath, and therewith ſhee caſt him ſo rudely to the earth againſt a ſtone that he was therewith in a ſwound, and with the fall his teeth burſt in his mouth.</p>

and when ſhe ſaw time to depart, ſhe ſpurred her horſe, for by that time the reſidue of the Théeues had gotten weapons, and they followed her to haue ſlaine her or her horſe, then ſhée departed with the ſpurres, her horſe was good, therefore anon ſhe was farre from them, then the Théeues ſawe they loſt but their labours to follow any further: therefore they let her goe. When <hi>Ide</hi> ſaw that ſhe was eſcaped their handes, ſhe humbly thanked our Lord God, deſiring him to ayd and conduct her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome ſauegard, and ſhe road ſo long, that ſhe yſſued out of the great Forreſt: Of her iourneys and lodging I will make no mention, but ſhe ſped ſo in her iourney, that ſhee arriued at the noble Citie of Roome, and ſhe tooke vp her lodging néere to the Pallaice, whereas the Emperor was deuiſing with his Lordes of the Feats of warre: then <hi>Ide</hi> went thether, &amp; knéeled downe and ſaluted the Emperour and all his Lords.

Great ioy and noiſe there was when the Battailes encountred together, the ſhot flew ſo thicke on both parts, that it ſéemed to be ſnow and hayle. <hi>Ide</hi> encountred with a Knight Nephew to the King of Spaine, hee receiued ſuch a ſtroake, that for all his armour, <hi>Ides</hi> Speare went cleane through his bodie, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight fell to the earth with his féet vpward, and ſo dyed miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably among the horſe féete: then <hi>Ide</hi> ſayd, of God be thou cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in an ill houre thou camſt hether to receiue ſuch an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, I challenge from you all the Empire of Rome, then ſhée ſayd to her ſelfe.

I ought little to be praiſed, without I reuenge the death of theſe two Lordes ſlaine by the King of Spaine: then ſhee road to the Kinge, and gaue him ſuch a ſtroake vppon the helmet, that all the circles with ſtones and pearles flew downe to the earth, and ſtroake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way part of his coife, haire, and ſkinne, and if the King hadde not turned his head, it had béen clouen to the téeth, &amp; the ſword glaunced and lighted vpon his horſe necke, and ſtrake it cleane aſunder, and ſo the horſe fell downe dead and the King to the earth, whereof the Spaniards were ſore abaſhed, thinking their King had béen ſlaine, ſo they fled away, and left him there lying on the earth in a traunce, in ſuch ſort, that hee could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſée, heare, nor ſpeake one word: then the Damſell <hi>Ide</hi> tooke him, and deliuered him to two noble Lordes of the Emperours Court, and when he reuiued, he was made to ſweare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be a true Priſoner.

were there that day, if I ſhould ſhew it, the time would bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-long to rehearſe it, but ſince Roome was firſt founded, it was not knowne that there had béen ſuch a Feaſt as this wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for no bodie thought but that <hi>Ide</hi> had béen a man: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Supper, when it was time to goe to reſt, the Brides were brought into their Chamber, then the Ladie <hi>Oliue</hi> went to her bed, then came <hi>Ide,</hi> and the Chamber auoided, and ſhee locked faſt the dore, to the intent that none ſhould heare them, then ſhee came to bed, and layd her downe on the bed-ſide, and ſayd to <hi>Oliue.</hi> My right ſwéete Loue, God giue you good night, for as for me, I can giue you no good, becauſe I féele ſuch a diſeaſe, the which gréeueth me ſore, and therewith ſhe kiſſed <hi>Oliue,</hi> who anſweared and ſayd. My ſwéete Louer, you are the thinge in the world that I moſt deſire, for the bountie and ſwéetneſſe that I knowe in you, then doe with me as it ſhall pleaſe you, and to the intent that you ſhall not thinke, that I haue ſo great deſire, that you ſhould do the thing which of right ought to be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene man and Wife, I am content to forbeare it Fiftéene dayes, and becauſe that diuers folkes are héere about to heare vs, I am content to giue you truce, for wee ſhall haue time y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough hereafter to ſport vs, and I know ſuch nobleneſſe in you that I am ſure you will take none other Wife, nor touch none other, but that you will kéepe your faith and troth to me, for I am chaſt and ſo ſhall you find me, it ſufficeth me to kiſſe you, &amp; as for the priuie loue, I am content for this time (ſince it is your pleaſure) to forbeare it. Then <hi>Ide</hi> anſweared: Faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, I wil not refuſe your will, thus they paſſed that night with clipping and kiſſing. Then in the morning they aroſe and made them readie, and came into the Pallaice, the Emperour beheld <hi>Oliue</hi> his Daughter, to ſée if ſhee were any thing chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and ſayd. Daughter, how is it with your new huſband? Sir, (quoth ſhee) euen as I deſire, for I loue <hi>Ide</hi> my Huſband better then I loue you, although you are my Father, at that word the Emperour and all his Lordes laughed: ſo great ioy and feaſting was there made, that it endured Eight dayes. Then euerie man tooke leaue and went whether as they liſted, and after the Fiftéene dayes were expired, that <hi>Ide</hi> had layne
<pb facs="tcp:4519:314"/>
with <hi>Oliue, <hi>Ide</hi>
                  </hi> touched her not but with kiſſing, whereof <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue</hi> was ſorrowfull, and ſayde to her ſelfe. Oh good Lord, I was ingendred in an euill houre, when I haue married with the goodlyeſt perſon of the world, and the moſt worthy, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that euer was guirt with a ſword, or road on horſe, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no ſemblance to doe that thinge which I haue ſo ſore deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: then ſhe drew néere to <hi>Ide</hi> and touched her, and <hi>Ide</hi> (who knew well what her deſire was) turned toward her, and wold hide himſelfe no longer from her, but all wéeping cryed her mercie, and ſhewed her from the beginning to the ending the manner of all her aduenture, and how that ſhe was a woman, and was fledde away becauſe her Father would haue married her himſelfe. And when <hi>Oliue</hi> vnderſtood <hi>Ide,</hi> ſhee was right ſorrowfull, howbeit, ſhee comforted <hi>Ide,</hi> and ſayd. My right ſwéete Louer, diſcomfort not your ſelfe, for you ſhall not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by me neither to no man nor woman liuing, we are wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together, and I will be good and true to you, ſince you haue kept your ſelfe ſo truely, with you I will vſe my time, &amp; paſſe my deſtiny ſince it is thus, for I ſée well that it is the pleaſure of our Lord God.</p>
               <p>Thus as <hi>Oliue</hi> and <hi>Ide</hi> were deuiſing together of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, a Page being in a Chamber that ioyned cloſe to their Chamber, heard well all their ſecret words and communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what each of them had ſayd to the other, then he in all haſt went to the Emperour, and ſhewed him all that he had heard betwéene the two Louers. When the Emperour heard that, he was right ſorrowful, and ſayd. Fellow beware what thou ſayeſt, looke that thy report bee true, for if I finde it contrarie, thou ſhalt die an ill death. Sir, if it bee not as I haue ſayde, and that <hi>Ide</hi> be not a woman whom you take for a man, ſtrike off my head. Then the Emperour made him to bee taken and kept, to the intent to prooue the troth, for he thought that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrange to beleeue: then hee called to him the Lordes of his priuie Counſaile, and he ſhewed them the matter, whereof they had much maruaile, ſeeing the great vertue and hye Proweſſe that was in <hi>Ide,</hi> and they greatly complained of the matter and were ſorrowfull: then the Emperour (who was right penſiue)
<pb facs="tcp:4519:314"/>
ſware and made promiſe, that if hee found the matter in that caſe, hee would cauſe both his Daughter and <hi>Ide</hi> to bee burnt, becauſe of hyding of that ſtrange caſe, and ſayd. If <hi>Ide</hi> hadde diſcouered the matter to me betimes, my Daughter ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue married her, and the matter now kept cloſe from me, I ſhall neuer haue ioye at my heart vntill I knowe the troth. Then hee commaunded a bath to bee made readie in his owne Chamber, wherein he would haue <hi>Ide</hi> to bée bathed, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that he might know the troth before ſhe eſcaped away, for he ſayd that he would not ſuffer no ſuch falſhood to bee vſed: the bathing was made readie, and <hi>Ide</hi> was ſent for, who knewe nothing of that matter, then the Emperour ſaid to her. <hi>Ide</hi> doe off your cloathes, for you ſhall bath you with mée. When <hi>Ide</hi> heard the Emperour, ſhe was ſore abaſhed, and ſayd. Sir, I pray you to forbeare it for this time, becauſe I haue not béene accuſtomed to be bathed: then the Emperour ſayd. I wil not forbeare it, becauſe I will ſée you naked, for if I finde that true which hath béene ſhewed me, both you and my Daughter ſhall be burnt. When <hi>Ide</hi> heard that, ſhe ſaw that ſhe was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and loſt, then ſhee knéeled downe before the Emperour and cryed him mercie, and required him to haue pitie of her, and the Emperour in great haſt ſent for his Lordes, who were in the Hall talking together, and were ſorrowfull for <hi>Ide</hi> whom they loued entirely, ſo they came to the Emperour, and found <hi>Ide</hi> before him on her knées ſore weeping, in ſuch ſort, that for pity of her they wept all, then the Emperour ſhewed them all the déede: wherefore ye muſt needs ſée iuſtice to bee done vpon <hi>Ide,</hi> who then by the Peeres and Lords of Roome was iudged to be burnt. Then it was commaunded, the fire to bee made readie to burne her, the which was done: and <hi>Ide</hi> before the Emperor abyding her iudgement, with her handes ioyned lifted vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heauen, making pitifull prayers to our Lord God, and to the holy Ghoſt, praying them to haue pitie of her ſoule, and to receiue it into the holy Paradice, for ſhee ſawe well that the end of her life was come.</p>

Thus they talked together of this young knight <hi>Croiſſant,</hi> and when they came to the place whereas the Quintaine was dreſſed vp, the Earles Sonne ranne and brake his Speare all to péeces, &amp; then others aſſayed themſelues, ſome brake their Speares, and ſome fell to the earth by force of their ſtroake, but there was none that could remooue the Quintaine.

Then the Earles ſon hearing his Father make <hi>Croiſſant</hi> ſuch an offer, as to giue him his Siſter in marriage, and a great part of his Land, hee was therewith ſo ſore troubled in his heart, as he tooke againſt him a cordiall hate, and made promiſe within himſelfe, that if hee might returne from the Battaile, hee would cauſe <hi>Croiſſant</hi> to die an ill death, thinking not to be diſenherited by him.</p>

When <hi>Croiſſant</hi> had well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Earle <hi>Remon,</hi> hee ſayd.

the Earle <hi>Remon</hi> went to ſée his Daughter, and ſayd to her.

When the Damſell heard her Father, ſhe was right ioyfull, and thanked God, and ſaid. Sir, ſince it is your pleaſure to giue me to this noble Knight, I ſhall not refuſe him, but I am content to fulfill your pleaſure: whereof <hi>Croiſſant</hi> was ioyfull, for ſhee was ſo faire that euerie man had maruaile thereof.

Thus they taried the houre to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their vngracious Enterprize, &amp; as they were in their communication, there was in a Chamber there beſide a young Squier, who had well heard their Enterprize, and what they were determined to doe: then he ſayd to himſelfe, that ſurely he would aduertiſe <hi>Croiſſant</hi> of their malicious Enterprize, to the intent that he ſhould not be ſurprized: then he departed as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily as he could, and ſo came to <hi>Croiſſant,</hi> and ſhewed him, how the Earles Sonne with Ten men were determined to murder him, the very ſame night in his bed ſléeping, and how that each of them had a ſharpe knife, and he ſayd.

               <p>When <hi>Croiſſant</hi> heard that, hee trembled for the diſpleaſure that he was in, and he thought within himſelfe, that he would not ſhew the matter to any perſon liuing, but he ſware, that if any came to doe him diſpleaſure, with his Sword hee woulde cléeue his head to the braines. Thus the matter reſted vntill it was night, &amp; ſo he went into the Hal among the other Lords, and there he found the Earle, who made him great chéere, and Supper was readie, then they ſatte downe: of their ſeruice I make no rehearſall.

life as yée ſhall heare. Thus hee approached to the houſe, and heard how the Cookes were buſie in the Kitchin, then he ſawe a great fire in a Chamber, where there was the greateſt Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and players at dice in all the Towne, and they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared fleſh and fiſh for their Supper. When <hi>Croiſſant</hi> ſaw the preparation that was made there for the Sixe Ruffians, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the houſe, and ſaluted the Hoſt, and demaunded if he might be lodged there: the Hoſt ſayd yea, and how hee ſhould be there well ſerued both of wine and of meat, ſuch as he wold demaund. Then <hi>Croiſſant</hi> went in, &amp; the Ruffians met him, and ſayd, how hee was welcome, and each of them pinched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wincked with the one eye, and ſayd ſoftly to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of them: this great Trauailer is come well at a point, for before he depart, he ſhall pay for our ſhot and expences, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non we will put the dice into his hands, whereby he ſhal leaue his Gowne, Cappe, and monney if he haue any. <hi>Croiſſant</hi> did not vnderſtand them, becauſe they ſpake whiſperingly: then <hi>Croiſſant</hi> ſayd. Sirs, if I eate with you paying my ſhot, ſhall it turne you to any diſpleaſure? Fréend, (quoth the Maiſter of them) it pleaſeth me well that you eate with vs: then they wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all together, and ſate downe at the Table néere to the fier, &amp; they were well ſerued of euery thing. When <hi>Croiſſant</hi> was ſet, hee began to féede well, (his hunger was ſo great) for in Thrée dayes before he had eaten nothing but bread and water: &amp; therefore hee had the better appetite, and alſo hee found there good wine and freſh, and he dranke thereof at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>When they had well eaten and drunke, and were well cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed by reaſon of the good wine, the Hoſt roſe vp &amp; ſayd. Sirs, it is time to make reckoning, &amp; that euerie man pay his part, then the maiſter Ruffian ſayde. Sir, make you the account, for you can doe it better then we, and ſhew vs what wee ſhall pay. Euerie man alike Sirs, (quoth the Hoſt) as néere as I can reckon, yée muſt pay in all Twelue ſhillings, and looke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man pay his part. Then the Maſter Ruffian began to ſweare bloud and wounds, that they ſhould play at the dice, to ſée who ſhould pay for all, then hee ſayd to <hi>Croiſſant.</hi> Fréend, you muſt come play with vs, behold heere Thrée dice good and
<pb facs="tcp:4519:328"/>
ſquare, wee muſt doe ſo, for one muſt pay the whole expences before we depart. Sirs, (quoth <hi>Croiſſant</hi>) we ſhall not néede to play at dice to know who ſhall pay for the ſhot, I will pay it all together without any ſtrife: then they ſayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they were well content therewith, and thanked him: then one of them, the falſeſt Villayne among them, wilfully caſt downe a potte of wine vpon the Table, whereof his fellowes blamed him, then he anſweared and ſayd. Sirs, you néed not to be angry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, for there is none of you will drinke thereof, it is better to haue a freſh pot of wine of a new Veſſell: they ſayd, well, that is true, ſo be it. Then their Hoſt brought them a new pot full of wine, and ſayd. Sirs, this potte of wine is not of the firſt reckoning, this is a potte of a newe account: then the Maiſter Ruffian ſayd to <hi>Croiſſant.</hi> Sir, take and caſt the dice, for the firſt caſt ſhalbe yours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Croiſſant</hi> beheld them fiercely, and ſayd: Nay Sirs, I will kéepe mée from that, for I neuer played at dice in all my life, be content with the twelue ſhillings that I ſhall pay for our ſhot, for by reaſon of the longe Voyage that I haue made, I am not well fourniſhed of monney, for I haue but Thirtéen Shillings in my purſe: then the Maiſter ſayd. Thou art better arrayed then we, and thou muſt vſe thy tongue otherwiſe, for thou ſhalt not thus ſcape, thou ſhalt leaue thy Gowne to pay for our ſhot to morrow in the morning: then another Ruffian ſayd, and I will haue his hoſe and ſhooes to morrow, to buy fiſh for our din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. When <hi>Croiſſant</hi> heard the Villaynes, he began to change colour, and was ſore diſpleaſed, and ſayd right fiercely. Sirs, leaue your clattering, yet I haue xiij. s<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. in my purſe, the which I wil giue you, rather then you ſhould be diſpleaſed, me thinks this ought to ſuffice you: and Sirs, I am a noble man, &amp; late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I was made Knight, for if I were once againe in my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, I would neuer come from thence to ſéeke for ſuch aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, you ought to beare my honour, ſince I ſhew you that I am a Knight: the Ruffians ſayd, how his words nor his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſhould not auaile him, but that he muſt leaue his gowne, Iacket, hoſe and ſhooes. Then <hi>Croiſſant</hi> repleat with yre, did off his ſurcot, the which was furred with armins, and caſt it to

When the Ruffians vnderſtood him, they cried all at once, that he ſhould put off his hoſe and ſhooes, and his guirdle, purſe, and Gowne, and bad him quickely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it to them, and then to auoid the houſe, for they ſayd there was no lodging for him, and the Hoſt to pleaſe the Villaynes, ſayd, how they ſayd troth. Then <hi>Croiſſant</hi> full of yre and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, turned his viſage to the bench where his good Sword <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then the Hoſt began to crie, a Théefe, a Murderer: but <hi>Croiſſant</hi> would doe him no hurt, and hee yſſued out of the houſe with his ſword in his hand, and ran as faſt as he could vntill he was without the Subburbs, then he ranne in the field ouer hedges and diches, to the entent that none ſhould follow him, and he hearkened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Towne, where hee heard great crying, and noiſe of the Hoſt of the houſe that he came from, whereby all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Taylours, Shoomakers, Drapers, and men of al crafts, came to the houſe, and there was ſuch a noiſe made in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs, that the Towne gates were opened, and the Burgeſſes yſſued out, and came to the houſe whereas the noiſe was: and when the Magiſtrates of the Towne came thether, and ſawe the men lye dead, they demaunded of the Hoſt who had done that murder. Sir, (quoth the Hoſt) a Vagabond hath done it, who is bigge and mightie, for I neuer ſawe with mine eyes a man better made nor fourmed, and he is fledde away with his ſword in his hands on yonder hye way: but Sir, for God ſake come not too néere him, for hee ſéemeth no man when hee is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, but hée is like a man out of his wittes without all feare and doubt.</p>
               <p>Then the Magiſtrates commaunded to follow him both on
<pb facs="tcp:4519:329"/>
horſe-backe and afoote, and they all ranne to armour, though the Captaine were not greatly afraide, yet hee would not bee the firſt that ſhould go foorth, he loued better that another ſhold take that aduantage. Thus on all ſides on horſe-backe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote, they followed <hi>Croiſſant,</hi> who kept not the high way, and it was far in the night: and alſo there were many that would not chafe themſelues ouer much to ſéeke for him, for they wold make no preaſſe to receiue his offering: becauſe they feared to finde him: and when they had ſought a long ſpace in the fields and in the high wayes, and could not finde him, they all retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their Towne, and <hi>Croiſſant</hi> went euer from the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with his ſword naked in his hand: and when hee ſawe that he was two Leagues off, he entred into the high way, and praiſed God that hee was ſo eſcaped without daunger, but hee was ſore diſpleaſed, in that he had neuer a penny in his purſe, and nothing but his Sword, his Coat, and a rich purſe at his guirdle, and alſo he ſawe that it was Winter, froſt and ſnow: alſo he felt the cold winde, the which did him much ill. Thus hee went foorth all night, and the next day, vntill it was néere night, then he arriued at a Village, and there he was faine to ſell his ſword, for lacke of monney to pay for his ſhot, he came to a Lodge, where he was ſerued of euerie thing that he would haue: then in the morning when he departed, he ſold his purſe for as much as hee could get, and hee trauailed ſo long that hee approached to Roome, and hee came to a Lodging without the gate, and there he lodged that night, and in the morning he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of his Hoſt, to whome that Towne appertained, and who was lord thereof, and what his name was that gouerned the Towne? The Hoſt ſayd: Fréend, hee that nowe is Lord héere, is named <hi>Guymart</hi> of <hi>Puille,</hi> but before hee came hether, we had a young Lord, the faireſt young Gentleman that euer was ſéene, and he was Sonne to the noble Emperour <hi>Ide,</hi> you ſomewhat reſemble him, but he was of ſo ill rule, and ſo full of follies, that all the riches and wealth that his Father had left him, hée ſpent and gaue away to euerie man that would craue any thing of him, ſo that in the end hee left himſelfe nothing to liue by. And after I heard ſay, that he had in himſelfe ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:4519:330"/>
ſhame, that he departed priuily with a Squier, &amp; went to ſéeke his aduentures: but no man knoweth where he is, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will euer come againe or not, and the Communaltie of the Cittie made little thereof, for after hee was departed, they ſent for King <hi>Guymart</hi> of <hi>Puille,</hi> whome they haue made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of this Empire.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Croiſſant</hi> vnderſtood his Hoſt, he complained right pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly to himſelfe, and ſayde. Alas poore Caitiffe that I am, what ſhall I do, that thus haue loſt al mine Inheritance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recouerie? and beſides that I haue nothing to ſpend, nor I haue no trade to liue by, it muſt behooue me to die through hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and cold, I haue no more but fiue and Twentie ſhillings, for the which I ſould my purſe. Thus as well as he could, he continued till Lent, then the ſeaſon began to be ſomewhat hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and euerie day in the morning he would heare ſeruice, and euerie man that ſaw him, beheld him greatly for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that he was of, &amp; there were diuers that knew him, but they would make no ſemblance thereof, to the intent that they wold giue him nothing: and when they ſawe him, they would ſhun the way, becauſe he ſhould not know them, there were many of them that hee had done much good vnto, and giuen them in ſuch wiſe, that they were become rich, and he poore, and there was none of them that would offer him one morſell of bread, whereof he was ſorrowfull, for then he ſawe well his monney was gone, ſo that he had neuer a penny left, then he thought to ſell his Gowne, rather then to die for hunger, and ſo he did: he ſould it for eight &amp; Twentie ſhillings, and then he taried in his Lodging as long as his money endured, &amp; hée continued there vntill Eaſter, &amp; by that time all his monney was gone.</p>
               <p>Then he thought that he would goe into the ſtréetes, to ſée if he might eſpie any Burgeſſes, to whome he had done in times paſt ſome good vnto, and to demaund of them ſome courteſie: &amp; ſo he yſſued out of his Lodging, and walked into the ſtréetes, &amp; ſaw a rich Burgeſſe, who was leaning out at a window in his houſe: <hi>Croiſſant</hi> knew him well, for it was hee that made him rich, and before he was but poore: then he thought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge himſelfe to that Burgeſſe. Then <hi>Croiſſant</hi> went and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb facs="tcp:4519:330"/>
him right humbly, and ſayd. Sir, haue remembrance of a poore Caitiffe, to whome fortune is contrarie, and who in time paſt did you much good when you ſerued him, if you bee a good man as I beléeue you are, of the goodnes haue you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and it may be ſo, if you doe ſo, you ſhall fare the better. When the Burgeſſe heard <hi>Croiſſant,</hi> he beheld him fiercely, &amp; he knew him preſently, and without making of any manner of anſweare, he called his Page, and commaunded him to bring him a pan full of water to the windowe, and he did as his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had commanded him: then the Burgeſſe tooke the pan full of water, and he beheld <hi>Croiſſant</hi> who ſtood vnder the window, and did caſt the water vppon his head, ſo that his faire haire, coat, and ſhirt were all wet: <hi>Croiſſant</hi> without any word ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king made himſelfe cleane, and afterward ſaid to the Burges, that if he liued long, the offence that he had done him, he ſhould déerely buy it, but the Burgeſſe (who was proud and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) ſet but little by his words. <hi>Croiſſant</hi> (who was right ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull) tooke his way towards the Pallaice, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which there was an old Pallaice, whereas no man had dwelled in of a long ſpace, and he entred in at the gate, the which was great and ſtood open, and there he ſaw a great Piller, whereas there lay two burdens of ſtrawe: then he layd him downe and ſlept, right ſorrowfull &amp; angrie with the Burgeſſe that had ſo wet him with water: the which Burges after he had caſt this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vppon <hi>Croiſſant,</hi> hee went to the Pallaice to the Emperour <hi>Guymart,</hi> to flatter and to pleaſe him, &amp; he found the Emperor leaning in a window and ſaluted him, and ſayd. Sir, I bring you certaine tidings of <hi>Croiſſant,</hi> Sonne to the Emperour <hi>Ide,</hi> who of right ought to be Inheritour of this Empire, whereof you are as now Emperour: he is come into the Towne in his doublet, without hoſe or ſhooes, he is arrayed like a Vagabond or a Ruffian, comming from the Tauerne, &amp; he is ſo great and ſo well made in all his members, that hee ſéemeth more like a Champion readie to fight, then euer I ſaw man in all my life: if you will follow my counſaile, ſtrike off his head, or caſt him into a pit, that of him there may neuer be had any more memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For if he liue long, he may doe you dammage, and put you

out of this Empire which you hould, the which ſhould apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to him. When the Emperour <hi>Guymart</hi> vnderſtoode the Burges, he beheld him fiercely and ſayd: Speake no more to me of this matter, for thou doeſt like a Traytor, thou knoweſt well, that by him and his déeds thou and other bee made rich, &amp; thou art like him that betrayed our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I command thée from hencefoorth come not in my ſight, for I wil haue no acquaintance nor conuerſation with a Traitor: if it be ſo that <hi>Croiſſant</hi> be poore, it is pitie and lamentable, and great ſin to doe him any ill, for I haue done him great ill, when I kéepe his Landes and Signiories wrongfully and without a cauſe, wherefore I thinke my ſelfe greatly culpable againſt the almighty God, for the ſinne that I haue done him, in that I hold the honour and Signiorie, that of reaſon ought to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to him, this day is Eaſter day, vpon the which day eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good Chriſtian man ought to humble himſelfe to God, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him mercie and pardon for all their ſinnes: it is reaſon that I make peace with God, and doe ſo that hee may bee content with me.</p>

The Emperour (who was
