         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IN my laſt I acquainted you that one <hi>Thorp</hi> at the <hi>Mitre-Inn</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> was taken up for ſaying theſe words, <hi>That he hoped by</hi> Chriſtmas <hi>day to ſee</hi> Oxon <hi>laid in Aſhes, and that if it lay in his power be would waſh his hands in the Earl of</hi> Abbington's <hi>blood,</hi> or words to that effect: And now I ſhall let you know that the Mayor took Bail, one <hi>Kimber,</hi> and one <hi>Harding,</hi> two Papiſts; when the Rabble knew who was his Bail, there roſe about three hundred all with Clubs and Staves, crying out, <hi>No Popery</hi>; and thenwent to all the Papiſts houſes in the Town, and broke their windows, but eſpecially <hi>Thorps,</hi> and his two Bail: That night theſe three went to <hi>London,</hi> and it's thought, to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the 5th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> there came in about eighty Horſe, ſtout Men, well Armed, commanded by Captain <hi>Winch</hi> and Captain <hi>Flyer,</hi> going, as 'tis reported, into the Weſt, but Lodged at the <hi>Angel-Inn</hi> that night, who came out of <hi>Herefordſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About four of the Clock in the Afternoon came in my Lord <hi>Lovelace,</hi> with about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Horſe, the greateſt part Gentlemen, and at the Eaſt-gate there met him the Mayor and his Brethren all in their Formalities; the Recorder made a Speech to him, and marched up the Street in order as thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt went my Lord's Sumpter Horſes at a good diſtance, then went the Mayor with the Mace, and his Brethren all a-foot, juſt before my Lord, and next to his Lordſhip there were four Prieſts or Jeſuits, which he brought from <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> all pinioned, and the reſt rode in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſix a-breaſt up to my Lord's Quarters, which was the <hi>Croſs-Inn,</hi> with a multitude of Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but about Eight of the Clock at night there came News that at a place called <hi>Benſon,</hi> and at <hi>Wallingford</hi> there was about 1500 Dragoons, and both places not above ten Miles from Oxon; ſo the Mayor raiſed all the Trained-Bands that live in this place, but I ſuppoſe it was by order of my Lord, and ſo ordered about twenty to be upon <hi>Magdalen</hi> Bridge, and blockt up the ſaid Bridge with Waggons and Carts; and it is reported, this day being <hi>Thurſday,</hi> they will pull up part of the Bridge. That night they pulled up a Bridge called <hi>Oſney,</hi> likewiſe kept a mighty ſtrong Guard all the night, but all was in ſafety as yet.</p>
            <p>This day being <hi>Friday,</hi> about two of the Clock in the night the Trumpets ſounded, and there was cryed, <hi>Arms, Arms</hi>; my Lord Riding up and down the Street, encouraged all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Arms, which I think there could not be leſs in number than four hundred Musketeers, and about three hundred of the Rabble with Clubs and Staves.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Magdalen</hi> Bridge was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, and beſides, the Waggons and Carts ſtill remain upon the Bridge, and about ten in the morning my Lord diſmiſſed all the Foot, to be ready at the beat of Drum.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have told you that upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange's Manifeſto</hi> was proclaimed at <hi>Carfax</hi> by one Mr. <hi>Mordant,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi>'s Brother.</p>
            <p>This day being <hi>Saturday,</hi> Counſellor Pudſey brought into this place about twenty Men with Horſe and Arms, and in the Afternoon there came in thirty Gentlemen with their Sumpter Horſes, ſuppoſed to come from the Prince, but I cannot learn who they are: And in the Afternoon the Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> cauſed the Horſe and Foot to be drawn up, and the foreſaid Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and her Declaration, for all Papiſts to lay down their Arm, and the like.</p>
