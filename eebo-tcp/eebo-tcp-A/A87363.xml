            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Rules to know a Royall King,
from a diſloyall Subject.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> King is our Father which is on earth,
in that he is the Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and made Gods <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> by
that <hi>All-giving Power, Our Father
which is in heaven.</hi> This being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we are the Kings Children, (as he is King, and
we good Subjects) in that we are his Countrey:
And (according to this ſenſe) none but a Traytor
can be illegitimate.</p>
            <p>There is this neere affinity betwixt a Royall
King and a naturall Father; they have both a like
power aſcribed by Divine Ordinance, and but one
word to expreſſe that power; <hi>Honour thy Father and
Mother,</hi> likewiſe <hi>Honour the King;</hi> and I may joyn
the ſequell of the firſt to them both, <hi>That thy dayes
may be long in the land,</hi> (I pray heaven we turn not
this bleſſing to a curſe, and ſhorten our own dayes)
There is ſuch a ſympathie in their equall power,
&amp; our filiall obedience, that I conclude he cannot
truly honour his Father and Mother, that doth not
honour the King: I am ſo confident of it, that were
I the father of a knowing ſon, I ſhould gueſſe how
much his duty were to me, by his obſervation of
this command, <hi>Honour the King.</hi> Grace muſt take
precedencie of Nature, though (according to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation)
to the laſt we are moſt lenitive. And ſince
we are commanded one form of obedience to our
King and Father, Father and King, I have ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125302:3"/>
there is an unity in their forme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Firſt, in <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> a Father and a King have
equall power to correct offences, and mercie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit:
They both make <hi>Precepts,</hi> and (according to
their piety) are themſelves <hi>Examples:</hi> They aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate
in the way of Providence; As a father is
maſter of a Family, and protecteth the leaſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of it; ſo doth a King protect his Family, (which
is his Country) ſurrounding it with Fortifications
to prevent all barbarous invaſions; which if it
cannot be effected by his owne proper charges,
it is no more then duty the ſon ſhould help the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As no wiſe father will deſtroy his owne
houſhold; ſo no right royall King will ruine his
owne Countrey. With bowing reverence I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
the words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>or what man is
there of you whom if his ſonne aske bread will give
him a ſtone? or if he aske fiſh will give him a Serpent?</hi>
This is one perfect rule to know a Royall King
from a diſloyall Subject. <hi>Honour and obey him</hi> in
his Laws. He cannot be a Royall King, that lets
a Subject rule him. His royalty conſiſteth in your
obedience, or in ſuppreſſing your diſobedience:
in which the King ſtill appeares Royall, and the
Subject diſloyall.</p>
            <p>As it is inhumane, and ſtartles Nature it ſelfe to
ſee a ſonne draw weapons againſt the father; ſo it
ſhould doe in the oppoſition of a Subject to his
King: And becauſe the Lord would ſecure him,
fore-knowing the wickednes of the people, (who
conſtantly rebell againſt their Maker) he gave
them this ſtrong and moſt infallible Prohibition
in theſe words,</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:125302:3"/>Touch not mine Anointed, and doe my Prophets no
harme.</q>
            <p>That is, doe not aſſault the King, nor his Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Divines. This ſenſe is thus expounded. Some
ſtill-ſtanding Neuter will anſwer me very ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
honeſt, He will obey that Text; heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
that he ſhould lift a hand againſt his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.
But let me juſtly informe him, He is as
guilty in ſtanding ſtil to ſee another doe it. He that
doth no good, (where his ability can maintain it,
and the cauſe require it) doth harme; and he that
proceedeth not in that good, (having begun it) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
backwards. He is no honeſt man that is a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
and he muſt needs be a coward that is a <hi>Neuter,</hi>
(a <hi>Iohn-indifferent</hi>) who would peaceably live in
the Truth; but in caſe of neceſſity, when the cauſe
requires it, he dares not hazard his life &amp; fortunes
for the protection of this Truth, there lies the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize,
and (conſequently) the diſhoneſty. Is it
not ſtrange a man dares not weare a ſword for
feare of being beaten? it hath beene a cowards
policie, who hath liv'd ſecure upon the valour of
his adverſary; and his word is, <hi>I hope you will not
ſtrike a diſarmed man:</hi> he ſhall never be <hi>John for the
King</hi> Ile warrant him, therefore Ile leave him.</p>
            <p>The Royalty of a King doth mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the loyalty of a Subject: True Princes
will not be injured: The great unqueſtioned
power that made the Univerſe, did make a
King, but evill Subjects firſt made him a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
(A <hi>Lyon will not be roughly handled</hi>) A
Princes anger to a Subject ſhould be received as
wool embraceth flint, or any ponderous ſubſtance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125302:4"/>
caſt upon it. This is my fixt reſolution, Who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not truly a pious Prince, and ſuch a one is our
moſt gracious Soveraign Lord King <hi>Charles,</hi> I will
ſcarce beleeve that he can love his Maker. If any
man be offended with it, let him doe his pleaſure;
as he uſeth me, he would doe my Maſter, for
whom Ile lay my life downe.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Wipe your eyes cleare, and I will ſhew you the Jewels
which illuſtrate and illuminate the Crowne
of England.</head>
               <p>1. THe firſt you fixe your eyes upon, is the
Jewel <hi>Innocence;</hi> ſo cleere, that Chryſtal
would be a ſpot in it. The vertue is this, It dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
others eyes, but can it ſelfe receive no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh;
it is no colour, but a luſtre.</p>
               <p>2. The next Jewel is <hi>Fortitude,</hi> a round ſtone, the
vertue lyes within; where if you look you ſhall ſee
to your thinking the beauty of a glorious creature
crowned, and armed <hi>capape</hi> with many ſtout Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders;
the Banners bearing this Motto in them,
<hi>Vive le Roy:</hi> a ſtone of moſt unvalued price, and
worth your ſeeing.</p>
               <p>3. The third Jewel is <hi>Patience,</hi> a ſtone that can
cure the diſeaſe of a whole Nation, if it be not
abuſed by too much handling.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth Jewel is <hi>Peace,</hi> a Jewel not for
every eye to look on, for it hath made ſome blind;
in it ſelfe glorious, and of much vertue.</p>
               <p>5. The fift Jewel is <hi>Love,</hi> a ſtone very ſcarce,
but in the Diadem, and ſome few other Coronets.
He that can truly view it, ſhall find it work upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125302:4"/>
the ſoule; it is the onely thing in the earth to cure
a man corrupted with idle jealouſies.</p>
               <p>6. The ſixt Jewel is termed <hi>Royall Anger,</hi> a ſtone
that ſhews a cleare flame, yet appears burning and
dangerous. It is not to be touched, but diſcerned
at a diſtance. As you ſtand and look on it, it looks
flaming; when you kneel, the fire ſeems to vaniſh.</p>
               <p>7. The next Jewel to this, is the Jewel <hi>Juſtice;</hi>
a ſtone foure-ſquare: you can ſtand no way, but it
ſeems to be in your eye, and appears ſquare, which
way ſoever you turne it. It is a ſtone ſo full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
many are afraid to look on it; yet they that
have good eyes, may view it freely. Let any
Traitor look upon it, his eyes will preſently be
bloud-ſhot: therefore it is called by ſome, <hi>A touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
for a Traitor.</hi> I would not have a <hi>Browniſt</hi> look
on it, for feare of ſpoiling his eyes.</p>
               <p>8. The eighth and laſt Jewel is called <hi>Mercy,</hi> a
ſtone of a moſt delicious colour, and pleaſeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eye; It preſerveth good eyes, and cureth ſore
eyes, if they be not too dangerous. It contenteth
a good nature, but many times makes a bad one
worſe. I have now ſhewn you the Treaſury of the
<hi>Regall Diadem:</hi> if theſe pleaſe your eye, next Ile
content your eare with a Sonet:</p>
