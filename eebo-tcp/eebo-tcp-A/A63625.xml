         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

IN

Wherein is declared how the Earle of Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
met with Prince Robert as he was
plundering the ſaid town.</head>
            <head type="sub">Alſo how the ſaid Earle of Stamford fell upon

how Prince Robert himſelfe eſcaped
very narrowly.</head>
            <p>PRince <hi>Robert</hi> the ſecond ſonne to the
Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Kings Majeſties
onely Siſter, hath (if report ſpeake
truth) ſince his laſt coming and abode in
<hi>England,</hi> done many outrages, plundered
many townes, deſtroyed much corne, with
many other inſufferable injuries and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which have beene by him heaped on
the poore ſubjects that ſtood well-affected
to the Parliament. And leaſt any ſhould
make queſtion of the truth of this Relation,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58067:3"/>
ye know that an attempt of the ſame nature
was by the ſaid Prince <hi>Robert</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
put in execution on monday laſt the
twelfth of September at a place called <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> the inhabitants of
the towne, it appeares; being well affected to
the King and Parliament: For which cauſe
the ſaid Prince <hi>Robert</hi> came againſt them
with eighteene hundred horſe, and ſome
ſmall number of Foot, and fell upon them,
plundering of their houſes, taking away
their armes, ſeizing upon their horſes, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their hay about, and trampling it under
feet with their horſes, and doing miſchiefe
without controule, the towne not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make any reſiſtance without aid from
ſome other place, which for the preſent was
not afforded unto them.</p>
            <p>During the time that Prince <hi>Robert</hi> was
putting the towne to this extreme trouble
and diſtraction, the noble Earle of <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
had received intelligence of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
hee being upon a march onely
with eight hundred horſe: whereupon,
knowing that Prince <hi>Robert</hi> would never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
upon ſuch a deſigne; if his ſtrength
were not anſwerable; and withall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the great dammage that he might ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine,
if hee ſhould go againſt him, being
ſo weake and unprepared: Wherefore hee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58067:3"/>
drew up his men into a ſmall Front, with a
loud voice immediately declaring what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
he had newly received from <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
and alſo declared unto them the
number of the Forces that accompanied the
ſaid Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> and with many expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſetting forth the earneſt deſire he had to
go up to aſſiſt them, but withall was very
loath to adventure his ſmall Forces againſt
ſo great odds, and hee for the preſent not
knowing how to gaine ſtrength to ſuppreſſe
them, his Forces being diſperſed thorough
the Countrey apon ſeverall urgent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
occaſions for the maintaining of the
peace of the Kingdome; wherefore the ſaid
Earle demanded of them whether they were
willing to goe on or retreat, withall telling
them, that if they did goe on, they muſt
reſolve to fight it out to the uttermoſt, and
to ſtand againſt a double oppoſition for their
number.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, and theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and the imminent danger, they with a
generall ſhout cried, On, On: Which the
good Earle perceiving, with a great deale of
joy incouraged them, telling them that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in perſon would lead them on and bring
them off, and not forſake them ſo long as he
had either breath or one drop of bloud in
his veines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58067:4"/>
Thus with confidence and courage they
preſently marched forward, ſinging of
Pſalmes till they were within the ſight of
<hi>Harborough,</hi> where they might plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Prince with all his Forces march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the ſaid towne, very confidently
and ſecurely, without the leaſt ſuſpition of
being oppoſed, with their prize of Armes
and Horſe which they had taken from the
towne; which the Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> ſeeing,
made a ſtand under a wood ſide, which ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
him and his Companies from the ſight
of the Princes Forces: which having done,
he ſent forth a Scout privately to the towne,
to command them to put themſelves into
the beſt poſture of defence that they could,
to keepe them from retreating backe to the
towne, which was accordingly effected; in
which time the Prince had recovered the
bottome of the hill, where the Earle of
<hi>Stamford</hi> had placed his men, onely two
Troupes which hee had ſent thorow the
wood, to come on the Reare of the Princes
Troupes, and conſequently to get betweene
him and the towne.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as the Prince ſaw himſelfe ſo
ſuddenly encompaſſed, he endeavoured to
retreat againe to the towne; but finding that
there was no ſecurity, and ſeeing that the
Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> preſſed ſo hard upon him,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58067:4"/>
and charged ſo hotly againſt him, the Prince
with his horſe made up to the wood ſide, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to gaine the wind, but was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
prevented, and beaten back upon
the River, by which meanes his Troupes
were diſordered: for the other two Troupes
of horſe which the Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> had
ſent to get betweene the Princes Forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the towne, together with the inhabitants of
the towne on the one ſide, and the Earle of
<hi>Stamford</hi> with his Troupes on the other ſide,
purſued them ſo cloſely, that moſt of the
Princes Foot were forced to take the river,
thirty were ſlaine, many Priſoners were
taken, and the Prince himſelfe inforced to
flie for the ſafety of his Perſon, and leave
his rich Prize behinde him, otherwiſe the
Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> had taken order for his
forth coming.</p>
            <p>This victory being thus obtained, they
marched backe againe to the towne, where
they were joyfully entertained by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
bringing back with them the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
alſo which Prince <hi>Roberts</hi> Forces had
taken from them. The<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

horſe quartered there for the ſafeguard and
future ſecurity of the towne againſt other
