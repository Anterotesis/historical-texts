            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. At last he is out; and then like a disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Guest, hindred of his old Lodging, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of so warme a bed, he <hi>walks through dry places,</hi> revisites the Heathen. But finding them as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his owne, as the infrangible chaines of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse could make them; he disdaines <hi>rest,</hi> like an Ingrosser, in his owne Lordship; so long as there are other purchases to bee made abroad. Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes the <hi>Arke</hi> of <hi>saluation</hi> is now brought to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and then the <hi>Dagon, Dragon</hi> of hell must needs be packing.

                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Ayre</hi> thus discouered, and discomfited by the <hi>Sunne</hi> of <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the grosse and foggy Clouds of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> wherein the <hi>Gentile</hi> world was wrapped: VVhat doth he? but re-salutes his former habitation. He liked the <hi>old seat</hi> well, and will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fall, but recouer it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thether he flyes; and loe, how fit he findes it for his entertaine! The <hi>heart</hi> of the <hi>Iewes is empty</hi> of <hi>Faith; swept</hi> with the beesome of <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> a iusticiary, imaginary, false-conceited righteousnes;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:491:6"/>
and <hi>garnished</hi> with a few broken traditions and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; suppellectile complements in stead of substantiall graces.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Glad of this, he recollects his forces: <hi>takes with him seauen other spirits,</hi> a greater dominion of sinne, then he was earst armed with all: <hi>more wicked then himselfe;</hi> as if hee would make inuincible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, and preuention of any future dispossession.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>He enters in</hi> with his crew; not purposing to be as a <hi>Guest,</hi> but a <hi>Tenant;</hi> not a <hi>Tenant,</hi> but a <hi>Land-Lord;</hi> not a <hi>Land-Lord,</hi> but a <hi>King,</hi> a Commander, a Tyrant: till at last he may presume of an indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate right. As Vsurpers that come to a Kingdome by a violent or litigious title, are at first so modest &amp; dainty, that they signe not their Graunts, Edicts, and such publike Acts in their owne particular and singular names, but require the conscription, and euident consent of their Counsell. But once esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by succession, and vnriual'd by opposition, they grow peremptorily confident in their owne right and power, and in their most tyrannous acts dare signe, <hi>Teste meipso.</hi> So <hi>Sathan</hi> at first erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Kingdome in the <hi>Iewes,</hi> conscious of his vniust title, was content to admit the helpe of fond Ceremonies, Tales, Traditions, &amp;c. to make for him against <hi>Christ,</hi> whose <hi>Kingdome</hi> hee vsurpes. This he condiscended to out of a mannerly couze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and for the more subtle insinuation into the <hi>Iewish</hi> hearts. But now established in his Throne and confirmed in his title, by their hard-hartednes, and wilfull obstinacy in reiecting their <hi>Messias;</hi> hee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:491:6"/>
is bold to signe all his oppositions to the <hi>Gospell</hi> with a <hi>Teste meipso.</hi>

Sometimes he supends his tyranny, and sits close in the heart, banketting on the lusts which he findes there, and sends not abroad for new cates. The tempestuous wind eftsoone lyes still: the most robustious and malignant force of wickednes bates of the vsuall violence, and breaks not forth into the same shew of malice without some intermission. So farre as this suspense, remission, and interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne extends, so farre is <hi>Satan</hi> said to be <hi>gone out.</hi>

                     <p>You see the <hi>Measure.</hi> Onely giue mee leaue, to set you downe two short rules, as two reflecting perspectiues; wherein you may behold, whether this <hi>vncleane spirit</hi> be truely, or hypocritically <hi>cast out</hi> of your hearts.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:491:15"/>
The tenure, whereby <hi>Satan</hi> holds any Lorshippe in the heart, is sinne: He that would ouerthrow his title, must labour an eiection of wickednesse. Piety in the heart, purity in the life, are true testimonies of the Deuils exile. <hi>Satan</hi> fights against vs with 2. weapons. 1. That he found in vs. 2. That he brings vpon vs. That he found in vs, is <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>bloud:</hi> that he brings vpon vs, is <hi>death.</hi> By this latter he could not haue hurt vs, except wee had giuen him the former: and so reach'd him a weapon to pierce our owne hearts. In what measure <hi>sinne</hi> rules or is ruled: <hi>Satan</hi> is held in or eiected.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The discontinuing of some sinnes, and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others giues no comfort or argument of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans departure.</hi> If he be truely <hi>gone,</hi> there comes in his place a perfect detestation, and resolute op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position against all sinne. It is in vaine to <hi>cast out Satan</hi> by auoiding auarice, when thou letst him in by a wastfull prodigality: to admit him by hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, whom thou throwest out by profanesse. This is to put the <hi>Deuill</hi> out at the porch, and let him in againe at the posterne. But one <hi>Rimmon</hi> is too much for <hi>Naaman,</hi> one <hi>Delilah</hi> for <hi>Sampson,</hi> one <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias</hi> for <hi>Herod:</hi> one exorbitant delight reserued, resolued, persisted in, is enough for <hi>Satan,</hi> too much for the sinner.</p>
                     <p>I say not, leaue all sinne, but loue no sinne. How impossible is the former, the latter how necessary! It is the content and complacency in sinne, that holds in the Deuill. What is it for a rich man to brag he is no theefe? or a begger to cleare himselfe from bribery? or for an olde man to forbeare the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:491:16"/>
Stewes? or for a credulous Papist, that thinkes to deserue heauen by workes, to adde a mite to an Hospitall? but whiles hee powres a little ointment on <hi>Christs</hi> feete by charity, by opinion of merit he throwes the boxe at his head. What is it to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from those sinnes, whereunto thou art not tempted? But repentance renounceth <hi>all dead workes:</hi> and obedience striues to walke in all Gods wayes. <hi>In omnibus sine exceptione, etsi non in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus cum impletione.</hi> None of all must be excepted, though none of all fulfilled.

                     <p>This is the effect of an ouerly and superficiall <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> like a slight beesome, it sweepes away the dust and cobwebs, and such lighter stuffe, but the filth and dirt is caked and baked on. Sinnes of lesse delight to the flesh, and tentations of weaker force, are brush'd away; but the maine affection to some olde impiety hath the roote in the heart vndigged vp. The deuill is content, the conscience should be <hi>swept,</hi> so long as it is but onely <hi>swept.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sinne is congealed, concorporated, baked on; and must be pared and digged away by greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence then <hi>sweeping. Swept Satan</hi> yeelds it, so not pared. Impiety is habituated by custome, hardned
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:491:30"/>
by impenitency, concorporated to him by his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to it: and shall hee thinke, that a formall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, like a soft beesome, can <hi>sweepe</hi> all clean? Can a few drops and sprinklings of water purge off the inueterate foulenesse and corruption of the flesh? There is required much rensing to whiten a defiled soule.</p>
                     <p>How peruerse is their course and thought, that imagine, they may repent more in an houre, then they sinne in an age! As if, hauing in many yeares kindled a thousand fires, thou wouldst think to put them out all with one teare: whereas indeede, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares can scarse put out one. Then boldly, staine the cloth a whole vintage, and at last let one wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing serue for all. Alas! man is quickly made mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but not with such speed happy. How easily, how suddenly got man his damnation: it was but eating an apple; soone done. <hi>Esau</hi> quickely hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away his blessing, but could not with <hi>manie teares</hi> recouer it. <hi>Dauid</hi> is not long in falling, his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is tedious. With much paines and contention doth a man climbe vp some high Tower; but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his hold, he comes downe apace. It is no easy thing to stand, it is easie to slip, to stumble, to fall. The thicke and foggy aire of this sinfull world, as the smoake and stenchfull mistes ouer some popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cities, can soone fully the soule: the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all tramplings of sinne brings mire and dirte vpon the conscience: these corruptions are not so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently rid away, as taken.</p>
                     <p>Clip thy haires short, yet they will grow againe, because the roots are in the scull. A tree, that is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:491:30"/>
but pruin'd, shredde, topp'd, or lopp'd, will sprowt againe: roote it vp, and it shall grow no more. What is it to clip the outward apparances, and to loppe the superfluous boughes of our sinnes, when the roote is cherish'd in the heart? What to haue a foule and miry house <hi>swept?</hi> The <hi>Pharise</hi> in his blowne prayers, cousening ythes, frequent almes, did but <hi>sweepe</hi> the house, and remoue the cobwebs of outward impieties; but the dirt of hypocrisie was baked on; the rootes of pride and couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse grew still vntouched.</p>
                     <p>It is not then a transient sorow, nor a formall compunction, (which may wound and pricke the heart, like a needle; but wants the thred of <hi>Faith</hi> to sow and ioyne it to God) that can make the <hi>house</hi> cleane.

                     <p>These <hi>hypocrites,</hi> being erst so themselues abused and deluded of <hi>Satan,</hi> perswade others to villany, by arguments of vertue.

                     <p>This is that <hi>hypocriticall</hi> and halfe-turning to God; when the outward action is suppressed, and the hidden corruption lyes still foster'd in the heart.

                     <p n="1">1. Whilst this <hi>blacke Deuil</hi> had a <hi>white</hi> face, &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the countenance of religion, he was wrap'd vp in the general prayers of the Church.

                     <p>But when the white scarffe is plucked off this <hi>Moores</hi> face, and his <hi>blacke</hi> leprosie appeares: when the Wolfes sheepskin is stripp'd off, and he is seene to worry the lambes: then is he singled out as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to <hi>Christ,</hi> and Gods iudgement hastened on him at the intreaty of his seruants.

Whilst this <hi>blacke Deuil</hi> mantled his tawny skin, and vlcerous hart with dissimulation of piety, there was outwardly some hopefull likelihood of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and winning to heauen. (Though God knew otherwise in his hidden and reserued counsel) whilst he sate in the congregation of Saints, heard what God spake to them, and spake with them to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:491:41"/>
God; the Minister did preach to him the tydings of peace with a good opinion, and admitted him to the communication of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> But now, his eruption into manifest contempt of sacred things, and despite done to the <hi>spirit of truth,</hi> hath deaded that hope so that the Minister hath not that confident comfort, that the <hi>word</hi> will be the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of life</hi> vnto him. His <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the world; his <hi>Apostacy</hi> hath deceiued himselfe: therefore his <hi>state is worse.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. His <hi>latter end is worse</hi> in regard of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:</hi> and this may bee amplified in foure circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Before he was sicke of spiritual drunkennesse, now he is lethargiz'd. VVho knowes not that a continued lethargy is worse then a short ebriety Such is his <hi>state.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2.

                        <hi>Nay, they wer not at al ashamd, neyther could they blush.</hi> He hath so little repented for wickednes, that now he thinkes there is no wickednesse standeth in need of repentance. A brasen face, which no foule deed, nor reproofe for it, can make to change colour. How can it be otherwise? For a <hi>blacke Deuil</hi> can no more blush, then a blacke Dog.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He is in <hi>worse state,</hi> by so much as a relapse is more perilous then the first sicknesse. By reason that strength is now spent, and nature made more

weake, and vnable to helpe it selfe, or to receiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by what is ministred. The sparlies of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse are now dying, or quite extinct, &amp; the flouds of iniquity more violent against him. There be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer assaults, and lesse strength to encounter.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Before he was quiet in himselfe, and might haue a flattering hope, that the night would neuer come. But now breaking forthinto palpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and obduracy, he finds his conscience open to condemne him, and hell gates open to receiue him. His vlcer seemed to be fairely skinn'd ouer, and in his owne sense healed; but now to come to a new incision, is greater terror then euer. The sound of feare is now in his eares, the sense of a dagger at his heart. His body would, his mind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rest. The horror of future punishment lyes at <hi>Cain's</hi> doore, and is at euery noyse ready to wake. There is a fearefull conflict betwixt <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> in him: that he may vse <hi>Iobs</hi> words, though in a deeper and direr sense. <hi>Pactus sum mihimet</hi>

                     <p>This ague, or rather agony, is made more vexing by the sting of conscience: which is now Gods bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe to arrest him; his witnesse against him; his whip to lash him. His Register, that reades ouer the long booke of his offences; and after a terrible aggrauation of their heynousnes, tells him his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, direfull and intollerable; and that <hi>Coneordat cum actis Curiae,</hi> it agrees with the iust decree of Gods Court, neuer to be auoyded.</p>

A man is committed to prison for debt, or some light trespasse; is there indifferently wel vsed, hath (for his money) all the liberty that the layle and layer can affoord him; nay, is permitted to go abroad with keepers. At last, he spies opportunity, and breaks away: then the layler fumes and fomes and rageth; and perhaps, sweares away that little share of his owne soule, which he had left. The prisoner had need looke to himselfe: if the layler catch him, he had better neuer haue stirr'd. At last he is taken; now bolts, and lockes, and heauy yrons, a strong guard, and a vigilant watch; til he be made safe for stirring againe. This bondage is far worse then the first.</p>
                     <p>The sinner in the deuils keeping is let alone to enioy the liberty of the prison, that is, this world; he may feed his eye with vanities, his hand with extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his belly with iunkets, his spleene with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his eares with musicke, his heart with iollity, his flesh with lustes; and all this without controll. But if he be wonne by the <hi>Gospell</hi> preached to break pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and thereupon giue the deuill the slippe: let him take heed, <hi>Satan</hi> doe not catch him againe. If he once recouers him into his prison, he will dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon him; remoue from him all meanes, whereby he might be saued; let him see, heare, feele, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand nothing but temptations and snares; blinde

his soule, harden his heart; loade him with heauy irons, and locke him vp in bolts and fetters of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting perdition.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Then lastly, <hi>his end shal be worse at the last;</hi> when the least parcell of Gods wrath shall be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier, then all the anguish he felt before. When his <hi>Almond</hi> tree shall be turned to his <hi>yron</hi> rod; his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to Scorpions. VVhen the short and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany vexations of this world shall no sooner cease to him, then the eternall torments of Hell shall begin, and (which is most fearefull) shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer end. Be his body burned to death in fire, yet those flames shall go out with his ashes: but come his flesh and soule to that infernall fire, and when they haue beene burned myriads of yeares, yet it shall not be quenched.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I haue put vp the <hi>VVolfe,</hi> though not <hi>hunted</hi> him; as iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my selfe too weake for that sport-earnest. It is no desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Office to discouer that subtle and insatiate Beast; to pull the Sheepe-skinne of Hypocrisie ouer his eares; and to expose his feming malice and sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sugous cruelty to mens censure and detestation. Let those hands strike him, that haue darts of authority put into their Quiuers. Our Land is no <hi>Forrest,</hi> literally or metaphorically vnderstood: but whether for <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> profession or soile, an <hi>Orchard</hi> of Gods owne planting; fruitefull in goods and good workes. <hi>VVolues</hi> we haue none, but some <hi>Mystical</hi> ones; whose ferocity is yet hidden vnder the habites and
<pb facs="tcp:491:46"/>
cases of those <hi>Lambes,</hi> they haue deuoured. These I haue set in view, or at least meant my best to do it. I haue seldome pretended that common poyse, that (by their owne report) sets so many mad pens, like wheeles, a running, <hi>Importunacy</hi> of friends. I haue willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly published, what I had hope would do good published. Onely this I feared to keep from the Presse, lest it should steale thither another way. Being there, I could not with better confidence fasten vpon a knowne <hi>Patron,</hi> then your selfe: who can both vnderstand it, and will reade it: not onely the <hi>Epistle,</hi> but the whole <hi>Booke.</hi> Though that fashion with many patrons, of perusing more then their owne Titles, bee now as a Sute of the old make. I know you spend some houres of all dayes in such good exercises; abandoning those idle and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue customes, wherein too many will please themselues, and none else.</p>
                  <p>It is an vnthrifty spending of time, and a sorry successe will conclude it, when we are curious in plotting a method for our inferior delights; and leaue our <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation</hi> vnwrought vp. Wee striue to settle our Lands, to secure our monies, to confirme our estates; but to conforme our liues, or to make <hi>sure</hi> our <hi>Election</hi> is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipended. And yet when all is done; braines haue plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, meanes haue seconded, bonds and lawes haue esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished; nothing can be made <hi>Sure</hi> but onely our <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi> But goe you forward to adorne your eternall mind; and to plant your soule full of those <hi>Flowers,</hi> which giue already a pleasant odour on earth, and shall one day be stucke like glories in Heauen. So shall your <hi>memory</hi> be sweet in the mouths and hearts of future generations; whiles the vicious, euen aliue, doe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape

the Satyre. Thus with true thankfull loue I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hight you in my prayers, a happy Progresse in <hi>Grace,</hi> till you shall come to your Standing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of <hi>Glory.</hi>

                  <p>The holy word of God, who can giue most congruous names to natures, often compares the wicked to brute and sauage creatures.

                  <p>But mysticall <hi>wolues:</hi> rauenous in the formes of men: hauing a greater similitude to <hi>wolues</hi> in the disposition of their minds, then dissimilitude in the composition of their bodies.

                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>Sterrillity.</hi> The <hi>wolfe</hi> is not very fertile in producing the one kind: (if lesse, better.) But vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnprofitable in any good thing redounding from him. The horse carrieth his Maister, the oxe is strong to draw the plough, the sheepe giues vs wooll for warmth, and flesh for nourishment, the Cowes vdder drops milke into our pailes. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant hath vertue in his tooth, the Vnicorne in his horne, the Ciuet-cat in her sent, the Goate in his blood, the Beuer in his genitals. The dogge hath his seruice, and the catte keepes away vermine: not the ape, but makes some sport; and the very poyson of serpents is by art made medicinall. For hyde, or haire, or horne, or hoofe, or blood, or flesh, most beasts yeeld some profite; but the <hi>wolfe</hi> is good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>A fitte Embleme of a wicked man; that is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally euill whiles he liues: and not often doth so much good as a hogge when he dyes.

he may giue away some fragments in his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: but he parts with it in his will, against his will: and it is but a part, whereas <hi>Iudas</hi> returned al, yet went to hell.

generations hope to find out new Lands; and you know, they haue found them. You cannot expect more of two houres discouery, then of seauen yeares.

Ipoc. con. 61</note> booke, a booke of most happy consolation: deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring those euentuall comforts, which shall succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely and succesfully, accompany the <hi>Church</hi> vnto the end of the world. It presents, as in a perspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue glasse, the <hi>lambe of God</hi> guarding, and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his <hi>Saints:</hi> &amp; giuing them triumphant victory ouer all his and their enemies. The <hi>writings</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as I haue read it obserued, are of three sortes.

                  </p>
                  <p>This last (as of great consolation, so) is of great difficulty. There is <hi>Manna</hi> in the <hi>Arke,</hi> but who shall open it to vs?

                     <hi>lambe</hi> in the shallowes: not to be ouer-ventrous in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> as if I could reueale the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> but briefely to report what expositions others haue giuen of this branch: and then gather some fruite from it, for our owne instruction and comfort.

                  <p>VVith purpose of auoiding prolixity, I haue limited my selfe to this member of the 6. <hi>ver.

                  <p n="1">1. Some expound this <hi>glassy</hi> and <hi>Chrystal-like Sea,</hi> of <hi>Contemplatiue</hi> men: so <hi>Emanuel Sa.</hi> But I find this foundation so weake, that I dare not set any frame of discourse on it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

3. Some vnderstand by this <hi>glassy Sea-like Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall,</hi> the <hi>Fulnesse</hi> of all those guifts &amp; graces, which the <hi>Church</hi> deriues from <hi>Christ. In him dwels all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> yea so aboundant is his <hi>oyle of gladnesse,</hi> that it runnes (as it were) ouer the verges of his <hi>humane nature,</hi> vnto the <hi>skirts of his clothing;</hi> plentifully blessing his whole <hi>Church.</hi> Thus it is conceiued by <hi>Brightman.</hi> As if this <hi>mare vitreum</hi> were an <hi>anti-type</hi> to that <hi>mare fusum:</hi> spoken of 1. Kings 7. <note place="margin">1 King. 7, 23.</note> this <hi>glassy sea,</hi> to that <hi>molten sea.</hi> Among other admirable works of that heauen-inspired King. ver. 23. <hi>Hee made a molten sea, ten cubites from the one brimme to the other: it was round all about, and his height was fiue cubites: and a line of thirty cubites did compasse it round about, &amp;c. It contained two</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">ver 26.</note> 
                     <hi>thousand Baths.</hi> The end why it was made, and vse for which it serued, you shall finde, 2. Chron. <note place="margin">2. Chro. 1, 6.</note> 4. <hi>The sea was for the Priests to wash in.</hi> Now this might well seeme to prefigure some great <hi>pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> For otherwise, for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes to wash in, <hi>Exiguus aliquis vrceolus vel guttulus suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecisset:</hi> some cruet, bason, or lauer might suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently haue serued.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some intend this <hi>glassy sea, like to Chrystall,</hi> to signifie <hi>Coelum Chrystallinum,</hi> the Chrystalline heauen: which they affirme to bee next vnder that heauen of heauens, where the eternall God keepes his Court, and sits in his <hi>Throne.</hi> And somwhat to hearten the probability of this opinion; it is saide here, this <hi>Sea is before the Throne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Some expositions giue this <hi>sea</hi> for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. And their opinion is probably deduced from the two attributes, <hi>Glassy</hi> and <hi>Chrystalline.</hi>

                  <p>The accordance of the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Anti-type</hi> stands thus.

                  <p n="7">7. Lastly others affirme, that by this <hi>glassy Sea</hi> is meant the <hi>World.</hi> So <hi>Bullinger,</hi> &amp;c. This being the most generall and most probable opinion, on it I purpose to build my subsequent discourse. A spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reason to induce me, (as I think, the best light to vnderstand the <hi>Scripture</hi> is taken from the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> and as God best vnderstands his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, so he expounds it to vs by conferring places difficult with semblable of more facility) I deriue from <hi>Reuel.</hi> 15. verse 2. <hi>I saw as it were a Sea of glasse mingled with fire, and they that had gotten the victory</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Reuel. 15, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>ouer the beast, and ouer his image, and ouer his marke, and ouer the number of his name, stand on the sea of glasse, hauing the harpes of God.</hi> Where the <hi>Saints</hi> hauing passed the dangers of the <hi>glassy sea,</hi> all the

perils and terrors of this brittle and slippery <hi>World:</hi> and now setting their triumphant feete on the shores of happinesse; they sing a victorious song. <hi>Great and maruellous are thy workes, Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, iust &amp; true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints.</hi> Praising God with <hi>harpes</hi> and <hi>voices</hi> for their safe waftage ouer the <hi>sea</hi> of this <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for further confirmation of this opinion, in the 3. <hi>verse,</hi> the exultation which they sing, is called the <hi>song of Moses the seruant of God.</hi> So that it seemes directly to answere in a sweet allusion, to the deliuery of <hi>Israel</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> At what <note place="margin">Exodus 14.</note> time the diuided waters of the <hi>redde sea</hi> gaue them way; standing vp as a wall on their right hand, and a wall on their left; and that so long, till the little ones, and the women with childe might passe ouer dry-shod. But at last returning to their old course, swallowed vp their pursuers. Immediately here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Exodus 15. <hi>Moses</hi> and all <hi>Israel</hi> turning backe to behold the <hi>Egyptians</hi> drown'd in the <hi>sea,</hi> or flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the waues, whiles themselues stood secure on dry land; they sung a <hi>song</hi> to the <hi>LORD.</hi> The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> hauing passed the <hi>redde sea,</hi> sing a <hi>song</hi> to the <hi>LORD:</hi> the children of GOD ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing past the <hi>glassy sea</hi> sing a song also; and this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter song is called by the name of that first, euen the <hi>song of Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the <hi>Analogy</hi> stands thus. 1. The <hi>redde sea</hi> was a type of this <hi>glassy sea, the VVorld.</hi> 2. The olde <hi>Israelites</hi> of the new and true <hi>Israelites,</hi> the <hi>Faithfull.</hi> 3.
