            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Instructions concerning the <hi>Gamut.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the First Column of your <hi>Gamut,</hi> you have the Names of the several Lines and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In the Second, you have the Notes to each Line and Space, and their Names as they are to be Sung when <hi>Mi</hi> is <hi>Bmi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Third, you have the Notes to each Line and Space, and their Names as they are to be Sung when <hi>Mi</hi> is in <hi>Ela.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Fourth and last Column you have the Notes to each Line and Space, and their Names as they are to be Sung when <hi>Mi</hi> is in <hi>Alamire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, you see the Lines of your <hi>Gamut</hi> are divided into three Fives, expressing the Three several Parts in Musick <hi>(viz.) Treble, Tenor</hi> and <hi>Bass:</hi> And upon one of these Five Lines in every Part, you will find a particular Mark or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter called a <hi>Cliff</hi>; by which you may know exactly how to call every Note, that is placed upon the five Lines, or Spaces; for upon the fourth Line from the bottom, which is <hi>F-faut,</hi> you will see this Mark 𝄢 which is called the <hi>Bass</hi> or <hi>F-faut Cliff</hi>; because it is placed upon <hi>F-faut:</hi> And upon the Second Line above it you will see this Mark 𝄡 which is called the <hi>Tenor</hi> or <hi>C-sol-faut Cliff.</hi> And upon the Second Line above that you will find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Mark 𝄞 which is called the <hi>G-sol-reut</hi> or <hi>Treble Cliff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now take any of the Five Lines which you see Tied or Braced together out of the Scale, and you'l find these several Cliffs placed as follows: The <hi>Bass</hi> upon the upper Line but one of the Five. The <hi>Tenor</hi> upon the middle Line of the Five, and the <hi>Treble</hi> upon the lower Line but one of the Five,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:29819:3"/>Now as I said before, by these Cliffs you may know exactly how to name your Notes when you see them pricked down, either in <hi>Treble, Tenor,</hi> or <hi>Bass.</hi> But that you may the better understand them, I'le lay before you these following Examples in the Three several Cliffs.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, You may here observe by these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that <hi>Mi</hi> is the principal or Master-Note, which leads you to know all the rest; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found out that, the other follows in course. And this <hi>Mi,</hi> as I have already shown, has its being in Three several places. The first of them you see is in <hi>Bmi,</hi> but if a <hi>Flat,</hi> which is known by this Mark (♭) be set in that place, then it is removed into its second place, which you see is <hi>Elami</hi>; and if a <hi>Flat</hi> be also set in that place, then it is removed into its Third place, which you see is <hi>Are</hi> or <hi>Alamire:</hi> so that in which of these places you find it, the next Notes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it Ascending (as you may see in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Examples) are called <hi>Fa, sol, la, Fa, sol, la</hi>; and then you see the next Note is called <hi>Mi</hi> again: In like manner the next Notes below it Descending are called <hi>La, sol, fa, La, sol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fa,</hi> and then you see the next Note is called <hi>Mi</hi> again, for it is found but once in eight Notes Ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Desecending.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:29819:4"/>Now I proceed to the first Example of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Voice, or a Lesson of Plain Song upon Five Lines in the <hi>Treble,</hi> or <hi>Gsolreut Cliff,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of eight Notes gradually Ascending and Desending.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap> Sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, sol, fa, la, sol, fa, mi, la, sol,</p>
               <p>Now you are to observe when a Sound is given to the first Note, which is called <hi>Sol,</hi> you are then to rise to <hi>La</hi> (as the next in order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it) one whole Tone or Sound, and another whole Tone to <hi>Mi:</hi> From <hi>Mi</hi> to <hi>Fa</hi> is but half a Tone; From <hi>Fa</hi> to <hi>Sol,</hi> and <hi>Sol</hi> to <hi>La,</hi> are whole Tones; From <hi>La</hi> to <hi>Fa,</hi> but half a Tone; From <hi>Fa</hi> to <hi>Sol</hi> a whole Tone; And you might Ascend, if your Voice would permit you, Ten Thousand <hi>Octaves</hi> in the same Order as this one. The difference between whole Tones and half Tones either rising or falling, are easily distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd; for all whole Tones are chearful to the Ear, but half Tones are melancholly; and you'l always meet with two half Tones (either rising or falling) within the compass of Eight Notes, and those two are called <hi>Fa:</hi> For to rise from <hi>Bmi</hi> to <hi>Csolfa,</hi> and from <hi>Ela</hi> to <hi>F-faut,</hi> are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Sounds; Also to fall from <hi>F-faut</hi> to <hi>Ela,</hi> and from <hi>Csolfa</hi> to <hi>Bmi</hi> are melancholly sounds.</p>
               <p>Now for fear you should not Sing these Notes in Tune at the first, you ought to get the Assistance of a Person, either skill'd in the Voice or Instrument, and let him Sing or Play your Eight Notes over with you, till you can retain the sound in your Memory so well, as you may be able to do it without him: And when you are perfect in this first Example, here is a second<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29819:4"/>Example a little harder which is called <hi>Thirds</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because of the skipping from the first Note to the Third, and so missing a Note upon every Key as you rise and fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap> sol, mi, la, fa, mi, sol, fa, la, la, fa, sol, mi, fa, la, mi, sol,</p>
               <p>But for fear you should not rightly understand what I mean by skipping a Note, I have set you a third Example, thus: <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap> Sol, la, mi, sol, mi, la, mi, fa, la, fa, mi, fa, sol, mi, sol, <gap reason="music">

                  </gap> fa, mi, la, fa, la, mi, la, sol, mi, sol.</p>
               <p>You see now from the first Note of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample you Ascend three Notes gradually, as you were Taught before in your Eight Notes, and then you fall to your first again, then leaving out the second Note which should be <hi>Alamire,</hi> you skip from the first to the third, or from <hi>Gsolreut</hi> to <hi>Bfabemi,</hi> which will be the same thing with the Second Example, called Thirds: And the same Method you must observe in the rest of this Example: Also the like must be done with Fourths, Fifths, Sixths, Sevenths, and Eighths, As you may see in this Fourth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, wherein these several Leaps, or Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings in general are proved.</p>

               <p>I shall now proceed to give you some Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>Flats</hi> and <hi>Sharps,</hi> which are two Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of a different Quality, and much used in Musick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:29819:5"/>A <hi>Flat</hi> is known upon a Line or Space by this mark (♭) and a <hi>Sharp</hi> by this (<g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>) and the use of them are to <hi>Flat</hi> and <hi>Sharp</hi> any Note they are placed before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppose you were singing your Eight Notes, and when you come to <hi>Csolfa,</hi> or the first <hi>Fa</hi> above your <hi>Mi</hi> you should find a <hi>Sharp</hi> in that Space, you must not Sing it as I directed you in your first Example of Tuning the Voice, where I told you it was but half a Note or Tone above your <hi>Mi,</hi> but you must sing it a whole Tone above your <hi>Mi,</hi> for the Quality of a <hi>Sharp</hi> is to raise any Note it is Placed before half a Note or Tone higher, (or to speak like a Musician) sharper than it was before. Also when you descend to a <hi>Sharp,</hi> as from <hi>Ela,</hi> to <hi>Dlasol,</hi> or from <hi>Alamire</hi> to <hi>Gsolreut,</hi> and a <hi>Sharp,</hi> should be in <hi>Dlasol</hi> or <hi>Gsolreut,</hi> then you are to fall but half a Note, which is a Melancholly sound, as I before told you all half Notes were, either rising or falling, and consequently you may easily distinguish whether you sound it right or not, for it is like falling from <hi>Ffaut</hi> to <hi>Ela,</hi> or from <hi>Csolfa</hi> to <hi>Bfabemi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Flat,</hi> when it is placed before any Note which you should sound a whole Tone or Note higher than the Note immediately before it, obliges you to sound it but half so high, in the same manner as from <hi>Bfabemi</hi> to <hi>Csolfa,</hi> or from <hi>Ela</hi> to <hi>Ffaut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe also, that when these <hi>Flats</hi> or <hi>Sharps</hi> are placed at the beginning of your five Lines immediately after your <hi>Cliff,</hi> they serve to all the Notes that shall happen in that Line or Space where you see them placed, unless it is contradicted by a <hi>Flat</hi> or <hi>Sharp</hi> placed before that Note which the Composer has a mind should be so: And when they are not placed at<pb facs="tcp:29819:6"/>the beginning, they serve only to those Notes they are placed before. To conclude: I have made it my Endeavour so to perfect and finish this Work, that nothing should be wanting to render it useful to the End it is designed.</p>
