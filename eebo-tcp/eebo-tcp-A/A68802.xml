            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God might gouerne the world (if he pleased) by himselfe immediately, yet he committeth it to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Rulers, both <hi>supreame,</hi> and <hi>delegates</hi>; whom he honoureth with an high style,<note place="margin">Zach. 4.</note> calling them <hi>assistants to him that ruleth the whole earth:</hi> yea the <hi>sheilds of the earth,</hi> to beare off wrongs and euills from men.<note place="margin">Psal. 47.9.</note> The <hi>boughes</hi> of this <hi>faire tree</hi> of magistracie (as in that sacred em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme) are <hi>shelter for all,</hi>

               <hi>First</hi>; they must be <hi>men of courage,</hi> stout to vndergoe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> all the parts of their calling. How fit a vertue this is for a Magistrate will appeare, if we consider, 1. the good and <hi>godly</hi> in the land,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.3.</note> who are to be incouraged and <hi>praised</hi> in well doing by their Rulers: which will neuer be, if a man be afraid to be seene, or be timorous, as Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus was, who would faine be with Christ, but cast himselfe into the night, as though that had bin a worke of darknesse. Moses for his courage was called <hi>Pharaohs God,</hi> hee told Pharaoh to his face, hee would not leaue an hoofe behind him, that Pharaoh himselfe stood in awe of him. 2. The <hi>wicked,</hi> who are stout in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and sinne is with them as <hi>bold as an harlot,</hi> as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon speaketh. Now the Magistrate with Iob, must bestirre himselfe, and cloath himselfe with zeale and courage, that the <hi>young men may hide themselues,</hi> and the <hi>olde rise vp at his presence:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 29.8.</note> whereas an irreligious mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and remisnesse, strengthneth the hands of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. 3. The <hi>wicked one,</hi> euen Satan himselfe, who emboldneth offenders against the cheifest ordinances of God; I meane <hi>Magistracie,</hi> and <hi>Ministrie,</hi> to bring
<pb facs="tcp:18746:3"/>
them into contempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so bring in all confusion into the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> they must be men <hi>fearing God,</hi> and they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> specially called <hi>vpon to kisse the Sonne of God.</hi> For,<note place="margin">Psal. 2</note> 1. Gods feare is the beginning of wisedome: and who should be wise, if not Magistrates, to iudge and discerne of the most difficult cases amongst men? 2. If hee feare not God, hee will feare the face of man, and so accept of persons condemned, Deut. 1.17. 3. Hee must here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in assist the Lord himselfe in planting the feare of God in all his gouernment. <hi>Cyrus must performe</hi> not his own, but <hi>all the Lords desire: hee must say to Ierusalem, thou shalt be built,</hi> and to <hi>the Temple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 44.18.</note> 
               <hi>thy foundations shall be sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid.</hi> Euery Christian Magistrate must be a <hi>nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Church:</hi> and here begin his gouernment, as <hi>Moses</hi> with <hi>celebrating the passeouer, Ioshua</hi> with renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>circumcision, Gideon,</hi> with destroying <hi>Baal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 12. Ioshua, 5.7. Iudg 6.</note> 
               <hi>Dauid</hi> with establishing the Arke, <hi>Salomon</hi> with building Gods house, <hi>Asa</hi> with renewing the Lords Altar. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many inferiour Magistrates looke on, whilest this care slippeth into other mens hands; yet must they all knowe, that they are Gods vicegerents; and the <hi>iudgement is Gods,</hi> that is, from God, and for God: and therefore they must not onely cut off thefts, murders, adulteries, and such barbarous outrages, and riots against publicke peace and humane societie; but blasphemies, heresies, swearing, sabbaoth-breaking; and such sinnes as more directly oppose God and his worship: and these will the feare of God where it is especially hunt out. This was the grace that made Nehemiah seeke the <hi>wealth of Israel,</hi> by making the Princes sweare <hi>to Gods couenant:</hi> this made him almost forget himselfe in zealous reuenge against the Sabbath-breakers: all Ierusalem could not maintaine this one sinne against that one godly magistrate.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, magistrates must be men <hi>dealing truely.</hi> 1. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:18746:4"/>
sinceritie, truth, and iustice, which are the verie sinewes of humane societie. 2. effecting it by taking true paines, that the truth of euery cause may be sifted out; and receiue a true sentence,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.6. Deut. 16.20</note> that the poore may not bee borne downe with power and greatnesse, nor goe away in a good cause disappointed. 3. opposing with all their strength, whatsoeuer is opposite vnto truth: not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the truth to be clouded and vailed by flourishing pleas,<note place="margin">Opti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they must be men <hi>hating couetousnesse.</hi> For, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> 1. a publicke person must seeke the publicke good, and not be priuately minded, or selfe-seeking. 2. Hee will then hate gifts, which blind the wise, and peruert the words of righteousnesse: Now what a fearefull inuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods order were it, if hee who is set vp to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute iudgement, should peruert it? 3. Hee is in place wherein (if hee be corrupt) hee may helpe himselfe by the damage of others: but who should hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion that would flow in as a deluge, if the meanes ordained by God to helpe the oppressed, should be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted to helpe forward oppression? Now such a man thus qualified, Iethro thought fit to be set ouer <hi>thousands, and ouer hundreths; ouer fifties, and ouer tens.</hi> To this serue those auncient ceremonies vsed among Gods own people, in the installing of their gouernours: example whereof we haue in Ioash, whom when Iehoiadah had set into the right of his kingdome,<note place="margin">2. King. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12</note> they did three things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vnto him. First, they <hi>crowned him</hi> with a crowne of pure gold, set with pearles and precious stones: and these signified both the integritie of his person, and the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of his manners. 2. They gaue <hi>him the booke of
<pb facs="tcp:18746:4"/>
the testimonie:</hi> the booke shewed that wisedome is meet for a Ruler: and that it was the <hi>booke of the testimonie,</hi> sheweth, that 1. the most necessarie wisedome for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, is the wisedome of God: 2. that hee must iudge by Gods booke and directions, and therefore must be learned in Gods lawes, and skilfull in the cases of Gods statute booke: and 3. the booke was giuen him, that he might keepe and preserue it, and see the contents of it obserued in others: for he is a keeper of both the Tables. 3. They <hi>annointed him,</hi> to signifie the power and gifts of courage, magnanimitie, and other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ornaments fit to attend Magistracie. And indeed it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably preserueth the honour of this ordinance, when the person executing it, is as eminent in gifts and graces, as in place, and preheminence. I take not vpon mee to teach your Worships how to gouerne, but only declare how the Lord would euery way haue this ordinance of his, and the bearers of it honoured, and what be the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ornaments which draw the eyes, and reuerent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of inferiours vpon you.</p>
            <p>Now more seuerally, your grauitie (Reuerend Iudge your humanitie, your equitie in the lust and vnpartiall carriage of causes, your zeale against vice and vicious persons, who gladly decline your censure, your diligent frequenting the house of God; your care of promoting the pure worship of God, which you witnesse by your new erection dedicated thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue got you a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and due regard through all our countrie, wherein though I be but a stranger, yet must he be more strange that meeteth not with the report of your vertues. And you noble Knight (whome I haue knowne of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time) will giue mee leaue to conceale a great part of that I conceiue of your worth. You doe well to imitate your worthie parents, one of whom hath left you with a faire inheritance, a patterne (as I haue heard)
<pb facs="tcp:18746:5"/>
of many vertues, from which you may not depart: the other, God hath yet left vnto you, to follow you with motherly aduise and counsell, to set before you still the best patterns: but aboue all, the glasse of Gods word; the reuerent obseruation whereof, if you adde to the other excellent indowements of your minde, person, and estate, you shall giue a number of your yeares and ranke leaue to come behind you, and follow you a farre off, whilest your country shall be reaping the encrease, and your selfe the comfort of those hopefull seeds which everie one that know you, acknowledg with gladnes in you.</p>
            <p>Thus humbly craving pardon for my boldnes, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this booke to your worships acceptance, which for the whole argument (containing a plaine vnfolding of the most grounds and maine pillars of our religion) is worthy your respect; and your selues, with your vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ladies, and hopefull children, together with all your studies and endeauours for the Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to the rich blessing of God: who fill your hearts with heauenly wisedome, and preserue you both blameles till his appearing, Amen. <hi>Watford, Iuly</hi> 20.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18746:9"/>
Psal. 78.2. <hi>I will open my mouth in a parable, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare sentences of old:</hi> Iob. 33.1. <hi>Behold I haue opened my mouth; my tongue hath spoken in my mouth: my words are in the vprightnesse of my heart, and my lippes shall speake pure knowledge.</hi> Yea our Lord Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, when he begunne his most heauenly sermon on the mount,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.2.</note> is said to <hi>open his mouth, and say.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Whence, 1. we haue the doctrine in the sermon following commended vnto vs, to be for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it graue, and high, and neerely concerning the saluation of men: wherein are laid downe the maine grounds of all religion, and whatsoeuer we are to beleeue concerning Christ vnto saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we shall see when we come to open the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> points. 2. We are secretly incited, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Ghost hath opened the mouth of such a worthy instrument, we are also to open our eares, yea our hearts to let in the matter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as it proceeded out of the treasurie of a good and sanctified heart, so we also may hide it in good hearts as in good treasures, to bring it forth as our needes and occasions shall require. 3. Ministers must come with their mouthes open, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and not only not to be dumb dogs which cannot, or seale vp their lips and will not protest against the sinnes of the times; but also must haue care to speake the words of wisedome, iudgement, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie: for if the holy men of God, Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, nor the sonne of God himselfe did not preach without preparation and due considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18746:9"/>
both of what, how, and to whome they spake, how much more should ordinarie Ministers vse all diligence in fitting themselues to speake from God, and for God, and euen as God himselfe would speake to his people. 4. Euerie Christian may hence also take vp his dutie; namely, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> neuer open his mouth but to edification: For it is attributed to euerie <hi>iust man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 37.30.</note> that his <hi>mouth speaketh wisedome, and his tongue talketh of iudgement:</hi> he iudgeth of his speaches before he let them passe the doore of his lippes: and of the vertuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is said, <hi>She openeth her mouth with wisedome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 31.26.</note> 
               <hi>and the lawe of grace is in her tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the sermon following consisteth of three parts.<note place="margin">The parts of the sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 3.</note> The first is an entrance or preface in the two first verses, 34.35. 2. The proposition or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; that Iesus Christ was the Messias now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the flesh, and <hi>Lord of all,</hi> vers. 36. 3. A confirmation of that narration, partly from the <hi>Apostles</hi>; and partly from the Prophets witnesse. 1. For the Apostles they witnessed of such facts of Christ as argued him, First a <hi>Prophet,</hi> vers. 37.38. <hi>Who went about doing good, and healing, &amp;c.</hi> for these miracles serued to confirme his heauenly doctrine. Secondly a <hi>Preist,</hi> vers. 39. <hi>Whome they slewe, and hanged on a tree:</hi> which noteth his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Thirdly a <hi>King,</hi> prooued by three arguments: 1. By his <hi>rising</hi> from death, vers. 40.41. 2. By sending out his Apostles to preach, vers. 42. 3. By his comming to iudge all flesh, vers. 42.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:18746:10"/>2. The same truth is confirmed by the witnesse of all the Prophets: vers. 43. In the preface Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maketh way vnto his doctrine three wayes. 1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> By remoouing from himselfe an imputation of leuitie, and suddaine change of his mind, which might otherwise haue beene obiected against him; for all men knew that he beeing a Iew had beene very respectiue, least at any time he should come neare an Heathen or Gentile (such as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius and his companie were) for so it appeareth by his answer in the vision, vers. 14. yea and after his vision he was full of doubts whether he might adventure into their companie, till the Lord ads to his vision, a voice; bidding him go in to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, <hi>doubting nothing,</hi> vers. 20. Peter therefore most ingeniously in the first place acknowledgeth an error that had stucke by him: namely, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting now after Christs death and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (whereby he brake downe all partition walls) such as were vncircumcised, an vncleane company, and like dogges and swine to whom holy things might not be cast and offred. 2. That the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> had remooued this error, manifestly teaching him both by vision and voice, that his grace did now extend it selfe ouer all sorts of men; and therefore that he came not of his owne head mooued by temeritie, or rashnes; but vpon good ground to teach euen the Gentiles the misteries of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. 3. He gets not audience only and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but authoritie also to his doctrine; by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18746:10"/>
what a good conceit he had of Cornelius and his companie; that he had not now to deale with profane, and lewd persons; but such as the Lord had sanctified to himselfe, according to the vision and voice. <hi>What or whome the Lord hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, account not thou profane,</hi> vers. 15.</p>
            <p>Whence,<note place="margin">Observ. 1.</note> 1. we haue in this holy man a mappe of humane frailtie,<note place="margin">A mappe of humane frailtie in the Apostle.</note> in which we may see how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie the best are to their duties: for was it not long before giuen Peter in charge to teach the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; was not his commission large inough, when among other disciples he was dismissed by Christ himselfe, to <hi>teach,</hi> not onely the nations, but <hi>all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Had not he heard often from the mouth of Christ; and read in the writings of the Prophets, that the Gentiles must be called in, that the tents of the Church must be enlarged, her courteins stretched ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and that their owne sound must go ouer all the world? yet Peter had forgotten all this; and as though Christ had not beene come, or as if himselfe had neuer conuersed with him, he would still vphold the difference of peoples which his Mr. had destroyed, confine saluation to the Iewes only, as if Christ had not been a common Sauiour of Iewes and Gentiles; he must haue new visions, and voices to lift him vp to his dutie, or else he cannot be brought so much as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. Let vs looke vpon this example to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our owne corruption by it, yea to watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it; least following (as we are too prone) the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18746:11"/>
streame of it, we be carried away from the most essentiall duties, which by our calling, either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or particular, are by God enioyned vpon vs. Let the Popish guids also looke vpon this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and tell vs whether Peter erred not, 1. in iudgement. 2. after Christs promise. 3. in a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie matter; forgetting his commission, and calling, yea, and the calling and saluation of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Gentiles; all which he failed in. And then whether it be a sound ground vpon Peters person, or any promise made to him, to build their Popes immunitie and freedome from error in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith, so long as he sitteth in Peters preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded chaire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that the Apostle Peter secretly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> an acknowledgment of his error, we haue in him a worthy patterne of a speciall grace to be practised of vs all;<note place="margin">A patterne of speciall grace in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</note> namely vpon better grounds to lay aside any errour in iudgement, or practise, although neuer so long held, or stifly maintained of vs before; and not be ashamed to professe that we so doe: which vertue is a sound fruite of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and argueth a good heart, which is in loue with the truth for it selfe; and esteemeth it aboue his owne estimation: the obseruing whereof would cut off infinite controversies which could neuer be carried and continued with such burning heate in the Church of God; if the contention were not many times more for victorie, then for truth; and rather least error should be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18746:11"/>
then that truth should triumphe ouer it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in this preface euery Minister is taught, wisely to cut off and remooue such lets, as might hinder his doctrine among his hearers; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily to winne by all good meanes such credit to his person, as that he may preserue a reuerent esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of himselfe in the hearts of his people. So did the Apostle here, and not without cause; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acceptance of the person of a Minister, is a great furtherance for the entertainement of his doctrine, not that the faith of God ought to be had in respect of persons; but because mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse carrieth him beyond his dutie herein. And againe, Satan and his instruments seeke excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against their persons, whose doctrine is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception: well knowing that where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is not first receiued, hardly will any doctrine from him be embraced, Matth. 10.14. <hi>he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth not you, nor your words.</hi> Whence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Paul was constrained to be much and often in the iustifying of his person, calling, and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; because to hinder his doctrine, the false A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles by all these laboured to bring him into contempt. Nay our Lord Iesus himselfe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced often to averre his person to be diuine, his calling to be heauenly, and his conuersation holy and without sinne: because the Iewes were euer hence disgracing his doctrine, because of the meanes of his appearance. Now whosoeuer would retaine reuerence &amp; authority among his people,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18746:12"/>
must shewe forth, 1. conscience of his duty. 2. loue to his peoples soules, and bodies. 3. a wise and vnblameable carriage and conuersation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these things if he doe not, he hath more disgraced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, then his people can.</p>
            <q>Of a truth, I perceiue that God accepteth not of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</q>
            <p>By <hi>person,</hi> is not here meant the substance of man, or the man himselfe: but the outward quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, appearance, or condition, which beeing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the eie, may make a man more or lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected; such as are wealth, honour, learning, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, beautie, or such like, here called the <hi>face</hi> of a man: for which God accepteth not, nor reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth any man,<note place="margin">Iob. 34.19.</note> 
               <hi>he accepteth not the persons of Princes</hi> (saith Elihu) <hi>nor regardeth the rich more then the poore, they beeing all the worke of his hands.</hi> And ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Apostles purpose, is as if he had said, I now indeed clearely perceiue, that the Lord hath no respect of any dignitie, or priuiledge in any people, aboue an other, that he should powre his grace vpon one more then an other, vpon the Iew aboue the Gentile; vpon the circumcision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the vncircumcision; vpon the seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham according to the flesh, aboue the rest of the nations and kinreds throughout the world. Now I see that the righteous iudge of all the earth,<note place="margin">Why God accepteth not of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, reas.</note> can be <hi>no accepter of persons.</hi> For, 1. this were to esteeme men by adiuncts and qualities, and not by their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> essence, and substance of grace and pietie: thus
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18746:12"/>
should the rich man haue beene preferred before Lazarus; and the proud Pharisie before the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Publican. 2. this were to iudge by inconstant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> things, for all these outward respects passe away, as the <hi>figure of the world it selfe doth</hi>; whereas the iudgment of God is most vnchangable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grounded on things vnchangeable. 3. it were a most vnequal valuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to compare, &amp; much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> more to preferre things which are in no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goodnes, to the things which are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued: for betweene temporall and eternall, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and earthly things can be no proportion. 4. he which hath forbidden vs to iudge by the false, and crooked rule of sence, sight, reason, and such things as are before vs, cannot himselfe doe so: both which points are plainely prooued, 1. Sam. 16.7. The Lord biddeth Samuel (beeing to chose one of the sonnes of Ishai to be king) <hi>looke not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature:</hi> and addeth this as a reason: <hi>for God seeth not as man se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; man loooketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord beholdeth the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But when the Lord passed by all the rest of the nations, and chose Abraham and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eede, did he not accept persons? <hi>Answ.</hi> That Abraham and the Israelites were chosen, the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malites and heathen reiected, was no accepting of persons: the Lord himselfe declareth that there was no cause at all in the people which furthered his choise of them, iust cause there was in them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18746:13"/>
why he should haue passed by them, as well as the rest: for as they were <hi>the fewest of all people,</hi> Deut. 7.7. so they were the worst, and most <hi>stiffenecked of all:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Another bond whereby man is knit vnto God, is the <hi>working of righteousnesse,</hi> an immediat fruit of the feare of God. Where must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, 1. what this righteousnesse is, and then 2.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18746:20"/>
what is the working of it. For the former: This Righteousnesse is a grace of God,<note place="margin">To worke righteousnes what it is.</note> whereby the beleeuer is inclined vnto honest actions according to the prescript of Gods law. When I say a <hi>grace of God,</hi> I vnderstand that righteousnesse whereof a man in the state of grace is by grace made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; and exclude all that originall righteousnesse which was set in the nature of man by his creation, whereby he was wholly conformable to the image and righteousnesse of God: further, saying that the <hi>beleeuer is hereby inclined to honest</hi> actions: three things are implied. 1. That this righteousnesse is not that imputed righteousnesse of Christ, which is a most exact conformitie of the humane nature of Christ with all his actions and suffrings, performed of him in our stead, with the whole law of God; whereby we are wholly couered as with a garment in the sight of God: but rather a fruit of that, namely that infused and inherent righteousnesse wrought in the heart of euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer, by the singer of the spirit, whereby the image of God is daily renewed and repaired in him, and so himselfe inclined to workes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,<note place="margin">Eph. 4 24.</note> to which he is now <hi>created.</hi> 2. That subiect of this righteousnesse is the <hi>Beleeuer</hi>; for all the workes of vnbeleeuers (whose mind and conscience are defiled. Tit. 1.15.) inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, cannot be other then sinne and vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. 3. That the next efficient cause of it is liuely faith, beeing the instrument of the holy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18746:20"/>
Ghost, by which he begetteth this righteousnesse, wheresoeuer it is: now faith produceth this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse in vs, not as it is an excellent gift of God, nor as an excellent qualetie in vs; but only as it is an hand or instrument apprehending and laying hold vpon Christ, who iustifying vs by his owne righteousnesse imputed, and by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit regenerating and sanctifying our natures, is the verie proper cause of this infused and inherent righteousnesse.

            <p>Now for the right <hi>manner</hi> of working righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it appeareth in these rules. 1.

And this, although it be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18746:21"/>
implied in the text, yet is it else-where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, Deut. 5.29. <hi>Oh that there were in them such an heart as to feare me and keepe all my com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> A second thing required is <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> which must needes attend feare. How di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a vertue feare is, appeareth in Iacob, who beeing to meete his brother whom he feared, could <hi>not sleepe all night</hi>: and in Abraham, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a most difficult commandement to slay his sonne, yet rose early, and went three dayes iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, without reasoning the matter. But what mooued him hereto? surely the Lord himselfe sheweth the true cause, Gen. 22.12. <hi>Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not spared thine only sonne.</hi> 3. <hi>Delight</hi> in the workes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which also attendeth the feare of the Lord, Psal. 112.1. <hi>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, he delighteth greatly in his commandements,</hi> both to thinke of them, to speake of them, and to doe them. Whereas the worldlings heart, speach, and affection, is taken vp with his gaine, commoditie, rents and income. For as the feare of God it selfe is not a seruile and slauish feare for punishment; no more is that obedience which proceedeth from it forced or wrung out: but as it is such a feare as delighteth greatly in Gods commandements; so the obedience is such as is offred from a <hi>willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> like a free will offring, which they must only offer whose <hi>heart encourageth</hi> them, and whose <hi>spirit maketh</hi> them willing. 4. <hi>Continuance</hi> in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

for this is another propertie of the true feare of God, that it respecteth not only <hi>all</hi> the commandements,<note place="margin">Deut. 5.19.</note>

The blessing of God comes downe vpon him, and discends to his posteritie, God hath blessed him, and hee shall be blessed in his person, in his estate, in his name, in his goods, in this life, and in the life to come. The blessing of men also comes vpon him, the loines of the poore blesse him; the Church of God blesseth him; yea, turne him what way he will, the blessing of goodnesse meeteth him euerie way: God giueth him according to the worke of his hands often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen here in this life; and if that should faile, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marked for a member of the Church militant, he shall be in due time remooued into the holy mountaine of heauen; where he shall <hi>dwell</hi> who <hi>worketh righteousnesse,</hi> Psal. 15.2. Thus much of the description of a religious person: now of his priuiledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the priuiledge of a religious man is, that a beleeuer of any nation vnder heauen, of any calling, sex, or condition of life, <hi>is accepted of God.</hi> Where it may be asked, whether God, whose grace is most free, be bound by any thing which a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny man can do, to accept of him? I answer, a man is to be considered two wayes. 1. as in the state of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his corrupt nature before his calling and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and thus he hath nothing worthie loue, and nothing which prouoketh not further hatred: here are no works which are not wicked and stained, such a filthy puddle cannot send out one droppe of sweete water; not any <hi>cleane thing can be brought out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18746:23"/>
of such filthinesse</hi>; all this while can be no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the person or of the work;<note place="margin">How the person and worke of a beleeuer ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be accepted of God.</note> no sight of any present obiect in such a partie, nor any foresight of any future faith or worke whereby the Lord can be mooued to accept him: for then the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of his grace should be hindered. 2. As he is conuerted, and now reconciled vnto God, called by the word, regenerated by the spirit, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his heart purified by faith. Now the Lord looking vpon him, sees him not as he was before, all naked, and lying in his blood and filthinesse; but beholding him in the face of his Christ, he espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his owne image vpon him, yea and his owne workmanship vpon him; and thus commeth the person to be first accepted. And then in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, the worke of such a person cannot but be also pleasing vnto God, not for any worthines or perfection in it selfe, (for euen the best worke of the best man from imperfect faith, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge, is so farre from meriting as that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it needeth pardon) but, 1. because it commeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from an accepted person: 2. is a fruit of faith: 3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a testimonie of obedience vnto Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. the imperfection and staine of it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and wiped awaie with Christs most absolute obedience. And thus both the person, <hi>fearing God,</hi> and his <hi>working of righteousnesse,</hi> is accepted of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. To comfort the godly poore, who find but strange entertainment in the world where
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18746:23"/>
they are strangers; who hence learne, that as the world loueth her owne,<note place="margin">Comfort the godly in that God is the God of the abiect.</note> so God loueth and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his owne, in what countrie, or condition soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be: the which comfort if they had not to sustaine their hearts withall, they could not but thinke themselues the most miserable of all men: so many sinnes they see which God may see in them, so many temptations with which they are daily toyled, so many discouragements without them to cast them downe, or backe at the least: against all which, this one consideration shall be able to beare them vp, that the <hi>eies of the Lord are vpon them that feare him:</hi> and by these eyes he seeth their wants to supply them, their iniuries to relieue them, their sorowes to mitigate them, their hearts to approoue them, and their workes to accept them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those that feare God, must also be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and respected of vs, as they be of God:<note place="margin">We must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus that worthy Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned not the poore Shunamite fearing God, told wicked Iehoram king of Israel, that if he had not regarded the presence of good Iehosaphat, he

            <p n="3">3. This doctrine teacheth all sorts of men, to turne their course from such earnest seeking after honours, profits, preferments, and such things, which make men accepted amongst men, and as eagerly to pursue the things which would bring them to be accepted of God: such as are faith, feare of God, loue of righteousnesse, good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the like: which things bring not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into fauour with God, but often get the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of men, at least so farre as God seeth good for his children, Rom. 14.17, 18. <hi>The kingdome of God is not meate and drinke,</hi> that is, hath not such neede of such indifferent things as these are, but <hi>righteousnesse, peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost</hi>; those are the essentiall things to be respected of all such as are the subiects of that kingdome of grace.

And to vrge the godly hereunto, marke the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles reason in the next verse; <hi>for whosoeuer in these things serueth Christ, is</hi> ACCEPTABLE <hi>vnto God, and approoued of men:</hi> such a mans wayes please the Lord, and then he maketh his enemies become his freinds.</p>

            <p>Of all other readings I follow this, not onely as the plainest, but because it most aptly knitteth this verse with the former, as a cleare proofe of it. For hauing said, that now he knewe that whosoeuer, whether Iew or Gentile, did now purely worship God, according to the prescript of his word, the same is accepted of him: he prooueth this to be a truth, because it is the selfe same thing which God himselfe had of old published to the Israelites, when he declared vnto them, that peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was made betweene God and man by the meanes of Iesus Christ, who is Lord, not of any one people or nation, but <hi>Lord of all.</hi> For the Apostle doth not secretly oppose the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Moses and of Christ: Moses was a minister of the law to the Iewes onely, but Christ himselfe, and the Gospel, is the power of God to saluation to <hi>euerie beleeuer,</hi> first <hi>to the Iewe, and then to the Grecian:</hi> and now God is not the <hi>God of the Iewe onely,</hi> but euen of the Gentiles also, according to that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly song of the Angels, when Christ appeared
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18746:25"/>
to throwe downe that particion wall which stood betweene the Iewe and Gentile; wherein they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed not onely all the glorie vnto God, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed peace to all the earth. In one word, that Iesus Christ is our peace, and <hi>Lord of all,</hi> is the scope of this whole sermon, and of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as after remaineth to be shewed in vers. 43.</p>
            <p>The former part of this verse hath two generall points to be explaned: the former, touching the <hi>peace</hi> here spoken of: the latter, concerning the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <hi>preaching</hi> or declaring of it.

            <p n="2">2. It must be considered how this peace is by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>

               <note place="margin">Iob. 5.23.</note> And the reason is, because as then the creatures rebelled against man, when he became a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18746:26"/>

Thus we see what is this peace, and how Iesus Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth it vs: whence we may obserue sundry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable points of doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is no sound peace without Christ; he is the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Observ. 1.</note> his doctrine is the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of peace, and himselfe the messenger of the great couenant of peace. There can be no peace with God by Moses, nor by the workes of the law, (whatsoeuer dotages Popish teachers hold to the contrarie) only the obedience and merit of Christ, is the matter of it: which made the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles alwaies pray not for peace from merit, but for mercie and peace, or grace and peace: because it only floweth from the grace and mercie of God in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is as cleare as the former, that there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> can be no <hi>peace to the wicked man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 57.21.</note> because he is out of Christ. 1. No <hi>inward peace</hi> in his conscience, the which howsoeuer it may slumber for a while, or become feared, benummed, and past feeling; yet like a wilde beast will it hastily waken and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18746:27"/>
him, and make him restles, as Caine, and flie when none pursues him. 2. No true <hi>outward peace,</hi> for although their houses may seeme peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and without feare, and all things passe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their hearts desire, yet this is but a truce for a time, or rather a respite of a condemned person, who, where euer he goeth, carrieth his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death with him: and woe must needes be the ende of that peace, that maketh men most qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, when their sinnes crie the lowdest for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the eares of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this point affoardeth some maine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> betweene true and false peace,<note place="margin">Difference betweene true and false peace.</note> by which euery man may be helped in the examination of his estate. For, 1. sound Christian peace is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a fruit of righteousnesse, and by vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is vnsetled and disquieted: but the peace of the wicked is for most part a fruit of iniquitie, and by it is neuer disturbed; but for the time, the more sinne, the more peace, as in a number of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> might be instanced. 2. peace by Christ ariseth from sorrowe for sinne: whence our Sauiour counteth mourners blessed: but worldly peace, from the fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of some worldly delight or other. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. the former is rooted in the heart, and stablisheth it:<note place="margin">2.

But let thy peace be neuer so great, and the light of God shine neuer so bright vpon thy habitation, and yet thou hast ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene troubled with the sight of thy sinne (as many professe they neuer were) if it can dwell with iniquitie as many iolly fellowes who make bold couenants with hell and death, if it stablish not the heart with assured hope and comfort in all well-doing;

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the want of peace, we are by this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> doctrine directed to the best and only meanes to come by it;<note place="margin">The best way to come by peace in the want of it.</note> namely, to make our peace first with God through Iesus Christ; and then, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or accuse, and terrifie, looke vpon this brazen serpent, and that wound shall be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

               </gap>e: the only Phisition in this case, is Iesus Christ: he calleth, come to mee all that are heauie laden, and I will ease you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only in him canst thou find <hi>refreshing</hi> for thy wearie soule. Doest thou perceiue God frowning against thy sinne? there is no way for thee but to get him to behold thee in <hi>the face of his anointed:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 84.9.</note> no merits, no workes, no good intentions, no gifts can cleare his countenance, to make it shine vpon thee; only he is well pleased in his Christ, and with such as he beholdeth in him, and no other.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18746:28"/>
If men be at oddes with thee, the next way to be at one with them, is not by raging and stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming against them, to driue thy selfe further from God: but to draw neare vnto him in Christ, by whom reconcile thy selfe vnto him; and then as thine owne mind shall be more composed vnto peace and loue; so will he also make thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thy freinds, if he see it good; at the least, restraine them, so as they shall not hurt thee. For if he pitch a couenant for vs with the bruit beasts of the feild, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they shall not hurt vs, much more will he shelter vs from the malice of men, be they neuer so bruitish &amp; vnreasonable. So much of this peace by Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Now in the second place, we are to consider the <hi>preaching of it to the children of Israel.</hi> Where two things are to be explaned:<note place="margin">Christ was preached to Israel two wayes.</note> 1. <hi>How</hi> Christ was preached vnto the Israelites. 2. <hi>Why</hi> he was so prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto them. Concerning the former, Christ was preached to Israel two wayes: 1. by the <hi>word,</hi> or promise. 2. by <hi>deede,</hi> or type. For the <hi>first,</hi> the maine promise of all concerning this truth, was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that which (after it was by Gods own mouth once deliuered vnto Adam in paradise, <hi>The seede of the woman shall bruise, &amp;c.</hi>) was so often repeated to A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>braham, Isaac, and Iacob, <hi>In thy seede shall all the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions of the earth be blessed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 12.3.</note> The same promise in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance Moses maketh to the whole people of the Iewes, Deut. 18.15. <hi>Also all the Prophets</hi> (saith Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>from Samuel, and thenceforth so many as haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18746:29"/>
haue likewise foretold the same thing:</hi> and in this regard the Iewes are called,<note place="margin">Act. 3.24.</note> the children <hi>of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and of <hi>the couenant which God made to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>; where the verie same promise made to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, is repeated, v. 25. And the Apostle Paul is as expresse, Galat. 3.8. <hi>The Scripture foreseeing that God would iustifie the Gentiles through faith, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before the Gospel to Abraham, saying, In thee,</hi> that is, in thy seede, <hi>shall all the Gentiles be blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, Christ was by <hi>deede or type,</hi> preached <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our peace in the whole Leviticall preisthood: for all that ceremoniall worship, all their sacrifices, oblations, altars, yea their temple, arke, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie, resembled, and pointed at Christ our peace: and yet further, their very kings and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, their Preists and Prophets, all of them not obscurely resembled Iesus Christ, and preached him our peace; who as a <hi>King,</hi> deliuered his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from all the former bondage of forraine power, and by his merit, and triumph, wrought out their peace: As a <hi>Preist,</hi> sacrificed himselfe, and offred vnto his Father a sweete smelling sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of peace for them: and as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> fully deliuered from his Father the whole doctrine of peace and reconciliation. Both these waies was Christ preached to the Israelites; whereof for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities sake we will for the present forbeare further discourse.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18746:29"/>
first</hi>; and why was that doctrine renewed to them from time to time by the hand and ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Prophets? <hi>Answ.</hi> For three reasons. 1. Because they were that seed and certaine fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of whom the Messiah should descend and arise:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for which cause they were to obserue an accurate distinction of the tribes, according to that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and gouernment which God had establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed amongst them, that they might not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his person when he should in fulnesse of time appeare. 2. Because God had chosen them to be a peculiar people, he set them vp aboue all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> nations, not only in many other prerogatiues, but in this, which was the cheife of all (had they seene it) that the <hi>Oracles of God was committed vnto them: Hee gaue his lawes to Iacob, his couenants to Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>hee dealt not so with euery nation,</hi> Psal. 147.20. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Paul when he had reckoned a number of the Iewes aduancements aboue the Gentiles, such as were their adoption, couenant, promises, fathers, he shutteth vp all with the cheife of all, in these words, <hi>of whom concerning the flesh Christ came.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 9.5.</note> Now as that was the first, that he came of them, so this is the next, that he came vnto them alone first, in the promises and types, then in his person and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, then in his doctrine and miracles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in his owne person; adde hereto, that he came to them in his life and death, and lastly, he came first and alone to them in the Ministrie and miracles of his holy Apostles, who must not goe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18746:30"/>
into the <hi>way of the Gentiles,</hi> nor <hi>turne themselues to other nations,</hi> till the Iewes, by despising that grace offred, had made themselues <hi>vnworthy of life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting:</hi> the lost sheepe of the house of Israel must first be sought vp, and therefore (as Paul said) <hi>it was necessarie that the word of God should first be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vnto them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13.46.</note> 3. That both Iew and Gentile might know that Christ came not by happe, or chance, or on the suddaine, so as his comming might not be obserued; but that he came for the time, and for the manner, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and predictions of old, of which our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle is willing in these words to imply the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment.</p>
            <p>Whence we may note, 1. the diuinitie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Observ. 1.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Diuinitie of Scripture prooued.</note> which foretelleth beforehand things which are to come to passe many hundreths, yea some thousands of yeares after. The thing that foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth things properly to come, which haue no exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence in any cause, or signe, must needs be of God. Satan indeede can gesse at some euents, but which haue some grounds in nature, or experience; or can foretell a thing to come which God hath reuealed to him, or himselfe is made an executioner of, as in S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ul: but to foretell a thing, or euent meerely to come, is proper to God. Whence it necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth, that the Scripture, <hi>foreseeing that God would iustifie the Gentiles thorough faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal 3.8.</note> that is, a thing to come to passe almost 2000. yeares after, must needs be of God. Againe, it followeth as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18746:30"/>
that the Prophets in preaching, and the holy penmen of God spake and writ as they were mooued by the spirit of God, and directed by the immediate assistance of God, and therefore could not erre in any thing: for they foretold directly such things, which both for matter, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nner, came to passe many yeares after. Iacob in his will foretold, that the Scepter should not depart from Iudah till Shiloh came: this prophesie was not accomplished till aboue 17. hundred yeares after the prediction: for not much aboue twentie yeares afore Christs birth, <hi>Herod</hi> became king of Iudea, killed the whole colledge of the Iewes, called the <hi>sanhedrim,</hi> wherein was the heire apparant of the Kings blood.

For whereas the Romane Empire was deuided into Easterne, and Westerne, the Westerne which onely hindred the reuelation of Antichrist was in that yeare quite ouerthrowne, and Rome it selfe taken by the Gothes,<note place="margin">Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <note place="margin">Observ. 2.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> from hence also note the antiquitie of the gospel, in that it was preached by the Prophets to the auncient Israelites; and knowne for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, not onely to the Apostles, and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Christians, and beleeuers, but to the Patriarks and Prophets, yea euen to Adam in Paradise, to all whom Christ was preached the <hi>Lord of all,</hi> and that blessed seede in whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed. This doctrine, although it be called a newe Testament,<note place="margin">Our religion is the oldest religion, &amp; Poperie but a noueltie.</note> is no new doctrine. Let the Papists make a vaine bragge of antiquitie, and charge vs with a newe religion, the truth is, whereas the bodie of their doctrine was not knowne to the Prophets, nor Apostles, nor belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers for many hundred yeares after Christ: our doctrine is that which God sent <hi>to the children of Israel,</hi> and therefore is most auncient and true. And to prooue this that I say, we will goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then our text. That doctrine which preacheth peace by Iesus Christ, is the doctrine which was sent to Israel; which we professe at this day: but so is not Popish doctrine, which preacheth peace not by Christ, but by our selues, our merits, and satisfactions, and peace by the Popes pardons, bulls and absolutions, and indulgences; now these, with other dependances thereon, beeing the main points and pillers of their doctrine, were neuer preached to the children of Israel, by any Prophet,

nor euer by any of the Apostles to the Church of God; but haue crept in one after another many hundred yeares since Christ and his Apostles. Let their owne rule stand in force therefore with good will; if we cannot plead antiquitie, we will lay no claime to the truth.</p>

            <q>Which is Lord of all.]</q>
            <p>Christ may be said to be Lord of all two waies: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. More generally he is with the Father and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost Lord of all things, vnto whom all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by right of creation, euen the very deuills are subiect.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now Christ is Lord of his Church, consisting of Iew and Gentile: 1. Because God hath giuen the Church vnto him for his inheritance, Psal. 2.8. <hi>I will giue thee the Heathen for thine inheritance:</hi> which beeing a prophecie of the calling of the Gentiles, implieth that the kingdome of grace, whereof Christ is appointed King in Sion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of all countries and peoples, and is not

They are so giuen vnto him, as he must win them before he can enioy them. Hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> winneth partly by <hi>conquest,</hi> partly by <hi>ransome:</hi> hee both conquereth and casteth out the strong man that held them captiue, spoyleth him of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and weakneth his arme for euer: as also he payeth a precious ransome for them to God his Father: so as beeing now redeemed, and <hi>bought with a price,</hi> they are <hi>no longer their owne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.20.</note> but the Lords that bought them. 3. Because when he hath thus dearly purchased his Church, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> himselfe in spirituall marriage with her, and so becommeth her Lord, Hos. 2.18. <hi>I will mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thee for euer vnto my selfe: yea, I will marrie thee vnto mee in righteousnesse, in iudgement, in mercie, and in compassion.</hi> Ephes. 5.23. <hi>As the husband is the wiues head, so is Christ of the Church.</hi> So as if a man be a Lord of that which is giuen him; of that which he hath redeemed and ransomed; of her whom he hath married into his bosome; in all these regards by as good right is Iesus Christ the Lord of his Church, and euery member of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But how can Christ be a Lord and a seruant too: Isa. 42.1. <hi>Behold my seruant, I will
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18746:33"/>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ considered as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is after a speciall manner both his Fathers ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and yet the Lord of his Church. In all the worke of mans redemption he serued and obeyed his Father, beeing sent of his Father for this end, he was subiect to the death, he praied vnto him, gaue him thankes, learned obedience by the things he suffered, not as God equall to his Father, but as our Mediator and suretie: and yet by all these things he became our Lord, and the King of his Church. And herein the Apostles trauell as in their maine scope, to prooue that Iesus Christ, whom the Iewes put to death, hath shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the Lord of glorie, and the true Messias, Act. 2.34. <hi>Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that Iesus, which they crucified, Lord</hi> and <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But how can Christ be the Lord of all, seeing many, yea the most wil not obey him. <hi>Ans.</hi> Doth a king cease to be the Lord of all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, because some which were his subiects are gone out in rebellion against him? besides, howsoeuer it standeth with his glorie and grace, to suffer with patience the vessels of wrath; yet at length he shewes his power against them, in bringing forth his whole displeasure vpon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> Hence in that Christ is in generall Lord of all, we learne that all creatures are his, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must neuer vse any of them without leaue
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18746:33"/>
from him, or without returne of praise and thanks vnto him: none of them are sanctified to our vse, without the word and prayer. And if we haue leaue from him, we ought in sobrietie to vse them, 1. Cor 10.26. eate whatsoeuer is sold in the sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, making no question for conscience sake. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce followeth it also, that he hauing an absolute power ouer all, he may doe with his owne what he will: who shal hinder a potter to frame one ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to honour, another to dishonour; which I speak because many cannot endure to heare of a decree of reprobation, who must frame their iudgement to his will who cannot but be iust and good, and leaue off to reason with God. Hence also he may make one rich, another poore, at his pleasure: <hi>The rich and poore meete, this Lord maketh them both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in that Christ is in speciall, Lord of his Church, sundrie things are to be noted: as first, That none can haue Christ to be a Iesus, that is,<note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note> a Sauiour, who haue him not for their soueraigne, and Lord: whosoeuer thou art that challengest him for thy Sauiour, see thou acknowledge him thy Lord. <hi>Quest.</hi> How may a man haue Christ to be his Lord? <hi>Answ.</hi> By the practise of fower du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.<note place="margin">A man hath Christ his Lord by 4. things.</note> 1. by preseruing in the heart a feare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence towards his person, Malac. 1.5. <hi>If I be a Lord, where is my feare?</hi> Lordship requires subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Psal. 45.12. <hi>he is thy Lord, and reuerence thou,</hi> or bow vnto <hi>him.</hi> Now this feare must proceed from loue; for if any man loue not the Lord Iesus, let him

By professing him to be thy Lord: as seruants by their liuerie, or cognisance, speake, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime to all men, to whome they belong: so if Christ be thy Lord, thou must not be ashamed of him; but be euer speaking of him, commending his goodnesse: thou must glorie of such a seruice, accounting it thy greatest honour, that thou art become his seruant: thou must defend his name, where euer thou hearest it called into question: thou must suffer with him,<note place="margin">1.

I am vnprofitable: If I gaine, I must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto him. 4. By absolute obedience vnto his will reuealed. Thus himselfe beeing to giue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> his law, beginneth thus, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi>

Which may be considered in three heads.<note place="margin">The will of Christ redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to 3. heads.</note> 1. It is his will that we beleeue in him, Ioh. 6.40. <hi>this is the will of him that sent me, that euery one that seeth the sonne, and beleeueth in him</hi>; not onely beleeuing his word to be true,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but leaning vpon him onely for thy saluation.

Apollos knew onely the <hi>baptisme of Iohn,</hi> that is, his doctrine: and therefore is it said in the next verse, that Priscilla and Aquila tooke him home, and shewed him the way <hi>of God more clearely.</hi> And in Acts. 19.3.4. <hi>Into what were ye baptised?</hi> that is, into what doctrine were ye initiated and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: they said, <hi>into Iohns baptisme,</hi> that is, into Iohns doctrine: the which interpretation notably freeth that hard text from the false collection of

Anabaptists, who thence would gather that those were by Paul rebaptised, who were formerly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by Iohn: but the difficultie will be remooued, if the words of Paul be wisely distinguished from the words of the Euangelist, and writer of that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie: <hi>Iohn baptised</hi> (saith Paul) the <hi>baptisme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>: that is, taught the doctrine of repentance, <hi>saying that they should beleeue: which when they heard,</hi> namely, they which heard by Iohns ministerie, <hi>they were baptized into the name of the Lord Iesus,</hi> nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Iohn, not by Paul. Then addeth the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, vers. 6. <hi>And Paul put his hands on them, and the holy Ghost came on them,</hi>

To note the accomplishment of that prophesie in Isai. 9.1. which also was obserued by the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist Matthew. 4.14. 2. To shewe that this fame was no bare, or vngrounded rumor, but raised vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iust cause: for Iesus was baptized by Iohn not farre from the borders of Galily about Enon, Ioh.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18746:40"/>
3.23. And presently after he returned by vertue of the spirit, and came into Galily preaching the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of the kingdome, Mark. 1.14. and made no ende till he had taught all their cities in all their synagogues, Luk. 4.14. adde to his baptisme and doctrine, that he wrought his first miracle of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning water into wine at Cana a towne of Galilie, and that he called his disciples in Galilie; all which beginnings must needes raise a rumor and fame of him, which, as Luke reporteth, went through all the adiacent region round about. 3. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance notably befitteth this argument, to prooue him Lord of all, both Iewes and Gentiles, because he begunne and was so famous in <hi>Galily of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> But was not Christ sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel? did he not come to his owne, how then did he beginne his ministerie in Galilie of the Gentiles? <hi>Ans.</hi> Galilie of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles is so called, not because it was not in Iudea, but 1. to distinguish it from an other Galilie, which was also in Iudea, and called Galilaea inferior, in the tribe of Zabulon, where Nazaret was scituate. But this was called Galilaea superior, or Gentium, in the tribe of Nephtali, not farre from Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. 2. Because there were twentie cities in Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie giuen by Salomon to Hyram a Gentile, 1. kin. 9.11. 3. because beeing in the extremitie of Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stina, neare the sea, and not farre from Tyrus and Sidon, they were euer mixt with many Gentiles
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18746:40"/>
that were forreyners; besides that, they were so seated within that countrie in Salomons time, as they could neuer after be remooued. 4.

               <hi>Quest.</hi> But why should Christ beginne his Ministerie here, rather then at Ierusalem, was it for any singular disposition or good which hee found in them aboue other?

whose inhabitants were mixed of Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But this seemeth to crosse sundrie places of the Scripture, which affirme that the preaching of Christ must beginne at Ierusalem, not in Galily, Luk. 24.47. And <hi>that repentance and remission of sinnes, should be preached among all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, beginning at Ierusalem. Answ.</hi> That place is meant of the preaching of Christs Apostles, and not of his owne as this is. 2. That of their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of him after his death and resurrection; this of his owne in his life time. 3. That was a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall publishing of Christ; this place speaketh only of a voice, fame, and good report in the mouthes of the common people, such as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extraordinarie Prophets: and therefore such places cannot crosse this.</p>
            <p>Now for the other circumstance of time, when this fame went of Christ, namely, <hi>after the baptisme which Iohn preached,</hi> it is not without waightie cause added by the Apostle. 1. to note the truth and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of those prophecies which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Iohn himselfe: as Mala. 3.1. <hi>Behold I send my messenger, and he shall prepare before mee,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie Christ himselfe applieth to Iohn, Matth. 11.10. that by this consideration they might be one steppe nearer the acknowledging of the true Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, seeing that his harbenger Eliah was come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie. 2. To note that Christ appeared in his due season, not before Iohn had preached the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of repentance, and amendment of life, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18746:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so had prepared the way to Christ: neither before the people were fitted to receiue him; for Iohn had spoken many things concerning him, had pointed at him as the onely Lambe of God, that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the sinnes of the world: had affirmed that he sawe the holy Ghost descending vpon him, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his head like a doue: had professed him far worthyer then himselfe: had promised that hee should baptize them with the holy Ghost and fire. Now were the people desirous to see him of whom they had heard so much: and now therefore was the due time of Christs comming after the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme which Iohn preached.</p>
            <p>Whence we may shortly note, how the Lord findeth vs when he first setteth his loue vpon vs, as farre from meriting his loue as these Galilaeans who were a most wretched people: so as he respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth onely his owne grace in his respecting of vs: which consideration he would often fasten vpon his owne ancient people the Iewes; professing to their face, that he made no couenant with them for any worthynesse he sawe in them aboue other, for they were <hi>the worst of all people,</hi> and much lesse can he find any worthinesse to entitle a man to the heauenly Canaan:<note place="margin">Deut. 9.4.</note> the freedome of this grace doth therefore shine out more clearely; and deserueth that we should with much thankefulnesse, both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and also walke worthie of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hence is to be noted, that then men seasonably heare of Christ, when they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Iohn in the doctrine of repentance: when
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18746:42"/>
the lawe hath killed, cast vs downe, and made vs guiltie of the sentence of death; then the Gospell doth seasonably propound the grace and mercie of God in Christ. Hence for pacifying the troubled conscience,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6 15.</note> it is called <hi>the Gospel of peace:</hi> for chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp the heauie heart,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.5.</note> it is called <hi>a good word:</hi> and for healing and bringing the sicke soule to health and soundnesse,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.8.</note> it is called <hi>a sound word:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ministers in dispensing the promises, must see that men be fitted for them; because if the ground be not plowed vp, all the seede is cast and lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thornes: and hearers must be as warie of false application; least in time they as heauily loose, as they haue hastily snatched, such things as neuer belonged vnto them.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 38.</hi> How God anointed Iesus of Nazaret with the holy Ghost, and with power: Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the deuill, for God was with him.</q>
            <p>The Apostle hauing prooued by the common voice and <hi>fame,</hi> that Christ is <hi>Lord of all,</hi> he now descendeth to prooue it by his <hi>facts,</hi> all which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were performed by vertue of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly commission and calling; therefore (as good order requireth) he beginneth there, and in this verse propoundeth two things: 1. Christs <hi>calling</hi> to his office of Mediatorship, <hi>How God anointed, &amp;c.</hi> 2. the <hi>execution</hi> of that office according to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>who went about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> In the former are three points to be considered, 1. who was called, <hi>Iesus

That they and we might hence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> gather that he was sanctified and set a part vnto most holy purpose, beeing a true Nazarit (neither by vowe, nor commandement, for then he might neither drinke wine, nor touch the dead, which he did, and caused others also to doe the same; nor yet cut his haire, which in likelihood, both by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Iewes, and Pauls speach, 1. Cor. 11.7.14. he did) but by most perfect holinesse and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute puritie of his whole man, (whereof those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites were but shadowes) that so he might be a perfect Sauiour, and high Priest, separate from all sinners, Heb. 7.26.</p>
            <p>Whence note, how the prouidence of God in ouerruling euery particular circumstance is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly cleared. The very particular places assigned for this and that purpose, are accuratly set downe, to shew how those <hi>seauen bright eyes</hi> of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,<note place="margin">Zach. 4.10.</note> 
               <hi>which goe ouer all the world,</hi> haue beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer waking and watchfull ouer both predictions, and accomplishments, to bring them iust toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the iust point and period foreappointed. Christ must not be borne neither in Egypt, nor in Nazaret, nor in his fathers house; but in a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and in an Inne at Bethlem, because it was so foretold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Bethlem the least of all the cities of Iudea, should be made the highest in this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Againe, Christ though the sonne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18746:43"/>
must not be brought vp in Bethlem, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Dauid, nor yet (beeing of the Kings seed) in Ierusalem, the citie and seat of the Kings; but in Nazaret, that he might be called a Nazarite. Whatsoeuer therefore God hath promised in the Scriptures, waite in faith for the accomplishment, this prouidence will not suffer it vnaccomplished; but make not hast, he hath a due season for it, which thou must patiently expect, and the patient abiding of the iust shall not miscarie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Note hence, that Christ was the only true Messiah, and could not haue beene so, if he had not beene of Nazaret, and such a Nazarite as the Prophets foretold. The Iewes tooke offence hereat, as too base a place for the Messias whom they expected to rise out of: euen Nathaniel himselfe could aske if <hi>any good could come out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.47.</note> and this was in scorne added as a part of his stile and title written in three tongues vpon the crosse, <hi>Iesus of Nazaret</hi> King of the Iewes: and as they delt with the head, so also with the members; for presently after the death of Christ, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were in scorne also called <hi>Nazarits,</hi> that is, silly fooles that did beleeue in such a Messiah as came from Nazaret. But we must know, that the wisedome of God would haue him hereby gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proclaimed the Messias and Sauiour of the world, both to Iewes and Gentiles: as also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our faith and affiance in him made knowne to vs to be such a one, as in whom we also become
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18746:44"/>
Nazarites, that is, sanctified and consecrated vnto God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Note hence, that the Messias must needes be come alreadie, because he must be a Nazarite by education, as of Bethlem by birth, which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue beene long since destroyed, and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of euer beeing builded vp againe, or that in them the Iewes should euer recouer any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And is it not a wonderfull blindnesse, that the Iewes should still looke for their Messias out of a towne which hath beene destroyed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and fiue hundreth yeares agoe, the very place of which cannot be assigned? Our request to God must be for them, that he would remooue that thicke vayle which to this day is drawne ouer the hearts of his owne ancient people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By whom was Christ called to this office? By <hi>God</hi> who anointed him: for that which is said of one part of it, namely his preisthood, is true of the whole;<note place="margin">Heb. 5.5.</note> 
               <hi>No man taketh this honour to himselfe, but hee that is called of God:</hi> so neither Christ tooke this honour to himselfe, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that voice, <hi>Thou art my Sonne.</hi> How often did Christ witnesse of himselfe, that he came not of himselfe, but <hi>was sent</hi> by his Father, Ioh. 5.37. My Father <hi>that sent mee</hi> witnesseth of mee: and in that chapter because the Iewes obiected that he came of himselfe, he telleth them six times that his Father sent him: yea hath sealed him his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission as he saith, Ioh. 6.27. <hi>Him hath God the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18746:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Father sealed,</hi> that is, made his commission au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, as men doe their deeds by their seale, and set vpon him an impression or character; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing him with oyle of grace aboue all his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; yea himselfe beeing an expresse image of his Fathers substance, in him he hath laid vp all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of wisedome and knowledge, that from his fulnesse we might receiue grace for grace.</p>
            <p>Whence, 1. we learne, that no man ought to thrust himselfe into any office or function,<note place="margin">Christ expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers calling and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must his ministers much more.</note> nor runne before he be sent, but wait till God giue him a calling thereunto. For shall Christ, who had the spirit of God without all measure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> waite his Fathers leysure, and expect his fathers voice; and shall we, who haue receiued the spirit scarce in any measure, runne and ride, and shooue, and thrust in before we haue any commission drawne or sealed by God? who euer carried such post-hast happily? How miserably perished proud Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, who though it not inough to be the Kings sonne, vnlesse he thrust his Father out of his kingdome? Corah and his complices would haue beene Rulers, but that the earth would not suffer them aboue it. What shall I speake of Vzza, Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah, and the rest, who found the Lord as good as his word against such which goe on any arrand and he send them not; they found the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming many waies against them, as he often threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in Ier. 23.30.31. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If God haue called Christ to this office, we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18746:45"/>
must carrie our selues dutifully and reuerently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whom as the Father hath called, so he will defend and establish in his place, and reuenge such as rebell against him. This is that the Prophet tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in Psal. 2.2. that if the greatest Kings band themselues together against the Lord, and against his Christ, the Lord out of heauen will laugh them to scorne, he will speake to them in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and vex them in sore displeasure; and the ground of all this is laid downe, vers. 6. <hi>Euen I haue set my King vpon Sion:</hi> as if he had said, shall I set vp a King, and dare ye rebelliously resist him, or seeke to displace him? Let vs take heede it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall not vs, as it did the Iewes taxed in the parable of the King letting out his vinyard, which sent his seruants for his rent to the husbandmen, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his sonne; but they beat the one, slew the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, acknowledged neither: surely no more grace remaineth for such; but the Lord of the vinyard must needs destroy such husbandmen, and lay wast their citie. In like manner is he as readie to defend, and doe good vnto such as subiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto his sonne, depend vpon him, or suffer any thing for his sake: they shall not repent them of their seruice, seeing they serue so good a Lord.</p>
            <p>The third thing in this calling of Christ to his office, is the <hi>manifestation</hi> of it to himselfe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: in that he was annointed <hi>with the holy Ghost, and power.</hi> There were three sorts of men that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be anointed in the entrance vnto their office

Christ is here said to be also <hi>anointed</hi>; but not by man, as they, but by God: not with externall oyle, but with the holy Ghost, and with power: not ceremonially, and typically, but really and spiritually: not to any one of those offices, but to them all three: not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the signe, but the thing signified; because he was a reall and true King, Priest, and Prophet of his Church, of whome all they were but types and shadowes. In this anointing of Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both these things are signified and prooued: 1. that he was ordained of God to the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this office of Mediatorship, and consecrated by God, to be the Messiah, that is, a spirituall King, Priest, &amp; Prophet: 2. that he had powred out vpon him, the gifts of the holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, which gaue him power, and furnished him for this office; signified here by the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> and <hi>power:</hi> he receiuing of the <hi>holy Ghost power,</hi> whereby he performed that greatest worke that euer was vndertaken.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18746:46"/>
and some had more gifts bestowed and some lesse; but none all, nor all in one degree; Christ was perfectly anointed, and euen in his humane nature was adorned with gifts without measure:<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.34.</note> 
               <hi>for God gaue not him the spirit by measure:</hi> and not onely with gifts, but <hi>all gifts</hi> in the highest degree,<note place="margin">Psal. 45.</note> aboue <hi>all his fellowes</hi> men or angels, in none of which euer dwelt the <hi>fulnesse of the God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> head bodily</hi> as it did in him.<note place="margin">Colos. 2.10.</note> 2. Whereas all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiued gifts only for themselues, and could not by their gifts make others Kings as they were, or Priests, or Prophets; Christ was so anointed with the holy Ghost and with power, that he could impart his gifts to others in such manner, and measure as they might become like vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: that looke as the oyle which was powred out vpon Aarons head, runne downe by his beard euen to the skirts of his garment, and so sweetned his whole bodie; euen so such abundance of grace was powred (as out of a full horne) vpon Christ the head of his Church, as it distilleth from him to the sweetning and perfuming of all his bodie, to make the same acceptable in the sight of God. This the Euangelist expresseth, Ioh. 1.16. <hi>Full of grace, of truth</hi>—and, <hi>of his fulnesse we receiue grace for grace:</hi> Colos. 2.10. <hi>In him dwelleth the fulnesse of the godhead bodily, and yee are compleat in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But when was Christ thus anointed? <hi>Ans.</hi> The anointing of Christ is twofold. 1. In respect of his <hi>gifts:</hi> and with these he was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18746:46"/>
by the verie vnion of his two natures into one person in the wombe of the Virgin from the first moment of his conception: for beeing admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceiued by the holy Ghost, his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was anointed by the divine vniting it selfe thereunto. 2. In respect of his <hi>calling</hi> to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of those gifts; and this was then compleat when in the thirteth yeare of his age at his baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, he was solemnly inaugurated by a voice from heauen, by the opening of the heauen, and the descending of the spirit of God in a visible shape abiding vpon him; not that he wanted the spirit before, but that herein, as in the former respect also, a maine difference might be put betweene his, and the anointing of all that went before, who neither were anointed in the wombe, nor by the vnion of the dietie, nor by any other then materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all oyle: whereas he was anointed with the holy Ghost lighting vpon him. And this was that which was prophesied before of him, Isa. 61.1. <hi>The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is vpon mee, because he hath anointed mee that I should preach, &amp;c.</hi> In the exposition of which place, when Christ begunne his Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in Galily, he said, <hi>This day is this Scripture ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in your eares,</hi> Luk. 4.17.</p>
            <p>Hence we learne,<note place="margin">None can be capable of the office of a redeemer or Mediator but Christ, because non was so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed as hee.</note> 1. That Christ was and is an alsufficient Sauiour and redeemer: for beeing to this purpose anointed with the holy Ghost and with power, he cannot but be able fully to worke and absolue the worke of mans redemption. This
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18746:47"/>
is not a worke to be committed to any King, or Emperour, nor the greatest state and Potentate in the earth, no nor to any Angel or Archangel in heauen: none of these are fit for it, because none are capable of this anointing with the holy Ghost and with power, but hee alone: who therefore is able to subdue all the Deuils of hell, though they come rushing vpon him all at once; to ouerthrow all the armies of hell, sinne, death, and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, assalting himselfe and members with all their might and force: in a word, able to make his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (although principalities, and powers, neuer so mightie, and neuer so cruell) his very foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole. A greater <hi>King</hi> then Salomon is here, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who not only can tread downe his enemies, but giue vs strength also so to doe: who not only can giue vs lawes, but of his fulnesse grace to keepe them. God hath anointed him King, and set him vpon his throne, and endued him with rare gifts fit for gouernment; in all which regards we owe vnto him simple and absolute obedience. A farre more excellent <hi>Priest</hi> also then Aaron is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> nere,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.6.</note> he is not anointed to offer the blood of buls, or goates, but to offer himselfe a sweete smelling sacrifice, and that not often, but once for all: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he offer onely this sacrifice, but by this spirit and power with which he is anointed, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth it to his Church: neither neede he offer for himselfe as they, because he was a holy, harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.26.</note> and vndefiled high Priest: neither doth hee
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18746:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely pray for his Church, but meriteth also to be heard, is neuer denyed, <hi>neither euer dieth, but liueth for euer to make intercession for them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">25.</note> A more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Prophet</hi> then Moses is here anointed: he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but a seruant in the house, this is the sonne: Moses was but the instrument, this is the author of the word he deliuereth: Moses could teach but the eare, this Prophet teacheth the heart: Moses was a Minister of the outward circumcision, this circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth, or rather baptiseth with the holy Ghost and with fire: let not vs therefore dispise him that <hi>speaketh from heauen:</hi> for if <hi>they escaped not which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Moses that spake on earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.25.</note> 
               <hi>much more shall not we escape if we turne away from him that speaketh from heauen:</hi> And can we want reason? 1. In his anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting we are commanded by a voice from heauen, <hi>heare him,</hi> Matth. 17.5. 2. he deliuereth the whole will of his Father, we shall therefore be perfectly taught if we heare him. 3. we may safely rest in his doctrine, because with him are the treasures of wisedome. 4. In a word, he hath onely the <hi>words of life euerlasting, and whither should we goe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.68.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, hence we learne, that seeing euerie beleeuer is anointed with Christ, and in Christ,<note place="margin">Euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian must partake of Christ his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing.</note> we must all be carefull to finde this holy oyle run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning downe from the head vpon vs the members: 1. Ioh. 2.27. <hi>The anointing which yee receiue of him dwelleth in you.</hi> And indeede our verie name of <hi>Christians,</hi> putteth vs in minde that we must haue our measure of that oyle of grace which was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18746:48"/>
on Christ without measure: so as if we carrie the name and title of Christ, we must see that the nature and gifts of Christians appeare in our liues: Rev. 1.6. he hath made vs <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> vnto God. And it was long before prophesied of the Church of the newe testament, that the sonnes and daughters of it shall <hi>prophesie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioel. 2.28.</note> and all this by vertue of this anointing. Adde hereunto, that Christ is not perfectly anointed til his Church be: for Christ may be said to be anointed two wayes: either <hi>properly,</hi> in his owne person, as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in himselfe; or <hi>figuratiuely,</hi> by the vse of Scripture, as he is the head of his Church, which ioyned vnto him,<note place="margin">Christus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Euerie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian must be a King.</note>To this purpose euery man must become a <hi>King</hi> (for so he is if he partake of Christs anointing) in beeing euer in the field in combate against sinne, in taking vp armes against Satans hellish power, in getting daily dominion ouer his owne rebellious flesh, and wicked lusts. For if thou beest a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, thou hast ten thousand rebells to encounter, and as many strong temptations and lusts against which thou must stand out to victorie: and here faith must be thy victorie, which grace is attained by this anointing.

            <p>Againe, thou that wilt be a Christian, must be a <hi>Priest</hi> to offer <hi>vp thy selfe,</hi> soule and bodie,<note place="margin">And a Priest, Rom. 6.13.</note> an acceptable <hi>sacrifice</hi> of sweet smell vnto the Lord: to offer vp thy prayers and prayses, the <hi>calues of thy lippes:</hi> these are the <hi>odours</hi> of the Saints; to offer vp thy <hi>sinnes</hi> to be <hi>sacrificed</hi> and slaine by the knife and sword of the spirit in the Ministerie of the word: to offer the sacrifices of almes and mercie,<note place="margin">Reu. 5.8.</note> with which <hi>sacrifices God is well pleased:</hi> to offer the sacrifice of a <hi>broken and contrite heart,</hi> which the Lord despiseth not: and lastly, to offer, if neede require, thy life, and dearest blood for Christ and his profession. But how many titular Christians be there, who indeede are no better then Belzebubs Priests; who offer their soules, their bodies, their sences, themselues, wholly to the seruice of the deuill, in sinne and vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for praier and praise, they curse, sweare,

regenerate by meanes of this anointing, and is opposed to naturall lust and corruption in the same vers.</p>
            <q>Who went about doing good,]</q>
            <p>Now we come to Christs execution of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, according to his former calling and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For no sooner receiueth he gifts and calling from his father, but he manifesteth and putteth forth the same in most painefull preaching, and most powerfull working of miracles; which hee did not for a brunt, or by starts, and fitts, but he <hi>went about</hi> doing good. By which words is noted his diligence, in absoluing and finishing his course within his vocation and calling: not seeking here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe, nor the praise or applause of men, nor the kingdomes of this world, but denying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and glorie, spent his whole life in doing <hi>good</hi> vnto others; suffering himselfe to be subdued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a most shamefull and cursed death; that hee might bring others to life, who were as yet his enemies, and lying in the shadowe of death. Wherein he propounded himselfe a worthy pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and example of imitation,<note place="margin">Note.</note> vnto all such as haue receiued gifts, and calling to any office in Church, or common wealth: who are not to hide in a napkin those talents, but bring them forth, and traficke with them: and that not for their priuate, as seeking themselues; but for the common good: and not for a start or brunt, but thus to finish their course, holding out in well doing vnto the ende.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:18746:50"/>Thus if we shall doe, we shall be conformable vnto Iesus Christ, acceptable to God our Father, profitable to our brethren here on earth, and shall treasure to our selues an excellent weight of glory in heauen. But how many be there, who hauing receiued many talents, and charge to traffique with them, bury their gifts, and forget their charge; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom the fearefull sentence is not only pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but halfe executed alreadie; his talent is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the slothfull seruant; there now remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing but the binding of him, and casting him into hell. And would this were not too true, not in many Ministers only, but euen in numbers of priuate Christians; who haue had both gifts and calling to teach and pray in their families; but haue wilfully lost them for want of the carefull vse of them.</p>
            <p>Now more specially, this going about of Christ doing good, standeth in two things. The former, in curing the deadly diseases of mens soules, by most holy and sauing doctrine, reuealing his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whole will, and teaching the things of the kingdome, not coldly, as the Scribes, but in most powerfull manner: so as his verie enemies were forced to say, <hi>neuer man spake as this man doth.</hi> The latter, in curing the bodies of men also by most powerfull miracles: one kind whereof which was most eminent (namely the healing of Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aks) is put for all the rest in the words following: by both which meanes he shewed himselfe a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18746:50"/>
Sauiour, and the cheife Phisicion both of soule and bodie, and in one word, the verie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God. Of both which points we are to speake something, seeing the former is the principall and included in this latter; and these latter were but seruants vnto the former. It is true that the Iewes were more affected with his miracles then with his doctrine, insomuch as they were often wholly carried after him for the bread and belly sake. Which seemeth to be the reason why the Apostle Peter speaketh more plainely of these, as beeing better obserued, and more sparingly of his doctrine which was not so great a rayser of his fame as these were: but it must not be so with vs, who look for saluation by his most holy doctrine, but cannot by his miracles.</p>
            <p>And first for his <hi>Doctrine</hi>; the calling of our blessed Sauiour beeing to seeke and saue that which was lost,<note place="margin">Christ went about doing good in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where most holy doctrine.</note> to reduce the lost sheepe of the house of Israel vnto the fold, to finde the lost goat, to call sinners vnto repentance; how all his life was thus taken vp, were too long in euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to manifest. To omit his priuate life which was nothing but an encreasing in wisedome and fauour with God and man. After his solemne and publike inauguration, he shewed himselfe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mirrour of goodnesse, both in the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall parts of his propheticall office; as also in the more speciall practises of it. For the <hi>former,</hi> how faithfull was he in all the house of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18746:51"/>
not as Moses, who was but a seruant, but <hi>as the Sonne,</hi> who from the bosome of his Father brought and deliuered a most perfect word of truth; yea, who was not only the bearer of it, but the verie author of all truth. And therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his power and commission, reformed the law corrupted with false glosses of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and established it: preached the Gospel, and dispersed it, by himselfe, his Apostles and other <hi>teachers</hi> after them raised by himselfe and fitted with gifts thereunto for the gathering of the Saints:<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> instituted, and ministred the Sacraments of the new Testament after the abolishing of the old: framed and prescribed a perfect forme of prayer, vnto which all ours must be squared: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered (as Moses) a patterne of the Temple and all things therein; namely, an absolute forme of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall gouernment for the perpetuall vse of the Church, for the well ordering and cutting off dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in it. And for the <hi>latter,</hi> how carefull was he to take all occasions to instruct particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the will of his Father; nay not only to <hi>take,</hi> but euen <hi>seeke</hi> them, that so he might make offer of the greatest good, that euer men in this world could meete withall. If his Disciples only speake of bread, hee telleth them he hath other bread that they know not of. If a poore woman meete him while she goeth to draw a bucket of water, he preacheth vnto her of the water of the well of life. If hee looke vpon the sunne, he takes
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18746:51"/>
occasion thence to instruct those who were about him, that he is the light of the world, and that whosoeuer follow him, walke not in darknesse. If hee see but a little child, hee thence taketh occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to instruct his followers in the doctrine of humilitie, innocencie, and meeknesse.<note place="margin">Matth. 18.3.</note> If he doe but heare of his mother and brethren,<note place="margin">Matth. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>50.</note> hee taketh occasion to shew his spirituall kindred, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. And in <hi>both these</hi> how meekly, gently, humbly, yea and compassionatly did hee carrie himselfe towards those that were any way teachea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, howsoeuer in publike, and against gainsayers he taught with maiestie and as one hauing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Besides this, how boldly and diligently went he about, preaching the will of his Father in the midst of dangers, discouragements, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches which were raised against him: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they lay in waite to catch him in his speach, but euen to attach his person to mischeefe him. How often did the Iewes take vp stones to stone him?<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. &amp; 10. Luk. 4.29.</note> how did the people assault him to throw him downe headlong from the toppe of an hill? how many other deadly dangers escaped he, and yet in the midst of death could not be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, nor ouercome of their mallice, but ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their euill with goodnesse.</p>
            <p>Vnto which most holy course of doctrine, if we adde his most innocent life, in which was no spot or error; it addeth also grace and glorie to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Neuer went any before him, or can doe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18746:52"/>
after him, doing good as he did: for he neuer did otherwise; no word or deede euer proceeded from him, but was answerable to the lawes perfection: so as the Church may wel sing out his beavrie from toppe to toe which is euery way matchlesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable.<note place="margin">Cant 5 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ went about doing good by many miraculous actions, all of them directly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good of man.<note place="margin">Vse of Christs mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</note> The especiall vses of them all were three.

Secondly,</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> confirme the truth of his office: thus the Iewes could sometimes confesse, that he was a teacher sent of God, Matth. 22.16. and Nicodemus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.2.</note> that no man <hi>could doe such things vnlesse God were with him:</hi> and Ioh. 6.14. Then the men when they <hi>had seene the miracle,</hi> said, <hi>This is of a truth the Prophet that should come into the world. Thirdly,</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> confirme the truth of his doctrine, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our faith in the same: Ioh. 11.14. <hi>Lazarus is dead, and I am glad that I was not there for your sakes, that yee may beleeue:</hi> and cap. 14.11. <hi>Beleeue me at least for the workes sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

First, in their substance or beeing: for in a true miracle, the thing is the same that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> appeareth to be, and hath true and reall, and not onely seeming effects. Moses produced a true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and very blood; whose effects were the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of the enchanters rods, and the killing of the fish: but the other are lies, and not the things which they seeme to be, called by the Apostle <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders:</hi> meere sorceries, iuglings, sleights,<note place="margin">2.

The like must be said of the fire which he brought downe from heauen vpon the cattle and seruants of Iob, he created it not, for creation is the sole and proper action of God; but added combustible matter together and brought fire to it, by his power and agilitie.

In one word, all the worke of Satan, and his instruments in such strange euents, is nothing else, but either, the deceiving of the senses, or coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of naturall causes to deceiue by. And by the way, let the Romane Church consider what kind
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18746:54"/>
of miracle their transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is; seeing in euery true miracle, euerie thing is as it appeareth to be; and there is no appearance but of bread.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> in the end and vse: true miracles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> confirme true doctrine, alwaies tend to the glorie of God, and saluation of men; but all these false miracles, as they be lyes, To they tend to lyes; to confirme false doctrine, to impaire Gods glorie, to hinder the saluation of men, yea to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and hasten their damnation. The miracles of Moses tended to the dismissing of Gods people according to Gods commandement, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe might be serued, his people eased, and Pharaoh himselfe (if it might be) freed from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: but the lying wonders of Iannes, and Iambres, (for they were the Sorcerers that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted Moses) tended to hold them in Egypt still, against the expresse commandement of God; to harden the heart of Pharaoh, and resisted the power and glorie of God, and the good of his people, yea of Pharaoh himselfe and his land. By which rule if we shall examine Popish miracles, we shall euer finde them brought to confirme some vntruth, which hath no ground in the word to stand vpon; as to prooue image-worship, prayers to the virgin Marie, Saints, Angels and dead men; Pilgrimages, Monasticall life, wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

let them bring in their whole legend; we are to adiudge their miracle-mungers no better then Pharaohs inchanters; nor the miracles themselues no other then the lying wonders of Antechrist, which cause men to beleeue lyes who haue not receiued the loue of the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, they differ in the manner of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming doctrine. For neuer was any deuise so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully confirmed, as the doctrine and religion of Christ which we professe. For as it is said of Pharaohs inchanters, after that Moses had brought the lice,<note place="margin">Exod 8.17.</note> that they assaied to doe the like, but could not; so in admirable wisedome hath the Lord put forth his mightie power, in effecting such mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for this doctrine, as he neuer suffred to be wrought for any other. For this only hath hee staied and pulled backe the course of sunne in the heauens; letted the fire from burning, deuided the sea and made it stand as a wall; raised not the sicke only to health, but the dead to life: strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned decrepit persons to beget and conceiue; yea more, set a part a virgin to beare a Sonne. Let Popish imposters leaue to bragge of straw-mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles such as was taken vp at Garnets execution; and their childish miracles, as their late London boy; and shew vs such as these. Let vs heare (but without imposture) of such as speake with new tongues; driue away serpents, and drinke deadly poyson and hurt them not; but neuer was any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine thus confirmed: and whatsoeuer
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18746:55"/>
signes and wonders are wrought to weaken any part of this truth, or establish any doctrine not grounded therein, as we are commanded, so we hold them all accursed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. In that Christ went about doing good, we note that as his person was a perfect mirror of all goodnesse;<note place="margin">Christs life was not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> them good, and communicate vnto them of his fulnesse of grace. Neither was his life an idle, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate or pompous life, neither swelled hee with abundance and wealth: but poore, meane, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious, and painfull: hee continually went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout doing good. From whom how many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are degenerate; who professing themselues seruants, would be loath to be as their Lord was; some setting vp themselues as it were a fatting in a course of ease and delicacie: <hi>feeding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues</hi> (not the flocke) <hi>without feare</hi>; others clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing with restles desires to honours and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: others incessantly thirsting (as if they had a dropsie) after mony and profits, seruing their Master only to carrie the bagge: others are doing perhappes, but little good they doe in their places; their doctrine is so cold, so indigested, or their liues so scandalous, so offensiue; or their hearts so corrupt and cankred, as they rather op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

If men will broach and bring into the Church new doctrines, and devises of their owne (as the Romish Church doth at this day) it is no meruaile if they seeke after new miracles to obtrude them withall: but if men will professe the ancient doctrine of the Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Christ himselfe, to gape after new mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,

Hence is it that the Scripture giueth vs example of some out of whom Christ cast out but one deuil: as Mark. 1.23. and the Cananitish womans daughter, Matth. 15.22. of others out of whom hee cast out moe, as out of Marie Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delen, seauen, and out of the man that kept among the graues, verie many: for they said they were a legion, which though it be a certaine number put for an vncertaine, yet must the number be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great: for some account a legion to be twelue thousand and fiue hundreth.<note place="margin">Varro.</note> And the least I read it accounted, is six thousand, sixe hundreth, sixtie and sixe.

that now the verie bodie, by the forsaking of God, and his iust desertion of it, is, or may become the habitacle of a whole legion of deuils and wicked spirits. And againe to vphold his hope in the midst of so many enemies, it may be obserued, that as God suffreth many, euen a legion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, to hurt one man; so hee hath many good Angels to pitch about a godly man to helpe him against them. Neither doth the Scripture speake of one speciall Angel, assigned to euery speciall man, but for our more full comfort, that they are all set about vs to keepe vs in our waies; and that all of them are ministring spirits for the good of those that are <hi>heires of saluation.</hi> When God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the eyes of Elisha his seruant,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> he saw multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, euen a mountaine full of them, set as it were in battell arraie for the defence of them bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but two.</p>

Many wicked persons are hence giuen vp by God vnto the Deuil, as the condemned person is deliuered into the hands of the hangman, that he might execute the Lords most righteous sentence: thus is that wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which haunted Saul, called the <hi>spirit of the Lord,</hi>

because hee was the minister of God to execute that iudgement vpon him. And these are the Lords ends herein, which hee would haue careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserued in all ages; and that men should not look vpon such examples without returne of glory to God, and reaping good to themselues. Satan, I grant, propoundeth vnto himselfe another end, which is to delight himselfe in the vexation, and torment of such miserable men; but yet for the former causes, and to heape vp the damnation of the deuils themselues, he suffreth them by their own most wicked wills to bring his most righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will to passe.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because the Deuil knew his time was short, and that the Sonne of God was euen now appearing to destroie the workes of the deuil, and therefore hee more bestirred him then euer before. So likewise in these last times, hee applieth his worke, and shall doe euery day more busily then other, as his time draweth faster on.

Sometimes he oppresseth men by multitudes; for although ten thousand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> men are not able to resist one of these wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, yet to shewe his malice, hee will set euen a whole legion vpon some one poore creature, as Mark. 5.9. 3.

Because the word teaching what a malicious enemie Satan is, men will not beleeue it, and therefore it is iust with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God that we should see, and sometimes feele to our cost, and experimentally be taught what furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hatred, and irreconciliable crueltie, our dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> enemie carrieth incessantly against vs. 2.

As little can they heare any thing that is good, their eares are stopped, wil heare no voice of God or his seruants; their eies are blinded by the God of this world; that they cannot see the light of the Gospel shining vpon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wicked men euen when their bodies are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> most decently couered, runne starke naked like madmen euerie where; they teare off, and wil not abide vpon them the garments of innocencie: the robe of Christs righteousnesse they wil not put on, yet see they not, nor shame for this nakednesse; but as hauing put off all forehead, they blush not at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

In which courses they are driuen headlong by the Devil into a bottomlesse sea of sinne, as the swine were into the lake: out of which miserable destruction, let Christ, or his Minister seeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them; they rage and raile like the deuils that would not be tormented before their time. But let them offer to bind them, and bring them into order, by the yoke of Gods iudgements denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the word; or by the rod of discipline that they may not hurt themselues and others: they breake out with more violence; such bonds are but like Sampsons flaxe; they lightly cast off all such yokes from them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As Satan forceth possessed persons to wound and destroie themselues and others, so is hee not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> contented with any course but such as turne to the wickeds owne ouerthrow, and the mischeife of so many as are within their power and reach: hee makes them beat themselues with stones continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, cast themselues into fire and water; that is, into all perills and desperate sinnes, wound their owne bodies, destroie their health, shorten their liues through their intemperate and greedie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of sinne: but most of all, wound their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and let out the verie life-blood of their soules. And (that their damnation may be more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18746:62"/>
and seuere) hee stirres them vp to kill and destroy whomsoeuer they can meete withall: by drawing in companions and partners in their wickednesse, calling them to cast in their lot with them; that so they may all perish together. What a wofull captiuitie then are many in that yet see it not? How many possessed persons are in euery corner, who yet will spit at the mention of the Deuil in defiance of him? why should supersticious &amp; sim-people be so afraid of bodily possession, as that when they neesed, or open their mouthes to take meate, they vsed to fence their mouthes with the signe of the crosse, least the deuil should get in at that doore: and we neuer feare spirituall possession to fence our selues against it? If we saw the deuil raging and tyrannising, striking a person dumb, and blind, racking his ioynts and winding his bodie at his pleasure, we would commiserate his state, and we could not be so profane but to send vp prayers for his release, as esteeming death it selfe a more desirable condition then so to liue. But when we see lewd wretches, no better then deuils incarnate, wholly subdued vnder the power of the deuil; &amp; ruled wholly at his will, and euery way in an estate more miserable; yet are we void of compassion towards them, and affection in our selues. We rather turne their mad pranks into a iest, then turne to God in prayer for their recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: so little we see or sauour of the things of God and his kingdome.

No, but all this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18746:63"/>
confession and worship was by constraint partly, because they knew him a Prince and a Iudge, whose power they could not resist: and partly, they flatter him, to obtaine more gentle entreatie at his hands then they deserued: so many a man professeth Christ, but you shall obserue, at least he may him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that many foule spirits breath in him: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he know Christ (as the deuills did) yet he obeyeth him not; he would faine resist him if hee were strong enough to make his part good against him: which because he cannot doe, he will giue him faire words, and call him Lord and Master: he will pray to him in sickenesse or distresse, but it is but to get out of his hands, and keepe his wonted hold still. If the power of Christs word come neere him, hee can beginne to accuse Christ, and Christian profession of vnpeaceablenesse, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting him before the time (for what time would please these that Christ should come vnto them?) he can aske Christ and his ministers what they haue to doe with him, and Christ shal be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, because he cannot be at peace for him, if he would let him alone all should be well and quiet, but the ministrie and discipline are intollerable: let Christ preach, and he will preach him too, so it be such a Gospel as bringeth no repentance or ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life to himselfe, but he may remaine where he was, euen in the graues, alreadie lodged with death. When he cannot doe the greater mischiefe that he would, he will doe the lesser if he can: if
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18746:63"/>
he cannot hinder the ministerie, he can deprave it: wherein (as in all the rest) he shewes himselfe at the command of that wicked spirit, who when he could no longer torment the man, would drowne the swine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> although the deuill might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through the power of Christ to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> him the holy one of God, so as themselues might continue deuills still; yet who would thinke him guided by any other then a good spirit of God, that should extoll the seruants of Christ, their persons, their ministerie, their doctrine? for would any conceiue that the father of lyes would praise the truth? and yet marke what a large testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie the deuil himselfe in the maid gaue of Paul and Silas, <hi>These men are the seruants of the most high God, which shew vnto vs the way of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi>

               <hi>and this she did many dayes.</hi> Why did not the deuill know that they were the greatest enemies he had vpon earth? yes, he did, but he must somtimes transforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into an angel of light, he must colour all his lyes with some truth which is vndeniable, he can lay all his falshoods vpon appearance of truth; as his eldest sonne Mahomet enlarged the praises of Christ, and his Disciples to ouerthrowe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion withall: he hath his fetch to make men beleeue there is an agreement betweene Christ, and his Apostles, and himselfe, or that they needed his testimonie; who therefore put him to silence, and would receiue no commendation
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18746:64"/>
from him, but for praises returned sharpe rebukes. Euen so, many men can praise good men and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters before their faces, whom they knowe to be deadly enemies to their vices: not for loue of their vertues, but least they should vse them: and can call them honest men to trie if by that they can hinder them from doing the dutie of honest men, as the deuils called Paul and Silas the seruants of God, least they should shewe themselues so by dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing them. Besides, they would seeme heerein to be better then they are, and therefore will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Gospel, and bringers with their mouthes, whereas in their hearts they cannot abide that the doctrine of it should be in sincerity, either publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or practised: the name of Christianitie and of the Gospel pleaseth them well enough, so as the power and fruit of it come not neere them. But as the deuill had no sooner praysed the seruants of God, but presently he changed his coppie, and neuer left persecuting them till he had cast them <hi>into prison,</hi> got them <hi>soundly beaten,</hi> set fast <hi>in the stocks,</hi> and after sent out of the <hi>citie:</hi> euen so, many who now commend the person and doctrine of the seruants of God, presently (shewing what spirit guideth them) can accuse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hem to be mutinous, and seditious, troublers of their citie and state, and raise vp the whole citie, and stirre vp the wrath of the Magistrates against them, that so vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the word, or lawe, or peace, or order, the true Ministers of God shall bee wrongfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,

and cast out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> who would thinke that he could be haunted with a wicked spirit, that can see his sinne,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 24.17.18.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> confesse it with teares and indignation against himselfe; openly iustifie the righteousnes of Gods children? and yet in the example of Saul we see that a soule possessed of Satan may doe all this. For as it is in bodily possession, though the deuils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is incessantly to hurt and vex the poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet by Gods ouerruling power hee is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to giue them some respite, and though <hi>hardly,</hi> yet sometimes <hi>departeth from them:</hi> and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, but <hi>sometimes</hi> casts them into the fire,<note place="margin">Luk. 9.</note> and <hi>sometimes</hi> into the water. So is it in spirituall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, the Lord for the common good bridleth often the rage of the deuil in his instruments, that they cannot alwaies exercise it as they would; but they haue their fits sometimes, that is, some strong lusts which Satan watcheth and putteth himselfe into (as Iudas his coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ousnesse invited the deuill to enter into him) and also sometimes againe they haue their good moodes, and seeme to be come to themselues: but long stay they not here, but in a moment are changed and cast into their sits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Thus in a good mood, Saul could confesse his wickednesse, and Dauids innocencie, and lift vp his voice and weepe; and Dauid was now his good Sonne, and who but hee? but presently the <hi>good spirit went,</hi> and the <hi>euill spirit came vpon him,</hi> and he became more tyrannous and furious then
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18746:65"/>
euer before: euen so some there are who seeme to haue remorse of conscience for sinne, they will confesse their wickednesse with teares, pray for pardon, promise amendment, begge prayers of others (as Pharaoh) one would thinke them very penitent, themselues thinke they are so also, but the moone changeth not so often as these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall lunatiks: who hence may knowe that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill spirit hath taken possession of them, because they are neuer long in a good mind. These few notes in stead of many I thought good to set downe to helpe men that are desirous to see how secretly Satan worketh in their soules; and how hee can cunningly most forceably keep possession, when he seemeth most to disclaime it: that thus they comming to perceiue the disease, may run out of themselues to seeke for remedie. Which what it is, we are now in the next point to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
            <p>The third point in the words to be considered, is the mightie power of Iesus Christ, who only could heale those that were thus oppressed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled by the deuill: and here consider, 1. the <hi>ground,</hi> 2. the <hi>proofe or manifestation</hi> of it. The ground was because God was, <hi>with him.</hi> It will be obiected, that God is said to haue beene with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his seruants who yet had not this power:<note place="margin">How God was with his Sonne, and how with his seruants.</note> as with Ioseph, Ioshuah, Moses, and others. <hi>Answ.</hi> God was indeed with them onely by manifesting his presence in some powerfull or louing effect
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18746:65"/>
which he wrought in, by, or for them. But neuer was God present with any of his Saints as he was with his Sonne, who had not the vertue only and power of the Godhead effectually and energeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally working with him (which was all they had) but the godhead it selfe was after a sort bodily with him: yea, the <hi>fulnesse of the godhead was not</hi> only with him, <hi>but in him bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where God is said, not only to be with Christ, <hi>but in Christ, reconciling the world vnto himselfe,</hi> 2.

euer was made to man fallen, that this seede of the woman should bruise the serpents head. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which prophecie, hee, not only put Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to flight in his owne person, Matth. 4. but tooke also his strongest holds where he had strongly fortified himselfe in the persons of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as euery where the Historie of the Gospel recordeth. Hee rebuked the vncleane spirits, and made them crie for greefe and anger.<note place="margin">Mark. 9.25. Mark. 1.25.</note> Hee forced them to silence, and would not suffer them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse him. By his verie word hee cheyned and bound them whom no bolts could hold, nor any other meanes subdue: such was his power and glorie (though men saw little of it) that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils could neither flie from him, nor yet abide his presence. A whole legion of them, ranne to meete him a farre off,<note place="margin">Mark. 5 6.</note> and worshipped him, most submissly intreated him that hee would not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them; and earnestly sued vnto him, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could no longer inhabit the man, they might haue power ouer the swine. By all which examples and many moe that might be added, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth what command Iesus Christ hath ouer the deuils, and that by his only word hee healed all those that were oppressed by them. <hi>Quest.</hi> It is true that Christ hath this power and glorie in himselfe,<note place="margin">How the power of Christ foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Satan for vs.</note> because <hi>God is with him,</hi> but how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this power to be so sauing and soueraigne vnto miserable creatures who are held vnder the power of the deuil, and that most iustly. <hi>Answ.</hi>

In healing all our diseases (among which this cure is numbred,<note place="margin">Mat 8.16, 17.</note>) we must knit and combine those two things which in Christ were inseperable, namely, his <hi>glorie</hi> and his <hi>grace,</hi> the latter of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the former soueraigne vnto vs; and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in two actions: in remoouing from vs the next causes of all our diseases, namely our sinnes. For as the Phisicion in working a cure, first remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the distempered humors of his patient which are the matter of the disease: so doth our heauenly Phisicion imply, that this is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his cure, and therefore often his first word is, <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee,</hi> and his last word is, <hi>goe and sinne no more, least a</hi> worse thing befall thee. 2. By taking our diseases vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which no Phisician doth or can doe: but this Lamb of God taketh away the sinnes of the world, by taking them vpon himselfe:<note place="margin">Col. 2.22.</note> for <hi>hee bare our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> and carried our sorrowes and <hi>sinnes in the bodie of his flesh,</hi> euen to the crosse, where they were fastned with him, buried them in his graue, yea, cast them into hell, and there left them; by which most glorious triumph of his, the snares and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherewith we were chayned to death and the Deuil, are broken, and our soules (as a bird) are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped.</p>
            <p>Hence note,<note place="margin">Christ onely by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per power casteth out deuills.</note> 1. That no man can cast a deuill out of a possessed partie, or euer did as a principall efficient cause, but as an instrument, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by this power of the Lord Iesus, to whome all

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that whosoeuer finde themselues any way molested of Satan, must hasten themselues to Iesus Christ, who onely can batter down the holds of the deuill, and worke their deliuerance.

And for this they alleadge that in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, onely by naming Iesus such cures were effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. To which I answer, that it is too grosse a conceit, to thinke that there can be any vertue in words to driue away diseases, much lesse deuills: or to conceiue that by the pronouncing of words, but by the vertue and power of Christ, working by the Apostles, and miraculously put forth with those words, both diseases and deuills gaue place,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18746:68"/>
and so the parties were healed. 2. Such as thinke that by the applying of consecrated things (as they call them) deuills are scared away:<note place="margin">Popish char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> as by holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, salt, hallowed candles, reliques of Saints, the signe of the crosse, images fashioned in such or such a place: All which howsoeuer verie ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the Church of Rome, yet indeede are no better then sorcerie and charming; and the verie practises of those who while they will driue the deuil from others, plainly prooue that themselues are spiritually possessed by him, in that they will cast out deuills by Beelzebub the Prince of deuils. They obiect for these reliques, that a souldier that was to be buried, was reuiued by touching the dead bones of Elishah, 2. Kin. 13.21. But this was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle wrought by the finger of God, to confirme the truth preached by that worthie Prophet, and is not to be ascribed to the touching of the bones, which in themselues, nor at any other time, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such vertue.</p>
            <p>They alledge also the example of the woman hauing the blooddie issue, who was cured by the touching of Christs garment: whereas that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease was cured, not by the corporall touching of his skirt, but by the spirituall touching of himselfe, which was by the hand of her faith: and therefore our Sauiour said, <hi>be it vnto thee,</hi> not according to thy feeling, <hi>but according to thy faith.</hi> They alleadge also, Act. 19.12. <hi>That from Pauls bodie were brought to the sicke, napkins or handkercheifes, and the diseases

departed from them, and the euill spirits went out of them.</hi> Which things had no such power in them, but only that it pleased God by such weake meanes to produce miracles, for the confirmation of that holy doctrine preached by Paul. And therefore the text ascribeth these miracles, not to the gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments of Paul, but to <hi>God</hi> himselfe; who <hi>by the hands of Paul wrought them,</hi> vers. 11. Whence we may conclude, that whosoeuer vse any such meanes as these, shew themselues, not only superstitious, and wicked; but most foolish and ridiculous to thinke that any bodily substance whatsoeuer can worke vpon or violence a substance which is not bodily, such as the deuils is. It will be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that experience sheweth that such meanes as these preuaile to these intents and purposes: which we grant to be true; but that is by Satans subtelty, who often dissembleth a flight, as though he were forced by an exorcist to depart: or else indeed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away, that men might be confirmed in their impietie, and grow more madde vpon such wicked and vnlawfull meanes.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18746:71"/>
the rest of the Apostles, that they were witnesses, not onely of the things formerly vttered, but of all things else, not onely which Christ did in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea and Ierusalem, but also which he suffered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and so defendeth to lay downe his <hi>Priestly</hi> office in this verse, and his <hi>kingly</hi> office in the next.

               <hi>hee died according vnto his flesh,</hi> for his bodie was dead being separated from his soule; and his soule suffered the sorrowes of death. But yet we must conceiue, that he suffered not in such a manhood as was a naked and bare flesh, such as ours, but such as was inseparably vnited and knit to the godhead; and therefore the Apostle saith, that <hi>God shed his blood,</hi> that is, not the Godhead, but such a person as is both God and man. Secondly, although he had no personall sinne to bring him

            <p>Hence note, 1. how Christs righteousnesse is witnessed; hee went about doing good, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hee is slaine; and teacheth that Christ himselfe deserued not death; but hee endured it for some other that had deserued it: and indeed, Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for vs, and in our stead that we should not die. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But how could he, beeing innocent, suffer
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18746:73"/>
for vs sinners, or how standeth it with equitie, that God should punish the innocent,<note place="margin">How it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with Gods iustice to punish the innocent, and let the guilty goe free.</note> and let the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie goe free? <hi>Answ.</hi> We must consider Christ in his death, not as a debter, but as a surety or pledge betweene God and vs, who hath vndertaken our whole debt; and therefore he suffereth not as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in himselfe, but in the roome of vs that were guiltie: now it standeth with the course of iustice, to lay the debters action vpon the suretie, beeing 1. willing, 2. able to pay the debt, as Christ was. Secondly, we may gather hence the hainousnesse and odiousnesse of our sinnes, it was no trifle, nor a matter of small desert, that the Lord of glorie, the onely sonne of God, yea God himselfe must shed his blood for: and yet what a small reckoning is made of foule and open sinnes? Thirdly, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice also of the loue of God, who to free vs, would lay the chastisement of our peace vpon his deare sonne, that so his iustice might be satisfied. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But how could his iustice be satisfied, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely offended, with such a finite &amp; short death as Christs was?<note place="margin">The iustice of God doth more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in Christ his passion, then if all the world had been dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By reason of the dignitie of the person who suffered, beeing God as well as man: that suffering was in value eternall, though not in duration or continuance.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we haue here the two natures of Christ liuely set before vs; the one most powerfull and glorious in mightie miracles, which forced legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of deuils to flie before it: the other beaten downe with wrongs and iniuries, euen to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18746:73"/>
death it selfe: and it was meete that the Apostle intending to prooue Christ to be the true Messias, should mention both these natures, which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessarie to the Mediator: the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that it might suffer death, and so satisfie in the same nature that had sinned; and the dietie, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome in suffering, so to apply that satisfaction vnto beleeuers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the persons that put Christ to death, were the Iewes, they <hi>of Iudaea and Ierusalem. Obiect.</hi>
               <note place="margin">How the Iewes are said to put Christ to death, though they had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to doe it.</note> But the Iewes had no power to put him to death, the scepter was gone from them; and if the Scribes and Pharisies had had the power in their hands, they would neuer haue suffered him aliue so long. Besides, the Iudge who was Pontius Pilat, was the Romane Emperours deputie; the souldiers, his executioners, were of the Romane band; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of death also, not Iewish, but Romane: why is it then said, that the Iewes slew him, and no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Romanes, by whose authoritie he was put to death. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Iewes are iustly charged with it, because they were the cheife cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and abettors in all that violence which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mans vsed against him. They made way to this sentence, and went as farre as they could; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him, they mocked him, they charged him with blasphemie, they raised false witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, they beate him, spate in his face, they hoodwinke him, and bad him prophecie who smote him: finally, they deliuered him to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18746:74"/>
gouernour, accuse him with matter of death, falsly witnesse it against him, mooued the people to aske Barrabas, and cry, <hi>crucifie him</hi>: they are content that his blood be vpon them and their children, as it is at this day: and this is that which Pilate in his owne defence said vnto Christ, Ioh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.35. <hi>Am I a Iewe?

            <p>First, that the lower degrees of murther, such as are enuie,<note place="margin">Lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of murther condemned.</note> hatred, and vncharitable proceedings, are esteemed murther it selfe before God: for the Iewes slew Christ in that they deliuered him of enuie to the Romans to be sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet how openly do men testifie the mallice of their hearts, so farre as they dare, by cursed, reuiling, and murthering spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that they may shew themselues murtherers with witnesse: but alas, little know they what they doe; for if the least and lowest degrees of prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and rancorous speaches, as to call the <hi>brother foole,</hi>

against him in that cause, yea had his owne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that he was the sonne of God, which they tooke for blasphemie: yet for this could they not put him to this kind of death, seeing the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by the lawe of God, must be stoned, not cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and so had Christ beene, if the power of death had beene in the hands of the Iewes, as not long before it was: but the prouidence of God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruleth the matter so, as he must be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Romane gouernour, and a newe action of treasonable affecting the kingdome be laid against him, whence it was that Pilate asked if he were the king of the Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he answered yea, vpon which answer, he was condemned to the most cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell death that was in vse among the Romanes: for of those three kinds of death, burning, heading, and crucifying,<note place="margin">Christ repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an arch traytor in his life and death.</note> this last was the most seuere and shamefull, to which the chiefe malefactors were sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced: and that Christ was executed as an arch-traytor, the inscription on the crosse, containing the crime for which hee was condemned, plainely sheweth, <hi>Iesus of Nazareth King of the Iewes:</hi> that no man could looke vpon or read that writing, but he should presently conceiue Christ a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor in the highest kinde of treason and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> this kind of death was aunciently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, as also foreprophesied: it was prefigured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by Isaac, laid bound vpon the wood, and the other sacrifices, which all were laid on the wood to bee

consumed by fire; by the lifting vp of the shoulder of the peace offering, Leuit. 7.20. by the shaking of the breast of the same to and fro, which as some say, signifieth the spreading of our Sauiours hands vpon the crosse: but especially by the lifting vp of the brasen serpent in the wildernesse, which, (as Christ saith,) shadowed his owne lifting vp vpon the crosse, Ioh. 3.14. Againe, this kind of death was also foreprophesied, Psal. 22.17. <hi>they peirced or digged my hands and feete:</hi> it was foretold also by himselfe, Matth. 20.19. <hi>They shall deliuer him to the Gentiles, and they shall mocke him, and scourge him, and crucifie him:</hi> and that it was necessarie that this word of Christ should bee fulfilled, see Iohn, 18.32.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this kind of death carried with it a more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> speciall infamie then any other (as at this day wee count hanging a dogs death, that is, an infamous kinde of death) because it was especially execrable by the law, which accursed euerie one which was hanged on a tree; not that this death by any law of nature, or in it selfe, was more accursed then bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or pressing, or by the sword; for then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the theife on the crosse could be saued, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our fellons thus executed, whereas the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the one, and our owne experience in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, speake the contrary: but it was onely accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the ceremoniall law of Moses; so that euerie malefactor of the Iewes that was hanged, was in the ceremonie accursed, &amp; was the type of Christ,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18746:81"/>
the substance of all ceremonies, who on the crosse was really and truly accursed, sustaining the whole wrath of God, which is the curse of the lawe, and not only ceremonially and typically as they were. This the Apostle Paul teacheth, Gal. 3.13. that Christ was not onely dead, but <hi>made a curse for vs:</hi> his reason is, because <hi>he died on a tree</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we admonished, Phillp. 2.8. to consider, not only that Christ <hi>was obedient vnto the death,</hi> but to the death of the <hi>crosse:</hi> for any other death had not so much concerned vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this death which so much concerned all the Church of Iewes and Gentiles must not be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> obscure, and therefore the Lord would not haue Christ to die in a tumult, or in secret, but most conspicuously and apparantly; at Ierusalem, the great citie of the Iewes, but tributarie to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, as it were vpon the theatre of the world, at a solemne feast, when all the males out of all quarters must appeare before the Lord: vpon a crosse high erected, that all might see him, and on that crosse himselfe proclaimed, King of the Iewes, in three seuerall languages, the Latin, Greeke, and Hebrewe, that all sorts of men might come to the knowledge of it: and further, because in his death standeth our life, he must be thus lifted vp that all men might see him certainely dead, and that he died not in shew and appearance only, but indeede, and in truth, really and perfectly: for which cause also our Apostle doubleth his affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18746:82"/>
they <hi>slew him, and hanged him on a tree:</hi> which most necessarie ground of faith and religion, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath mightily by many heretikes sought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe: the Turks at this day are held off from the faith in this Messiah, by that diabolicall sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that not Christ himselfe, but Simon the Cyrenian was miraculously crucified in his stead. And therefore because the assurance of the death it selfe assureth vs more fully of all the fruits and benefits of it, the Scripture is carefull so pregnant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confirme it, as that it cannot be denied, not only that he was in the sight of a number of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands dead on the crosse, but by his three dayes buriall, by the peircing of his side, out of which came water and blood, by which was manifest that the verie call of his heart was peirced, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his verie enemies, who would beleeue nothing but their own sences: and lastly, by the fact of the souldiers, who, whereas they hastened the death of the theeues by breaking their legges, they broke not his, because (the text saith) they sawe that he was dead alreadie.</p>
            <p>The fourth point is the vse of Christs crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. First, in Christ on the crosse take a full veiw of the cursednesse and execration of sinne, and consequently of thine owne wretchednesse, both in regard of thy wicked nature, and cursed practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; euery sinne beeing so lothsome and odious in the eies of God, as the least could neuer be put away but by such an ignominious death of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18746:82"/>
Sonne of God himselfe. If thou lookest at sinne in thy selfe, or in thy suffrings, yea or in the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings of the damned in hell, it will seeme but a slight thing: but behold God comming downe from heauen, and him that thought it no robberie to be equall to his Father in glorie, taking flesh, in that flesh abasing himselfe to the death of the crosse, on that crosse susteining the whole wrath of his Father and so becomming accursed for it, and thou shalt see it in the natiue face of it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this one consideration setteth a more vgly face vpon sinne, then the law possibly can;<note place="margin">The most vgly visage of sinne that can be.</note> for that sheweth our sinnes to be a knife to stabbe our selues withall, but this to be the very speare that went to Christs heart, which is the most odious apprehension in the world: all the sinne that euer was committed on the earth, could not bring a man so low (suppose one man had committed them all) as the least sinne of the elect brought the Sonne of God; seeing hee that falleth lowest, falleth but from one degree in earth to another, but Christ falleth from the glorie of heauen, into the very sorrowes of hell: whosoeuer thou art then that makest light account of sinne, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest that God is mercifull, looke a little in this glasse, wherein behold Gods iustice, and sinnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, in the Fathers iust indignation against his wel-beloued Sonne whom nothing but the cursed death of his only Sonne, in whom hee professed himselfe well pleased, could appease.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:18746:83"/>Secondly, seeing all the knowledge of Christ profitable to saluation, is of Christ crucified, let vs desire to know nothing in comparison, but <hi>Christ and him crucified</hi>;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.2.</note> seeing such a great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle as Paul was, desired to know nothing else. Now to come to the distinct knowledge of it, we must consider these three points. 1. The vertue and power of this death in it selfe. 2. The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it vnto our selues. 3. The fruits, which must appeare in vs by such application.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>first</hi>; Looke vpon this death of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Sonne of God, not as of another dead man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke or speake of it as of the death of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinarie fellon executed; but as of a death which slew all the sinnes, of all the beleeuers in the world, and as a destroyer of all destroyers; a death wherein was more power then in all the liues of all Angels and Men that euer were or shall be;<note place="margin">More power in Christs death then in the liues of all men and Angels.</note> yea such a death as hath life in it, quickning all the deaths of all that haue benefite by it. Here we haue a mightie Sampson bearing away the gates of his enemies; by death killing death; by suffering his Fathers wrath ouercomming it; by entring into the graue, opening it for all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers; by his blood shedding vpon the crosse, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling all things,</hi> Col. 1.20. neuer was their such an actiue suffering of any man, which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and crucified the Deuils themselues, when the deuils instruments were tormenting and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him: it is peerelesse and vnmatcheable, no
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18746:83"/>
Martyr euer thus suffered, though Popish doctrine would match as Corriualls some of their Saints sufferings with it; the most faithfull Martyrs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred but dissolution of soule and bodie; but Christ besides, suffered the whole wrath of God due to mans sinne: they suffred in way of Christian dutie and seruice; but hee to make a sacrifice of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinne: they hauing their sinnes remooued, and taken off from them; but hee <hi>bare</hi> all theirs, and all beleeuers <hi>sinnes in his bodie vpon the tree</hi>:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.24</note> Howsoeuer therefore humane wisedome stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at this death of Christ, yet must we, by the eye of faith, labour to espie glorie in ignominie, esteeme of the crosse as an honourable chariot, &amp; reioyce in a triumph made (as the Iewes scoffe) by an hanged man; thus shall we see the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, wiser then man, and the weaknesse of God, stronger then man; thus also shall we imitate the holy men of God, who looking backe to the crosse of Christ, could see him thereon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, spoiling principallities, breaking down partitions, reconciling God and man;<note place="margin">Coloss 2.14.</note> yea man and man,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aying hatred, and procuring perfect peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, seeing it is cleare in the text that Christ died not for his owne sinnes, it is cleare that hee died for the sinnes of his elect, vnto whom this vertue of his death must be applied; and this two waies, 1. to their humiliation. 2. to their
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18746:84"/>
consolation. Both of them grounded hereupon, that Christ was thus crucified for thee: without which application, the knowledge of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified excelleth not that in the deuils themselues. For the former, if Christ died for thee, then wast thou the cause of his death; thou crucifyedst him, thou art as faultie and blame worthy for his death, as euer was Iudas, Pilat, the Iewes, or the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; thy sinnes were the nayles, and the speare, and thy selfe wast one of them that pearced him: which consideration seriously thought of, will be forceable to cast downe the proud conceits of those for whom Christ must be thus humbled;<note place="margin">Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation must humble Christians, and how it doth so.</note> and cannot but bring bitternesse of spirit to him that truely conceiueth that himselfe deserued that death which Christ, not deseruing, indured for him: yea, and to haue beene held vnder the wrath of God for all eternitie, if Christ had not freed him: vrge this point vpon thy conscience to bring thy selfe to the bewayling of thy sinnes: oh it was my pride that stript Christ starke naked: it was the sinne of my soule that made his soule heauie vnto the death: my corruptions were the cordes that bound him; my malice, my contempt of God, my ignorance, my wofull courses were the thornes and nailes that wounded him, he all this while standing in my roome and stead. Thus is it prophesied of beleeuers in the new Testament, that when the spirit of grace shall be powred vpon them,<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> they shall looke <hi>on him whom they haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18746:84"/>
and lament for him:</hi> that is, by faith they shall looke to Christ whom by sinne they haue pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and this shall be an effectuall meanes to lead them further into the practise of repentance: Thus Peter when hee would bring downe the stifnesse of the Iewes, told them that they <hi>crucified the Lord of glorie</hi>; which when they heard,<note place="margin">Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.37.</note> they were <hi>pricked in their hearts, and said, men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what shall we doe to be saued.</hi> Popish preachers so handle this matter, as to stirre vp compassion towards Christ, hatred of the Iewes, and Iudas, and the soldiers; but we must labour by it to come to the hatred of our owne sinnes, or else we shall come behind the Iewes themselues.</p>
            <p>For the latter, If Christ was thus crucified for thee, then also be thou of good comfort, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things were nailed on the crosse with him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all thy inditement, all thy sinne, originall and actuall, the curse, hell, and death it selfe died with him; if thou beest a beleeuer, the some nailes which were driuen into his hands and feete were driven into thy sinnes; so as thou maist looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crosse as the Israelites did vpon the brasen serpent,<note place="margin">Christ his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement is the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> and thereby be cured of all the sting of sinne, and deadly sicknesses of thy soule: thou maist behold his ignominie, as thy glorious roabe, his arrainment, thy absolution, his binding, thy freedome, his abasement, thy advancement, his nakednesse, the couer of thy shame, his death, thy life, and his Fathers forsaking of him, an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18746:85"/>
that thou shalt neuer be forsaken. Only this knowledge of Christ crucified in speciall for thee is it that can settle the conscience in peace: when thou knowest and beleeuest that all thy personall &amp; particular sinnes were hung on the crosse with Christ, and that hee in thy roome suffred for them, that which in Gods acceptation was as much as if in thine owne person thou hadst borne the curse of the law for all eternitie. The most content themselues generally to know that Christ died for sinners, but neuer care to know what this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular application meaneth: The Popish doctrine also is an open aduersarie to this most comfortable perswasion of iustifying faith: but it behooueth him that would haue the right vse of this doctrine, neuer to be at rest, till hee can come to say with the holy Apostle, <hi>who loued mee,</hi> and <hi>gaue himselfe for mee, Gal.</hi> 20.20. and with Thomas, after hee had seene the impressions of the wounds in his hands and side, <hi>my Lord, and my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, seeing that of the two maine things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> in this death, 1. merit, 2. the efficacie; none shall haue his part in the former, that hath not in the latter: our care must be, if we would find life in this death of Christ, neuer to be at rest vntill we find the fruite and effect thereof in some sort in our selues. The most powerfull fruits of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

thus farre humbled for thy sinnes: if to reuenge, behold Christ on the crosse praying, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his deadly enemies: if to oppresse the poore and innocent, see Christ on the crosse suffering his blood to bee sucked out for those whose blood thou suckest: so in temptation to any other sinne, denie it, and say, Oh no, I see Christ on the crosse made a curse for my sinnes alreadie, I haue done him wrong enough already, I wil not adde this to the former, I see rather an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite debt due from me towards him; and I must rather thinke of the paiment of that, then offer to runne in further. Thus we see both the dutie and the meanes, neither of them both are regarded by many: some would faine see Christ on the crosse, for the remitting of their sinne, but not for the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of it: their lusts are as strong as euer before: pride, contention, hastinesse, voluptousnes, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse liue and thriue in them, and yet they say, Christ was crucified for them, whereas if Christ be crucified for thee, the world is crucified vnto thee, and thou vnto the world. Others, because Christ is come and dead for sinners, make a cleane contrarie argument: Christ died for sinners, and therefore they will liue in their sinnes; as though that were the worke of Christ vpon the crosse to maintaine sinne, and libertine courses, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to abolish the same: what a fearefull thing is it that men dare make the death of the Sonne of God as a common packhorse to lay all their sinnes

vpon, while yet hereby they embolden themselues in the multiplication of them.

The second fruit that must appeare in vs, is the life <hi>of Christ,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.15. <hi>He died for all, that they which liue, should not henceforth liue vnto themselues, but vnto him which died for them and rose againe:</hi> Rom. 6.11.12. <hi>Likewise thinke yee also that yee are dead to sinne, but are aliue to God in Iesus Christ:</hi> 12. <hi>Let not therefore sin raigne in your mortall bodie.</hi> In which places, this life of Christ is opposed to the course of our liues framed of our selues; and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but to depend vpon Christ in all things, to giue vp all our thoughts, words, and actions to be guided by his word, and directed to his glorie, and so to order our whole course, as his blessed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may appeare to breath, lead, and liue in vs. Now that this fruit should be added to the former, is euident, 1.

and shame for him? shall hee contentedly die an accursed death for me, and shall not I as conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly die to an accursed life for him? shall hee die to glorifie me, and shall not I liue to glorifie him? shall not he think his heart blood too deare for me, &amp; shall I loue any thing better then him? Thus to behold Christ on his crosse, will helpe the forward in this fruit also.

That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his victorie and conquest ouer death might be more glorious; in that hee could not hold him downe when hee had him in his owne house; but like a mightie Sampson he carried away the gates of his enemies. 3. To remooue by vndergoing for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vs that fearefull state of death and damnation, which we had otherwise for euer layd vnder; to sanctifie vnto vs our estate vnder temporall death, which is sweetned by his death: to make our graues as soft and perfumed beds of rest, by his lying in the graue: and that we also therein by beeing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued

That seeing it was his pleasure to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the lowest estate of humiliation before his exaltation; we might also with more cheerefulnesse content our selues, to <hi>suffer</hi> euen any abasement <hi>with him,</hi> and for him, before wee looke to raigne with him.</p>
            <p>The words of the verse containe two things. 1. The assertion of Christ his resurrection, <hi>Him God raised vp the third day.</hi> 2. The manifestation or eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, <hi>and caused that he was openly shewed.</hi> The former part is laid downe in fowre distinct points. 1. the person raised, <hi>him.</hi> 2. the person raising him, <hi>God.</hi> 3. the action it selfe, <hi>raised.</hi> 4. the time when, <hi>the third day.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, the person raised is <hi>Christ</hi>: where first it will be demanded how Christ can be said to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">How Christ can be said to rise, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither his diety nor the soule of his humanity arose.</note> seeing he consisted of a diuine and a humane nature, whereof the first could neither fall nor rise: and for the second that also consisted of soule and bodie; the former of which beeing the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18746:92"/>
part died not, but was in paradise. Seeing then neither the deitie, nor the soule of his humanitie, nor his person did rise, but only his bodie; how can Christ be said to be raised. <hi>Ans</hi> In sundry other places of Scripture besides this, we meet with such synechdochicall phrases and formes of speach; wherein somewhat is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the whole, which is proper but to one part, and that ascribed to the whole person, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth but to one nature: which commeth to passe by reason of that strait and personall vnion of the two natures in Christ. Thus we read that <hi>God purchased his Church by his owne blood</hi>:<note place="margin">Act. 20.28. 1. Cor. 2.8. Ioh. 3.18. Ioh. 8.58.</note> and that the <hi>Lord of glorie was crucified:</hi> of the sonnes bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in heauen and in earth at one time:</hi> of Christs <hi>beeing before Abraham was:</hi> of his beeing <hi>omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, &amp;c.</hi> All which are spoken of the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but properly are to be referred to the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall natures to which they doe agree. Thus the Apostles sometimes expound them, and teach vs so to doe; 1. Pet. 3.18. Christ was mortified <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh,</hi> and quickned <hi>according to the spirit:</hi> 2. Cor. 13.4. <hi>Hee died according to the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of his flesh,</hi> and was quickned according to the power of God: and to helpe our conceit herein, serueth that schoole distinction, which saith, that <hi>whole Christ</hi> is said to doe this or that,<note place="margin">Totus Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stus, non to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Christi.</note> which the <hi>whole of Christ</hi> did not: yea our owne common forme of speach saith, a man is dead whose soule liueth, and a man is a sleepe when his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18746:93"/>
bodie only sleepeth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We haue hence to note that the same bodie was raised which had beene laid downe in the graue, and no imaginarie bodie, neither any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodie for it; for neuer was any other laid there before. Of all which himselfe against all Heretikes giueth sufficient euidence, as in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation following remaineth to be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this person raised was not a priuate person, but the same who had as a publicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son beene abused, accused, condemned, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; and now as a publike person also raised from the dead; in whom all his Church, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member of it rose againe: for whosoeuer haue interest in his death, haue their part also in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is a further thing in this person to be noted then euer was in any: the first Adam was a roote also and a publike person; when hee sinned, hee sinned for himselfe and vs, and hauing sinned, and we in him, hee died away, and left vs in that sinne; and beeing dead we heare no more of him: and the Scriptures though they record at large the histories of the holiest men that haue liued, yet when once they come to this, that such or such a man died, we heare no more of him: but with Christ it is not so; who was not only as another Sampson, who bewraied the greatest power in his death; but herein vnmatcheable and pearlesse

            </p>
            <p>We must not then content our selues with common people, that Christ is dead for all and no more; but fasten our eyes vpon his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection so much the more diligently, by how much it is easier to beleeue that hee was dead, then that hee rose againe. And what other thing can more fitly be collected from that practise of all the Euangelists, who in other things while some of them omit one historie, some another; or else some of them breifly point at, and lightly touch and passe ouer some other histories: all of them set themselues of purpose to be copious and large in this of Christs resurrection; that the faith of beleeuers might be firmely grounded herein, and the rather, because no benefite of his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, none of his death: and without the certaine apprehension hereof, all preaching, and hearing, and faith were in vaine; and we our selues were yet in our sinnes: To which Apostolicall practise, this of our Apostle is not vnsutable in this place in hand;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.17.18.</note> who while hee almost in one word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of the death of Christ, hee at large prosecuteth and prooueth the truth of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>The second point, is to consider the person that raised Christ. Him <hi>God</hi> raised, that is, God
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18746:94"/>
the Father, Act. 2.24. <hi>And haue crucified and slaine, whom God hath raised:</hi> and 3.15. <hi>Yee haue killed the Lord of life, whom God hath raised from the dead.</hi> More plainely is this worke attributed to the <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power of the Father of glorie working in Christ, and raising him from the dead,</hi> Eph. 1.17.20. and to him <hi>at whose right hand hee sitteth:</hi> so Rom. 4.24. <hi>We beleeue in him which raised our Lord Iesus Christ from the dead. Obiect.</hi> But Christ raised himselfe, Ioh. 2.19. <hi>Destroie this Temple and in three daies I will raise it againe:</hi> and hereby was <hi>hee mightily declared to be the Sonne of God by raising himselfe from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1.14. In like manner is this resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his ascribed to the holy Ghost, Rom. 8.11. <hi>If the spirit of him which raised vp Christ, &amp;c.</hi> therefore the Father raised him not. <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is no contrarietie, the Father raised him, and hee raised himselfe. For 1. there is but one deitie of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, which is the common foundation of all their actions. 2. There is but one power common to them all three, and this is the power that Christ challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth he hath to lay downe his life and take it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. 3.

true and reall distinction of their persons: 2. in their inward proprieties, as to beget, to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and proceede: and 3. in their seuerall offices one to another, as to send, and to be sent: these three are <hi>one</hi> in nature and essence, <hi>one</hi> in power &amp; will, and <hi>one</hi> in the act of producing all such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as without themselues any of them is said to performe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> although here is no contrarietie, yet here is an order in the working or administration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the person to be obserued: for the Father as the first efficient in order, raiseth Christ as man, by the Sonne as a second efficient in order, and by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost as a third. For as it is in all the matter of creation, so is it in all the workes of redemption: they are ascribed vnto the Father especially; not because they agree not vnto the other two perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but because he after a peculiar manner worketh them, namely by the Son, and by the holy Ghost; but they not <hi>by him,</hi> but <hi>from him</hi>: and so neither this, or any other such place, where it is ascribed to the Father to raise his Sonne Iesus, must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, either as making Christ (as the Sonne) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in power to his Father, or as excluding his owne mightie power in raising himselfe; for they shewe onely the order of the persons, but make no inequalitie in essence, or power, or will, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> where the Sonne is said to be raised of the Father, it must not be vnderstood of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

of the Sonne, but in respect of his nature assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that is, his humanitie.

The <hi>latter</hi> is, that hee may not only make one offring for sinne (as those Preists did many) but that hee may alwaies liue to apply it (as they did not) and see that his people haue the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of it;<note place="margin">By dying Christ offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and by rising he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers.</note> not only before God for the appeasing of his wrath, but also for the purging <hi>of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences from dead workes to serue the liuing God:</hi> as the same Apostle noteth, Hebr. 9.14. and in the

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was necessarie hee should rise again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> because hee was so to die as that thereby hee must ouercome, yea and destroie death, which he had not done, if he had laine conquered of death still in the graue: yea more, he must so die as that he must giue <hi>eternall life to his sheepe,</hi>

But hence hath hee brought his Church strong consolation, in that beeing risen from the dead, hee hath fully ouercome death, satisfied for euery sinne of euery beleeuer, and risen from vnder all that waight of sinne and death which would haue oppressed vs for euer; yea euen himselfe, if hee had left one of our sinnes that beleeue in his name vnsatisfied for.</p>
            <p>Out of this that hath beene spoken, commeth to be answered that <hi>obiection,</hi> that seeing Christ by his death paid the price of sinne vnto God, what need we more of him, we can be but acquitted
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18746:98"/>
and discharged. <hi>Answ.</hi> The prouiding of the most soueraigne plaister is not enough to worke a cure, but the applying of it also. Neither was it sufficient for Christ to performe the former part of his priesthood, namely satisfaction for sinne, if he had not added the latter thereto, which is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it. This latter maketh the former ours, and comfortable vnto vs. And both these the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle affirmeth of Christ, Rom. 4.25. Christ was <hi>deliuered to death for our sinnes, and is risen againe for our iustification:</hi> where by iustification is meant by a Metonimie, the application of iustice.</p>
            <p>The second point propounded to be considered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> of in the rising of Christ, is the manner of it, which will appeare in three things: the 1. concerning his soule; the 2. his bodie; the 3. his whole huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie standing of both. <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>soule</hi> of Christ which on the crosse was separated from the bodie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> commended into the hands of his Father, and translated that same day into Paradise, was by the mightie power of God the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, brought backe into his dead body, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the graue: quickened it, and made it a liuing bodie, moouing and sensible in it selfe, and vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the selfe same <hi>bodie</hi> which was borne of the Virgin Mary, educated in Egypt and Galilie; which was apprehended, condemned, crucified and laid in the graue, came out of the graue a liuing bodie; God by the ministerie of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18746:99"/>
Angels remoouing all lets, loosing the bands and apparell of death from off his blessed bodie; by the earthquake tumbled away the stone that held him downe, droue away the souldiers for feare, who would haue assayed to haue killed him the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time if they had seene him rise: and so opened the graue, that all might see the bodie was gone.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the whole humanitie was raised <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> For 1. his <hi>bodie</hi> put off all such infirmities and passions as he pleased to make triall of for our sakes, that he might be a more merciful high Priest: such as are hunger, thirst, cold, wearinesse, paine, and death it selfe: and contrarily put on such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities as are fit for a glorified bodie; such as are agilitie, brightnesse, incorruption, immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Christus glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam corpori suo dedit, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uram non abstulit.</note> and the like. But here two rules must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; the former that none of these qualities are diuine properties: for although the deitie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally inhabiting this humane nature, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne it with all perfection of most excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, yet must they still be conceiued as finite and created accidents, which destroy not the nature of a bodie: they beautifie it, but deifie it not; they make it not omnipresent nor yet invisible, for then should it cease to be a bodie, and become a spirit to which onely these can agree. The latter rule is, that although Iesus Christ rose most glorified, yet did he still while he was vpon earth, vaile his maiestie, and shewed not himselfe in that perfect glorie, the degrees of which he was now entred
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18746:99"/>
into; not onely because he would reserue the full manifestation of it vntill the last iudgement, but also in regard of his disciples and faithfull ones, that they might be able to discouer the selfe same bodie, which they had formerly well knowne: and that his surpassing glorie should not hinder or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray them from that further familiar conuerse with him, whereby they (beeing to be his witnesses) might be confirmed and fitted to their testimonie, by seeing, hearing, yea and touching him. Hence was it that while he was on earth, after his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he would carrie the scars and prints of the speare and nayles, that they might put their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into them for their better discerning of him. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce also although he rose naked out of the graue, and left the cloathes behind him (for that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the state of a glorified bodie, which standeth no more in neede of cloathing for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie nor ornament, then Adam did in the state of innocencie) yet in respect of their infirmitie to whom he was to appeare, he vsed cloathes: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he needed neither meate nor drinke, yet for their sakes and ours, he ate and drunke, as we shall after see.</p>
            <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, as for the soule of our blessed Sauiour, it was beautified with such a measure of knowledge as excelled all creatures men or angels; euen such as was meet for such an head: the Godhead reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto it all things which either it would know, or in regard of his glorious office ought to know.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18746:100"/>
The like is to be said of righteousnesse, holinesse, and the rest of his graces: wherein he was set so farre aboue all creatures, as they all are not able to comprehend them: and yet in regard of God all of them finite as his soule it selfe is.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third point in this rising of Christ, is the <hi>fruit or benefits</hi> of it, which will appeare to be not so many as great, if we attentiuely consider, either 1. the euills that hereby he hath remooued, or 2. the good things he hath procured vnto his people. The former is manifest, in that hence all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mans saluation, are not onely vtterly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but made not onely not formidable and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, as before, but after a sort friendly, at least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall vnto beleeuers: the which point after wee haue a little cleared, we wil proceed to the second sort of benefits hence also accrewing.<note place="margin">Ioshuah a singular type of Christ, wherein.</note> Ioshua in leading the people, and putting them in possession of the land of Canaan, was in many things a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar type of Iesus Christ: As that he beginneth where Moses endeth; his calling was confirmed to him by the voice of God himselfe: the ende of his calling to guid the people to the promised land of Canaan: the destroying and casting out all the enemies that lifted vp hand against them: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding of the land according to their tribes, and so preparing after a sort to euery one his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: the establishing of lawes and ordinances to be obserued of all the subiects of that kingdome: the peoples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acknowledgment of him for their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18746:100"/>
their promise of franke obedience, and of subiecting themselues to whatsoeuer hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. In one word, the whole historie doth represent our true Ioshua or Iesus, who is the accomplisher of all Gods promises concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heauenly Canaan, and the leader of Gods people to true felicitie: but in no one action did this worthy Captaine of the Lords hostes, more liuely resemble the <hi>truth</hi> or true Ioshua, then when at one time in one caue hee slewe fiue Kings; who beeing deadly enemies against the people of God, made out a strong head, and vnited their forces to hinder their peaceable possession: For our Ioshua or Iesus, which is all one, went into the graue or caue where hee was buried, and there met with, and slew fiue mightie Tyrants, and came out a most glorious conquerer. The names of these fiue Kings, were 1. <hi>Sinne.</hi> 2. <hi>Death.</hi> 3. <hi>Hell.</hi> 4. <hi>Satan.</hi> 5. the <hi>World:</hi> ouer all whom Christ by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull resurrection most gloriously triumphed.</p>
            <p>The first of these enemies is <hi>Sinne:</hi> who had for euer raigned in vs to death,<note place="margin">The first eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie foyled by Christ is sinne.</note> and held vs vnder his power, if Christ had not broken his power by his resurrection.

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.17.</note> But it is plaine this enemie is foiled: for if the guilt of one sinne had remained vnabolished; and Christ had not paied the vttermost farthing, he had neuer risen againe.</p>
            <p>But against this wil be obiected, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18746:101"/>
Christs rising we see sinne rule and raigne in the most,<note place="margin">A great question an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered at large.</note> and hath as much dominion and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as it euer had or can haue: and if we looke at the best, they haue many sinnefull actions found in their hands, plainely arguing, that sinne moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and stirreth, and is not dead in them. How say wee then that Christ by his resurrection hath slaine it? <hi>Answ.</hi> We must here obserue a two-fold distinction, whereby we shall more easily loose this knot. First, of persons, some are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his bodie, and some, yea the most are not: some are sheepe, but the most are goates; some are in communion with him, as the science set and growing in the roote; but the most are out of fellowship with him, and are no otherwise knit vnto him then a science tyed to a tree by a thred; I meane by the slender thred of outward professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now as the head only imparteth of the life, sence, motion, protection, light and comfort which it hath, to the members of it owne bodie, and no other: euen so the head of this mysticall bodie, quickneth, mooueth, protecteth, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, graceth, saueth only such as are in true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him: for these sheepe only hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his life; for these hee rose againe; for these hee spoiled principalities and powers; for these hee slew hatred; yea not for these only, but in these also, and in these only. As for all the rest, hee praieth not for the world, namely, the wicked of the world; hee died much lesse for them; his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18746:101"/>
death killed none of their sinnes; but they are left in their sinnes, and vnto the raigne and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their sinnes, without all benefit either of the death of Christ, or of his resurrection. When we say then, that Christ killed sinne, we must be vnderstood (according to the Scriptures) only for, and in true beleeuers, who only can <hi>receiue of his fulnesse.</hi> The latter distinction concerneth sin; wherein wee must consider two things: 1. the <hi>guilt.</hi> 2. the <hi>corruption</hi> of it.<note place="margin">In beleeuers the whole guilt of sinne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hough not the whole corruption.</note> The whole <hi>guilt</hi> of sinne, is wholly and at once abolished to all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers by meanes of Christ his death and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not the whole corruption; which while they dwell in the bodie will dwell with them: yet so as they neither liue in it, nor it scarcely liue in them. For the former, the Apostle asketh this question, Rom. 6.2. <hi>How can we that are dead to sinne, liue in it?</hi> and hence it is that such as are in communion with Christ, are not only said to be dead, but <hi>buried also with Christ:</hi> and consequently they leaue their sinnes in his graue, euen as Christ himselfe left them there: where if they be left, there will be a rotting and consuming of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that they will be euery day lesse then other, euen as it is with the bodie that lyeth in the graue: and those which remaine yet vnmortified, they will be euen as dead carkases, lothsome and stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which aboue all things the godly desire to be couered. Now how impossible is it that these should be the practises of such as liue in sinne. Nay
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18746:102"/>
I say more, that all the corruption of sinne left in the godly, can scarcely be said to liue in them. I graunt indeede, some moouing and stirring of it in them,<note place="margin">All the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of sin in the elect is onely in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the life of it goe.</note> but it is such a motion as is in a beast which hath the throat cut: it strugleth and striueth in letting life goe: but the beast is killed, and the vncleane issues of sinne in the godly (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are many) are like such issues which come from a dead man, and are a very parting from them, rather then any argument of the life of sin, or of any delight in them. This is that which the Apostle aimeth at, Rom. 6.7. <hi>Hee that is dead, is freed from sinne:</hi> as the theefe once hanged, stealeth no more: so sinne once dead and executed in Christ, liueth no more in state or strength: the sinewes of this giant are cut, and what strength of motion can be in it. In a word, it is in beleeuers but dying sinne, sinne destroied: the whole hoast of sinne is discomfited, though some stragglers of the armie wander here and there as rebells in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans dominions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> enemie is <hi>death,</hi> which entred into the world by sinne,<note place="margin">The second enemie is death.</note> and went ouer all men in that all men had sinned, and standeth in full force and state by sinne whersoeuer it raigneth. Now Christ by remoouing the cause, hath also remooued the effect: for sinne beeing slaine, death is also swallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vp in victorie: he hath made his word good, <hi>O death, I will be thy death</hi>; who although he be the last enemie that shall be fully destroyed, yet hath
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18746:102"/>
he disarmed him, taken away his dart and sting from him, and so spoyled him, as he hath left him nothing to harme the elect withall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> enemie is <hi>hell,</hi> the gates of which was set wide open by sinne; for, <hi>In the day thou sinnest,</hi>

               <hi>thou shalt die the death,</hi> namely, the second death as well as the former. But Iesus Christ, by discending into hell, and suffering the sorrowes of the second death, loosed the same from himselfe, and all such as shall beleeue in his name vnto the worlds ende: Reu. 1.18. <hi>I was dead, but am aliue for euermore, Amen: and I haue the keyes of hell and death:</hi> which phrase seemeth to be borrowed from great commanders and conquerours, who hauing wonne and entred any citie, presently haue the keyes deliuered vnto them, in token of that regiment and authoritie which now of right belongeth vnto them; and plainely importeth, that howsoeuer Christ was once dead, yet by his death he hath vanquished hel and death, and so hath obtained full power and command ouer them both.</p>

And whereas they are as prone to pitch their tabernacles here belowe as others, God vseth these as meanes to keep his from being of the world, euen while they are in it. They conforme them to Iesus Christ their head, and traine them in the imitation of him, both in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and obedience. Now how could any of these parcells of Gods curse against the sinne of man, or mans cursed sinne it selfe, bring to any such sweete and profitable fruits, but by the ouerruling power of Iesus Christ, who bringeth life out of death, light out of darknesse; and who only can make his owne wise out of ranke poyson to sucke most sweete and soueraigne preseruatiues; which who doth not, hee neuer as yet knew the benefit of Christ his resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:18746:104"/>The second sort of blessings procured to the Church, by Christ his resurrection,<note place="margin">Christ by his resurrection not onely remooued e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, but procured all our good as appeareth by 3. instances.</note> is the fruition of good things which it putteth vs in possession of euen in this life by giuing vs our first fruits, and a sweete taste: but vpheapeth our measure after this life when our haruest commeth, and we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to feed fully at the supper of the lambe. The benefits which I will mention are three. First, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> are confirmed hereby in the whole truth of all our religion; the maine foundation of which laid by all the Prophets and Apostles is, that Iesus Christ the sonne of Marie, was the Sonne of God, the true Messias, perfect God and perfect man: and so indeed hee was such a one as hee was foretold to be: one that was to die, and yet saw no <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> one who must make his soule an <hi>offering</hi> for sinne, and yet <hi>must surviue to see his seede,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <hi>his daies:</hi> one that had power to <hi>laie downe his life,</hi> and power to <hi>take it vp againe.</hi> In a word, one that <hi>was put to death concerning the flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.18.</note> but <hi>was quickned in the spirit:</hi> that is, by vertue <hi>of his dietie,</hi> raysing that flesh vp againe. Let all the Iewes and Atheists in the earth dispise the indignitie of his death, we with the Angels will admire the glorie of his resurrection.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> benefit is, that hence we are assured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> that our 1. Iustification, 2. Sanctification, 3. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect saluation, is not only obteined, but applied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. For our <hi>iustification</hi> before God, by meanes of Christ his resurrection, hee brought into vs an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:18746:105"/>
euerlasting righteousnesse: in that hee not only bare our burden vpon himselfe, but bare it away from vs: for what is his resurrection else but his actuall absolution from our sinnes which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him, and for which he subiected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto the death: Whence we grow vp in full assurance, that the whole price is not only paid to the vttermost on Christs part, but that the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is accepted also on his Fathers, whose iustice would neuer haue absolued him, if all the bills and writings which were to be laid against vs, had not beene fastned to the crosse, and so cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and fully discharged: so as now we may with the Apostle, hold out a flagge of defiance, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our righteousnesse; for who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? <hi>It is God that iustifieth,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. From this resurrection of Christ issueth our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sanctification, which is our first resurrection or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of our soules from the death of sinne: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in euery reconciliation making must be two conditions. 1.

            <p>Thirdly, our perfect saluation is also hence ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assured vs; for if our Lord Iesus hath foyled all the powers of hell, death, and darkenesse in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, when he was yet dead; how much more doth he it for vs his members, beeing now aliue? if he could driue backe and disperse all spirituall enmities, euen when he was in hell it selfe after a sort,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.10.</note> how much more now beeing ascended <hi>farre aboue all mooueable and aspectible heauens?</hi> for we must not behold the victorie &amp; triumph of Christ, as performed onely in and for himselfe;<note place="margin">What or who shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate vs from the loue of God, seeing it is Christ that is dead or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther risen from the dead.</note> but as the ground and pledge of the victorie and conquest of all the beleeuers in the world. Looke vpon this sonne of <hi>Dauid</hi> prostrating the great <hi>Goliah</hi> of hell, for all the <hi>Israel</hi> of God; casting out the strong man, not onely out of his, but of our possessions,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18746:106"/>
that he might take vs vp for his owne vse; spoyling him of his kingdome and weapons, for vs, yea and in vs. And hence, as out of a well of consolation, we shall drawe this comfort to our selues, that looke as the gates of hel could not preuaile against him our head, no more shall they euer bee able to preuaile against vs his members, although they neuer so fiercely and forcibly assayle vs. And if spirituall enmities shall not be able to cut vs short of our saluation, much lesse shall temporall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: for by vertue of this resurrection also, euen in the most troublesome deepes, when the waues of sorrowes ouertake one another, and goe ouer our soules; when with Ionas we are readie to say, <hi>we are cast from the face of the Lord</hi>;<note place="margin">Ionah. 2.4.</note> euen then wee haue hope to rise out of such euills; and because our head is aboue, in short time comfortably to swimme out. Adde hereunto, that death it selfe, nor the graue shall stand betweene vs and home: for this rising of Christ is both the cause and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation that we shall rise againe: If the head be risen, so shal also the members: if Christ the first fruits of them that sleepe be raised, so shall also the whole bulke and bodie of beleeuers: if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Christ is risen <hi>from the dead, euen so them which sleepe in Iesus will God bring with him:</hi>

               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.11.</note> 
               <hi>then he that raised Christ from the dead shall also quicken our mortal bodies:</hi> for Christ hath not redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the soule alone from death, but the body also:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18746:106"/>
els had this second Adam bin inferiour to the first, if not able to saue by his rising al that which was lost by the fall of the former. Oh how would this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation well digested, sweeten the remembrance of death and the graue? when a Christian shall consider, that looke how it was with Christ when his soule and bodie were separated, yet both of them were vnited to the dietie, which brought them together againe: euen so I am taught by the Scriptures, that when my soule and bodie shall be separated, yet shall neither of them be sundred from Christ my head, but he will reunite them like louing friends that they may participate in his own glory.

            <p>The <hi>third</hi> benefit befalling vs by the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> of Christ is, that because Christ is risen, we know it shall not only goe well with vs, but with all the Church of God; the prosperitie of which, so many as would prosper must reioyce in; for hence it is that Christ calleth a church out of the world, which after a sort riseth euen out of his owne graue: hence is it that beeing ascended on high, hee gaue gifts to men, for the gathering and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of his Church: hence is it that the church shall alwaies haue the light of the Gospel, Pastors, Teachers, and the Ministrie, till we all meete to a perfect man: hence is it that this Church shall be defended from Wolues and Tyrants; seeing none
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18746:107"/>
is stronger then hee, nor able to plucke any of his sheepe out of his hands. Let the Church be pressed, it shall neuer be oppressed: Let the Kings of the earth band themselues and forces against it, the Lord hath set his Sonne vpon his holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and hee shall crush them like a potters vessel: Let Heretikes and Antechrist send armies of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs, Iesuites, and seducing vagrants to wast the Church, and bereaue it of the truth and light lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to life, they shall only seduce such as whose names are not written in the booke of life, and of the Lamb: for seeing Christ is risen, so long as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e (who can die no more) liueth, hee will preserue his darling; hee will send out the starres that are in his right hand for her releefe; who like Dauids worthies shall break through the hosts of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and bring the pure waters of the well of life: as we are for euer thankfully to acknowledge in those worthy restorers of our religion. Lastly, let floods of persecution rise and swell, so as this doue of Christ cannot find rest for the sole of her foot, one meanes or other Christ will vse for her helpe: for hee will either send her into the wildernesse, or the earth shall helpe the woman and drinke in the waters, that they shall not hurt her: or hee will prouide for her one of the chambers of his prouidence (as hee did for Ioash against the rage of Athaliah) wherein shee shall be safe till the storme be blowne ouer. These are the principall benefits procured vs by Christs resurrection,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18746:107"/>
which belong not vnto all, but only to such as are risen with him.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi>
               <note place="margin">How to know that we are risen with Christ.</note> How shall wee know that we are risen with Christ, that they may assuredly belong vnto vs? <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle setteth himselfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue this question, Coloss. 3.1. where he maketh the <hi>seeking of things aboue where Christ is,</hi> an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble marke of our rising with him; for as when Christ was risen, he minded not things below any more, but all his course was a preparation to his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, to which all things tended: so now if thou be risen with him, heauen will be in thine eye, and thine affections are ascended thither <hi>where Christ is:</hi> if Christ were on earth, thou mightest fix thy soule and senses here on earth, and yet be a Christian; but seeing he who is thy head is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, thou that art a member of him, must be there also.

               <note place="margin">Heauenly life discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by two notes.</note> There be two speciall notes to discerne this truth by: the former is the dissimilitude and opposition which it hath with the life of sinnefull naturall men vpon earth:<note place="margin">1. Dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with the life of sinnefull and naturall men.</note> the latter is the similitude and agreement it hath with the life of Saints and glorified men in heauen.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18746:108"/>
Concerning the former: the naturall man will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and pursue things which tend to a sensuall and naturall life;<note place="margin">1. In the matters of this life.</note> he will beate his braines for gold and siluer, meate and cloath, goods and lands for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his: as for heauen, he will haue nothing to doe there till he be dead, and for the way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he careth not to know it till he be dying at the soonest. But the spirituall man he coueteth after spirituall things; the power of Christs spirit where it is present, will lift vp his heart be it neuer so heauie, to seeke the kingdome and the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it: and he seeketh after the wisedome of God; as for gold and treasures, he accounteth of the graces of faith, loue, hope humilitie, and the feare of the Lord aboue all pearles and precious things; he prouideth for himselfe and his, the food that perisheth not, and thinketh himselfe warmely and comely arraied, when he hath put on the Lord Iesus Christ, as knowing, that onely the garment of this righteousnesse, can fence him from all the iniurie of wind and weather. The naturall man doth not more seriously listen after great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases of land and fields, as he doth cast with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to purchase the pearle hid in the field; for which he will sell himselfe, as we say, into his shirt; nay and further, his owne selfe, libertie, life, and if he had any thing dearer then that. As for the things of this life, if he haue them not, he wanteth not his portion: If he haue them, his care is that they haue not him, or become his portion: If ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18746:108"/>
increase, hee setteth not his heart vpon them. If they decrease, his heart faileth not with them. In abundance, hee carrieth himselfe warily and weanedly. In want, cheerefully and contentedly. The things he hath, hee vseth as not vsing them: the things he hath not, he knoweth he hath no good vse of them, or else hee should haue them. And thus as the naturall man bestirreth himselfe, and all his motion tendeth to the bettring of his outward estate at home; so contrarily doth an heauenly minded man (accounting himselfe from home while hee is heare in the bodie) bend his cheife care to settle his estate at home in heauen; and all his trading and conuerse in this straunge country tendeth to the enriching of him in his owne country. Further, if we looke to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mans course in the matter of his religion, we shall see as great difference betweene them.<note place="margin">2. In the matters of religion.</note> For it is cleare, that whereas matters of religion are a burthen to the one, they are the ioy of the other. The one as heauie to pray, to heare, to read and meditate on the word, and of his owne estate, as a beare to the stake: if law, or shame, or some such by-respect mooued him not, it were all one to him to be on his horse backe as in the Church: the other, would account his life tedious, were it not for these meetings of God and his people in the assemblies, and those sweet refreshments they bring backe from thence. The one, if hee pray sometimes in publicke, he maketh little conscience
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18746:109"/>
of priuate prayer in his family, and so of other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate duties, to which God and a good conscience would bind him as strait as to the former. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, walketh wisely and religiously in the midst of his house, and preserueth the worship of God at home, and maketh his house a little Church and house of God. The one, maketh little or no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of such sinnes, as either in comparison of other, or in his owne corrupt conceit, are smaller sinnes: such as are inferior oathes, idlenesse, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, sinnes of omission, idle words or hurtfull; vncleane or wandring thoughts: words hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to be but wind, if he meane no hurt; and if he meane hurt, but doe none, thoughts are free. As for the sinnes of the time, hee will not be so vndiscreete as to swimme against the streame; he is here violently carried without resistance into a gulfe of knowne euills, and all is well, he doth but as others doe, and it were worse for him if he did not: the other, maketh conscience of all sinne, lesser sinnes, and secret sinnes: hee can hate all, euen those which hee cannot auoid: he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the euill that himselfe doth, and willingly will not displease God though all men be therefore offended with him. To conclude this point, the one seeketh to approoue himselfe vnto man; the other to approoue his heart to God, because hee knoweth hee made it, and knoweth what is in it. And this shal serue for a tast of the opposite dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition betweene naturall, and spirituall life.</p>

Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which it hath with the life of the Saints in heauen in two things.</note> to discerne this heauenly life by, is the similitude or agreement which it hath with the life of the Saints in heauen. For the life of the Saints in heauen, must be a counterpaine of the beleeuers vpon earth, to which they must be daily framed in sundry regards. 1. In respect of the things they are called from. 2. In respect of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the things they are called vnto. 1. The Saints in heauen are called from three things. 1. the world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it selfe. 2. the corruptions that are in the world through lust. 3. The companie of the wicked of the world. Euen so must beleeuers in the world in their degree and measure, carrie themselues as those that are chosen out of the world, and such as are <hi>bought from the earth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 14.3.</note> medling no more with earthly things then needs must, enioying them so, as they ioy no more in them, then in things which are not their owne, but borrowed only for a time: vsing them so, as they abuse them not, because they are to be counteable for them;<note place="margin">VVhat the Saints are called from, in three things.</note> abiding in their earthly businesse and callings, so as they be neuer earthly minded: in one word, so desiring, pursuing, hauing, holding, and parting from the profits of this life, as those to whom God hath shewed better things, then any below; yea, and esteeming of their present life it selfe so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, as that they can account the day of their death better then the day wherein they were borne. 2. As the Saints in heauen, beeing deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the prison of the bodie, haue all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:18746:110"/>
bolts and chaines of their corruption struck off; so the godly who haue their parts in the first resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, haue after a sort changed their liues, and put on a <hi>diuine nature:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.4.</note> they haue bid farewell to the follies of their former times, yea renounce, and as farre as frailty will permit, loath their sinnes; saying vnto them, as Ephraim to his reiected I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, <hi>get you hence: what haue I to doe with you?</hi> they that were of the Synagogue of Satan, are now in the Temple with true beleeuers. Thus is it said of the 144000. that were bought from the earth, that they were not <hi>defiled with women,</hi> but were <hi>virgins,</hi> that is, sanctified in part, and washed from their filthinesse, and will haue no more fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship in the vnfruitfull workes of darknesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wherein sometimes they were cheife actors. 3. The Saints in heauen neuer ioyne with the wicked of the world any more; that beeing verefied, which Moses spake to the Isralites, concerning the Egyptians, <hi>The enemies whom your eyes haue seene this day, you shall neuer see more:</hi> euen so the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hate the companie of the wicked, with whom they can neither doe good, nor take any: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before their calling, they were mixt with them, and ran with them to the same riot of excesse. Now their fellowship is dissolued; they are no more companions with them; the light of the one admitteth no communion with the others darknes: and that they are often forced to dwell in Mesech with them, it is the woe and greefe of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18746:110"/>
their hearts.</p>
            <p>Another part of this agreement, standeth in the things to which the Saints are called,<note place="margin">What the Saints are called vnto in 5 things.</note> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are sundrie. As, 1. looke as their cheife happines standeth in the beholding of the face of God, and seeing him as he is, together with their reioycing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in his blessed communion, and that most sweete fellowship they haue one with an other; euen so the cheife blessednesse of the Saints in earth, is their fellowship with God and Christ, though it be not so immediate as the former. They see his backe parts indeede rather then his face, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce after a sort in his face, but a farre off; and as in a glasse of the word and Sacraments, not face to face, nor in that brightnesse wherein they shall behold him, when they are at home with him at his right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: but yet what they want in the thing, they want not in desire to be where he is, that they may see his glorie, so as they may be satisfied with the fulnesse of it; that they may so see him, as they may be like him; that they may drinke (not of the streames, but) of the well of life, and see light in his light. And because louing him that begat, they cannot but loue him that is begotten: the next happinesse to the former, doe the godly iustly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme the communion of Saints, placing vnder God their cheife delight in such as excell in vertue. Secondly, as the heauenly life of the Saints is spent in the perfect praise of God, wherein they employ their eternitie, keeping in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the throne
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18746:111"/>
of God a perpetuall Sabboth,<note place="margin">Rev. 11.17. and 7.15.</note> and seruing him day and night: euen so beleeuers indeauour in their measure, that the same mind be in them which was in Iesus Christ, who thought it as his meat and drinke to doe the will of his heauenly Father: they bring free will offerings: they esteeme one day better in his courts, then a thousand besides: and account these persons blessed that may dwell in his house, because they euer <hi>praise him.</hi> Not that much rebellion and corruption of nature, doth not often dead and dull euen the most sanctified; but yet something they get forward; and delight in the progresse they make to the cheerefull praise and worship of God. And this they doe, not by fits and starts, but imitate that heauenly life in the continual endeauour, to make the pleasing of God their principall delight, and the chiefe thing that most soliciteth them. Thirdly, as the Saints in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> heauen liue according to the lawe of perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, which is the law and charter of heauen, and haue obtained perfect sanctification: so belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers on earth set the same law before them, to rule and direct euery particular action by, and beginne the selfe same obedience: they beginne to waigh all they giue out or take in by the waights of the sanctuarie, which God hath sealed as iust: they follow the lambe whithersoeuer he goeth before them, whether by voice or example. Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as the Saints in heauen enioy God for the means of all their liues;<note place="margin">Rev. 22.35.</note> for he is their Temple, their light,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18746:111"/>
their tree of life, their Christall riuer, &amp;c. euen so the Saints in the world, though they liue by meanes, and must not looke to reape without sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as once it was, 2. King. 19.29. yet enioy they God aboue all meanes; and acknowledge that he is their life, and the length of their dayes; that they liue not by bread alone, but by euery word procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the mouth of God: that it is he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them power to get substance, and blesseth their children with increase: that he which cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth the lillies, and feedeth the sparrowes, will cloath and feed them: yea and more, that before they shall want that which is good for them, if all meanes should fayle, he would sustaine them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meanes by miracle: that his promise cannot faile them, when the Indian mines shall come to naught: that his word is meanes enough, which commandeh the rocke, and it giueth water; and the winds, and they blowe quailes before his host shall perish. Fiftly, as the Saints in heauen would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> not for all the world forgoe their happines for one day, and yet are they not now so fully happy, but that they still wait and long for further perfection of their glory, saying, <hi>Lord, how long, holy, and iust?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 6.10.</note> so the godly would not for all the world be separated from their estate in Christ. A cloud of Martyrs in all ages hath manifested, that all the world, the sweet of it nor the sower; the flatterie of it nor the tyrannie, could drawe the godly from the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of their priviledges in Christ. And yet dwel

How doe sinners combine themselues against God, to run to all excesse of riot? How vnpleasant and vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a voice is it, to call men to delight in God and his children? How heauie are they to the parts of his worship, comming vnto them, as if they went to some punishment? How are mens lusts become their lawes, in stead of the perfect rule and law of God? euery man almost liuing as Israel when their was no King among them. How doe men rest in the meanes of their welfare, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing their hearts from the author of it? How few prize the life of Christianitie, how many skorne it in themselues, and in others? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wish in their hearts there were no other life to come, and that they rather had good assurance of this which is present: and in stead of wishing and wayting, tremble at the mention of Christ his comming againe? Yet most of these men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christ: all of them baptized into his name; and all of them will be reputed as good Christians as the best. But all this forenamed course, hath no sauour or rellish of heauen; all that take it vp, <hi>minde nothing but earthly things</hi>; and <hi>the end of it,</hi> without timely repentance,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.19.</note>

            <p>The fourth generall point, is the <hi>time</hi> of Chists resurrection, set downe in the text to be the <hi>third
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18746:113"/>
day.</hi> To vnderstand which, we must knowe that Christ lay not in the graue three whole naturall dayes, each of them standing of 24. houres; for then he should haue laine 72. houres, and haue ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen also on the fourth day; whereas he lay not in the graue aboue 39. houres, and rise on the third. But the Scripture vseth a grace,<note place="margin">Synechdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.</note> or forme of speach, whereby two parts of dayes are called by the whole: and three dayes put for the time which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in three seuerall dayes; euery day hauing his night belonging vnto him. The first day of the three, saith <hi>Augustine,</hi> is to be reckoned by his latter part, in which Christ was dead and buried not passing three houres of the foure and twentie; yet so as both the night before when the Iewes day begunne, and the most of that day was spent in taking, examining, whipping, misusing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and executing him. The second day is to be accounted wholly and perfect, from the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the day before the passeouer, to the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Saboath following; standing of full 24. houres. The third day is to be accounted from the former part of it, beginning at the euening of the Iewish Saboath: for Christ lay all night neere twelue houres in the graue, and rose in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betime about the midst of that naturall day, standing of 24. houres. And thus is Christ truly said to haue risen the third day.</p>
            <p>Now that Christ should rise the third day, and no sooner, nor later, these reasons shew. 1. Hee
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18746:113"/>

The Scriptures had also further figured this distinct time in the type of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who hauing laid three daies and three nights in the bellie of the whale, was the third day cast on the drie land: as our Sauiour himselfe while hee was yet aliue, expounded of himselfe, Math. 12.40. <hi>As Ionas was in the bellie of the whale three daies and three nights, so shall the Sonne of man be three daies and three nights in the heart of the earth.</hi> 2. It pleased him not to rise sooner: hee would not presently come downe from the crosse, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> reuiue himselfe before hee was buried, nor rise presently after hee was laid downe, as hee easily could; because he would manifest that hee was truly dead: as also because hee would lead his Church into some suspense, therefore he rose not till the case seemed desperate: Luk. 24.21. <hi>We trusted that it had beene hee that should haue deliuered Israel: and as touching all these things, this is the third day that they were done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, hee would no longer deferre his rising.<note place="margin">VVhy hee would no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> 1. least he should vtterly haue endangered the faith of the Disciples, which in that short time was sore shaken; as not only the former example, but the heauinesse of the Disciples themselues to beleeue
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18746:114"/>
the newes of it, and the wilfulnesse of <hi>Thomas,</hi> plainely bewrayeth. 2. Because vpon this euent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and keeping touch in this very circumstance of time, he had laid all the credit of his person, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, doctrine, miracles, life and death. For when they come to aske him a signe to prooue himselfe the Messiah, he referreth them to this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent after his death: that when they had destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Temple of his bodie, if hee did raise it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after or before the third day, or did not on that day raise it, they should neuer take him for the Messiah. And of this verie circumstance <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> and <hi>men</hi> had taken notice from his owne mouth; Luk. 24.7. when the women came to the sepulchre to seeke Christ after he was newly risen, the Angels told them, hee was risen, he was not there: and further wisheth them to remember what he had said to them while he was with them, that the <hi>third day hee must rise againe:</hi> nay not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his freinds, but his verie enemies had got this by the end, and therefore came to Pilat, saying, sir, we remember that this deceiuer said, that hee <hi>would rise the third day:</hi> let vs take such order that the last error become not worse then the first. 3. The blessed bodie of Christ was not to enter into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the least or lowest degree of corruption, and therefore hee would lie no longer in the house of corruption. <hi>Quest.</hi> But how could his bodie be preserued so long, seeing Lazarus his bodie, and our bodies in that time enter into many degrees of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18746:114"/>
it. <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ was indeed balmed and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with odours: but all this could not haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued him, if his soule and bodie had not now beene freed from sinne, the mother of corruption. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But hee had sinne imputed vnto him. <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, but hee had ouercome all that, and slaine it on the crosse: for had he not destroied it, himselfe had beene destroied by it, and subdued for euer vnder the corruption of it. In all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, that is verefied which himselfe beeing risen, affirmed, Luk. 24.46. <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behooueth Christ to suffer, and to rise againe from the dead the third day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other things the Euangelists obserue in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance: as that it was the first day of the week; that is, the first day wherein he had created the heauens and the earth, and wherein he would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate now a new heauen, and a new earth; and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had set vp a meruailous frame of the world, but since exceedingly shaken and defaced by sinne, he would now restore the world againe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the ruins of it, by abolishing sinne: as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he had filled heauen and earth with the glorie of his power in creation; so would he now fill them with the glorie of his power in redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a second creation. Hence is it, that that day is now conuerted into the Christian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and called the Lords <hi>day,</hi> or if you wil, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; but not as the heathen, in honour of the sun;<note place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note> but as Christians, in honour of the the Sunne of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18746:115"/>
righteousnesse.<note place="margin">Christ rose early, and what we learne thence.</note> Againe, the Gospel noteth, that this our glorious Sunne, rose about sunne rising, earely in the morning, or a little before it, Matth. 28.1. To shewe vnto vs, 1. the power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who could while his bodie was dead, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the promise which he had made aliue, euen in the instant of which he had spoken. 2. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of his enemies, who although they wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him, sealed him vp, laid an heauie stone vpon him, were euery way cautelous to keepe him down till the third day was past, and he not stealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way secretly in the dead time of the night but rose with noise and warning, euen in the morning, yet could they no more stay him, then they could the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> sunne from rising and running his course. 3. The benefit which the world of beleeuers obtaine by his rising againe, set down by the Euangelist, Luk. 1.78. <hi>Through the tender mercie of our God, the day spring from an high hath visited vs</hi>; 79. <hi>To giue light to them that sit in darkenesse, and to guide our feete into the way of peace.</hi> The Chronologers further obserue, that this was the day wherein Moses lead the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites through the sea, wherein all the troupes of Pharaoh and his hoast were drowned: Euen so our Lord Iesus this third day, lead all the Israel of God out of the spirituall Egypt of blindnesse and filthinesse; but gloriously triumphed ouer all the bands of Satan, sinne, and death: all which were sunke like a stone into the bottomelesse pit of hell. Other obseruations concerning this day
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18746:115"/>
might be inserted out of authors, which, because I see no sound ground for them out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I will omit them, that I may now come to the lessons which out of this circumstance, wee may drawe for our further instruction.</p>
            <p>First, we learne hence, that all the promises of God shalbe in due season accomplished,<note place="margin">All the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mises of God are ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>complished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their due season.</note> whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer may seeme to come betweene them and vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For seeing Christ beeing dead, both could and did performe his promise to his Church, will not hee much more beeing aliue and in his glorie doe it? The Israelites had a promise of a good land: they must in the meane time suffer much oppression in Egypt, for the space of 430. yeares together: but the selfe same <hi>night</hi> when the tearme was expired,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.41.</note> they went out against the heart, and yet at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie of Pharaoh and his people. In like sort Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph had a dreame, that the Sunne and Moone, and the 12. starres should worship him: in the meane time he must be cast into the pit and dungeon, where he can see neither sunne, moone, nor starre: many dayes and yeares passed wherein he saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the cleane contrarie, &amp; yet in the due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it this dreame was accomplished. And the reason is, because, 1. God is true of his word, <hi>hee cannot lie,</hi> nor repent: and 2. he is able to fulfill whatsoeuer passeth from his mouth: for <hi>shall any thing be hard</hi> or impossible to God? or shall any power, or death, or the graue it selfe falsifie it? Leane thy selfe then vpon this truth of God: hast
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18746:116"/>
thou a promise of outward or inward peace, health, wealth, or any other good thing, which thy heart can wish? hold this promise fast in the midst of thy heart; wait for the accomplishment of it; it shall not faile thee so farre as thy Father seeth good for thee: if it be delaied and deferred, euen this also shall turne to thy best. Hast thou a promise of life euerlasting? hold it by the faith of thy soule as the ayme and end of all thy faith &amp; religion: for all the miseries of this present life shall not be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat thee of it. Hast thou the promise of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the bodie after death? sticke to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of thy faith also: nothing could hinder the rising of thy head, no more can let, but the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers shall be where the head is: not the graue, not fire, not water, not the bellyes of beasts or fishes, but they shall giue vp their dead, and further the accomplishment of the word of their Creator.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Lord denyeth not to helpe his children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee delay them till his owne due time be come.</note>The second obseruation is, that as the Lord of life raised not his Sonne as soone as he was dead, but he must lie in the graue two dayes, yea and the third also, till his case seemed desparate to the Disciples themselues: euen so may the members of Christ lie long in the graues of their miserie, yea, so long, as their case seemeth desperate; and all that while, the Lord not onely deferreth, but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to denie their helpe, and vtterly to neglect them. Abraham had the promise of a sonne by Sarah; he looked euery yeare for him, ten, twenty yeares together, nay till the thirtieth yeare, till it
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18746:116"/>
was not with Sarah as with childing-women, in so much as she laught when she heard it, the case in nature was desperate: who would haue thought but that God had forgotten his promise: which Abraham himselfe in all that time (if God had not shoared vp his faith) might haue forgotten: but though long first, yet at length the Lord found out a time fit enough to bring his word to passe. Dauid in like manner had the promise of the kingdome, but in the meane time hee was so traced and hunted by Saul, that he said in himselfe, <hi>I shall surely one day fall by the hands of Saul:</hi> but howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Lord still deferred his promise, he knewe not how to breake it: the kingdome was rent from Saul, and giuen to him that was better then he.</p>
            <p>Now the cheife reasons of this dealing of the Lords with his children, are these.<note place="margin">Why God delayeth to answer his children. Reasons.</note> 1. In Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes there is a seasonable time for all the graces which he giueth to be set on worke, such as are faith, patience, hope, prayer; all which cease in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the accomplishment. Secondly, he will haue his childrens case often desperate, that his owne hand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may be acknowledged in giuing them vnexpected deliuerance. How could Israel but acknowledge his outstreached arme in their deliuerie, when they saw nothing but the mountaines before them, the enemies behind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the sea as a wall on either side: and if the Lord had deliuered them before they came into the bottome of the sea (as he easily
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18746:117"/>
could haue done) the glorie of his worke had been obscured, which all ages since haue admired and extolled till this day. How did Ionah and the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites acknowledge the finger of God, in calling him to that ministerie, when as he seemed vtterly cast away, beeing buried in the whales belly three dayes and three nights? for when by the powerfull word of God, the fish was commanded to cast him on the drie ground, what a worthy fruit of conversion it had in them generally, the history doth declare. What great glorie the Lord wonne to himselfe by sauing Daniel (not from the den) but from the lyons teeth in the denne: and the three children (not from the furnace) but the verie fire in the furnace; it appeareth, in that the verie heathen Kings themselues made publike edicts, that no God, but Daniels, and no God but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drachs, &amp;c. should be worshipped through all their dominions, because no God could deliuer their worshippers as he had done. Thirdly, the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> often longer absenteth himselfe from his owne children, that when he is returned, they might make the more account of him; it pleaseth him to deale herein as a mother with her child, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though shee be tender enough ouer it, will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times get her out of sight, and behind a doore; in the meane time the child falleth and getteth some knocks, and all this to make the child perceiue it owne weakenesse, and depend vpon her so much the more. Example hereof we haue, Cantic. 3.4.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18746:117"/>
when the Church had sought her beloued in her bed, in the streetes, among the watchmen, and found him not, at last, after much seeking and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing after him, she findeth him whom her soule loued: then shee <hi>tooke hold on him, and would not let him goe, till shee had brought him to the house of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Tedious and heauie afflictions may not be an argument of Gods hatred. It is a simple o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of simple people, that God loueth not that man, who is exercised with any strange crosse, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if it be more lasting and lingring vpon him. Why dost thou not consider, ignorant man,<note place="margin">Lingring afflictions no signe of Gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</note> that the Lord suffered his owne welbeloued sonne to lie in the graue till the third day, before he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him vp? what sayest thou to the Israelites in Egypt, did they cease to be the people of God, or to be deare to God, when the heauiest taskes were laid vpon them? Whose blood was it that Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seh, made the streetes of Ierusalem runne with, but the <hi>Saints</hi>? In the persecutions of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, we read of thirty thousand of the deare Saints of God put to death in seuenteene dayes vnder the tyrant <hi>Maximinian,</hi> and as many cheined vnder mettalls and mines. Who was it that asked if the Lord would <hi>absent himselfe for euer,</hi> and whether <hi>his mercie was cleane gone for euermore?</hi> was not this the voice of Dauid, a man after Gods owne heart? wouldst thou heare the style of Gods children in the Scriptures? thou hearest them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            <p n="2">2. In tedious and heauie afflictions, and graues of miserie, prescribe not vnto God, neither the time, nor the manner of thy release; but leaue all to him, in whose hand, times and seasons, and meanes of deliuerance are.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1.

Neither needeth hee for the furthering of his kingdome the helpe or witnesse of the great ones in the world: for then would hee haue passed by the Scribes and Pharisies; the Doctors and great Rabbies, whose words would easily haue beene taken, and shewed himselfe to a few poore and abiect men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

            <p n="2">2. The time was now come wherein Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> was not to be knowne any <hi>longer according to the flesh:</hi> the world that had so knowne him before,<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. The wicked had made themselues vnworthy to see him any more: and this was a part of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> iust iudgement of God vpon them, who had so despighted him: they saw him once, and were sufficiently conuinced by the Scriptures, by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, his life, and his doctrine: all which because they despised, and wilfully thrust the kingdome of God from them, they are iustly left of God and Christ, and permitted to be further blinded, that they may vpheape the measure of their sinnes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for the godly, the Lord would not haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> their faith to depend vpon the witnesse of the eies and sight of the wicked and vngodly; but vpon a diuine testimonie, namely, vpon such as were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God for it: and this is a sure ground of faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If Christ had openly appeared to all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> people, hee had falsified his owne word, who had threatned them, that because when hee would

And perhappes (as some interpret it) all you who now reiect mee, as a vile person; wil then, but too late, and to no profit of your owne, either by force, or in imitation of the godly, acknowledge mee the blessed that commeth in the name of the Lord: and to this also maketh that, Math. 26.64. where giuing a reason of his confession to Pilat, that he was the Christ the Sonne of God; hee telleth them, that they shall hereafter <hi>see the Sonne of man</hi>; but not before hee be <hi>sitting at the right hand of the power of God, and comming in the cloudes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. It appeareth that many more of the Iewes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> were more convinced in their consciences, and pricked in their hearts for crucifying the Lord of glorie, by the preaching and ministerie of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; then they would haue beene by the sight of Christ himselfe.

Fourthly, there was the witnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the disciples and followers of Christ: and this was either <hi>priuate</hi> or <hi>publike.</hi> The priuate witnesse was of many priuate Christians, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, but women also who followed Christ, who also were by Christ vouchsafed to be the first prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of it euen vnto the Apostles themselues; as we read of Marie Magdalen, Marie the mother of Ioses, Salome, Ioanna, and diuerse others.

            <p>Now for the further clearing of this publike witnesse of the Apostles, wee will consider three things: 1. That these twelue were appointed by Christ himselfe to this witnesse; which the Apostle Peter plainly concludeth, Act. 1.22. where spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king of one to be elected into Iudas his roome, he saith, he must be chosen of <hi>one of them which haue companied with vs all the time that the Lord Iesus was conversant among vs, beginning at the baptisme of Iohn vnto the day that he was taken vp:</hi> implying, that whosoeuer was not thus qualified, he was not fit to be made such a publike witnesse with them of his resurrection: because to the making of an Apostle, was necessarie either an ordinarie conuerse with Christ vpon earth, or els an extraordinarie sight of him in heauen: by which latter, Paul, who made an honourable accesse to that number, pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued

And to confirme this truth of our Apostle, we read that not once or twice, but often, hee eat and drunke with his Disciples after hee arose from the dead: for hee did not only eat with six of his Disciples, as Ioh. 21.2. <hi>cùm</hi> 13. but with the two disciples with whom hee ioyned himselfe going to Emaus, Luk. 24.30. and with all the eleuen gathered together, Luk. 24.33. <hi>cùm</hi> 43.</p>

men, yet prooued them to haue had true bodies, which were assumed for the time of their message, and againe dissolued into their first nature, as also was the meate which they did eate: euen so our Sauiour Christ is prooued hereby after hee was dead, to haue a true, liuing organicall bodie, which is a sufficient proofe of his resurrection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our faith in that Article; especially seeing that it was the selfe same bodie that was laid in the graue, the testimonie of the Angels, the emptinesse of the graue, the prints of the nailes and speare, with many other euidences sufficiently confirme.</p>

For what is it that more confirmeth and strengtheneth our faith, then the boldnesse and libertie of the Apostles, both in their sermons and writings? and whence is this but from their owne full perswasion of the truth, which maketh them bold? and whence is this perswasion, but from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sense and vndoubted knowledge, arising from their familiar conuerse with him after his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18746:131"/>
same to all the world; thy faith must be as fully assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as if thine owne eyes had seene him, thine owne hands handled him, and thy selfe had sit with him at the table while he eate and drunke among them: yea so often as thou hearest, or readest, or thinkest of any of these things; so often must thou be renewing and adding something to thy faith in this behalfe; as euery new apparition or manifestation of Christ, added something to the faith of his Apostles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that our Lord after he was gloriously rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the dead, would still for those fortie dayes depart from his glory, abasing himselfe to conuerse with sinfull men; yea to eate and drink corruptible creatures; of which his incorruptible bodie had no neede: and would still humble himselfe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to the weakenesse of his Church: we are to learne the same lesson towards our brethren, to be of a yeelding disposition, readie to depart with some of our right for their good and edification; and carrie our selues as weake to the weake, and become all things to all men, to saue some.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 42.</hi> And hee commanded vs to preach vnto the people, and to testifie that he is ordained of God a Iudge of quicke and dead.</q>
            <p>A third argument to prooue that Christ is ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the dead, and so is indeed the true Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, and Lord of his Church is, that he gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and commandement to his Apostles to become Preachers &amp; witnesses, as of other points,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18746:131"/>
so especially of this; that howsoeuer he was adiudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death according to that iudgement execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and laid as one foyled by death for the space of three dayes, yet he is now gloriously raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and appointed of God the Iudge of all that euer haue liued, doe, or shall liue to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>In the verse wee haue three things to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. 1. that preaching is a reuerent and necessarie ordinance of Christ himselfe, <hi>And he commanded vs to preach vnto the people, and to testifie.</hi> 2. The obiect of this ordinance, or what we must preach, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Christ, that hee is, &amp;c.</hi> 3. What particular do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrine concerning Christ must more especially be preached, that he is <hi>ordeined of God a iudge of quicke and dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first of these, are two branches to be cleared. 1. That preaching is the ordinance of Christ. 2. The necessitie, which will easily be deduced from the former. That Christ instituted this holy ordinance, is plaine, Matth. 28.19. <hi>Goe preach to all nations, baptising them, &amp;c.</hi> the which commission, that it was extended beyond their persons, to such as should in after ages succeed them, appeareth by his last words, <hi>and behold, I am with you to the end of the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preaching the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Christ.</note> And that the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie teachers are no lesse the gift of Christ then the Apostles themselues, is as plaine, Ephes. 4.11. he therefore <hi>gaue some to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Euangelists, some Pastors, and some Teachers.</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:18746:132"/>
Neither must this trouble vs, that both in this place alleadged, as also in some other it is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Father, to send and giue <hi>Pastors according to his owne heart:</hi> and sometime to the holy Ghost, Act. 20.28.<note place="margin">Ier. 3.15. &amp; 25.4.</note> 
               <hi>Take heede to your selues, and the flocke ouer which the holy Ghost hath made you ouerseers:</hi> 1. Cor. 12.11. and <hi>all these things worketh euen the selfe same spirit, distributing to euery man seuerally euen as he wil</hi> For, 1. all these externall workes are common to all the three persons: and where any one of them are named in any action done without themselues, no one of them is excluded, but all the three must be included. 2. The diuinitie of Christ is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely prooued, in that the same glorious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Father, and the holy Ghost, are ascribed also vnto him, as from heauen whither he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to giue seuerall gifts for the worke of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie. 3. That wee might better instruct our selues, in their seuerall order and manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the selfe same action: for the Father is the fountaine, and the first author of all these gifts; the Sonne properly is the distributer and giuer: for the Father worketh all in vs by the Sonne, and both of them by the communication of the blessed spirit: euen as the sunne by his beames sendeth light, and heat vnto the inferiour creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But this ordinance of preaching, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to be Christs, because it was long before his incarnation; and nowe remaineth after his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, when he cannot call men as he called the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18746:132"/>
Apostles while hee was on earth. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Ministrie of the Gospel, in the proper acception of it, hath two things to be considered. First, the <hi>beeing</hi> of it: Secondly, the <hi>vertue</hi> and efficacie of it. The beeing of it (as it was the Ministerie of the new Testament, wherein glad tydings were published to all nations) was temporarie; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the time of Christ, and shall haue end with the world: yet can it be called no new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, because the summe and substance of it, was (though more obscurely) deliuered to Adam, and the Fathers of the old Testament. But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the vertue and efficacie of it,<note place="margin">Reu. 14.6.</note> it is an <hi>eternall Gospel</hi> during from the beginning of the world to all eternitie. Now therefore will it not follow, that because it was before his incarnation, it was not his; but rather therefore it was his, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Abraham was, the cheife Prophet of his Church, that raised, according to the seuerall ages of his Church, such men as were fit, either more obscurely, as before his comming (when rather some Evangelicall promises of things to come were preached then the Gospel it selfe, or else more manifestly to preach and open the misteries of the kingdome of God. And this latter kind of preaching, was not before his incarnation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it fully setled before hee ascended into heauen, and from thence gaue gifts to men; that thereby hee might shew himselfe a carefull head and <hi>gouernour</hi> of his Church, euen then when hee
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18746:133"/>
was set downe at the right hand of his Father. It is true indeed that before Christs suffring, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Apostles, instructed and furnished them with many gifts of the spirit; yea, and these gifts were increased very much after his resurrection, whereby they were more confirmed in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleship; and although they did before Christs death, exercise the office of Apostleship in Iudea amongst the lost sheepe of the house of Israel, yet had they not receiued that <hi>fulnesse of the spirit, and power from aboue,</hi> which was necessarie to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, before they had receiued in visible forme of fierie tongues, the spirit in abundant measure: whereby they were before all the people of the world, after a sort, solemnly inaugurated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be the Apostles of Iesus Christ: neither had they, till after Christs resurrection, receiued this commandement (of which our Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) <hi>To preach to all nations, and to euery creature vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen:</hi> the practise of which commandement they tooke vp after that (they hauing staied at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem for the promise) the spirit came vpon them,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.49.</note> and they were endued <hi>with power from on high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the second branch of the obiection, that because ordinarie Pastors and teachers are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly called by Christ, beeing now in heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore they are not ordained by him, it is false: for of the Pastors and elders of Ephesus is said, that the holy Ghost <hi>made them ouer seers:</hi> and Paul
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18746:133"/>
accounteth Apollos ordained by Christ as well as himselfe, 1. Cor. 3.5. <hi>What is Paul, and who is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos, but the Ministers by whom yee beleeue?</hi> and, <hi>as the Lord gaue to euery man?</hi> only the difference must be obserued in their calling; both are called of Christ, but the Apostle by himselfe immediatly, not by men: the ordinarie Pastor called of him by the Ministerie of man. I call it a Ministrie, because the whole power and authoritie of the Church in calling Ministers, is but a seruice vnto Christ; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing, declaring, and testifying to the Church those whom Christ hath called. And therefore both before his incarnation a long time, and after his ascension also, the exhortation which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced vpon beleeuers turne in this tenor, to day <hi>if yee heare his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 95.7. Hebr. 3.7.</note> Whence we conclude, that <hi>his voice</hi> hath ouer sounded in the Church, and so shall doe in the ministrie of his seruants,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.16.</note> vntill his comming againe to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: hee that heareth them, heareth him; hee that receiueth them, receiueth him; hee that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them, refuseth him: hee by his seruants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth men to be reconciled; by them hee bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and looseth, saueth and destroieth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the necessitie of this ordinance,<note place="margin">Necessitie of preaching evinced by foure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> can any denie it who seeth the Sonne of God so carefull before his death, after his resurrection and ascension also into heauen, to furnish and fit with an extraordinarie measure of the spirit, Apostles and Apostolike men, for the founding of the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18746:134"/>
Church of the new Testament; and not only so, but now sitting in his glorie at the right hand of his Father, is mindfull of his promise, and is with his Church to raise vp successiuely faithfull Pastors and teachers, gracing them with varietie of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts; and blessing those gifts for the building vp, and repairing of his bodie, and the gathering of the Saints: of whom, as of liuing stones, is reared a spirituall house or temple fit for his owne vse. But because most men are willingly ignorant of this necessitie of preaching, I will a little inlarge it by some reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider the condition of those that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuerted,<note place="margin">In regard of the vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and it will appeare necessarie for them. No man was euer saued, while he was in his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blindnesse, no vnbeleeuer could euer get with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the gates of the holy Citie: no hard hearted or impenitent person, could euer, so remaining, see the life of God. Neither was euer any man ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily drawne out of this fearefull estate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but by the word of God preached; which is the light to the blind eyes, the ground of faith: <hi>for how can they beleeue, except they heare?</hi> and the <hi>hammer</hi> of the Lord to breake asunder the hardest stones in mens hearts.<note place="margin">Ier. 23.29.</note> Who were euer begotten to God, without this <hi>immortall seede,</hi> and these spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Fathers? who euer became <hi>liuing stones</hi> in the building, without the hewing and polishing of <hi>Gods builders?</hi> what <hi>harvest</hi> was euer brought into God, without these <hi>labourers?</hi> what soule was euer
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18746:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>pulled out of the kingdome of darkenesse,</hi> and brought to be a member of Gods kingdome, but by this meanes? The word in this ordinance is called the <hi>Gospel of the kingdome of God,</hi> that is, whereby men attaine both the parts of Gods kingdome:<note place="margin">Mark. 1.14.</note> both that of grace here in this life, and that of glorie in the life to come: from which effects it is called, 1. the word of grace, Act. 20.32. 2. the Gospell of glorie, 1. Tim. 1.11. also the <hi>word of reconciliation,</hi> because hereby sinners are reconciled to God:<note place="margin">Eph. 1.13. &amp; 6.15.</note> the word <hi>of life,</hi> because it quickneth the dead in sinne: the <hi>Gospel of peace,</hi> because it alone pacifieth the conscience, and setleth it in the peace of God: to conclude, <hi>The good word,</hi> because it onely reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.5.</note> who procureth all good vnto belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. Who seeth not then the necessitie of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, seeing none are added to the Church without it, Act. 2.41. no spirituall life can be preserued without this feeding, Act. 20. <hi>no Saints are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor no bodie of Christ built vp without Pastors and Teachers, Ephes.</hi> 4.11, 12. And it pleased not God by any other meanes, but by the foolishnesse of preaching, to saue such as beleeue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we consider those that are called to knowledge and faith, it will appeare also a most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> necessarie ordinance in regard of them. For,<note place="margin">In regard of the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 1. seeing a man cannot safely and comfortably passe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> through any part of the day, without the light, strength and comfort of the Scriptures, it pleased the Lord to set vp this publike ministerie in his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18746:135"/>
Church, that euen beleeuers themselues by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Scriptures daily explained, obscure places opened by those which are clearer, and figuratiue speaches cleared by the proper; might attaine not onely to a clearer vnderstanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but also to haue them printed in their minds and memories, so as they might be able to drawe them into continuall vse. 2. Euen the best haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> nature in them, and their daily faylings; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daily repaire, growe weake in faith, wearie of wel-doing, and vnfruitfull in the worke of the Lord. And therefore though they should not need to come to increase their knowledge, yet haue they neede to heare their faults controlled, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked vnto dutie, to be confirmed in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to be strengthened in their faith, reformed in their liues, comforted in their troubles, and spurred to bring every thing to vse and practise; and therefore the best may be still disciples and learners in the schoole of Christ. 3. The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> &amp; fellowship of the members of the Church, is excellently hereby maintained and preserued: not onely by communication of gitfs and graces, while some teach and some learne, but also while it is a meane to hold them all of a minde; whereas without this publike ministerie, if euery one were left to his priuate sense and reading, it could not but breed corrupt and priuate opinions, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing of mindes and affections. And this speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al benefit of this publike ordinance the Apostle ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18746:135"/>
at, Eph. 4.13. <hi>Till we all meete together in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the faith, and knowledge of the sonne of God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect man,</hi> implying, that the scope of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, is to bring and preserue all the members of the Church in this vnitie of faith and knowledg; which in this world it cannot doe, but so soone as it hath done this, it selfe shall cease, namely, in the life to come. He must needes be wilfully blind, that espieth not very great necessitie of the word preached, for the strengthning of those <hi>ioynts</hi> and <hi>bands,</hi> whereby beleeuers are knit both vnto the head, as also vnto the members.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the necessitie of this ordinance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in that the deuil and wicked of the world,<note place="margin">From the opposition of the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hence is it, that he stirreth vp Iannes and Iambres, and all the rable of Egypts inchanters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Moses; and setteth all his power against him to prooue him a counterfait. Hence is it that hee will not want a Pashur to smite Ieremie, nor an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah to doe as much to Amos. Hence raised he vp many armyes against Paul; Elymas &amp; Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Hymeneus and Philetus, Diotrephes and Demas, and from his mouth he casts out floods of reproachfull and virulent slanders against him; that he is a pestilent and seditious fellow; that hee speaketh against the law, and against the Temple, away with such a fellow, it is not fit that he shoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:18746:136"/>
liue. And hath the deuill growne any whit more calme, or can hee digest Pauls preaching better since Pauls time? no sure, he is no changling, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept because his time is shorter, his malice be stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more raging; I wish Gods faithfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters euerie where found it otherwise. But to omit other proofes, obserue generally the voice of the multitude. Where there is no preacher, but some poore creature to serue, as they say, or starue them rather; it is wonderfull how well people thinke themselues with him: he shall be commended and defended, for a verie honest peaceable man, or for a verie good fellow, that will beare his neighbours companie, they could not haue a better; and for all he cannot preach, a worse (they feare) will come when he is gone. But whose voice is this? and is not the hand of the deuill in all this? Well, on the contrary, where there is by Gods mercy a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and faithfull Minister, that preacheth constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conscionably; how goeth the crie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon voice of people vpon him: we haue one that preacheth indeede often, and (perhaps) is a good scholler; but he is verie vnpeaceable, a reproouer of euery man, a spyfault, he hath made such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in our parish since he came, that we wish he had neuer come amongst vs; we were quiet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and held peace and neighbourhood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came. And thus he is counted, as Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, a man that <hi>striueth with the whole earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the necessitie appeareth by common
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18746:136"/>
experience, if we compare the people, who haue had the Ministrie planted amongst them,<note place="margin">The same prooued by experience.</note> with those who haue it not. In the one, what shall a man sooner meet with, then wofull ignorance, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish opinions, superstitious practises, heathnish conuersation? they liue as men without God in the world: or, as if the old Sodomites were aliue againe. But in the other, by Gods mercie some seale of the Ministrie you shall meete withall; some men of knowledge, of conscience, and out of conscience performing duties in publicke, and in priuate; in the house of God, and in their owne houses; you shall heare godly and gracious speach in their mouthes, see good example in their liues, holy desires and endeauours to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Iesus Christ. And whence is this difference, but from the presence or absence of this ordinance, and Gods blessing attending or departing from it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. The Ministers of Christ must vrge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselues this selfe same commandement,<note place="margin">Ministers must vrge themselues to diligence by this nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.</note> to prouoke themselues to diligence in preaching: for it layeth necessitie vpon them, and woe vnto that Minister that preacheth not the Gospel. A la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing is it to see how little either this commandement, or the denunciation of this fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full woe preuaileth with many: but some are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vp with Demas, to embrace this present world; some giue vp themselues to idlenesse, and voluptuousnesse of life; some to ambition, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18746:137"/>
further preferments; some to pollicie, and state matters; and very few only to faithfull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching. Thus this commandement of Christ is generally forgotten, the sheep and lambs of Christ vnfed and forsaken, the kingdome of Christ vnbuilded and vnrepaired, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power of sinne generally standeth in the state of it vnshaken in the hearts of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We see hence what little need we haue of a dumb, or blind Ministerie; vnlesse there be need of breaking so expresse a commandement of Iesus Christ, who sealeth no mans commission, but to preach to his people. What need is there of wells without water,<note place="margin">No need of a dumb or blind Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ needed not to haue ascended to send men without gifts; hee sendeth no messenger without a message, no steward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his prouision, no Captaine without weapons, no watchman without eyes: this were a folly which the wisedome and weaknesse of man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brooke: but hee sendeth <hi>an interpreter,</hi> the learned tongue, the prompt Scribe in the law of the Lord; such as are mightie in the Scriptures, and are stored with things new and old. Let vs not implead the wisedome of the Sonne of God, and say, where shall we haue such store of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for our seuerall parrishes? If we want them, the salt is our owne, and not Gods; who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen meanes, men, and maintenance inough; if all
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18746:137"/>
these were wisely and thankfully disposed to his glorie, and the seruice of the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This doctrine must be applied also to the more ignorant sort of men, who neuer as yet came to see the absolute necessitie of this ordinance of preaching: as witnesse,<note place="margin">Few men see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now would I aske of these, was it the abundance of Mannah, the Angels food, that was the fault, or their wicked loathing of it? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so is it the commonnes of the word, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the wicked contemne it, (for the hungrie soule of the godly would neuer despise it, if it were ten times more common) or rather because they see not the worth, nor tast the swetnesse of it? dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise we the sunne because it riseth daily and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all the day long vpon vs? or the ayre which we breath in euery moment? or doth the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and common vse of the bread vpon our tables, bring bread out of request with vs? No, we see the necessitie that without the Sunne, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our daily bread, and without the ayre we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue. And did we see also as clearly that where vision fayleth, people perish: wee should change with our mindes our note; and highly blesse God for the commonnesse of it, as we doe in the other: and sure I am that either the Apostle Paul did not feare this inconvenience, or else he ouersawe it, when hee enioyned the Ministers to preach <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, both in season and out of season.</hi> Others say the world was better when there was lesse preaching, and thence conclude, that it is far worse now, because there is more: which though it be a rude fallacy scarse worthy answer, as putting that to bee a cause of mens wickednesse which is

not, yet something must be said vnto it; and fooles must be answered in their follie, least they be wise in their owne conceit. Let these men bethinke themselues, and then tell vs whether the holy Gospel (beeing the power and arme of God to saue euery beleeuer, the glad tidings of saluation and word of life) can make the world worse then it is. For if that be the vse of it, our blessed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was farre ouerseene to leaue his glorie of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to take our flesh, and in it to submit himselfe to the obedience of the whole lawe; and to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the whole curse of it for our disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; if by all this he leaue the world, or make the world worse then he found it. How shal it be true that is written of him, that the <hi>Sonne of man came not to destroy, but to seeke and saue that which was lost,</hi> if the preaching of him make the world worse then it was? we will easily graunt that the Gospel, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great light, it daily discouereth that corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and darkenesse which before lay hid; as the sun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing manifesteth all those things which were wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp in the darkenes of the night. But to say that sinne is the more, because it is more seene by the light of the Gospel, is a fancie: or if sinne it selfe in these dayes of the Gospel by the multiplication of people be multiplied; shall we say the gospel is the cause, or rather the malice of men, who peruert it to their owne destruction, taking occasion by it to turne the grace of God into wantonnesse? Let not vs therefore looke (as the olde idolaters in

            <p>Many other allegations of simple people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this ordinance I might alleadge, but they are well met withall by some others; and my selfe haue elsewhere answered many of them,<note place="margin">Beauties of Bethel.</note> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore referring the reader thither, I content my selfe with these fewe for the present: and conclude this point with this exhortation to these poore seduced people: that considering the strait charge and commandement that lyeth vpon vs to preach in season, and out of season, they would be willing to picke out their dutie therein implyed; which is to be diligent, yea <hi>swift to heare,</hi> to attend as earnest suiters at the gates of wisedome, for their owne good; to lay vp instruction as they would treasure gold, and to call after the wisedome of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in this ordinance, without which neuer was any made wise to saluation. And let them further
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18746:139"/>
know, that (seeing God doth not extraordinarily saue men, where the ordinarie meanes are affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or offered) the neglect of this meanes is to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spise <hi>great saluation</hi>; and to make themselues <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of life eternall.</hi> And from the euidence of truth I avouch against euery soule, that turneth his eare from hearing the word preached; that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth the pardon of the king of heauen, he rufu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth life &amp; saluation offred; he chooseth death, and forsaketh his owne mercie:<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.27.</note> he is no sheepe of Christ, for then would be heare his voice;<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.47.</note> and if he were borne of God, he would heare the words of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>obiect</hi> of this ordinance, or what we must preach, and that is <hi>Christ.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What is it to preach Christ? <hi>Answ.</hi> It standeth in two things.<note place="margin">To preach Christ wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it standeth</note> 1. In plaine manner to teach the doctrine of Christ, concerning his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his natures, his offices, and the execution of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them from his incarnation to his ascension. 2. In powerful manner so to apply this doctrine to euery hearer, that euery one may feele a change to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, both in his heart and life. For to teach only the Historie of Christ his doctrine, his miracles, his life, his death, is not the full teaching of Christ: for thus the vnbeleeuing Iewes know Christ; and the Infidell Turkes can easily come to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him. But to teach Christ as the <hi>truth is in Christ,</hi> is to apply euery particular to the heart of a sinner, that he may be framed to conuersion and repentance; which is the most difficult labour of the ministerie, and most to be striuen in. Many teachers who can choose hard texts, and make lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned discourses, and shewe much dexteritie of wit, reading and humane literature, haue not thus lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christ themselues, nor can after such a liuely manner teach him to others. And pitty it is to see that whereas so great an Apostle as Paul, who wanted not Arts, tongues, and humane learning, desired to knowe nothing but Christ, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified among the Corinths themselues: it should
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18746:140"/>
be the studie of many men to shew the knowledge of any thing rather then of Christ; and how they may paint out themselues rather then Christ in their preaching. Is not the end of preaching to <hi>make Disciples of Christ?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 28. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> was it instituted to please the eare, or to pricke and pearce the heart? Let the minister therefore striue to ransacke the hearts of men with whom hee is to deale; that discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their secret things they may fall downe and say, God is in him indeed. Let him thinke hee hath spoken the word of Christ; when hee hath both taught him, and led his hearers vnto him. And this will not be done but by the <hi>plainnesse of words, and euidence of the spirit.</hi> It is thought a reproach to preach a plaine sermon; whereas indeed, that is the best sermon which teacheth Christ most plainely. 1. By true interpretation of Scripture. 2. By wholesome sauorie and proper doctrine ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thence. 3. By sound application of that doctrine for the information of mens iudgements, and reformation of their liues: where Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified is thus held out, there need no wooden Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges nor pictures, nor the reall sacrifice of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable Masse, to put men in mind of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hearers may hence learne to iudge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, whether they haue heard aright or no. And then haue you heard well, when you not only know that which you did not before, but when you beleeue more, loue more, hope more, and are more changed then before. When you find our
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:18746:141"/>
sermons as the glasse wherein you see and discerne the true estate of your soules; when you are cast into the forme of this doctrine; when your lusts stoope and yeeld to this scepter of Christ: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this no knowledge is sauing; but all our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and your hearing tendeth to damnation: <hi>if yee knowe these things, blessed are yee if yee doe them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The third point is, what is the particular do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which the Apostles,<note place="margin">The Apostles commanded in speciall to teach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> and wee in them are so straitly enioyned to preach: and that is, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Christs comming againe to iudge the quick and the dead. And surely it is not without reason, that our Sauiour should wish them to insist in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> doctrine, aboue others. 1. Because this beeing the last worke of Christ remaining to be done after his ascension, it could not be so easily beleeued as those things which were alreadie done and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, beeing still in fresh memorie; and so much the lesse deniable, by how much they were still fixed euen in the sences of all those who were eye-witnesses of the same. And therefore hee would haue his Apostles carefull to helpe the weaknesse of mens faith, in the expectation of his returne to iudgement, by much and often bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon it, as a point that needeth more instance and perswasion, then such as (beeing past, and so sencibly confirmed by many hundreths and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands as they were) are farre more easily apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and beleeued. 2. The Scriptures teach that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18746:141"/>
the remembrance of this iudgement to come, is a notable meanes to quicken the godly in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to worke in them a reuerent feare, and shake out securitie, which breedeth hardnesse of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore did the Apostle Paul,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.11.</note> 
               <hi>considering the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Lord,</hi> prouoke both himselfe and others vnto their dutie: and no meruaile, seeing the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, haue euen at the consideration of more particular iudgements, beene stricken with the feare of the Almightie. The Prophet Abacuk when hee heard but of iudgements to come, saith, <hi>that his bellie trembled, his lippes shooke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Habac. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse entred into his bones.</hi> And Dauid, beeing a noble King, hath these words,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.120.</note> 
               <hi>my flesh trembleth for feare of thee, and I am afraid of thy iudgements.</hi> A speciall example whereof, we haue in that famous Preacher of righteousnesse, <hi>Noah,</hi> of whom it is recorded,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> that beeing warned by God of the flood to come an hundreth and twentie yeares after, he was mooued with a reuerent feare of God to make the Arke. And as Noah was by hearing of the waters, so the seruants of God hearing of fire, wherewith the world shall once againe be destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ought to be, and are mooued with a reuerent feare of God, which is as a steele spurre to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them to their dutie. 3. The Scriptures make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the contempt of this day of iudgement, the ground of all sinnes, and of the destruction of vngodly ones. For as it was in the daies of Noah, so shall it be in the daie of the Sonne of man: they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18746:142"/>
neuer dreamed of the iudgement, before it came, and so perished in it; so men eate and drinke, marrie, and giue in marriage, till the day come vpon them as a snare, and they taken as a bird in an euill net. What was the cause that the euill seruant sate him downe with drunkards, and rose vp to beate his fellow seruants, but because he said with himselfe, my master will still deferre his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. In all which regards, neither the Apostles, nor we the ordinarie Ministers succeeding them, can want good reason to stirre vp our selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by the often and diligent propounding and applying of this holy doctrine of Christ his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againe to iudgement.</p>
            <p>The verse containeth two things: 1. Christ his appointment to this office, <hi>that he is ordained of God.</hi> 2. the execution of it, <hi>a Iudge of the quicke and dead.</hi> Touching the former, it will be asked, how God could ordaine Christ a Iudge,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.9. Ioh. 16.8. How Christ is ordained a Iudge, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost iudge also.</note> seeing that both the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> iudge as well as he? <hi>An.</hi> In the last iudgement must be considered, 1. the decree of iudging. 2. the authoritie, or iudiciary power. 3. the externall and visible act, or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iudgement. Now in regard of the two former, all the three blessed persons, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost concurre, as hauing an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall decree of iudging, an equall authoritie and iudiciarie power, an equall dominion ouer all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and an equall consent in the iudging of them. But in regard of the third, the visible iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18746:142"/>
act, Christ is the Iudge and that according to both his natures, the godhead, and manhood: and yet both of them herein retaining their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. Thus is <hi>Christ ordained of God a Iudge:</hi> and thus is it said, that the Father <hi>iudgeth no man,</hi>

               <hi>but hath committed all iudgement to the Sonne.</hi> Where by <hi>iudgement,</hi> must be meant the administration of iudgement: for so the Euangelist expoundeth it in the 27. verse of the same chapter, where he saith, that the Father <hi>hath giuen him power to execute iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And by committing it vnto the Sonne,<note place="margin">

For all that power of iudging which is in God by nature, shall be in Christ as man by grace of personall vnion, for the execution of it</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ hauing in his humanity accomplished the worke of mans redemption, and in it had bin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> iudged in the world; it is meete that he should now manifest the glorie of his manhood, exalted aboue all creatures, and shining in such brightnes of glorie, as is fit for such a body as is vnited to the diuine nature. Hence is it, that often we read this second comming opposed vnto his former, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18746:143"/>
he pleased to couer and vaile his glorie, which now he will reueale and display aboue the shining of a world of Sunnes: Matth. 25.31. <hi>when the Son of man commeth in his glorie, and all the holy Angels with him, then he shall sit vpon the throne of his glorie:</hi> Luk. 21.27. <hi>Then shall they see the Sonne of man come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in a cloud with power and great glorie.</hi> Secondly, he shall shewe his neere affinitie vnto man, in that he shall in his humanitie be seene visibly discending in the clouds, as he was seene visibly to ascend by a cloud: this was long since prophecied, that <hi>euery eye should see him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 1.11.</note> and how meete is it, that the Iudge of all should be seene of all. Thirdly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of his Church; which as it is iustified by his first appearing in humilitie, so must it be glorified by the second appearing of the head of the church in glorie. Fourthly, that he might in this last act <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of it, fully accomplish his kingly office: for when he shall haue faithfully finished this iudgement, which is committed vnto him, he shall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly <hi>deliuer vp the kingdome vnto his Father:</hi> not that he shall then cease to bee an euerlasting king of glorie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.24.</note> but because he shall no longer exercise any temporarie gouernement, as now he doth. Hee shall not rule his kingdome by ciuill magistrates, nor his Church by such officers and ministerie as are now appointed vnder him for the gathering of the Saints. It shall not stand in need of the means of edification by the word, Sacraments, or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; the Lambe himselfe shall be all these in the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18746:143"/>
midst of the throne of God. In both these regards, he shall deliuer vp his kingdome; but he must first appeare in a most glorious humanity to finish this great businesse. For these reasons is this great worke committed to the Sonne immediately to execute.</p>

What a fearefull sentence awaiteth them when they shall come before him? no mervaile if they call for the mountaines to couer them, and the hils to hide them, rather then they should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the presence of his glorie, whose wrath is as a consuming fire, and no stubble can stand before it. Oh consider this yee that put farre from you this great day of the Lord, speaking peace to your selues, whilest euery thing wageth warre against you, in that you still by liuing in your sinnes proclaime open warre against the Son of God. Why should you any longer abuse his patience? why will you treasure vp wrath for your selues against this day of wrath? why will you fit your selues as fewel for the fire of that day, when the Lord Iesus shall come <hi>from heauen, in flaming fire to render vengeance against all them which knowe not God,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, in the execution of this office, two things must be considered: 1. the persons vpon
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18746:144"/>
whome, here said to be the <hi>quicke and the dead.</hi> 2. the manner of it.</p>

This appearance may be shadowed by the comming in of earthly Iudges to hold assises through their circuit, attended with the honourable, nobles, iustices, and gentelmen of the country; yea with the high Sheriffes power, besides all their owne followers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which great state and attendance, they are both honoured, and

Or rather, looke as Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Parliament to make lawes, put on their royall robes, and shew themselues in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test glorie; euen so shall this great King of glorie comming to require the obedience of his lawes, cloath himselfe with such a roabe of glorie as the brightest sunne shall not endure to behold: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heauens nor the earth shall be able to see this glorie, but shall shrinke at it, and melt away with a noise: Rev. 20.11. <hi>Iohn saw a great white throne, and one that sat vpon it, from whose face fled a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is not to beare the burden of that soule, which beareth the waight of it owne sinne, but to beare thine owne sinne in not preuenting that euil from him, which by thy negligence came vpon him.</p>

Hence is he said to haue bookes, and to open them, because all things are as certainely recorded and registred by him, as if he had registers in heauen to keepe roles and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of all that euer were or shall be to the end.

Be admonished then in time, whosoeuer thou art, to beware of all secret sinnes, as close cousenage, lying, vncleannesse, whisperings, and all other cunningly contriued wickednesse: seeing there is a <hi>cleare light</hi> into which they shall bee

brought, and by which they shall be <hi>reprooued.</hi> True it is, that open shame of the world restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth many one from committing open and grosse sinnes; but where conscience is wanting, the same sinnes, if they can cleanly conueie them, are made no bones of. Hence is it that the adulterer watcheth for the twilight, before he goe into his neighbours house; hee careth not for his chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so be hee may charily, and cautelously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe his vncleannesse. If a child of foure or fiue yeares old stood by, he would forbeare his sinne; but the presence of the mightie God that standeth at his elbow, who seeth and recordeth his foule sinne to bring it into iudgement, mooueth him neuer a whit. Would a fellon commit burglarie, if hee thought the iudge himselfe looked vpon him? would Gehezi haue runne after Naaman, if hee had thought his Masters eye and spirit had runne after him? would Ananias haue lied to the Apostles, if hee had thought they had knowne hee did so? Euen so it is a shame to speake what is done of many Christians in secret; because their eye is not vpon the iudge, whose eye is vpon them, and who is framing a bill of inditement against this day of generall assise.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This consideration must mooue vs to care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, both of our receits, and expenses,<note place="margin">Be carefull of thy receits and expenses because thou fittest in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans to whom thou must be counteable.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be gifts of minde, or of bodie, or of our outward estate. Hee that spendeth, and wasteth his owne, need care the lesse, because none

can call him to reckoning why hee doth so? but he that sitteth in another mans, or hath a matter of trust in his hands, and cannot mispend but out of another mans stocke, had need looke about him; because hee is to be counteable, and must make good whatsoeuer his reckoning commeth short in. Aske thy selfe, What haue I which I haue not receiued of my Master? How came I to be so rich? Is all the wealth I haue of my Masters gift, or haue I gotten goods into my hands by wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or iniuring some other men? Againe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I receiued at such and such a time a great summe of my Masters money, hee betrusted mee with a great portion; how haue I laied it out, that I may giue him vp a iust and comfortable recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to which I am sure to be called. Thus much I haue spent vpon suits in law: Thus much vpon my pleasures and sports; my dogges haue ravend vp a part of my revennue; my hawks haue flowen away with another end: cards and dice haue cost mee no little: and a great deale is wasted by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing my sinne, vncleanesse, pride, reuenge, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, and the like. But O thou vnfaithfull seruant, that hast thus wasted thy Masters goods; how much hast thou giuen to the poore? how much to good vses, to workes of mercie, to a setled Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie, to helpe Ioseph out of his affliction? oh no, here hee can set downe little or nothing; the dogges are preferred before Lazerus by many a Diues, who if they timely looke not better to their

            <p>Now for the generall vse of this doctrine of the last iudgement.

The former is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vpon vs by that precept, which commandeth vs to be like the <hi>seruant that wayteth for his Masters comming,</hi> and hath euery thing in a readinesse, and that at all watches: and by that of Peter, 2.3.11. <hi>Seeing all these terrors of the Lord</hi>; what <hi>manner of men ought wee to bee in all holy conuersation?</hi> And for the furthering of this care, two things must carefully be shunned,<note place="margin">Two things hinder this care.</note> which shut it quite out of the hearts of the most. The first is, <hi>securitie and deadnesse of heart:</hi> which is a slumber of spirit, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sleepinesse of the soule, which hath bound vp all faculties and powers of the soule, so as it can as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mooue or stirre in the actions and affaires of heauenly and spirituall life, as a man when hee is on a dead sleepe can mooue or bestirre himselfe to bodily and naturall actions. The mind, till God awaken it, neuer seriously thinketh of God, or of his owne estate. The conscience neuer, or seldom accuseth for sinnes committed. The will enclineth not to any thing truly good. The affections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnmooued at Gods word, or workes. The whole man is sencelesse and carelesse of Gods iudgements, either present, or to come: and whence is all this, but from a profane delusion of the heart,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:18746:156"/>
that the Master will not yet come; they shall not yet be called to their reckoning; there is time i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough behind to repent in: they craue but an houre on their death beds, and that they hope they shall haue. In the meane time they are eaten vp with dissolutenesse and profanenes, casting away sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and watchfulnesse, so as their Master commeth vnexpected, and in an houre they know not. How doth it therefore stand euery man in hand, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake from his sleepe, and stand vp from the dead? with wise virgins to prepare and trim their lamps with oile before hand, and so waite for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the briedgrome: to take heed of euery sinne, thought, word, and deede? to watch narrowely their owne liues, to prouoke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the best duties? What, is not sinne a fearefull thing, which made the Sonne of God cry, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee?</hi> Is not the greatnesse of them like the mountaines, and the number of them like the sand of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoare, which is numberlesse? Is it not a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God, whose wrath and iustice against the least sinne, all creatures in heauen and earth cannot stand vnder, but be oppressed and shaken in peices? Is not the night past, and the day come, the sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse risen, so as if euer we meane to wake out of this deadly sleepe, and walke as the children of light, it is more then time? Wouldst thou be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken lying, or swearing, or gaming, or drinking, or
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18746:156"/>
railing, or breaking the Sabbath, or stealing, or whooring; wouldst thou haue thy master find thee in any of these practises and distempers? oh no, I meane to repent: But he commeth suddainely as a theefe in the night; and this suddaine comming, at least to thee in particular, may cut off al thy purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: for it is iust with God, that they who take not his time of repentance, shall neuer attaine to their owne. What wil now be the issue of thy delayes? surely thou hadst better beene a dogge, or a toad, or the vilest creature of all the creation, then a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure sinner ouertaken in thy wickednesse.</p>
            <p>The second thing that hindereth this expecta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the last iudgement, as carefully to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the former, are the cares of this present life, and the greedie desire and thirst after the world, which by this consideration also may be abated. For if this day of iudgement, whether generall or particular to thy selfe, were to morrowe, what were thy gold, siluer, plate, Iewels, worth to thee? they were all one with the stones in the streete. Tel me nowe whether thou wouldst not then esteeme Christ and his merit thy chiefest commoditie: or if thou couldst but conceiue with thy selfe the truth, and say to thy soule, I shall certainely shortly come to answer the iudge of all the world; couldst thou goe on to lade thy conscience with iniquitie for so short a possession of vanishing profits? No, thou wouldst begin to husband thy time, which world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse hath hitherto ingrossed: thou wouldst not
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18746:157"/>
suffer thy soule to be so surcharged with earthlynes as to forget treasuring in heauen, making readie thy account, and the finishing of thy reckoning: thou wouldst not suffer the thornie cares of this life to choake all the seede of thy saluation: neither could it be that the oxe, or farme should so still fill vp thine eyes, as that the supper of the King should be despised. But, in truth men liue generally as though there were no iudgement to come, or as though they had stricken a couenant with it to passe ouer them: for when we preach, and men heare or read of the iudgement to come, who trembleth at it, as Faelix an heathen did, to heare Paul dispute of it? When we teach that the iudge is at the doore, who seeth all the facts of men, and draweth them into bills of remembrance, and of them all is drawing a bill of inditement; who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more, who sinneth lesse? who is it that smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his thigh, or saith, what haue I done? who forsaketh his wilfull ignorance, his contempt of the word, his abuse of Gods seruants, his blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, his pride, vncleannes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnlawfull games, or lawfull vnlawfully vsed, his sabbath breaking, his swearing, his oppression, his vsurie, or the like? We like Lot forwarne men of the euill to come; but men like Lots cousins and kinsmen, entertaine our words as a iest: we are as though we mocked; and so they sit out the summons to their further danger: yea more then this, when the Lord thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth his feareful iudgements into the eies and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:18746:157"/>
of men as forerunners of this generall; men shut their eies and will not see the <hi>brightnesse</hi> of them; nor the danger of sinne by them; nor the speciall anger of God bewraying it selfe and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out in them; but still liue as they did in the daies of Noah, and will lay none of these things to heart till it be too late.</p>
            <p>The second thing whereby euery man must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> himselfe to this iudgement, is to vse the best meanes that he may happily passe through it. And the only meanes is set downe by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1. Cor. 11.31. <hi>If we would iudge our selues, we should not be iudged of the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudging of our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in 4. things.</note> Now this iudging of our selues before hand, standeth in foure things. First in <hi>arraigning</hi> our selues before Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat; that is, when by serious consideration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we summon our selues before this Iudge to whom we are to be counteable. This is the <hi>memento</hi> that Salomon giueth the young man who is set vpon his pleasure, <hi>Remember that for all this thou must come to iudgement.</hi> And if the young man must sawce his pleasures with this remembrance, much more the older had need as beeing in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie course of nature nearer it then they: some of the ancients haue so acquainted and accustomed their hearts to this meditation, that one of them professeth of himselfe that wheresoeuer hee was, or whatsoeuer hee was doing, hee thought hee heard alwaies this voice in his eares, <hi>arise yee dead, and come vnto iudgement.</hi> Secondly, in <hi>examining</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:18746:158"/>
of our selues, and this is, when we search and fanne our selues, when we sift the secret corners of our hearts, and enquire narrowly, and without partiallitie, <hi>What haue I done?</hi> that looke as the Kings Attornie sifteth out, and exaggerateth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumstance of the crime against a Traytor at the barre, to make his offence as foule as can be; so should we become the King of heauen his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tournie against our selues; not lessning or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and much lesse excusing, hiding, or defending any sinne: but labour to see our sinne in euery cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, and make it as vile as we can that our hearts may be convinced, and beaten downe in the sence of our miserie. For this purpose, lay thy life, and euery particular action of it to the law of God; that as a straight line will shew thee all thy crookednesse and fetch thee in by such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as whereby thou shalt not content thy selfe with a confession in grosse, that thou art a sinner; but shalt confesse thy sinne to be out of measure sinnefull. But many a Christian is like a desperate bankcrupt, who beeing afraid to looke into his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings, goeth on till hee be clapt vp in prison; and at length they see there was no heauenly hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie in all this.

            <p>The Apostle Peter although he hath sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prooued whatsoeuer he hath formerly deliuered concerning the doctrine, and miracles, life and death, resurrection and ascention, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ againe vnto iudgement: yet as though no proofe could be too much; or as if he could not satisfie himselfe in enforcing this holy doctrine, and binding it vpon the consciences of his hearers; he shutteth vp his sermon in this verse with an other assured testimonie aboue all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, drawn from all the Prophets; who all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and conspire with the Apostles in all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning him: the summe and maine end of all which is, that through beleeuing in his name, the elect should receiue remission of sinnes: which is the summe and effect of this verse.</p>
            <p>Where first may be asked,<note place="margin">Why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth so many testimonies concerning Christ. Reasons.</note> why doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle induce so many testimonies one in the necke of another? In the answer where of we shall see, that none of them are needelesse or superfluous. For, 1. all the points of Christian religion are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and against corrupt nature; as appeareth in the heathen, who still esteemed the preaching of Christ <hi>foolishnesse:</hi> and in the Athenians,<note place="margin">2.

               <hi>they mocked him.</hi> The hardened Iewes at this day, on whom the wrath of God is come to the vttermost, doe the like: and well it were for many, if profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18746:160"/>
Christians in the midst of such a light, made more reckoning of our painfull preaching of Christ, who teach the same points, then some of the former: which were they so slight matters as most account them, what neede they be so enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? We are therefore hence fitly enformed, both to make more high account of such great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which the spirit of God is so carefull to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto vs, as also to bewayle the infidelitie of our hearts, that neede so much working vpon them to entertaine such necessarie truthes as these bee.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Because (although he was an Apostle) yet would he shewe his care, that in all his sermon he taught nothing of his owne which the Prophets had not formerly taught. Which teacheth all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters much more to beware, least in any of their sermons they broach such doctrine, or bring in such stuffe, of which they cannot prooue the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles to be patrons and publishers: For this was the commandement of the Apostles, that we teach <hi>no other doctrine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.3.</note> neither contrary, nor diuerse from it; no priuate opinions, which are the causes of scismes and heresies; nor vaine <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits or iangling, which breede questions, but no godly edifying.</hi> It was not onely their precept, but practise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> also: as, Act. 26.22. <hi>Paul spake no other things then those which the Prophets and Moses did say should come: to wit, that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead:</hi> Nay, <hi>the Lord of

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:18746:161"/>1. The generallity of this testimonie: that all <hi>the Prophets beare witnesse vnto him.</hi>

cheife aime and drift of all these Master builders was to lay this, the maine foundation of all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that Iesus Christ the Sonne of Marie, was the Sonne of God, the true Messias, the Lord of all, and the onely Sauiour and Redeemer of the world.</p>
            <p>First note hence,<note place="margin">Consent of the Church to any do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctrine to be receiued with these cautions.</note> what is the true consent which all teachers must ayme at in the deliuerie of any doctrine vnto the people of God; namely, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Prophets and Apostles: it forceth not a doctrine to be orthodoxe, or auncient, for a man to say, all the Fathers are of this minde; which is the Popish cry for all their heresies: but to this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine giue all the Prophets, and all the Apostles witnesse; and therefore it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound and perswasiue. Yet we refuse not, but challenge to the doctrine which we teach, the consent of the ancient church; but with these cautions. 1. With the Primitiue and Apostolicall Churches, which as they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> most auncient, so were they the purest. 2. With the Churches which were after them fiue or sixe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hundred yeares, so farre forth as they consented in doctrine and discipline with the former: for many Popish errors are auncient, and the Apostle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that Antichrist begun to worke in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie euen in their dayes. And some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were carried into some superstitions and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and so, not espying the mysterie, helped vp Antichrist, whom they entended to hold downe. 3. The holy Ghost hath revealed euery doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:18746:163"/>
necessarie to saluation, more holily, more clearely and more eloquently then all the Fathers put to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gether, who if they had any true wisedome, had it from the Scriptures; to which we must still hold our selues, both as the ground, as also the iudge of consent. 4. If any Father or fathers, shall by a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> common error, by word or writing condemne any point of our doctrine without the authoritie of the Scriptures, we will willingly dissent; neither doe we giue credance to any doctrine, because the Fathers haue taught it, but because that which they teach is founded in the writings of the Prophets and Apostles. 5. We cannot hold consent to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> a note of the true Church, vnlesse it be in the true doctrine: and therefore we iustly blame sundrie of the learned Papists, who make <hi>vnitie</hi> a note of the Church, but make no mention of <hi>veritie</hi> at all: for the strong man may hold all at peace and vnitie, whilest Paul and Barnabas hauing the truth may be at oddes betweene themselues. On which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as we are able to iustifie our whole religion by antiquitie, and consent of the most auntient Churches and Fathers, so also hath it beene and may be made as cleare as the light, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of Rome, wherein they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from vs, is a stranger, and noueltie, neuer knowne to the Prophets and Apostles, nor the purest Churches after them: neither had it euer that which they bragge of, the consent of the auntient Fathers; neither doe they consent in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:18746:163"/>
themselues.</p>
            <p>Secondly, note hence what is the force and worke of consent of the Church in doctrine,<note place="margin">The force of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it standeth</note> it is not to worke faith, for that is in the next words ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the word and witnesse of the Prophets and Apostles, which is called the word of faith, because it is by Gods ordinance a meanes to worke that faith by which it selfe is beleeued: but to mooue the heart, and prepare the way to faith. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that any spirituall grace, such as faith is, can be wrought by any but supernaturall meanes: of which kind no outward testimonie, if it come bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the voice of all the Churches in the world can be; for all this is but an humane witnes, simply and in it selfe considered. If they say the Churches testimonie is a diuine testimonie: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, so farre as it carrieth with it the agreement of the Scriptures, and holy Ghost speaking therein, it may be said to witnesse a diuine truth. And thus in no other respect can the voice of the Church be called a diuine testimonie, then the preaching and writing of some other teacher in the Church, who deliuereth nothing but what is agreeable to the Scriptures. From this ground it followeth, that the doctrine of the Church of Rome is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and derogatorie to the glorie and maiestie of the Scriptures, in that they stifly after conuiction auouch and maintaine, that the authoritie of the Scriptures depend vpon the testimonie of the Church, some of them blaspemously saying, that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:18746:164"/>
they haue no more credit then Esops fables, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Church giueth it vnto them: which is to say, that God must not be beleeued for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: and as if the Kings word should haue no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit or command, but from his guard.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence note, that in our reading of the Prophets, we must still be led further vnto Christ;<note place="margin">In reading the Prophets thou must be led still nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnto Christ.</note> for as all the Scriptures, so the writings of the Prophets were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for this purpose, and set apart by God to be the ordinarie outward stay and foundation of the faith of the Church. And if our Lord Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, whilest hee was yet in the flesh present with his Disciples, did for the confirmation of their faith in his doctrine, life, death, and resurrection, interpret vnto them the writings of the Prophets; how much more need haue we now in his bodily absence, to reade with diligence these same wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, to helpe vs forward beeing so wauering and staggering in our faith, and the attendant graces of it? And hereunto answereth that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Ioh. 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> namely, Moses, and the Prophets: that is, doe not only procure these writings to your selues, nor only reade perfunctorily; but diligently and studiously search to find out the cheife scope and matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined therein; which lyeth not in the crust or shel, but within, in the verie bowells of them: and this kernell himselfe in the next words sheweth to be himselfe and <hi>life eternall</hi> through him. And why must we thus search the Scriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:18746:164"/>
himselfe rendreth the reason, the very ground of our exhortation; <hi>because they testifie of mee.</hi> This is the naturall scope of them, to bring men to the acknowledgement of the persons, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; benefits of Christ. Thou loosest all thy labour in searching the Scriptures, if thou searchest any thing but Christ; if thou hast not and holdest him not in thine eye; if thou giuest ouer searching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou hast met with him: and then thou hast met with him in the Scriptures, not when thou historically knowest something of him, which thou didst not know before; nor when thou art able to discourse, or dispute of deepe points of diuinitie: but when <hi>thou commest vnto him,</hi> as the context sheweth, when by the quickning of thy faith and repentance, thou laiest faster hold vpon him for life euerlasting. Alas, how few searchers of the Scriptures thus search them: to say nothing of them who search them not at all, but cast them aside as refuse wares; of whom we may renew the wofull complaint of Christ against the Iewes, who when hee had exhorted them to search the Scriptures, presently addeth, <hi>But yee will not come to mee that yee might haue life,</hi> Ioh. 5.40.</p>
            <p>The second point, is the scope of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets witnesse: and this is to bring men to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in the name of</hi> the Sonne of God; which is by <hi>faith to receiue Christ,</hi> as he hath described and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pounded himselfe in the word and promises of the Gospel. For although the Apostle might sooner
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:18746:165"/>
haue said, that <hi>whosoeuer beleeue in him,</hi> yet he vseth this phrase rather of <hi>beleeuing in his name,</hi> thereby secretly to referre vs vnto the word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles which testifie of no other name to be saued by but onely the name of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. For our better clearing of this point, we will consider, 1. what this faith is. 2. the benefit of it. 3. the marks and signes of it. 4. the vse.</p>

               <note place="margin">Faith, what it is.</note>First, what this faith is, <hi>It is a supernaturall gift whereby euerie beleeuer apprehendeth and applyeth vnto himselfe Christ and all his merits vnto saluation.</hi> I say, it is a <hi>gift:</hi> nay the Scripture saith, that it is the <hi>gift of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 1.29.</note> and it is giuen <hi>you to beleeue as also to suffer:</hi> And that it is <hi>supernatural,</hi> all the commandements we haue to beleeue plainly euince; for were it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall we should neede no commandement to doe it.<note place="margin">Opera natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralia non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto.</note> Further, it is such a gift, as whereby we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>and apply vnto our selues Christ and all his merits:</hi> for the verie nature of iustifying and sauing faith standeth in these two degrees. 1. In apprehension and receiuing of Christ: for to <hi>beleeue and receiue Christ</hi> are all one, Ioh. 1.13. 2. In applying to ones selfe Christ and his merits particularly, which is not onely to know that Christ is God in himselfe, and all other parts of truth necessarie to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; but a full perswasion of the mercie of God through Christ to belong vnto himselfe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: so as he be able with Thomas to say, <hi>My Lord, and my God:</hi> not only confessing that Christ died for sinners (which the very Deuils beleeue)
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18746:165"/>
but as Paul describeth the true faith in the Sonne of God by the proper speach and voice of it, Gal. 2.20. <hi>Who died for mee, and gaue himselfe for mee.</hi> Further, the description restraining this grace to <hi>beleeuers,</hi> giueth vs to vnderstand,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 3.</note> that <hi>faith is not of all,</hi> nor so common as men take it to be: not euery one that can say, <hi>I beleeue in God,</hi> hath faith; nor euery one that will boldly say, Christ is his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, hath presently sauing faith. For, 1. The Prophet Isay speaketh of a number that <hi>beleeued</hi> not the Prophets <hi>report,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Faith is not of all.</note> and to <hi>whom the arme of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God was not reuealed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53.1.</note> The Euangelists and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles also complaine in their times how this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie was accomplished, notwithstanding they heard the blessed word of truth from the mouth of truth it selfe, and saw the wonderfull miracles in the hands of Christ himselfe, and his Apostles for the confirmation of that truth. 2. The end of faith, which is saluation, belongeth not to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> most, and therefore not faith it selfe the means: for there are few which shall be saued. 3. The word, the parent of faith, is wanting to many people; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and where it is so neglected by the most as grace and Gods blessing is withdrawne from it: besides, that the vnfaithfulnesse of teachers, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of iniquitie in all sorts of men prouoke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be expected. 4. The Scriptures not only denie true and sauing faith to the reprobate, whose eies the <hi>Lord blindeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 6.9.4</note> and whose <hi>hearts hee hardneth,</hi> least they should see and beleeue; but impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it to the elect, whence it is called the <hi>faith of the elect:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the description addeth the finall cause of faith to be <hi>salvation,</hi> namely, in regard of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: for the maine end of all graces is the glorie of God: and so Abraham by beleeuing is said to <hi>giue glorie to God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.20.</note> but the subordinate end of faith, is the saluation of the elect, and therefore is it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sauing faith:<note place="margin">

                  </gap>. Insalutem animae Beza.</note> Heb. 10.39. we are not they which withdraw our selues vnto perdition, but we <hi>follow faith to the conservation of the soule:</hi> 1. Pet. 1.9. <hi>Receiuing the end of your faith, euen the saluation of your soules.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Faith neuer quite lost.</note> And from hence followeth it, that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith can neuer be quite shaken out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> heart of him that once hath it; beeing, 1. but once giuen to the Saints, Iude 3. and a gift of which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God neuer repenteth him. 2. A gift flowing from Gods eternall election, as we haue shewed out of Act. 13.48. 3.

            <p>From which description of true iustifying faith,<note place="margin">Popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not true faith to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> day.</note> it is euident that Popish doctrine knoweth not, teacheth nor, nor suffereth men to be taught the true doctrine of sauing faith, because it vtterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth the very essentiall forme of it, which is speciall application of Christ and his merits, with affiance and resting only on them vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea and more, they condemne this glorious worke of faith as a mortall sinne, and stile it by the name of presumption: and so, by Gods iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they take vp such a faith in stead of it, as is common, not onely to Heretikes and reprobates, but to the verie Deuils themselues, who beleeue as much as Popish doctrine requireth to saluation, yea and more, they tremble also. For doe not they know and assent that there is one God; that all that is in the word of God is true and certaine; that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18746:167"/>
all the Articles of the Creed are the true grounds of Christian religion? and if you goe any further (excepting the thrusting in of generall councells and traditions which euery good Catholike must take in with the former) Popish faith leaueth you, and biddeth you farewell: and euen those things which are absolutely necessarie to saluation to be beleeued by sauing faith (as that the Scriptures are Gods word, that the Articles of faith compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Creed of the Apostles are of vndoubted truth) they embrace only by historicall faith; by which yet was neuer man saued: for if euer man were, then might the Deuils also by the same faith. But iustifying faith is another manner of thing; it sealeth not it selfe in the vnderstanding only, as the former, but taketh vp the whole soule, euen the heart, will, and affections also, all which lay hold and cleaue vnto Christ for saluation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it a common and generall worke of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vpon good and badde, as the former illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and assent is; but a speciall fauour and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie grace proper to the elect, as wee haue heard, and the stranger entreth not into this their ioy.</p>
            <p>The second point to be considered, is the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or excellent fruite of this grace.<note place="margin">Fiue excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fruits of sauing faith.</note> 1. It is the first stone to be laid in the building of a Christian, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and therefore called a <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>foundation:</hi> and the Colossians are said to be <hi>rooted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11 1. Colos. 2.7.</note> and <hi>built,</hi> and <hi>stablished in the faith:</hi> this is that rocky foundation
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:18746:167"/>
which shal beare vp the house against all winds and weathers. It is the first worke of change in the heart, and the first difference betweene man and man, when God <hi>by faith purifieth the heart.</hi> It is the foundation of all obedience;<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> for whatsoeuer <hi>is not of faith, is sinne.</hi> It is the roote of all Gods worship, for till we beleeue in God, we can neither trust, nor hope, nor loue, nor pray, nor performe any other part of his seruice truely or acceptably. It is the mother of all good workes: the word is the seede of them, which faith conceiueth and digesteth, and so bringeth forth commanded and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded actions. Generall faith knoweth the worke to be good in the kind of it, and speciall iustifying faith beginneth it, and maketh it good in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and endeuour of the doer; and layeth hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ to couer the defects of it. Hence is it, that often in the Scriptures we reade it to bee the first commandement giuen by <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, to such as were desirous to know the way of life, and how they might please God. The Iewes come to our Sauiour, and aske him, what they might doe to <hi>worke the workes of God?</hi> and Christ beginning here, telleth them,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.28, 29.</note> that <hi>this is the worke of God, that they beleeue in him whome hee hath sent.</hi> And, 1. Ioh. 3.23. <hi>This is his commandement, that we beleeue in the name of his Sonne Iesus Christ, and loue one another:</hi> for we cannot performe any worke of loue before we beleeue. In one word, faith is the verie soule of all obedience, without which, the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:18746:168"/>
most sightly and glorious actions; be it of almes, prayer, preaching, hearing, worship, or miracles themselues, all are but verie corpses and carkases of good workes dead and liueles.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, faith exalteth it selfe aboue all other graces, not onely in the excellent obiect of it, which is Christ and saluation; but also in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worke of it aboue them all, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they all haue their speciall excellencies: it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spouseth vs vnto Iesus Christ, and in these espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls and contract for the present, it assureth vs of our mariage with him hereafter. And beeing the <hi>condition of the new couenant of life,</hi> it tieth God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto vs;<note place="margin">Ioh. 3 16.</note> who is not further bound to any man, then he is a beleeuer. True it is that <hi>loue</hi> placeth it selfe vpon Christ, but it is after faith, for hee must be apprehended before he be loued. <hi>Hope</hi> waiteth for saluation, but faith first beleeueth it. <hi>Trust</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vpon the promises, but faith first laieth hold on Christ the author and accomplisher of them. And though the Apostle say, that of <hi>faith, hope, and loue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> 
               <hi>loue is the cheifest,</hi> himselfe interpreteth it to be in respect of durance and continuance, but not in respect of our iustification, or acceptation with God. Loue indeed suruiueth and lasteth longest; for our sight of God as hee is shall vanish faith; but yet faith is before it, and the mother of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, sauing faith is a liuing thing, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to liue by it: It purgeth his owne dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by purifying the heart &amp; conscience, it renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18746:168"/>
the spirit and mind, it quickneth to all good duties: for it beeing an instrument to vnite vnto Christ, by it as by a bond of vnion, wee receiue from him our head, life, and power to mooue and stirre in Christian duties: yea, it so gouerneth the whole life, that we henceforth liue not, but Christ liueth in vs. In our busines and labour, it maketh men diligent in the worke, but leaue the successe to God. In temporall wants, it saith with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>God will prouide</hi> at least <hi>in the mountaine:</hi> it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not so much for bread, as the staffe of it: if it haue meanes, it blesseth God, and vseth them; but trusteth not in them: if it haue them not, it resteth on God, but vseth no vnlawfull courses for them. In afflictions it stablisheth the heart with assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a good issue, and still waiteth the Lords leasure without making hast. In temptations it goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sence and feeling, and resteth vpon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked promise: yea, when it can scarse apprehend any thing but wrath, it will vphold the heart, and reare it, euen when God seemeth to kill him to trust in his mercie. In the vse of things spirituall, as the word, Sacraments, prayer, and other holy means, onely faith draweth vertue from Christ; and all of them are vnprofitable, further then they are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with faith. In the vse of temporall, it is faith that weaneth the heart, and keepeth it that earthly cares choake it not, earthly pleasures possesse it not, and earthly comforts oppresse it not: but it holdeth the mind heauenly in the midst of earthly busines,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18746:169"/>
&amp; suffreth it not to loue pleasures more then God, nor to enioy any comfort of the creature aboue, or against the comforts of God and his word, whom they acknowledge the verie life of their liues, and the soule of their soules and bodies here and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Thus is faith euerie where diffused; if wee walke, <hi>we walke by faith:</hi> if we liue, we <hi>liue by faith in the Sonne of God:</hi> if we stand, <hi>we stand by faith:</hi> if we die, <hi>wee must die in faith,</hi> as the Patriarks did, Hebr. 11.13.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. This excellent grace only fenceth against temptation, quieteth the distressed soule, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth it from sinking, as once it did Peter, Matth. 14.29. This is the only sheild which quencheth all the <hi>firie darts of the Deuill,</hi> Eph. 6.16. and, 1. Pet. 5.9. Your adversarie the Deuil goeth about like a roaring lyon, whome resist stedfast in the faith. This is the victorie also that <hi>ouercommeth the world, euen our faith,</hi> 1. Ioh. 5.4. This the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest ouer the lusts of our <hi>owne flesh,</hi> 1.

Therefore the poore Iaylor that could not tell what to doe with himselfe, that of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie man now readie to kill himselfe, he might become happie, and an heire of saluation, was sent no where else by the Apostle, but to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18746:169"/>
and practise of this grace of faith. This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolueth fully the question, <hi>Oh, what shall I doe to be saued?

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:18746:172"/>
is it, that whereas vnbeleeuers are glewed to the earth, and cannot thinke of heauen, but either with sorrowe, or a formall and false ioy (and what meruaile is it, that those who haue no better should set their hearts vpon the worse) beleeuers haue preserued in them a willingnes to leaue this world, and to be with Christ, which is best of all: yea, so sweete is their present tast of Christ, through faith and hope, that they are vnquiet till they bee filled with the fruition of his fullnesse; being often in his absence sicke of loue, and pine away till they bee with him whom their soule loueth. 4.

            <p>The fourth marke or note of true faith,<note place="margin">IIII.

First, it frameth and fitteth the owne habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it <hi>purifieth the heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> it suffereth not vncleane
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:18746:173"/>
thoughts, vnlawfull lusts, or wandring motions to harbour there: it guideth the affections of loue, hatred, ioy, sorrowe, and the rest; that a man loue nothing more, or so much, as God and his image: he hateth not mens persons but their sinnes, &amp; no mans sinne so much as his owne: he reioyceth in nothing so much as in doing the will of God; this is as his meat and drinke: he sorroweh for nothing in the world so much as for offending so good and patient a God. This pure heart also guideth the words with wisedome, and maketh it his chiefe stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die how to preserue with faith,<note place="margin">Act. 24.16.</note> 
               <hi>good conscience</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>faith worketh by loue,</hi> Gal. 5.6. both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards man: towards him that begate, and him that is begotten, yea, and him that is yet not begotten.<note place="margin">Our loue of God expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in 3. things.</note> This loue of God expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it selfe, 1. in much thankefulnesse vnto him, who hath loued vs first; who hath giuen so much, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> euen his Sonne, and all things with him pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to life and godlinesse: who hath forgiuen vs so much, and to whom many sinnes are forgiuen, they must loue much: who hath done so great things for vs, by becomming our portion, our treasure, and our cheife good. 2. In shame for our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vnkindnesse vnto him, both before, and euen since we knewe this his loue in Christ, and haue beene acquainted with his wayes; taking vp with shame in our faces, sorrowe into our hearts for the sinnes of our youth, and of our age: against the lawe the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:18746:173"/>
rule of righteousnesse; but especially against the glorious Gospel, which of all other are least ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. 3. In desire of that blessed fellowship of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> his, when and where we may neuer sinne against him any more: accounting one day within his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of holies, better then a thousand besides: and much more to be <hi>euer with the Lord,</hi> and to enioy the pleasures at his right hand for euermore, to be at <hi>home with him,</hi> and sit downe with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, yea with Iesus Christ himselfe, should make vs grone in our soules, and say with Dauid, <hi>Oh, when shall I appeare in this thy presence?</hi> The Spirit saith, come, and the Spouse saith, come. Euen so, come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</p>
            <p>The loue of men by which faith worketh, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth it selfe not only in iust dealing with them as we would be dealt by; which many ciuill men, endued only with ciuill righteousnesse, haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in; nor only in mercifull distribution of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts for the releeuing of the bodies of our brethren, yea and of our enemies; which hardlier goeth downe with the vnconuerted then the former: but also in shewing most loue vnto their soules, in helping forward their conversion and saluation. For so soone as any man is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hee will strengthen the brethren. Faith, wheresoeuer it liueth, it loueth, and loue beeing an hand giuing out, mooueth men conuerted to counsell, exhort, rebuke, admonish, comfort, pray, and waite when God will giue vnto others the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18746:174"/>
grace of repentance. As soone as Andrew was called, hee bringeth his brother Simon to Christ. No sooner had Christ found Phillip, but Phillip finding Nathaniel, hee bringeth him to Christ. The woman at the well no sooner heareth that Christ was the Messiah, but shee bringeth all the citie. In finding this treasure, the Christian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide his ioy; neither can any mans ioy be so full, vnlesse hee with others <hi>reioyce together.</hi> For it is not here as in earthly things, which the more they are communicated, the more are they dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and euery mans share is the lesse; but heauenly things are by communication the more increased; for we reade not of any man that laid out his tallent, but to increase: and as the light of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nne is neuer a whit impaired by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating it selfe to the whole world; or as hee that lighteth one candle of another, diminisheth not in either, but increaseth the light; so is it in the light of the Sonne of righteousnesse much more, and in the kindling of these heauenly sparkles, whose propertie is to diffuse themselues as fire, &amp; the further they spread, the greater and brighter is the flame.</p>
            <p>The third fruit or effect of faith, is an vndaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> confession of it: Rom. 10.10. <hi>With the heart we beleeue to iustification, and with the mouth we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to saluation.</hi> For where faith is in the heart, it will be also in the mouth. The spirit of faith, and the speach of faith are vndeuided: as, 2. Cor. 4.13.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:18746:174"/>
               <hi>And because we haue the same spirit of faith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which was written:</hi> I beleeued, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I spake, <hi>euen so we beleeue,</hi> and therefore also we speake. Now there be three actions of faith which helpe forward this free confession. 1. It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man bold in a good cause, Act. 5.29. Peter beeing full of faith, with a bold spirit told the Counsell that had the power of life and death in their hands, and himselfe in their power, <hi>we ought rather to obey God then you.</hi> 2. Faith keepeth a man in a preparednesse to suffer by leading him along in the deniall of himselfe; and hereof we haue a notable example in Paul, Act. 21.13. who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed how <hi>readie</hi> hee was, <hi>not only to be bound, but to die also at Ierusalem,</hi> if God called him thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. 3. It worketh ioy, yea much reioysing in the heart, in the suffring for Christ and a good cause: Rom. 5.3. after the Apostle had laid downe the iustification of faith as a ground, hee saith, that <hi>we then reioyce in tribulation:</hi> and that they did so indeed is plaine, Act. 5.41. <hi>They departed from the Counsell, reioysing that they were counted worthy to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer rebuke for his name:</hi> hence could they sing Psalmes at midnight in the dungeon, and fetters: and hence could the Martyrs embrace the fire, kisse the stake, and testifie such ioy in the flames, as all men might acknowledge the truth of the speach of our Sauiour, <hi>Your ioy shall no man take away from you</hi>; no Tyrant, no tormentor, nor any kind of torment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:18746:175"/>The fourth and last fruit or worke of faith is, that wheresoeuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound faith is, it is most diligent in preseruing, yea and increasing of it selfe. The most couetous man is not more complaining nor gathering then the beleeuer, who is euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of want of faith,<note place="margin">Mar. 9.24.</note> or of the weaknesse of it; and knowing the want of it to be so dangerous and hurtfull, as without which hee wanteth Christ himselfe; as also that the weaknesse of it depriueth him of much comfort, and many good things; for a man of weake estate must needs want many rich commodities and sweete comforts which the wealthy enioy in abundance. Therefore hee vseth all good meanes to encrease his stocke:<note place="margin">Meanes to encrease the stocke of faith.</note> as, 1. Hee is much in hearing, reading, and meditating in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> word, because hee knoweth, <hi>faith commeth by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:</hi> and euery thing is preserued and nourished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by that whereof it is begotten. 2. Hee is much in godly talke and Christian conference, by which as the fire by the bellowes, so is the grace of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> blowne, and stirred vp in him. 3. Because hee seeth how without prayer, both his owne, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christs his faith is as readie to faile as Peters was: hee is much in prayer, and with the Father of the child, crieth with teares often, <hi>Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22.32. Mar 9.24. Luk. 17.5.</note> 
               <hi>helpe my vnbeleefe:</hi> and with the Disciples, <hi>Lord increase our faith.</hi> And these are the markes by which the soundnesse and currence of faith, as by a touchstone may be tried, and distinguished from all that false and counterfeit faith which is so

stirring in the world, and whereby most men are lamentably deceiued.</p>
            <p>The vse of this doctrine is, 1. to stirre vp men to examine, and by these notes to prooue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, whether they are in the faith or no, to try their faith of what kind it is, least in the ende they finde that they haue leaned vpon a staffe of reede. By which examination, I feare it will bee too eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently seene, that these are the last dayes wherein the Sonne of man shall come, and scarcely finde faith vpon the face of the earth.

First, euery man saith hee hath faith; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whence had hee it: it was neuer begotten by the word, he neuer cared for that, that was euer as a sixt finger and superfluitie vnto him. It was neuer founded in repentance, nor dwelleth with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for most men neuer saw change in themselues, they haue loued God, and beleeued in Christ euer since they can remember. It was neuer cherished with the duties of prayer and invocation, they could neuer pray in all their liues except after the minister, or by set formes, but the spirit of prayer neuer dwelt there. It was neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flicted with vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beleefe, they wonder what that should be, or that any man should not euer beleeue: so as indeed here is no character of the faith of the elect; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing all this while but a voice and verie carkase of

faith.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Others say they beleeue, and bragge of a sauing faith in Christ, but they feede a bare fancie: for they could neuer beleeue God for lesser things: they want the faith of Gods prouidence euen for meate and drinke, which is apparant in that they can vse wicked &amp; vnwarrantable meanes for them: their strong faith they bragge of, waiteth not for Gods prouision, but will shift for it selfe by hooke and by crooke: it holdeth not the heart to patient bearing of the crosse, but flingeth out in distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: it putteth not forth in inferiour businesses, to giue directions to the particular actions of life: and therefore seeing this faith faileth in lesser and smaller things, how can it be found in the greatest of all?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others boast of a sound faith, which were it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> so, it would lay hold vpon the promise, and beleeue for themselues and their seed; but this it doth not: for many who for themselues would rest in the prouidence of God, vpon the good and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meanes, will yet endanger themselues for their children. And hence is it that many who haue liued conscionably in single estate, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted much of their care and feare in their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition, and come short of their former vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse; and why is this else, but that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not the Lord to be <hi>all-sufficient</hi> for them and theirs.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1.</note>

            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Others there be that challendge as sound a
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:18746:176"/>
faith as any, but neuer prise such a pearle as it is: can a man haue such a commoditie, but he shall valew it according to the worth? but these thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues neuer the richer for it: they haue more sense and ioy in the smallest, and most trifling earthly profit, then that Christ is become their gaine, which although they professe, yet this vndervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him in their hearts, giueth their tongues the lie. Besides, if they did esteeme of faith indeede, they would professe it boldly, and confesse it to all the world, whereas they are ashamed of Christ before men, and cast themselues into the night with Nicodemus, as fearing least if they should come to Christ by day, men would see them, whose praise they loue aboue the praise of God; and whose reproach they feare aboue the rebuke of the Almightie. But how vnlike is this to the faith of the Saints, whereby they could esteeme the <hi>rebukes of Christ, aboue the treasures of Egypt.</hi> And further, were it so they made reckoning of their faith, they would much more care for the end of it; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound faith carrieth the heart euen in the constant way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and wishing for Christs appearance; but these rather feare it then hope it. Now what a faith is that which neuer careth to come to the ende of it, that faine would still be pitching vpon earth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Peter when he wist not what he said, <hi>It is good beeing here:</hi> Is this faith an euidence of <hi>things not seene?</hi> or doth it <hi>looke at things within the vaile?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:18746:177"/>5. Another sort would be loath to be otherwise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> accounted, but true beleeuers; and yet their faith worketh no cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; how their hearts are purified, witnes the vncleannes, enuy, drunkennes, oathes, iniustice, couetousnesse, contempt of the ministerie, profanations of the sabbaths of God in themselues and theirs: these and the like proceede from within; and by the wares in the shop any man may know how the warehouse is stored. And as this faith purgeth not the nastie corners of the heart, no more doth it the mouth, but that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth according to the abundant foulenesse of the heart, and is filled with vnlceane, vnsauourie, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull speaches. Further, as they were at first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to God, and goodnes; so they abide still and are no changelings. Here is no faith working by loue, neither to <hi>God</hi>; for they will doe nothing for him, will be at no costs or paines for him: and as little will they suffer for his sake, not a reproachfull word; much lesse will they reioyce in suffring: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Gods</hi> children, these can they pinch and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, whereas loued they him that begat, they would loue those that are begotten of him. As for helping others to heauen, they are so farre from it, as that if any will cast an eye that way, they can tell what he is presently, and they would be loath to be such an hypocrite, or precise foole as hee is. To conclude, although true faith is most industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the meanes of preseruing and increasing it selfe, these men hold their wont: enemies to the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:18746:177"/>
word were they, and so are they still, they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the meanes, and absent themselues from the Ministrie; and can no more beleeue then Thomas,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.24.</note> who was absent when Christ came and shewed himselfe to the rest of the Disciples: and that which they do heare, they mingle not with faith, and so it becommeth vnprofitable. The Lyon roareth, they feare not in their hearts, because they apply not the threats of the law against their own sinnes. The Gospel propoundeth promises of life and saluation, but they trust God no further then they see him; they reioyse no more in them then they can in another mans mony or evidences; they pray not to be taught of God, nor heare to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in faith; nor meditate nor conferre of the things they heare, further to edifie themselues and others in their most holy faith. Now will these fruits stand with faith? or if they will not, is faith so common as men pretend? but I hope I haue a little helped many a man to see by this applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how that his gold is turned into copper, and his faith but into a dreame and fancie.</p>

To teach in what an high reckoning it is with God; who is the author of it, the finisher of it, the accepter and approouer of it, yea of a graine of it; and not of it only, but of our persons and imperfect works because of it: and consequently that euery belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer should make as high account of it as of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it selfe, it leading to the very gate of heauen: nay beeing the threshold ouer which euery one must steppe that meaneth to enter into the holy citie.</p>

               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:18746:178"/>3. <hi>Vse.</hi> This teacheth vs that seeing the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie of the Prophets, Apostles, Pastors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers was instituted to this purpose to beget and confirme men in the faith: all such as frequent the Ministerie must be carefull to grow vp in the strength of faith. For otherwise they frustrate to themselues this holy ordinance? for the summe of our commission is this, <hi>Goe teach all nations, he that beleeueth shall be saued,</hi> Mark. 16.16. And what is Paul, Apollos, or any other ordinarie Minister <hi>but the Ministers of your faith</hi>; both for the begetting and confirming of the same? So as whosoeuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ministrie wanteth either the worke of faith,<note place="margin">Grow vp in the strength of faith. Reasons.</note> or the working of it to further strength and degrees; that Ministrie is by him peruerted to his owne danger, and damnation without repentance. And if we search further into the Scriptures, we shall not want store of reasons to the same purpose. As, 1. according to the increase of faith is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> increase of all graces: as a man beleeueth, so he loueth, prayeth, and obeyeth, and so is loued, heard, and recompensed: and no meruaile, seeing not only the measure of graces here, but of glorie hereafter is according to the measure of faith, as appeareth in the parable of the talents. 2. As a child once borne groweth daily vnto the talenesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of it, so those that haue beene borne vnto God, haue euer encreased (except in temptation, and desertion) in faith and godlinesse, and so drew dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nearer their saluation then when they first belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:18746:179"/>
so must we walke from faith to faith; from strength to strength; of weake becomming strong; not standing in the infancie, or childhood, but growing vp to our full age and old age in Iesus Christ. 3. It is true that a graine of true faith is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> very powerfull and preuailing; but the strength of faith can doe much more: and therefore the full sayles wherewith Abraham was carried to the promise are set before vs, Rom. 4.5. Againe, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry measure of faith, if true, is acceptable to God, and maketh vs so; because Christ is laid hold on vnto life; but the greater measure is much more: a smoking flax shall not be quenched, that is, the least sparkle of true faith shall not be despised; but a flame of faith is of great bewtie and brightnesse. If a poore man wrastle haltingly with Iacob, he shall preuaile, and get a blessing to carrie away; but if a man stand stoutly with the Centurion, and Syrophaenicean, Christ himselfe will be foyled after a sort, hee will admire it, and professe hee found not so <hi>great faith</hi> in Israel; and according to this great faith shall it be to this partie. Seeing therefore the Lord hath still afforded the Ministry and word of faith, let this be thy cheife aime to find the worke of it vpon thy faith; and content not thy selfe that Christ may say to thee, <hi>Oh thou of little faith:</hi> but rise vp in the degrees of it, that hee may say as of that <hi>woman,</hi> O man, <hi>great is thy faith:</hi> this will beare thee vp in the waues of temptation and affliction: no blast or billow shall sinke thee,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:18746:179"/>
not all the gates of hell shall preuaile against thee. But alas, how is this principall ende of the ministerie neglected of the most, and many come to heare a sermon, and that is all: some rather to see a sermon, or be seene at it, then to heare it: some to knowe more then they did, some to reforme something, as Herod, who heard Iohn gladly, and did many things, but fewe to learne to become beleeuers: which till they haue done, all morall precepts vrged vpon them are but lost, because the inside is not yet cleane: and fewest of all doe liue by their faith in the Sonne of God: for of all sinnes that the spirit shall rebuke the world of, this is the cheife, that they beleeue not in him. Thus much of this worthy doctrine concerning <hi>faith,</hi> which is the scope of all the Prophets and Apostles.</p>
            <p>The third point in the verse, is the fruit of faith, namely, that all that beleeue in his name <hi>should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue remission of sinnes.</hi> Where for the meaning must be knowne, 1. what is Remission of sinnes. 2. what it is to receiue it. 3. the persons receiuing it, namely, those that beleeue <hi>in the name of Christ:</hi> euen all they, and none but they. First, Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes is a <hi>grace of God, whereby for the merit of Christ, he accounteth the sinnes of beleeuers as no sinnes, and acquitteth them from the guilt and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them all.</hi> Where I say, it is a <hi>grace or fauour of God,</hi> this remission of sinne is distinguished from all other: for man hath also from God power and commandement to remit sinnes; and that either

publikely or priuately. The <hi>former,</hi> when the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister by authoritie from God, remitteth the sinnes of beleeuers, and repentant sinners; by publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of the Gospell, and applying it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such.

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:18746:181"/>2. I say in the description, that the Lord doth <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the sinnes of his elect as no sinnes, and that for the merit of Christ:</hi> both which appeare in the former resemblance, which compareth sinnes to debts: wherein God is compared to a creditor, man to a debter, the law to the bill or bond which bindeth man to God, 1. to obedience, 2. in default of that to punishment; so as here is nothing but either satisfaction, or to goe to prison. Now we beeing banquerupts by our fall, and of such broken estate, as we are not able to pay one farthing neither of the principall, nor the forfeiture: the mercie of our creditor steppeth in, who himselfe procureth vs a suretie, both able and willing to discharge our whole debt, and the forfeit as wel as the principall: that is, Iesus Christ, who by his obedience actiue, and passiue, hath made a full discharge, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent satisfaction for the sinnes of all the beleeuers in the world: the which beeing accepted of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in full paiment, he further imputeth not to vs our sinnes, but couereth them, casteth them all <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his backe,</hi>

Thus they become as though they had neuer been, and wee accounted as innocent, as if wee had neuer fallen from our first estate of innocencie.

               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.</note> wherein not the action of remission, which is proper to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:18746:181"/>
the deitie is ascribed to the blood of Christ; but onely the cause of remission is signified, for which God the Father remitteth sinnes: and that is the blood of Christ, including his whole obedience, and the merit of it, which is a iust price, and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his father; Eph. 1.7. <hi>In whome wee haue redemption through his blood; euen the remission of sinnes.</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

It will not stand with the faith of our prayer for remission of sinnes: for if our whole debt be not forgiuen, but some satisfaction remaineth for vs to performe, to beleeue remission of sinnes were no faith, but a vaine opinion and fancie: nor with our peace with
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:18746:182"/>
God, if his wrath bee not yet fully satisfied. Nay it will not stand with right reason: for is it reason, that he that oweth nothing to a man, should be forced to make a satisfaction where nothing is due: but where the debt is remitted, nothing is due, nothing is owing, the debter is freed, and the whole obligation cancelled. Who seeth not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by all this, what a wicked and detestable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise it is of the schoolemen,<note place="margin">Concil.

Vpon this string hang their indulgences, pardons, masses, pilgrimages, and the whole body of their troumperie, deuised to make a prey of the world; a great part of which (beeing the cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est theiues in all the world) they haue by such craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>and yet the child borne to him must surely die:</hi> and againe, though the sinnes of the godly be pardoned, yet death which is the punishment of originall sinne remaineth. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 1. that Dauids sinne and punishment were both remitted, for so said the Prophet, <hi>Thou shalt
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:18746:182"/>
not die.</hi> 2. we must distinguish betweene punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of sinne, whereby Gods iustice is satisfied, and chastening of sinne with a fatherly rod. The former are alwaies remitted with the sinne, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the latter: by the former, the Lord reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the sinnes of men, by the latter, he correcteth. The former can onely be borne away by Christ: the latter cannot be borne off by any masses or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences; but are wholesomely dispensed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by God to his dearest childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their good. Of this latter kind was the death of Dauids child, not properly for his sinne, but that in the deed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee had caused the enemies of God to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme. Of this kind was the sentence against Moses and Aaron, whose sinne of not <hi>glorifiyng God at the waters of strife</hi> was pardoned,<note place="margin">Numb. 20.12.</note> and yet they must not enter into the land of promise: they were corrected with roddes of men (not punished in proper speach) both that others with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues might be more carefull not to offend in the like kind, as also that beeing depriued of the earthly Canaan, they might more studiously seeke for the heauenly. The like is to be said of the Corinths, of whome <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 4. de paenit. cap. 2.</note> that they were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, and yet diuerse of them were stricken with death for vnworthy receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As for the example of the Israelites, Num. 14.20. whose sinne of murmuring God is said <hi>to forgiue at Moses prayer,</hi> yet they must all for this sinne die in the wildernesse. The answer is,<note place="margin">Note well this answer.</note> that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:18746:183"/>
Moses did not pray that God would absolutely and for euer pardon their sinne; nor that the Lord would abstaine from all iudgement and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that sinne: but that <hi>now</hi> at this present time he would be pleased to appease his great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger so iustly conceived, and desist from that great iudgement of the vtter destroying of them; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, v. 12. as may appeare, both by the arguments vsed by him, as by that he expressely noteth the manner of this forgiuenesse, ver. 19. as <hi>thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen this people, euen from Egypt till now: and forgiue them, euen according as thou hast spoken,</hi> ver. 17. but how the Lord had after they came out of Egypt forgiuen them, appeareth Exod. 32.35. when they had made a calfe, and the Lord wished Moses to let him alone that he might consume them, yet by Moses intercession, the Lord did not consume the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but plagued them with a great plague and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and yet the holy man prayeth, hee would forgiue them as hee had done <hi>from Egypt till nowe.</hi> And what was it the Lord had said which Moses taketh hold on? namely, in verse 34. of that 32. of Exod. <hi>Goe nowe, bring the people vnto the place which I commanded thee, behold myne Angel shall goe before thee: but yet in the day of my visitation, I will visit their sinne vpon them.</hi> So as this place rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, yeeldeth no patronage to any such Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and wicked collection.</p>
            <p>Further, for the second obiection, that death remaineth though the sinne be pardoned. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18746:183"/>
it remaineth not as any satisfaction to the iustice of God to beleeuers;<note place="margin">Though death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine after sinne is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, both the fault and punishment is remoued</note> nor as a punishment of sinne to such as haue their sinnes remitted; but it hath lost his sting, which is the guilt of sinne; &amp; is become a remedie rather then a punishment, Phisicke rather then poison, an end of their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and an entrance into a better life. So as it still abideth firme against all such detestable deuises of Poperie, that remission of sinnes carrieth with it the remoouall of all the guilt and punishment of sinne to such as haue their parts in the same.</p>
            <p>And it is lastly to be obserued in this descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I say the guilt and punishment of <hi>all sinne</hi> is taken away: for if any be not remitted, they be either greater sinnes or lesser: to remit the lesser and not the greater, what were wee the better; how could our saluation be effected or perfected; how could grace be euery way grace? or doe we pray for remission of lesser, and not of greater also, seeing our selues must forgiue our brethren, not only lesser offences, but euen the greatest? Again, to remit the greater, and retaine the lesser, were to say that the Lord is either not so able, or so willing to forgiue lesser sinnes as greater. Shall a man frankly forgiue a debt of thousands of pounds, and will hee not forgiue also to the same partie a few pence?<note place="margin">A bundle of Popish blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</note> The Popish Church confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch, that many sinnes need no remission; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, which they say is not properly a sinne, albeit indeed, it is the mother sinne of all. And
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:18746:184"/>
all the heape of their veniall sinnes, which they say are not <hi>against,</hi> but <hi>besides</hi> the commandement, because they are not attended vnto, or deliberatly done with full c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ensent of reason: because they cannot hinder the <hi>habit</hi> of vertue, but the <hi>act</hi> of it, and that a verie little; nor turne vs from our end, but hinder so much as it is our progresse vnto it: and because they (though themselues displease God) yet they make not God displeased with the partie committing them, for they can stand with grace, and haue not properly and simply the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and respect of sinne or offence: therefore are they not to be punished with eternall but only temporarie punishment. These need not the blood of Christ, nor grace, nor confession in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, nor absolution, nor any new habit of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; but these are easily wiped away with a little holy water, or any meritorious worke, or by the Sacraments receiued, or by generall confession, or by a small humiliation; as knocking the brest, fasting, almes, the Lords prayer, an <hi>ave Maria,</hi> or by entring into a consecrated Church, or by a Bishops blessing: or if all these helpe but a little, presently after death they are all consumed in the fire of purgatorie. Oh horrible blasphemies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatorie to the blood of Christ which purgeth vs from <hi>all sinne</hi>; and to the truth of the Scriptures which teach vs that when <hi>we had nothing to paie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 18.32.</note> our Master <hi>forgaue vs our whole debt.</hi> But I haue follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them to farre, were it not that the discouerie
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:18746:184"/>
of their impieties may bring some profit to such as are not so well acquainted or exercised in their writings. Thus much of the description of this Grace.</p>
            <p>The second thing propounded, is what it is <hi>to receiue</hi> remission of sinnes? which because it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a gift or oblation, therefore we must know that pardon of sinne is offred generally to all in the word of grace publickly preached, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto beleeuers, not only in the beginning of their conuersion, but through their whole life. Now to receiue this remission, is when a capable,<note place="margin">How remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne is receiued.</note> that is, a contrite heart by faith (which is an hand taking in) receiueth Christ and all his benefits, (among which remission of sinnes is the cheefe) preached and published in the Gospel. And this it doth on this manner: 1. Vpon a touch of sinne, and sence, that without this gratious pardon there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is nothing but certaine perdition: the heart bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe beginneth seriously to meditate of the promise of mercie in Christ, and of the meanes of deliuerance from this wofull estate. 2. It desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to beleeue, and wisheth that mercie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to it selfe, it sendeth groanes to God, it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth for pardon, and weakly applieth the generall promises of grace. 3. After such desires and grones of the heart, the Lord most gratiously answereth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by his spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by little and little setleth, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etteth the heart, perswading it that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and consequently reconciliation with God
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:18746:185"/>
doth indeed belong vnto him, so as hee resteth in that assurance. Thus the Lord will not only giue vs mercie, but letteth vs know that hee doth so, that our ioy and peace, and boldnes in him might be more full.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the persons receiuing this remission, are <hi>all beleeuers. Whosoeuer beleeue in his name:</hi> whose faith intitles them to the maine promise of life,<note place="margin">Beleeue in the name of Christ, why.</note> and all other depending thereupon: they must beleeue <hi>in his name.</hi> For, 1. there <hi>is no other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> name to be saued by:</hi> In him alone is the matter of our saluation, seeing <hi>remission</hi> is <hi>obtained by his blood,</hi> Ephes. 1.7. 2. Hee alone is God and man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> both which natures are necessarie to our suertie: by the former, he hath power; by the latter, a right to vs, not only more generall of <hi>proprietie,</hi> as the Father and holy Ghost also haue; but more speciall of <hi>propinquitie,</hi> beeing our brother, and first borne of our family; the next of our kinred, and therefore of right belongeth to him to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our weake estate, as was figured in that law, Levit. 25.25. <hi>If thy brother be impouerished, and sell his possession; then his redeemer shall come, euen his neere kinsman, and buy out that which his brother sould.</hi> 3. Hee only was deputed of God to deriue life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and grace into vs as the head into the members: and therefore most meete it is, that whosouer would sucke and draw of his fulnesse, should <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from these words wee learne two instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18746:185"/>
1. What is the cheife thing which euery Christian must striue to obtaine while hee liueth in this world: namely, <hi>remission of sinnes.</hi> 2. What is his estate and condition that hath attained it. For the first, it is grounded in the text,<note place="margin">The cheife dutie of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian while he is in this world</note> because howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer remission of sins is here only named, yet in it are included al the other gracious mercies of God: not only all deliuerances, and freedome from the euills and punishments that attend vpon sinne, but euen all our redemption and saluation with the meanes of it, and blessings accompanying the same. And indeed, this is the summe or epitome of all Gods mercie, in which the Lord <hi>crowneth</hi> his Saints with compassion; a mercie which <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vp to heauen,</hi> and draweth them out of the most miserable thing in all the world; which is to lie vnder the curse and danger of sinne, and consequently, vnder the endles displeasure of the Almightie. Which point beeing euen as the one thing necessarie to be knowne and attained, I will stand a little longer vpon it, hoping to spend my time well in setting downe these fiue points. 1. the necessitie of remission of sinnes. 2. the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of it. 3. the Lettes of it. 4. the helpes to it. 5. the companions of it, by which as by so many notes we may know we haue it: and so we will adde the vse of the whole doctrine.</p>
            <p>First, the <hi>necessitie</hi> of it will appeare,<note place="margin">1. Necessitie of remission of sinnes in 3 points.</note> if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, 1. the multitude and abundance of our sins, which are to be remitted, beeing for number as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:18746:186"/>
our haires, and as the sand of the sea which is num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlesse; which cannot be other, seeing <hi>we drinke in sinne</hi> as the fish doth <hi>water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 15.16.</note> that is incessantly, for the fish ceasing to drinke in water, ceaseth to liue; neither can we cease to sinne, till we cease to liue. Nay, seeing our very best actions hold no corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the law of God; and in strickt iustice are no better then so many sinnes: this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration exceedingly multiplieth our sinnes; in that not only in fayling in, but in doing of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> duties we sinne incessantly against our God. 2. If we looke vpon the danger of sinne, we shall better see the necessitie of remission. It is a filthie lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie which infecteth the bodie and soule, the thoughts, speaches, and actions: it maketh a man a loathsome creature in the eyes of God; it maketh God our enemie, who is the fountaine of life, and whose lightsome countenance is better then life: yea, it maketh God depart from his creature, and destroie the workes of his owne fingers: it layeth the sinner open and naked to all the wrath of God, to all the curses of the law in this life, and in the life to come. It setteth him as a bute against whom the Lord in anger shooteth out of his quiuer all the arrowes of his displeasure. It is the only thing which vnremitted, maketh the sinner absolutely vnhappie, and euery way most accursed. Neither doth the whole heape of sinne only make the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner so miserable, but any one sinne euen the least vnpardoned, would for euer hold the sinner vnder perdi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:18746:186"/>
And more, all the men that euer were or shall be in the world, were neuer able to rise from vnder the burthen of one sinne, if it were imputed vnto them: and yet the most of the world see no part of this danger of sinne, and therefore no such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the remission of it. 3. Consider thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> owne insufficiencie, if thou hadst the strength and power of all men and Angels, to satisfie for the least sinne: and if we cannot satisfie for any, what remaineth but a fearefull perdition from the Lord, and from the glorie of his power, if all be not remitted. In one word, the sinner who hath not got his discharge sealed, is without all safetie in his life, all sound comfort in his death, and at the iudgement day, shall haue the sentence of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting torment with the Deuil and his angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him, before men and angels.</p>
            <p>The second point, is the <hi>benefits</hi> issuing from it,<note place="margin">Benefits flowing from remission of sinne. 4.</note> and these are: 1. <hi>peace of conscience,</hi> an immediat fruit of our iustification by faith, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God: Rom. 5.1. <hi>Beeing iustified by faith,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we haue peace with God:</hi> and it was ordinarie with our Sauiour to ioyne them together; as Luk. 7.47. <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, goe in peace.</hi> This bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the most know not what it meaneth, but hee that hath the feeling of the wrath of God against his sinne; and seeth nothing but an angrie face of God burning like a consuming fire; hee that is so straitned as hee can thinke no other thing but that the Lord in his iust iudgement hath cast him
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:18746:187"/>
quite away: this man, as of all other torments that can be suffered in the world hee lyeth vnder the greatest, so nothing in the earth can content or comfort him, but only the sence, and perswasion of Gods fauour. Now the conditions of peace with his God, are the most ioyfull tydings in all the world, as is the vnexpected newes of a pardon to a malefactor readie to execution for high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against his prince.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>right and possession also of life euerlasting:</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or if we be estated vnto life eternall by our iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and righteousnesse before God; then are we so also by remission of sinnes; because these two are confounded in the Scriptures, and are the same. Whence it is that the Apostle, Rom. 4.7. beeing to prooue the point of iustification of a sinner before God, without the workes of the law, citeth the text, Psal. 32.1. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiuen, and whose sinnes are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. And further, if our whole redemption put vs in possession of euerlasting happinesse; so doth also remission of sinne, seeing the Apostle in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie places confoundeth these two, and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth one by the other: Eph. 1.7. <hi>By whom we haue redemption through his blood, euen the forgiuenesse of our sinnes:</hi> Coloss. 1.14. <hi>In whom we haue redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through his blood, that is, the forgiuenesse of sinnes.</hi> And it must needs follow, that if they <hi>who are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and sanctified, are also glorified,</hi> then they haue attained the beginnings of their glorie, who haue
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:18746:187"/>
attained remission of sinnes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The benefit of Christs intercession, which meriteth all our good; for hee <hi>prayeth not for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> world, but those that are giuen him out of the world:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.19.</note> and this is no small benefit, seeing no part in the prayer of Christ, no part in his death: hee will not endure death for him for whom wil not vouchsafe to pray.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consolation in affliction, strength in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and assured comfort in life and death, are the sweete fruits arising from remission of sinne. For, 1. although afflictions entred with death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world by sinne, and in their nature are testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of Gods wrath; yet sinne being remitted, they proceed no further from God, as a iust iudge reuenging sinne, but from a mercifull father, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for triall of vs and our graces, or for chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to keepe vs from perishing with the world; to make vs hate sinne the more, to drawe vs nearer him in invocation and prayer, to force our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections out of this present world, to fray others from sinne by our example, to conforme vs to the image of his Sonne, and to shewe his mightie power in our weakenesse, by turning them to our best. And thus from the former consideration ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to the beleeuer euen in darkenes a great light. 2. From hence obtaineth the beleeuer notable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> strength and sense against the fierie darts of Satans temptations.<note place="margin">Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by this assurance.</note> For Satan vrgeth the poore sinner sundrie wayes, as 1. by the multitude and vilenesse of his sinnes, with which his conscience telleth
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:18746:188"/>
him he is couered: and thence inferreth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the wages of euerie sinne is death, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath deserued eternal death, he must needs perish, he can expect no other. But now can the beleeuer stoppe his mouth, &amp; say, I graunt Satan al thy premisses; no sinner is worthy of, or can expect saluation in or by himselfe, or so long as he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in sinne: but my sins are remitted by meanes of Christs satisfaction; and though in my selfe I am worthie to perish, yet in Christ I haue a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse to bring me to saluation. I continue not in my sinnefull estate, but am drawne out of the guiltinesse, the filthinesse, the seruice, the loue and liking of my sinnes, through the grace wherein I stand: and therefore thy consequent is false, I feare it not beeing so forcelesse. 2. From the iustice of God, who cannot but reiect whatsoeuer and whosoeuer is not fully conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his righteousnesse: but here the beleeuing heart is quieted, in that through remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes, the iustice of God is fully satisfied, though not by the person offending, yet in his pledge and surety Iesus Christ, who beeing <hi>iust,</hi> died for the <hi>vniust,</hi> that we might bee the righteousnesse of God in him. And hence the iustice of God is a matter of most comfort to the poore sinner, in that this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse cannot suffer him to demand satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on twise for one and the same sinne; for this direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fighteth with iustice and equitie. And if Satan be still instant, and say, But what shall an others
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:18746:188"/>
righteousnesse availe thee, if thy selfe be not a kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the lawe, <hi>for the soule that sinneth, that soule shall die:</hi> the beleeuing heart will readily answer: That although the lawe require proper and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obedience, yet the Gospel translateth it to the person of our suretie, who beeing God and man, not onely paid the whole debt, but performed all righteousnesse, absolutely fulfilling the whole lawe: whence it is that his obedience is called the <hi>fulfilling of the lawe for righteousnesse to euerie one that beleeueth:</hi> and himselfe was made vnder the law,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> that he might redeeme from it those that were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, Gal. 4.4. And whereas the tempter will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, But for all thy righteousnes thou hast innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable sinnes, originall and actuall, which the Lord hateth, and euery day addeth to the huge heape of them. The heart which holdeth this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of remission of sinnes, abideth vndaunted: for though it feele a bodie of sinne dwelling with it, yet is it not raigning sinne, it is not sinne at quiet, but daily battaile is maintained against it; it is sinne weakened, and in daily consumption; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall neuer be laid to the charge of him that is in Iesus Christ: Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that are in Iesus Christ: for the lawe of the spirit of life which was in Iesus Christ hath freed mee</hi> (though not from all molestation and presence, yet) <hi>from the lawe,</hi> that is the seruice and slauerie <hi>of sinne and of death,</hi> vers. 2.

righteousnesse of Christ are damned, and haue no benefit by it: and numbers haue reuoulted and fallen away, and why maist not thou: to which the beleeuer will readily answer, that those that were thus plucked vp, were neuer of the Fathers plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; onely infidels and vnbeleeuers haue fallen away, and withered for want of rooting and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; but I beleeue the remission of sinnes, not by any vngrounded perswasion, but with a sound, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and vnfayling faith, resting it selfe wholly vpon Christ; so as I am perswaded, neither death nor life can seperate me from his loue, the worke of whose spirit maketh me bold to call vpon God as my tender father; &amp; produceth the fruits of true faith and conversion into my whole life, whereby I know as infallibly the truth of my faith, as I know the presence of the sunne by his light, or of fire by his heate. Finally, he that hath begun to make me good,<note place="margin">The sound comfort of this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> wil make me also perseuere in goodnes. 3. This assurance of remission of sinnes, yeeldeth most assured comfort in life, and in death: the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> goodnesse of Pauls conscience, was his comfort when he stood at the barre, Act. 23.1. and 2. Cor. 1.12. <hi>This is our reioycing, euen the testimonie of our conscience:</hi> and in the agonie of death, this is the Christians comfort, that his sinne being remitted, the sting of death is gone; the locks of this strong Sampson wherein his great strength lay, are clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, and he is disarmed of his weapons which are our owne sinnes. So as a Christian may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:18746:190"/>
him into the field, and say, <hi>O death where is thy sting?</hi> which because hee is bereaued of, when he intendeth to kill, he cureth; when he doth his worst, which is to separate soule and bodie, he can seuer neither from Christ; nay rather hee sendeth the member of Christ, and setteth him nearer to his head, <hi>which is best of all.</hi>

An er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> iudgement, that no man can attaine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely to beleeue the pardon of his sinnes: for the common Protestant is a verie Papist in this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who hold that to doubt of this point is a vertue, and to beleeue it is presumption, because no man can certainely know it without a speciall reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so aske ordinarie Christians, doe yee beleeue the pardon of your sinnes, they will say yea, for God is mercifull, and they be not so many or great but they may bee pardoned. Hereby wee haue brought the partie to confesse that his sinnes bee pardonable; but vrge him,<note place="margin">Beleeuers may and must know the pardon of their owne sinnes.</note> are you sure they are pardoned; and here he is set vp, he stammers out a carelesse answer; he cannot surely tell, but hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth well, and this is all you can wring out of him: he knowes not whether Christ be in him or no, whether he be in the faith or no, he beleeues hee knoweth not what. But to let men see their error
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:18746:191"/>
herein. 1. doth not our text say, that men must receiue the remission of sinnes: and can any man receiue so pretious a gift from God, and not know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when, and how he came by it? 2. what is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that article in our creed which we professe, <hi>I beleeue the remission of sinnes:</hi> what beleeue wee more then the deuills, if we beleeue no more then that God forgiueth the sinnes of the elect, and not our owne; and then, how is this one of the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the Church? 3. to beleeue in the name of Iesus Christ in particular for remission of sinnes, <hi>is his commandement,</hi>

sinnes: which generall promise while we specially apply to our selues, the spirit begetteth this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But we are commanded stil to feare, <hi>Blessed is he that feareth alwayes.

            <p>A second <hi>let,</hi> is the want of iudgement to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne aright of the best things, and of resolution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to purchase or practise that which a truely enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med iudgement concludeth to bee the best. This was the sinne taxed in Martha, who sawe not the greatest good neere her, as Mary did. And the world is full of Marthaes, who willingly hurried with many earthly distractions, vtterly neglect the one thing necessarie; namely, their reconciliation with God, and the things which serue to vphold and maintaine the Christian life, whereby Christ should liue in them, and they in him. What else
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:18746:192"/>
is it that maketh men runne ouer sea and land to prouide for the bodie and bodily life, and in the meane time cast off all the care, and meanes of the knowledge of God, and conscience of their waies, but that they see no profit in seruing God? they tast a little sweetnesse of the creature, but not of the creator himselfe; a small peice of earth hath more sauour to them, then the God of heauen. This is it that causeth men to walke painfully all the weeke in their personall and particular calling, but all the weeke and sabbath too neglect the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall calling of a Christian: whereas had they any iudgement in the things of God, reason would teach them that the particular must yeelde to the generall, as the inferiour giue place to the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Yea, this is it which strongly forceth men to choose the profits and pleasures of this life,<note place="margin">Learne to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme euery thing in the measure and degree of it goodnesse.</note> which altogether crosse and hinder this cheife &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall care of gaining the fauour of God; because they doe not follow the rules of wisedome, which esteemeth of things according to their degree and measure of goodnesse, and not aboue. Which if men would giue themselues to bee ruled by, they would with the Saints of God in this comparison, account but meanely of the things in the highest account with earthly minded men. The Apostle Paul comparing his gaine of Christ with the gaine of the world, he esteemed this as losse, yea as dung, which indeede is the right estimate of it in this comparison.

            <p n="2">2. Whereas they say that others which nourish this care, are as much crossed as any other, and therefore they see no reason that they should make their life so vncomfortable to no purpose: let them know, that all the crosses Gods children, whose care is to make vp their peace with God, are exercised with, 1. proceed from the loue of God,<note place="margin">Godly life not to be feared for the crosses attending it.

I answer, this is indeed one of Satans greatest bolds, but such a snare as God leadeth his children out of in safetie: whome he teacheth that it is their happinesse to goe to heauen,<note place="margin">Better going to heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, then to hell with companie.</note> though alone, rather then to hell with companie.

And for those (especially if they be Ministers, who should most aduance this care) but disgrace it as a needlesse vexation of the spirit, let them know, that the Lord Iesus was of another mind, who pronounced blessednesse on those that <hi>mourne now,</hi> and promised that they should be comforted: and farre are they from the guidance of that spirit who hath taught vs, that of all sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces none is comparable to that of a broken spirit and contrite heart which the Lord neuer despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>

            <p n="5">V. The companions of remission of sinnes whereby it may easily be discerned, are fiue.<note place="margin">Companions of remission of sinnes.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The daily exercise of true repentance in all the parts of it: as, <hi>First</hi> in iudging ones selfe for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sinne past and present: and this was apparent in Paul himselfe, who looking backe to his former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, reckoned himselfe a captaine sinner, and the <hi>chiefe of all sinners,</hi> he saw in himselfe many sinnes, and great sinnes, which needed great mercie and

much forgiuenesse: the which one consideration kept him vnder continually, and fostered in him the grace of humilitie, when as otherwise through his aboundance of gifts and revelations, he might haue exalted himselfe out of measure. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in watchfulnes and feare of sinne in time to come, according to our Sauiours holy counsell, <hi>Thou art now made whole, goe thy way, and sinne no more. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> in daily purging and clensing from knowne and secret corruptions: many are the places wherein the pardoning and purging of sinnes are ioyned as inseparable: Ier. 33.8. <hi>I will cleanse all their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yea I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they haue sinned against mee:</hi> 1. Ioh. 1.9. <hi>If we confesse our sinnes, faithfull is he to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to cleanse vs from all our vnrighteousnesse.</hi> This was the summe of the baptisme, that is, the doctrine which Iohn preached,<note place="margin">Mark. 1.4.</note> euen <hi>amendement of life for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes:</hi> neuer hope of remission, vnlesse thou hungrest after this grace of repentance: for the Lord <hi>will not be mercifull to that man that blesseth himselfe in his sinnes,</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The <hi>second</hi> companion, is gladnesse and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of heart, yea an vnspeakeable ioy that the Lord hath done so great things for his soule, and made him so happie as to bring him from such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of miserie to partake in the wisedome, righteousnesse, holinesse, and redemption of Christ: for can a man haue a gift bestowed vpon
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:18746:195"/>
him of more price and vse then all the kingdomes of the world, and neuer find his heart made glad in it? or is it possible that he that findeth the pearle, can goe away without ioy? The Eunuch beeing conuerted, went away reioycing: and if euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer must reioyce; in another mans conversion, much more must he in his owne.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> is loue and thankfulnesse to God, which are enforced by this excellent grace, Luk. 7.47.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The poore woman that stood weeping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Christ <hi>loued much, because much was forgiuen her:</hi> Psal. 116.1. <hi>I loue the Lord, because hee hath heard my voice:</hi> and wherein the Lord had thus grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously dealt with him, the whole Psalme teacheth; especially vers. 8. <hi>Because thou hast deliuered my soule from death, mine eyes from teares, my feete from falling.</hi> Now if Dauid for a temporall deliuerance from Saul in the wildernesse, did thus prouoke his heart to the loue of God; how should the consideration of our spirituall deliuerance from sinne, death, and all hellish powers, blow vp these heauenly spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles in vs? And what can so liberall a loue beget in a good heart, but much thankfulnesse for appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of much mercie? how Dauid in the sence of mercie reaching to the pardon of his sinnes, melteth into the praises of God; see Psal. 103.1, 2, 3. &amp;c. And the Apostle Paul considering what a weight of corruption did still oppresse him, whereof hee expected to be fully eased, concludeth his comfort with <hi>thankes vnto God in Iesus Christ.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is a sound and sincere heart, hating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and striuing against all sinne, euen secret and small aswell as open and greater: Dauid in the Psal. 32.1. pronouncing him a blessed man whose iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is couered and whose sinne is pardoned: true, but it might be asked; how shall I know such a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man, or my selfe to haue attained that blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? The Prophet giueth vs this note to know him by in the next words: <hi>and in whose spirit is no guile:</hi> namely, to hide and foster any sinne, of which guile hee there directly speaketh.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> note or companion is a tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to forgiue our brethren priuate wrongs and iniuries, euen great as well as small: hee that hath ten thousand tallents forgiuen him, will not easily take his brother by the throat for two pence. The commandement is to <hi>forgiue one another,</hi> euen as God for Christs sake forgaue vs.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.32.</note> The example is set downe, Luk. 6.36. <hi>Be mercifull as your heauen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Father is mercifull,</hi> but hee forgiueth <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> is the first in forgiuenes, and <hi>perfectly</hi>; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth and forgetteth too.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:18746:196"/>
of mercie is, <hi>forgiue vs, as we forgiue, &amp;c.</hi> Thou wouldst haue God to forgiue thee all, and forget all, and to make thy wrongs against him as though they had neuer beene, goe then and doe so to thy brother, otherwise the threatning will meet thee, Iam. 2.13. <hi>Iudgement mercilesse to him that sheweth no mercie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. All this doctrine concerning this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle sheweth, that there is no other meanes in the world to be free from sinne, but by Gods free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of it. Whence it is that remission of sinne is called the <hi>couering of sinne,</hi> in that the faith of the heart laieth hold on Christ and his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Psal. 32.2.</note> who is our propitiatorie couering vs and our sinnes against the two tables, as the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie couered the arke, in which those tables were: without which couer, euery sinner is next to the deuill, and his Angels the most vile, and lothsome creature in the eyes of God. This vse must the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thought of; because neither the Papists nor yet the common and carnall Protestant yeeld consent vnto it. The <hi>Papist,</hi> he beleeueth that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sinnes are veniall and properly no sinnes:<note place="margin">Neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to this doctrine of free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which hee reckoneth concupiscence (which indeed is the mother sinne of all) and these need no remission. Hee holdeth also that men redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Christ, and hauing receiued the first grace of God, are now fitted to merit by their workes remission of their sinnes. And further, hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that because no man knoweth whether hee
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:18746:197"/>
haue workes inough to please God, no man can know that his sinnes are remitted. All which with many moe assertions like to these, are most blasphemous heresies against this most comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble article of free remission of sinnes through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in the name of the Sonne of God: which (so long as thus they hold them) cut themselues off from the remission of their sinnes by Christ, and consequently from the grace of life. But the <hi>common Protestant</hi> also contenteth himselfe with simple defences against his sinne, like Adams couer and garment of figgeleaues which will scarce hold the sewing. Some will hide their sins from mens eyes, and then all is safe: others striue to forget them, and hauing choked the voice of their conscience, they lie them downe securely, and neuer thinke to heare of them any more. Others couer grosse and foule sinnes, such as are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, contempt of his word, hardnesse of heart, hatred of the light, and all irreligion, with an outward ciuill life, and an honest conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation as it seemeth to be; not thinking that God seeth many a wicked heart through a ciuill life. Others will goe beyond the former in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging themselues sinners,<note place="margin">Lutum la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant luto, ignem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguunt lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum strue.</note> and will make some shew of making vp their peace; but it is with some ceremonie, or bodily exercise, they will fast, and pray, and giue some almes, or some mony to good vses when they die: but as for the grace of faith, which should be as a soule to quicken these actions,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:18746:197"/>
they neuer knew what that meant. But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer most men are carried headlong with such strong delusions as these; let no man that would not deceiue himselfe wilfully, thinke in any such course to meete with sound peace: nothing but the <hi>blood of Iesus his Sonne that clenseth from all sinne.</hi> In the garment of our elder brother only, we can carrie away the blessing: and our text teacheth vs, that remission of sinnes standeth not in the doing of any thing, but in the <hi>receiuing</hi> of it at the hands of Christ, by so many <hi>as beleeue in his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Is this so worthy a grace of so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vse and sweetenesse through the whole life,<note place="margin">All diligence must be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to make our pardon of sinne sure to our selues</note> then it standeth euery man in hand to labour, and giue all diligence to make sure vnto himselfe, the pardon of his owne sinnes. But lamentable it is to note the generall carelesnesse of men in a matter of such moment and consequence as this is. And surely it will prooue the great condemnation of the world, that whereas the whole liues of men are thought too short, and all their time too little to be eaten vp in worldly cares, which breake their sleepe, their strength, and often their braines, yea and their very hearts: onely the last day of all, and their dying day is scarcely deuoted to this care of seeking remission of sinne, and the way to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting. See we not how busie and earnest most men are in the infinite incumbrances of the world, whilest this one thing is the only thing neglected? May we not obserue how sure men deuise by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:18746:198"/>
counsell at their great charge, to make to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues their deedes, leases, bonds and other instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and assurances of the things of this life, who in all their liues scarse euer dreamed of this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? Oh how wilfully herein doe men forsake their own mercie, how carelesly do they cast out of their hands, the onely comfort of their life and death? Whosoeuer therefore thou art that hast hitherto dispised so great saluation, that hast set light by Gods gratious invitings to repentance, &amp; that hast frowardly reiected his kindest offers of mercy; now at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth begin to take vp shame in thy face, and sorrowe into thy heart: in earnest accuse the securitie of thy soule, the deadnesse of thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the hardnesse of thy heart, the vnthankefulnes of thy whole life: say with thy selfe, Ah my folly, that haue neglected my mercie so long: alas, how haue I hated instruction? how vnkindly haue I dealt with so louing and patient a God: I see now that it is high time to looke to the maine businesse of my life, to make vp my peace with God, to get my pardon sealed: I will hie me to the throne of grace, I will henceforth lay hold of life eternall: I see now that there is one thing necessarie, and that is the good part which I will choose, and which shall neuer be taken from me.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the second point propounded (which is the last of this worthy sermon) namely, what is the condition of euery one that hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this excellent grace of remission of sinnes:
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:18746:198"/>
and that is to be a blessed and happie man: for such a one hath part in Christ,<note place="margin">Whosoeuer hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned remissi- of his sinnes is an happie man.</note> and with him of forgiuenesse of sinnes; in which Dauid, Psal. 32.1. placeth blessednesse. <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can this man be a blessed man, seeing hee is compassed with a bodie of sinne and death, and subiect vnto infinite afflictions, then whom no man is in this life more miserable, no sort of men more perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inwardly with sence of sinne, none more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly disgraced for well doing. <hi>Answ.</hi> There be three degrees of blessednesse. 1. In this life,<note place="margin">Degrees of blessednesse.</note> when God bringeth his children into the kingdom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of grace, and giueth them his Sonne, and with him their whole iustification, and sanctification in part. 2. The second degree is in the end of this life, when God brings the soules of the faithfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to heauen, and their bodies to the earth, safely to be kept vntill the last day. 3. The third in and after the day of iudgement, when hee bringeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> both soule and bodie into the glorie prepared for the elect: Of this last which is <hi>happinesse</hi> by way of eminencie, the two former are certaine fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners, &amp; he that hath attained the first, hath also assurance of the last, and must needs be a blessed man, not only in time to come, but euen for the present, whether we respect his outward estate or inward. For his <hi>outward</hi> estate, Gods blessing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer faileth him, but affoardeth him all good things, and that in due season, and in due measure: his riches are often not great, but euer pretious: and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:18746:199"/>
his little shall nourish him, and make him as well liking as the water and pulse did the Iewish chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Chaldaea. The same prouidence which watcheth to supplie all his good, keepeth him from all euill; it pitcheth the Angels round about him to guard his life; let him be persecuted, hee is not forsaken; his losses become his gaine; his sicknesse is his phisicke; his heart is cheared euen in trouble, which maketh that part of his life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; his soule is bound vp in the bundle of life with God; death shall not come before hee can bidde it heartily welcome: yea, let violent death come, it shall not be to him deadly: slaine he may be, but not ouercome: victorie attendeth him, and blessednesse euery where abideth him. But all this is the least part of his blessednesse: for if we looke yet a little more inwardly into him, we shall see the boundlesse extent of his happinesse farre more large: whether we respect the spirituall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie hee hath escaped; or else the spirituall good which with the pardon of his sinnes hee hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: for on the one hand, hee hath escaped the heauie wrath of God due to sinne; and so is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of an infinit debt, healed of a most deadly poyson, and pardoned from a fearefull sentence of eternall death and perdition readie to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon him: and on the other, hee hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a plentifull redemption; hee hath purchased the pearle, receiued Christ with his merits and graces, such as are wisedome, faith, hope: whence
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:18746:199"/>
issue our peace and ioy of heart which is heauen before heauen (for in these stand the kingdome of God) and the comfort of a good conscience which is a continuall feast.

If the tower of Siloam fall on any of them, they are thenceforth greater sinners then all other men: holy Iob because hee was afflicted, cannot avoid the note of an hypocrit euen among his owne friends and visiters. And no meruaile if the members looke thus blacke when the sunne looketh vpon them; seeing their head Christ himselfe was reiected, because they sawe and <hi>iudged him to be plagued and smitten of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53.4.</note> But we must looke beyond all these as the Lord himselfe doth, who in his iudgement goeth beyond the outside, and pronounceth sentence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace which himselfe worketh within. Let vs imitate our Lord Iesus who notwithstanding all the infirmities, yea and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities

of his Church, pronounceth of her, that shee is all faire, and no spot is in her, not because there are none, but) because all are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and none are reckoned and imputed vnto her: yea let vs remember that the pure and holy spirit of God is contented notwithstanding much blackenesse, to take vp his lodging in those hearts where he findeth raigning sinne dispossessed. Now how farre are they from the mind and iudgement of this blessed Father, Sonne, and Spirit; who haue nimble eies to spie out euery infirmitie of Gods children to blase them: nay rather then they will not accuse and slander them, can of themselues coine, raise vp, and impute vnto them that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are most innocent. Assuredly these are of neere kindred to the devill, who is the accuser of the brethren. And surely were Christ on earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, euen this most innocent lambe of God should not want accusers, wherein are so many of Cains constitution,<note place="margin">The glory of God in his children tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into shame.</note> who hate their brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their workes are good; and so many sonnes of men, who seeke to turne the glorie of God in his children into shame. Alas, religion is at a lowe ebbe alreadie, and not so reckoned of as it should be by the forwardest, and yet so malitious is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in his instruments, as vnlesse this smoaking flaxe also be quenched, we can see nor heare of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope or treatie of peace: the beautie of Gods people goeth disgraced vnder titles of nicenesse, precisenesse, puritie, holy brotherhood, and the

To goe ordinarily to sermons, is to bee a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-munger: not to sweare, is the next way for a man not to bee trusted: and except a man be as blacke and deformed as either the deuill is or can make him, by drinking, swearing, gaming, sabbath-breaking, and casting off all care of ciuill honestie as well as godlines, he may sit alone well enough, he hath a great many neighbours that care but a little for his companie. What can make it more euidently appeare, that numbers there are in this age who neuer knewe, and without Gods infinite mercie in their timely conuersion, are neuer like to knowe what the blessednesse of remission of sinne meaneth, neither in others, nor yet in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
