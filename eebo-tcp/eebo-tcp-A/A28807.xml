            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Pamphlet (ſince it is moſt certain, that if that be not, then they are moſt ſeditious,) but contrary to the Law of the Land, both anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern, both to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and to the Petition of Right, vex and impriſon His good ſubjects for a legall obedience to His le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall commands, or a legall diſobedience or diſreſpect to their illegall Orders and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſince He often before foretold, that their Contempt of His Regall Rights and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, which are the guard of His Subjects Liberties, would in ſhort time encourage them to deſtroy thoſe too, when that which ſhould guard them were oure deſtroyed. And as little doth His Majeſtie wonder that the Inſolence of thus violating ancient and known Laws ſhould encourage them to that of uſing words proportionable to their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and profeſſing (with great truth and ingenuity) that they value not the Law. His Majeſtie nevertheleſſe (not following the example of other men in concluding any thing before examination) is reſolved to have the truth of theſe allegations legally exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and if (as is very probable by the annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Affidavit</hi>) they be found true, to provide by all legall wayes, That both His Majeſtie
