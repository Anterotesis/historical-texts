            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER in God, RICHARD, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his Grace, Primate and Metropolitane of all England, and one of his Maiesties most Honorable Priuie Councell, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He loue and dutie which I owe to this Church of England (most reuerend Father) haue put into my hand this Oliue branch, that is an exhortation to holy obedience, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able resolutions, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue beene the crowne and glorie of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. For when I pondered with my selfe how some of the Ministerie stand vnresolued, and that (as I take it) because they doe not duly consider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things indifferent, and the dutie of a subiect to his Soueraigne; I must confesse that my bowels of compassion were mooued, and the fire of affection was kindled within me. And therefore although many learned and iudicious men haue richly and
<pb facs="tcp:12689:3"/>
plentifully handled this argument, yet in commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of those my brethren, I also haue aduentured to cast my poore mite into the treasurie, hoping that as they walke amongst the fruitfull trees, they will not disdaine to pull a little berrie from the lowest shrub. The principall marke I shoote at, is to doe my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to settle the tender and trembling consciences of those which are not wedded to their owne conceits, but haue bene carried away rather of weaknesse then of wilfulnesse, that such of them as it shall please the Lord, may be reduced to the Tabernacles of peace, and follow the trueth in loue. For alas who can but lament to see so many spend their short and precious time, in such scandalous prosecution of ciuill conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and some of them not altogether vnlike to <hi>Platoes Euthyphro,</hi> who in his inconsiderate <note place="margin">Plato in Euthyphr.</note> course went in all haste to accuse his own father? But this Church (God be thanked) neuer wanted a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> to encounter and conuince them, and make manifest to the world that they erred by misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and vnaduised zeale. O how much better had it beene to haue continued their labours in the Lords vineyard, and by bending their vnited forces against Babylon, to haue fought the Lords battails, to the comfort of the godly, who then might haue celebrated their triumph, erected their trophae, and decked their
<pb facs="tcp:12689:3"/>
victorious heads with lawreall garlands? O what a griefe ought this to be to their soules; so to oppose themselues against such a learned and religious Church, and so vnreuerently to traduce that holie Booke of Common Prayer, a worke of so great and admirable excellencie? concerning which, I may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme, that it hath beene cut vp like an anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, euery vaine of it hath beene opened, euerie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner searched, euery rubricke ransacked, not a word but hath beene weighed in the ballance, not a syllable but hath bene sifted to the vttermost: and yet for all this like to the bridge of <hi>Caesar,</hi> the more it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned <note place="margin">Caes. de bello Gall. lib. 4.</note> the stronger it stands. The ceremonies wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may aptly be resembled to the altar erected by the tribe of <hi>Reuben, Gad,</hi> and the halfe tribe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioshua 22.</note> vpon the passages of Iordan, at which the rest of the tribes were grieuously offended, imagining that it had beene for sacrifice: But when they were truely informed that it was onely for a memoriall that they had a part in the God of Israel, they were well content, they blessed God, and <hi>Phinehas</hi> said: <hi>This day we perceiue the Lord is among vs,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vers. 31.</note> because you haue not done this trespasse. In like maner, some of our brethren haue beene offended at our ceremonies, vpon an erroneous imagination of Poperie and superstition; but the Church of England
<pb facs="tcp:12689:4"/>
hath often manifested her innocencie, and cleared herselfe of those imputations. And therefore we hope that one day their eies being opened, and their soules satisfied, they will with the Princes of Israel blesse God, and say with <hi>Phinehas, This day we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the Lord is among vs, because you haue not done this trespasse.</hi> For the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance whereof, I doe in all humilitie present this Oliue branch vnto your Grace, whose eminent wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and godly care in suppressing innouations, and preseruing the well setled state of this flourishing Church, is most apparent. And therefore as God hath directed the heart of our religious Souereigne, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish you the chiefe Pastor and Father of our Church, so I beseech the Almightie to vouchsafe this fruit to your labours, that your Grace may see the weake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, the wilfull relented, the wandring reduced, and all of them returned to the bosome of the Church, like the Doue to the Arke, with leaues of Oliue in their mouths, in token that all gall and bitternesse being laid aside, the swelling flouds of discord are asswaged.</p>

            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y heartie desire and praier is to <note place="margin">The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded scope of this Sermon.</note> Almightie God the Father of mercy, that he would so blesse the Ministerie of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that we all being linked in loue as it were with chaines of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant, might with one heart and one hand, religiously build the Temple of the Lord, reuerently performe holy obedience to God and the Prince, careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keepe our selues vnspotted and vnstained of this present world, and faithfully feed the flocke of Iesus Christ, that depends vpon vs. The comfortable accomplishment wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whosoeuer shall maliciously hinder, let him take heed lest a fearefull curse from the God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> come like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his bowels, and like oile into his bones; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall praie for the peace of Ierusalem, peace be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and mercy, and vpon the Israell of God. The fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of which blessings to the glory of Christ and the good of the Church (men and brethren beloued in the Lord) is the marke I aime at, and the scope I intend, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12689:5"/>
we all like obedient children, may keepe the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now this present Sermon by Gods gracious assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <note place="margin">The diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> shall be diuided into two generall parts: The first an explication; The second an application; a briefe applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the text, and a more ample application of the text to the present estate of the Church of England, of which two points in order, beseeching the God of all grace and peace to grant vs a blessing.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And first who spake these words? It is plaine that <note place="margin">Who spake these words. To whom, and vpon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. 2. Pet. 1. 20. 21. 1. Cor. 1. 2. Rom. 15. 4.</note> the holy Apostle S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And seeing the holy men of God (as in the old Testament so doubtlesse in the new) spake not by priuate motion but <hi>as they were mooued by the holy Ghost:</hi> Therefore we may truely say that the spirit vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered these words by the mouth of <hi>Paul.</hi> But to whom were they spoken? <hi>vnto the Church of God which is at Corinth, and to them that are sanctified, in Christ Iesus. Now what things soeuer were written before time, were written for our learning.</hi> Therefore these things concerne not the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth onely, but the Church of England, the Church of Geneua, and all the Churches of the Saints. Wherefore he that hath an eare let him heare what the spirit saith vnto the Churches. <hi>Let all things be done honestly and by order.</hi> For the plainer accesse whereunto, let vs first consider the coherence with that which went before. The holy Ghost in this Chapter intreateth of certaine spirituall gifts and graces, by many reasons aduancing the gift of Prophecie aboue the gift of tongues: where by the way, it must bee obserued, that by Prophecying is not meant foretelling things to come, but the word of <hi>edification, exhortation, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 3.</note> 
               <hi>consolation,</hi> that is, the Preaching of the Gospell. In hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of which argument, it pleased the spirit to interlace cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine points of Church gouernment concerning the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke performance of Prayer, thankesgiuing, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. passim.</note> vnfolded in these three branches. First, they which speake publikely in the Church, must speake in a <hi>knowne</hi> 
               <note place="margin">v. 27. v. 29.</note> 
               <hi>tongue,</hi> or if they speake with <hi>strange tongues</hi> there must be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12689:5"/>
an <hi>interpreter:</hi> Secondly, those which Prophecie, <hi>must</hi> 
               <note place="margin">v. 30 32.</note> 
               <hi>speake two or three, and let the other iudge:</hi> If one sitting by haue a <hi>reuelation, let the former hold his peace,</hi> and the spirit of the Prophets must be subiect to the Prophets. Thirdly, those which publikely performe these duties must be men, and not women, for <hi>women must keepe silence in the Church.</hi> Now the spirit hauing thus as it were <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="6">6 Necessarie I call that which the eternall God hath in his word precisely and determinately commanded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, <note place="margin">The first obseruation,</note> either expresly or by infallible consequence. Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which the Lord hath not so commanded nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but is contained in the holy Scripture, rather potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally then actually, comprehended in generall directions, not precisely defined by particular determinations. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God hath in his Word precisely commanded, so farre as it is commanded is necessarie to be done, for the not doing of it is a sinne. Whatsoeuer God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, so long as it is forbidden, is necessarie to bee left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, for the very doing of it is a sinne. Whatsoeuer is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded nor forbidden, that (whether it concerne Church or common-wealth) is left to the Lords vicegerents vpon earth, who according to the exigence of the state, may by their discretion command it to be done, or to be left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and both without sinne. In the holy Scripture some things were commanded for a season, as the sacrifices of the <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:12689:6"/>
Law: forbidden for a season, as the meats mentioned in the xj. of <hi>Leuiticus:</hi> Indifferent for a season, as the place of ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting altars before the fabricke of the Tabernacle. Some things were euerlastingly commanded, as to feare God, and to keep his commandements: euerlastingly forbidden, as all sinne and wickednesse: euerlastingly left indifferent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many examples might be giuen, in meate, drinke, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and matters of such outward condition and qualitie. For some things are correspondent to the Law written in our hearte, that is, the Law of humane nature, which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the originall beautie and brightnesse is the same in substance with the Law Morall, and these are in their owne nature good and euerlastingly to bee imbraced: some things are repugnant to it, and these are in their owne nature euill and euerlastingly to be abhorred. Some things the sacred Law of our nature hath left arbitrary, and these are in themselues and of their owne nature indifferent. But it must bee noted that such things as the Law of nature hath left indifferent, may notwithstanding become neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie by the force and vertue of some other comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement diuine, as for example: The eating of Swines flesh <note place="margin">Leuit. 11. 7.</note> is a thing in the owne nature indifferent: yet there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie laid vpon the Iewes to forbeare it, because it was forbidden by the Law ceremoniall, which Law ceasing, that necessitie ceased, and so it returned to the originall estate, and became indifferent, as in nature so in vse. Likewise, to drinke wine, or to abstaine from it, is a thing in nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but being sanctifyed by the Lord Iesus to a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall vse, it is not in the power of man to cancell or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull the holy institution of that heauenly Lawgiuer. And heere it must be considered, that there are some comely rites and decent orders whereof we finde not precise comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in the holy Scripture, which notwithstanding the Scripture testifieth to haue beene very precisely obserued by the Apostles and apostolicall men; and are of such na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they agree to all places and ages: in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, they may aptly be reduced to things necessary: because
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12689:7"/>
the holy Ghost so exquisitely recording the exact obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them by the blessed Apostles, may seeme to haue pointed them out to all posteritie, as a patterne to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably followed. This is the iudgement of M. <note n="1" place="margin">Cal. inst. lib. 4. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Caluin</hi> concerning imposition of hands in the consecrating to holie orders. <hi>Although</hi> (saith he) <hi>there be extant no certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of imposition of hands yet because we see that it was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vsed of the Apostles, that their so exact obseruation should be to vs in place of a precept.</hi> So concerning the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of the Sabaoth, from the Saturday to the Lords day, it is certaine that there is no speciall commandement in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; yet because God hath commanded that the seuenth day shall be kept <note n="2" place="margin">Exod. 20. 8 Esay 58. 13.</note> 
               <hi>holy and glorius</hi> to himselfe, and because the Iewish Sabaoth was a <note n="3" place="margin">Colos. 2. 16. 17.</note> 
               <hi>shadow</hi> and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect abrogated; and sorasmuch as it was translated in the Apostles time, and that without all doubt by appostolicall authoritie, seeing the Scripture doth witnesse that the <note n="4" place="margin">Reu. 1. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Lords day</hi> was not only renowned with diuine reuelations, but also obserued by the <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2.</note> Apostles themselues: And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it standeth vpon such excellent reasons, as are vniuersall for all places, and perpetuall for all times, being (as it were) consecrated by the reuerent consent of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world; therefore this practise may be vnto vs in stead of a precept: It may be reputed a thing necessarie, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be changed. Now to apply these distinctions to our present purpose, the religious duties of which we speake, are the precise and euerlasting commandements of Iesus Christ, in regard of their substance, as may appeere, first in preaching and baptising: <note n="5" place="margin">Matth. 28. 19. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Goe teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, (and) behold I am with you alwaies vntill the end of the World.</hi> I am with you my Disciples and Apostles in teaching and Baptising, I am with you vntill the end of the world. But it is a cleere case, that the Apostles did not liue vntill the end of the the world, therefore the meaning of it is, I am with you, and your successours the lawfull Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, vntill the end of the world. Wherefore the promise
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12689:7"/>
is petpetuall, and consequently the dutie of teaching and baptising. So in the other Sacrament, <note n="6" place="margin">Luke 22. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me:</hi> there is a commandement for the celebration of the Lords supper: &amp; when <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of <hi>shewing forth the Lords death vntill his</hi> 
               <note n="7" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 26.</note> 
               <hi>comming;</hi> hee declareth that the former commandement is perpetuall. Wherfore that there shall be a Ministerie in the Church visible to teach the word, and to Minister the holy Sacraments, is the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting ordinance of Iesus Christ. Notwithstanding in euery one of these branches, there is somewhat indifferent. That there shall be a Ministrie is a thing necessarie, and it is <note n="8" place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 16.</note> 
               <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie</hi> that they feed the flocke of Iesus Christ: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they shall execute their publike function in a white garment, or a blacke, God hath neither commanded nor forbidden, he hath left it as a thing indifferent. Likewise, to Baptise, is the perpetuall commandement of Iesus Christ: but whether the water shall be in a font, or a bason, whether to be applied by dipping or sprinkling once or thrice, God hath neither commanded, nor forbidden, he hath left it as a thing indifferent. In like maner the celebration of the Lords supper is a thing commanded: but whether the bread shall be leauened or vnleauened, whether it shall be baked in a loafe, or in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ake, round or square, God hath neither commanded nor forbidden, he hath left it as a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. So in the second course of this celestiall banquet <note n="9" place="margin">Matth. 26. 27. 29.</note> the cup is necessarie, the Popish withholding whereof is the violating of Gods holy ordinance, But as M. <hi>Caluin</hi> saith, <note n="10" place="margin">Cal.

               <hi>Rubrum in album nihil refert,</hi> that is the kinde or colour of the wine, be it red or white is not materiall to the being of the Sacrament.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a cleere case, that some things are necessarie, some things indifferent. Things necessarie, are the weightier matters of the Law: Things indifferent may be well compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Commin.</hi> Things necessarie are registred

in the Tables of the Almightie, that is, in the volumes of holy Scripture, (for whatsoeuer is necessarie for mee either to beleeue, or to doe, or to leaue vndone, that I may please God in this life, and inherit glorie in the life to come. All that is richly contained in holie Scripture, either directly, or by inuincible consequence:) but things indifferent are there rather in an vnlimited generalitie then in any distinct and particular maner. Finally things necessarie God hath reserued to himselfe, no men, no <note n="1" place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> Angels haue authoritie to alter them: But things indifferent being of a <note n="2" place="margin">Caluin.

Wherein the spirit speaking to the Churches, willeth all things to be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a good maner: not defining what maner, but referring all to the discretion of the Church, so things be ordered in an honest and decent maner.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Secondly, when the spirit saith vnto the Churches, <note place="margin">The second obseruation.</note> 
               <hi>Let all things be done decently.</hi> It may bee demanded, who shall be the iudge of dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ncy? To me it seemeth an honest and decent ceremonie, to kneell at the holie Communion: some others do rather delight to receiue <note n="4" place="margin">Admon. &amp; T.

Now in this varietie of opinions, who shall be the iudge? who shall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and swaie the matter? Surely, they whom the Lord hath made Church gouernours. If priuate men will make publike orders, and require vs to accept of them, they must shew their commission: Otherwise we must take that for decent in things indifferent, which seemeth decent in the eie of publike authoritie. And verilie for priuate men to range without the compasse of their calling, and vpon their priuate opinions, to controle the publike iudgement of the Church, in a matter of decencie, is in mine opinion a matter very vndecent. Likewise, seeing the spirit hath said, <hi>Let all things be done by order;</hi> therefore doubtles in the Church of God there must be an order. But who shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12689:8"/>
this order? shall euery man doe what he list? that were disorder. Shall priuate men make publike constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? that were against good order. Therefore it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they onely haue authoritie to make Church orders, whom the Lord hath made Church gouernours. Now in an absolute kingdome, as this of <note n="6" place="margin">S. Edw. Cook. de iure Regis eccl.</note> England, the King by the law of God, is the onely supreme gouernor of all <note n="7" place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. 1.

            <p n="8">8 Thirdly, though Church gouernours may make Church lawes, yet they may not establish what they list. God hath <note n="9" place="margin">Non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misit nobis vagam effre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemque licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, sed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cello<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All their Canons must be framed according to the generall Canons of the holie Scripture, which may aptly bee reduced to these two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in my text. <hi>Let all things be done honestly and by order:</hi> First, honestly, that is (as was before declared) in decent sort, with relation to the glorie of God, and the edification of the Church, without scandall. Secondly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to order, for God is the God of order, and not of eonfusion. Now if all things in the Church must be done decently, then nothing may be established which is base or beggerly: The ceremonies of the Church though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alwaies be costly, yet they must alwaies be comely. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if all things bee decent, then religious solemnities must be performed with grauitie: magnificent they may be and sumptuous, according to circumstance of time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and place: but alwaies without vanitie, without luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pompe, or meretricious brauery. If all things must be done to the glory of God, then nothing may be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in superstitious or idolatrous maner, for that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the glory of his maiestie: then nothing must be established contrarie to the Scripture, for that were repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the glory of his wisedome: then things indifferent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12689:9"/>
must be established as indifferent, not as meritorious or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorie, not as necessarie to diuine worship, to iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <note n="1" place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.

If all things must bee done to edification, then the ceremonies of the Church must not be <hi>darke and dumbe, but so</hi> cleerely <hi>set foorth, that euery man may know what they meane,</hi> and to what <hi>vse they serue.</hi> If all things must be done to edification, then Church gouernors must duly intend the soules health of Gods people, framing all their Canons for the common good. To which purpose the Church of Iesus Christ vseth her ceremonies, either to imprint in mens mindes some reuerend mysterie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as when she appointed thrice <note n="2" place="margin">Tertul. de coron. mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis cap. 3.</note> powring on of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Baptisme, signifying the trinitie of the persons, or once to <note n="3" place="margin">

Finally, euen things of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior regard, must in their kinde tend to edification.

Yea the very Pulpets and seats must beso pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as euery man may conueniently heare: so euery thing according to his nature and degree must be referred to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. If all things must be done without scandall, then nothing which is sinfull may be established: for all sinne is of scandalizing nature; yea euen things indifferent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is apparant danger of superstition or idolatrie, are to be

If all things must bee done in order, then the Lay-man must not bee suffered to intrude himselfe into the office of a Minister, in ministring the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: nor the inferior Minister to vsurpe that which belongeth to the Bishop, but euery man must keepe his owne ranke, and therein proceed according to order. And that no maruell, seeing the whole fabricke of the World, both the celestiall orbes and the globe of elements are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and vpholden by order.

Therefore if an Ecclesiasticall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non be made of a matter lawfull, in a lawfull maner, to a lawfull end, by lawfull authoritie, according to the generall rules of Scripture, containing in it nothing repugnant to Scripture, nothing contrarie to faith or good maners, then that law is approoued in the sight of the Almightie: and seemeth to <note n="8" place="margin">Colligere promptum est has posteriores (ecclesiasticas) non esse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendas pro hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doquidem fundaetae sint in hoc generali mandat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

First we are not tied to this or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12689:10"/>
that paterne, but being within our selues a Church, not depending vpon any other: our Church gouernors haue libertie to establish whatsoeuer (being in it selfe indifferent) shall to their wisedome seeme most expedient; alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that all things bee done honestly and in order. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this is our libertie, that things indifferent being established, we <hi>retaine them</hi> not as a part of diuine worship, not as meritorious or satisfactorie, not as necessarie to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or saluation, but onely <note n="1" place="margin">Treatise of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> 
               <hi>for discipline and orders sake.</hi> Thirdly, if there shal happen <hi>any contempt or irreuerence,</hi> they may be altred and changed, by lawfull authoritie, which may likewise <note n="2" place="margin">Act for vniformitie.</note> 
               <hi>ordaine and publish such further ceremonies or rites as may bee most for the aduancement of Gods glory,</hi> and therefore they are not established as perpetuall, but so long as in the eie of publike iudgement they shal seeme conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent &amp; profitable for the Church of Christ. But some perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture will replie and saie: If things indifferent be such, as God hath not commanded, why then should the Church <note n="3" place="margin">Where it is destitute of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement it may not presume by any decree to restraine that libertie vvhich the Lord hath giuen. T. C. lib. 1. pag. 152.</note> presume to impose them vpon vs, and so abridge our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which God hath not abridged? I answer, that it is no presumption at all, but the lawfull vse of lawfull authority. For things are either commanded of the Lord, or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or left indifferent. That which God hath certainely commanded, man may not forbid: that which God hath certainely forbidden, man may not command or impose by any law. For that in the iudgement of S. <hi>Austin</hi> deseru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the name of a <note n="4" place="margin">Non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim iura di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenda sunt aut putanda iniqua ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituta.

Againe, if authoritie command the same thing which God commandeth, or forbid that which he hath forbidden, this is not the enacting of a new law, but a dutifull declaration and due execution of Gods law. But those things which God hath neither commanded nor forbidden, he hath left to be disposed by the law of man. In which case the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne may command his subiect, and the Church her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and it is the dutie of the inferiour therein to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. He that denieth this, taketh away the Sunne out of the world, dissolueth vniuersally the fabricke of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12689:11"/>
ouerthroweth families, corporations, Churches, and kingdoms, and wrappeth all things in the dismall darknesse of Anarchie and confusion. And though this be in some sort the abridging of thy libertie, yet it is for the common good, and according to the rules of equitie, and the Prince or Church in so commanding thee, doth no further abridge thy libertie then God doth allow them to abridge it.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Lastly, when it is said vnto the Churches, <hi>Let all things be done,</hi> it is plaine that this dutie is laid vpon the <note place="margin">The fift ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation.</note> Church to prouide that these things bee effectually done; and consequently, that God which gaue her this charge, hath armed her with authoritie. She may censure disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent children: God hath giuen to his Church in all ages, not onely a rule for direction, but a rodde of correction: this is the iudgement of all learned men, as appeeres by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the whole Christian world. And thus much of the explication, and so I come to the application.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Hitherto you haue seene the ballance of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary: Now it remaineth that the Canons and Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> of our own Church be weighed &amp; examined in this bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. Wherein, although I acknowledge that lawes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly established doe rather require obedience then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: yet because the lawes vnder which wee liue, are such (God be thanked) as need not to shunne the light: and forasmuch as many (otherwise vertuous and well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed mindes, and some of them very learned and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Church of Christ) while they haue trauelled in waightier matters, haue mistaken somethings of lesser mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Therefore giue me leaue in the spirit of meeknesse to instruct them that are contrarie minded: which I doe not to call the present lawes in question, I haue no such mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but to quiet and settle the vnresolued conscience, that that we may all performe cheerefull obedience to God and the Prince. And if any man thinke that this discourse were more seasonable in an assemblie of Ministers, let them consider; First, that this famous auditorie is furnished with a great number of the Ministerie: Secondly, that this is the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12689:11"/>
place of iurisdiction: Thirdly, that the handling of these points is very profitable for the people; for the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the authoritie of the Prince in things indifferent, is the very foundation of Christian obedience. And though I know that the handling of these points is very subiect to censure, yet for my brethrens sake of the Ministrie, my hart is turned within me, and my bowels of compassion are row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, and therefore I am resolued to wade through honour and dishonor, good report and bad report, for the workes sake which I couet to performe. Now this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Gods grace shall bee diuided into three generall parts. First, a declaration, that in the Church of England the principall points (for the time will not suffer mee to speake of all) are established, <hi>honestly and in order.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a confutation of certaine generall exceptions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. Thirdly, an exhortation to keepe the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace. And to begin with the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; let vs first declare the order which our church vseth in making of Church orders.</p>

            <p n="14">14 Concerning inferiour Ministers, the first point to be pondered, is their ordination: For which purpose the place is famously known, being either <note n="5" place="margin">Can. 31.</note> the cathedral church or the parish Church, where the Bishop resideth.

               <hi>Ieiunia quatuor temporum,</hi> commonly called Ember weeks, which by the wisedome of our Church, are consecrated to a most excellent vse, that all the people of the land should fast and praie, that the Lord would blesse his Church with learned Ministers, and send foorth woorthy labourers into his haruest. This is apparent by our Canons and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and surely it is an honest, a decent, a holie and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly preparation.</p>

honestlie and in order.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Concerning their learning, our desire is, that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie parish the Word of God might abound like Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, and as Iordan, in the time of haruest; that the doctrine of the Gospell might shine as the light, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow as Geon in time of vintage: plant (O Lord) we beseech thee, if it be thy pleasure, in euery parish a learned Minister: O Lord let thy <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummin</hi> be with thy holy ones, that they may teach <hi>Iacob</hi> thy iudgements, and <hi>Israel</hi> thy law. But (beloued in the Lord) it is one thing to speake of these things in speculation, and another when we come to practise: A Carpenter may contriue in his head a most exact and curious building; but when he comes to the point he can make it no better then his timber will suffer. The Defendour of the Admonition about thirtie three yeeres ago, auouched that <note n="8" place="margin">T. C. lib. 1. pag. 40. vide Arch. pag. 140.</note> 2000. <hi>sufficient Preachers which preach and feed diligently, were hard to be found in this Church.</hi> Admit this were true, and seeing there be in England about 10000. parishes, suppose that libertie had beene granted to this great Reformer, to haue reduced the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to his imagined platforme, what would he haue done? should 2000. Parishes haue beene furnished euerie one with a sufficient Preacher, and 8000. beene left forlorne, without publike Praying, or Preaching, or reading diuine Seruice? Should they haue had none, none at all, either to minister the Communion, or to Baptise their children? This had beene rude, and barbarous, and the high way ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Atheisme, or to Paganisme. Should one man haue had fiue benefices? That were contrarie to his owne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for so ech parish should haue had but the fift part of a Preacher. Should there haue beene a generall dissolution of parishes, and fiue reduced to one? Alas that had beene a wofull and lamentable reformation. What then remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but onely that which the Church of England approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that is, to be sparing in the former points, and to admit some into the Ministery of meaner, though tolerable sufficiencie, till it please God that our famous Vniuersities,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12689:13"/>
which haue already furnished many, may by Gods grace send out their crystall streames to water the rest of the land. And surely it were to bee wished, that some greater incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement were giuen to learned men, by encreasing their maintenance: For alas, it is notoriously knowne, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Church liuings haue beene so pared to the quicke, that now they are hardly able to yeeld vitall nourishment, so sharpely haue they beene launced and lost their best bloud. But God bee blessed, who hath put into the heart of his Maiestie, a holie endeuour to cure the Church of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption: the father of mercy giue a blessing vnto it, and the Lord grant that the Nobilitie and Gentrie of this land may follow his roiall example, and that euerie one in his degree may set his heart and hand to the further building of the Lords Temple. In the meane time I must needs say, that there are not a few in the Vniuersities, graue, learned, and vertuous, which might be imploied abroad, but onely that sundrie Patrons preferre a golden purse before a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wit. Wherein I would to God that such as are indued with right of presenting to spirituall promotions would consider what an honourable office is committed vnto them, and what excellent seruice they may performe to the Church of God; and let them withall call to minde, what a fearefull account such shall one day make, as cease not to preferre their priuate gaine before the publike good, but suffer soules to perish through their negligent default, or symoniacall sinne. Two reasons may bee rendred for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages, building the Church and mainteining the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: in regard whereof, this honour was granted to the lord of the soile in ancient time, that hee alone should present the Clerke, because he alone prouided for him. In remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof, the honour discended to posteritie: and therefore you which enioy this right from your Noble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours, as you succeed them in honour, so succeed them in vertue, and as they haue beene honourable founders, so discharge you a good conscience, and bee faithfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposers. And you which possesse the same dignitie, though
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12689:14"/>
not by lineall discent, yet by other lawfull interest, it is your part to be good stewards, and warily to discharge this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian dutie, according to that trust which the Church of Christ hath reposed in you: So learning shall be nourished, vertue aduanced, religion flourish, and out two famous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities shall be exalted like the cedars in Libanus, and as the Cypres trees vpon the mountaines of Hermon: They shall be faire as the Oliue tree, and sweete as the Rose: They shall bee fruitfull as the Vine, and like the Terebinth shall stretch foorth their branches to the glory of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of his children. But to returne to the present state of our Church, it cannot bee denied, but that God hath blessed this land with a great number of learned men aboue other nations; yet seeing the number of parishes is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, wee are constrained to tolerate some of meaner sufficiencie. And yet the <note n="1" place="margin">Can. 34.</note> law requireth that euerie one to be admitted into the Ministerie, should vnderstand the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles  of religion, not onely as they bee compendiously set downe in the Creed, but as they are at large in our Booke of Articles; neither vnderstand them onely, but be able to prooue them sufficiently out of the Scripture: And that not in English onely, but in Latin also. If it be obiected, that there haue beene sundrie consecrated which are not thus qualified: I confesse it may be true, and it is a iust cause of lamentation: but yet (beloued) this is not the fault of the law, but of such as transgresse the law. Now I speake in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Lawes vnder which I liue: If any whosoeuer shall transgresse the lawes, let him answer for himselfe, or beare his owne burthen: that which is of God I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly defend, but I am no patron of any mans iniquitie: I will conclude this point with the charge S. <hi>Paul</hi> giueth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him to all other Bishops: <note n="2" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 21.</note> 
               <hi>I testifie before God and the Lord Iesus Christ and the elect Angels that thou obserue these things without hastinesse of iudgement, and doe nothing after partialitie. Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17 And heere let mee aduise those Ministers which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12689:14"/>
are no Preachers, that they spend not their time idlely, but endeuour by all meanes to grow in wisdome and grace, lest they be a disgrace to that holy calling. For there is no doubt but being at their entrance qualified, as the law requireth, if they shall marke what they reade publikely, if they shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to reade the Bible priuately, if they shall ioine some short and easie Commentarie, if they shall informe their iudgements by introductions and institutions of Christian religion: if they shal be willing to learne of such as can teach them, and to teach such as ought to learne of them, if they shall be diligent in Catechising, if they shall delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and meditate vpon the law of God day and night, and withall bee deuout and feruent in praier; there is no doubt I say, but that God may so blesse their graine of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard seed, that it may grow into a goodly tree, their sparkle that it may become a flame, their drop that it may rise into a riuer, and ouerflow like Nilus with her siluer streames.

and being perswaded that it containeth nothing but that which may bee tolerated with a good conscience: and pondering how this Church hath beene troubled with turbulent spirits, and withall hoping that Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be a means to preserue the peace of the Church, how could they doe lesse, than commend the vse of this booke, and binde all that heereafter shall bee admitted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ministerie, or to any Ecclesiasticall promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their seuerall Subscriptions to approoue the same?

In al these points the Church of England requireth subscription, and is therfore sharply censured by her owne children. But they which are such admirers of forraine Churches abroad, let them a little in this very point compare the Church of England with that famous Church of Geneua. First, the Church of England requireth subscription of the Ministers, and not of the common people: but the Church of Geneua vrgeth not the Ministers onely, but the <note n="2" place="margin">A ciuibus primum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um contendit Caluin. vt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actus populus vniuersus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondlie, the Church of England requireth this approbation, that her rites are not contrarie to the word of God: but the Church of Geneua will haue her discipline receiued in a more high and glorious maner. Thirdly, the Church of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12689:16"/>
England contenteth her-selfe onely with subscription, but the Church of Geneua is more peremptorie requiring a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne <note n="3" place="margin">Dedit tamen Dominus 20.

            <p n="19">19 After Subscription followeth Consecration, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, which in the Church of England is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with such words of wisdome and in such maner, as flesh and bloud should not take vpon them to controle</p>
            <p n="20">20 And as our Church is carefull to make good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, so she hath a singular regard in placing them. And because many Patrons in placing their Clerks haue golden gifts in more precious account then gifts of grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chuch of England hath prouidently appointed an oth against <note n="4" place="margin">Canon 40.</note> Symonie. And heere I beseech all my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Ministerie in the bowels of Christ Iesus, to make a conscience of this oth, when they enter their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings: For how can they expect that God will blesse their proceedings, if they shall make their beginnings with Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and colour it ouer with periurie?</p>
            <p n="21">21 And as our Church is desirous that men may enter their liuings with a good conscience, so she is graciouslie prouident that they may discharge their dutie when they are entred: Wherefore the law prouideth for their personall <note n="5" place="margin">Canon 41. 42. 43. 44. 45.</note> residence, and in case of absence for a learned supply.</p>
            <p n="21">21 And forasmuch as the Church of God in all ages hath had some which after good and plausible beginnings, haue notwithstanding proued firebrands of schism, &amp; soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the trumpet of sedition, therefore the oth of canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obedience is a touchstone to trie their present affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a bridle to curbe their future passions, and a gracious meanes to preserue the precious peace and vnitie of the Church.</p>
            <p n="23">23 Moreouer, the messengers of peace should not onely be peaceable, but also painfull in feeding the flocke of Christ, and yet Sermons heeretofore in some places haue beene verie rare and daintie, insomuch that father <hi>Latymer</hi> in his time compared them to strawberies, which came but once a yeere. Wherefore that in stead of strawberie Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12689:16"/>
there might bee a more plentifull prouision in the house of God, our Church hath decreed, that if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters residing vpon their benefices be Preachers not lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindered, they shall preach euery <note n="6" place="margin">Canon 45.</note> Sabbath, and if they be no Preachers, they shall procure <note n="7" place="margin">Canon 46.</note> monthly Sermons.</p>
            <p n="24">24 Furthermore because (such is our selfe pleasing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie) we thinke our selues fit to flie before our feathers be growne, and sundrie to auoid the odious brand of dumbe dogges and idoll shepheards, are readie to stretch and straine themselues aboue their strength being forward to speake when silence would better become them; therefore it is wisely enacted, that none shall preach but such as are allowed by the <note n="8" place="margin">Canon 49.</note> Bishop of the Diocesse. In the meane time they must read Homilies, that is, holie and learned Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, publikely set out by authoritie. Surely (dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued) quirking braines may haue their conceits, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton wits may be more merrie then wise: but when these things are iudiciously weighed in an equall ballance, it will be found that the wisedome of the Church hath disposed them honestly and in order.</p>
            <p n="25">25 And as our Church desireth that doctrine may shine like the light of the Lord vpon the holie candlesticke, so she is carefull that the <note n="1" place="margin">Canon 75.</note> conuersation of her Ministers be such as may adorne the Gospell of Christ. In making of which Canon, the church of England may seeme to haue set before her eies that golden sentence, <note n="2" place="margin">Psal. 132. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Let thy Priests ô Lord be clothed with holinesse,</hi> and <hi>let thy Saints reioice and sing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="26">26 And as they should be inwardly decked with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and grace, so it is inioined, that their outward <note n="3" place="margin">Canon 74.</note> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell shall be sober and graue, euery way correspondent to their calling, that all things may bee done honestly and by order. And thus much of the Ministrie, and so I come to our ministration.</p>
            <p n="27">27 The beginning of our Church Seruice, is with some memorable sentence of holy Scripture appointed for that purpose, moouing to repentance and praier, or magnifying the mercy of God in Christ: then after a holy exhortation,

all of vs both Minister and people fall downe before the throne of grace confessing our sinnes, with an humble, lowly, penitent and obedient heart, meekely kneeling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our knees: without question (beloued) heere is a holie and a blessed beginning. Now because that God which dwelleth <hi>in</hi> 
               <note n="4" place="margin">Esay 57. 15.</note> 
               <hi>eternitie,</hi> hath respect to an <hi>humble and contrite spirit,</hi> and hath appointed the Minister to comfort them which mourne in Sion, therefore in the next place, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in the name of Iesus Christ, pronounceth forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes to all that truely repent and vnfainedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his holie Gospell. This is the oile of gladnesse, the balme of <hi>Gilead,</hi> the fountaine of grace for the washing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of sinnes,: <note n="6" place="margin">Cant. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>O the fountaine of the gardens, the Well of liuing water, and the springs of Lebanon.</hi> And lest any man hauing the pardon of his sinnes pronounced, should take occasion of carnall libertie, therefore our Church doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently apply a preseruatiue against presumption, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiue of all grace and godlinesse, euen that zealous and piercing praier, which the Lord Iesus himselfe hath taught vs. And because when we haue done all that we can, <hi>we are</hi> 
               <note n="7" place="margin">Luk 17. 10.</note> 
               <hi>vnprositable seruants,</hi> and must <note n="8" place="margin">Phil. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>forget that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and indeuor our selues vnto that which is before,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as though we had yet done nothing, we beseech him to <hi>open our lippes, that our mouth may shew foorth his praise.</hi> And so with praier to him which is best able to helpe vs, wee giue glory to the blessed Trinitie, in all which what is there, which can be bettered by the wit of man? Now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the minde of man in praier mounteth aloft with Eagles wings, piercing the clouds with ardent affection, and powring out her plaintes in the bosome of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therfore lest the vehement attention which is required in praier, should be dulled by long continuance, our Church vseth a profitable varietie, intermingling the reading of heauenly wisedome: wherein the soule tasting and seeing how good and gracious the Lord is, feedeth vpon him by diuine contemplation; and so returneth to praier with a greater inflammation. The Psalms being a store-house of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12689:17"/>
all godlinesse, wisedome, and grace, so plaine to the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so profound to the wise, so profitable to all sorts, in all ages, in all estates, ioy or griefe, prosperitie or aduersitie, our Church desireth to make familiar to all men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we reade them ouer euery moneth, still interlacing the Hymne of glorie to the blessed Trinitie. Then follow Chapters of the old and new Testament, intermingled with sacred Hymnes, all in a knowne language, so God is glorified and the people edified. It is true that to some parts of the Apocrypha we giue publike audience in our church, yet we omit some <note n="*" place="margin">As the bookes of Maccabes, and 3. and 4. of Esdras.</note> bookes thereof, and reade them not at all; and those bookes we reade, we reade not altogither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, but omit some <note n="1" place="margin">Tob. 5. 6. and 8. in the kalender of the booke of common praier expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp;c.</note> Chapters and peeces <note n="2" place="margin">Eccles. 46. verse 20. and in other places.</note> of Chapters, which some haue thought capable of hard construction. And if any thing we reade be such as may seeme to found suspiciously or doubtfully, wee hold it our dutie to make the most charitable and christian construction: and if wee cannot of our selues satisfie our selues, wee are referred for resolution of our doubts to the <note n="*" place="margin">Preface to the Booke of Common Praier.</note> Bishop of the Diocesse, of whom what interpretation is to bee expected, the Church doth teach vs, binding him to doe nothing contrarie to the booke, and proclaiming withall in the booke, that <hi>nothing is ordained which is not the very pure word of God, or euidently grounded vpon the same:</hi> and therefore his interpretation being accordingly performed, should in reason satisfie and content vs. Furthermore we receiue them for humane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and not for diuine, &amp; therfore we reade them not <note n="3" place="margin">Articles Anno 1562. artic. 6.</note> for confirmation <hi>of Faith,</hi> but for <hi>information of maners,</hi> &amp; yet haue I said nothing of the libertie granted by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the second booke of Homilies concerning the changing of Chapters. Moreouer, though some portions of the Canonicall, concerning <note n="4" place="margin">Gen. 36. &amp; alibi.</note> Genealogies, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="5" place="margin">As in Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp;c.</note> intricate and mysticall points be not appointed to be solemnly read in our Church seruice, yet we vsually alleage and expound them in Sermons. Neither is it our meaning to aduance the Apocryphal which we reade, aboue the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall which we reade not: for all Canonicall being the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12689:18"/>
sacred Oracles of God, haue incomparable preheminence of excellencie; yet nothing doth hinder, but that some thing in it selfe of farre lesser excellencie, may be more familiar for popular capacitie. After the Chapter of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accompanied with a holie Psalme or Hymne, wee all stand vp boldly professing our faith before God and men, in that forme which is most anciently receiued in the Church of Christ: for which purpose we vse sometimes the Creed of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and elsewhere the Creed of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice. Hauing thus fedde our mindes with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meditation of the blessed Word, and confessed our faith in the holie Trinitie, we fall a fresh to Praier: we praie for our Prince, for all the States of the land, for all Gods children, and that for all blessings spirituall and temporall: and we praie onely to God, and onely in the merits of Iesus Christ. And because the life of man is subiect to a seaof miseries, and little doe we know what storme may hang o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our heads, and suddenly surprize either vs or any of our brethren; therefore that Gods present wrath may bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, and future dangers graciously preuented, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our soules in the presence of God with a most deuout Letanie, which is so pathetically penned, that it may seeme to soare aloft with wings of sanctified affections, and to pierce the skies as it were with darts of deuotion. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some time spent in Praier, wee intermingle againe the reading of Gods holie word: to beate downe sinne, wee reade Gods firie law, and fearefull commandements, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously beseeching him to incline our hearts to keepe his law. And to kindle and increase our spirituall ioy, we reade those comfortable and selected portions of Scripture called Epistles and Gospels. Now for the holie Communion, it is so religiously penned, and so reuerently performed in our Church, as is most apt to kindle deuotion, to inflame faith, to raise vp the minde from earthly cogitations, and to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish the spirit with heauenly ioy: for it is replenished with most zealous exhortations, lowly confessions, piercing praiers, celestiall comforts, angelicall lauding and praising
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12689:18"/>
of God: and not presuming to come to the Lords table, trusting in our owne righteousnesse, but in his manifold and great mercies, we beseech him to grant that we may so eate the flesh of his deare sonne, and drinke his bloud, that our bodies being clensed and our soules washed, wee may euer dwell in him, and he in vs. And though we are not woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of our selues, so much as to gather vp the crums vnder his table, yet after the reheatsall of Christs holy institution (such is the mercy of God, in the merits of Christ) we are made partakers of this heauenly banquet, euen of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bodie and bloud of Christ, for the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and all other benefits of his passion. So againe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out praiers, and rendring thanks and glorie to God on high, we conclude the celebration of these reuerend myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, pronouncing a blessing to the people departing. Thus we repent and pray; wee reioice and praie: we thanke God and praie: we confesse our faith and praie: wee reade and praie: we heare and praie: we preach and praie: we receiue the Sacraments and praie. This is the order of our Church, which may well be called the house of Praier. <hi>Iacob</hi> when he awaked from the dreame of the ladder, he said, <note n="1" place="margin">Gen. 28. 17.</note> 
               <hi>How reuerend is this place, it is none other then the house of God, and the gate of heauen.</hi> So I say vnto you, oh how reuerend is this Church of England, where God is thus serued? surely it is the house of God, and this gracious seruing of him is the gate of heauen.

These firie darts flie farre and wide, the people men and women haue learned disdainfully to dash them in our faces: these I hold it my dutie to quench, or at least to doe mine endeuour; I will therefore bring my bucket of water, and commit the euent to the gracious goodnesse of Almightie God. And for breuities sake I will reduce all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12689:19"/>
these arguments into one, the branches whereof shall bee handled in order. Those orders and ceremonies which were neither commanded of God in holie Scripture, nor practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Apostles times, but are hereticall, popish, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, being scandalous where they remaine, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cast out of other reformed Churches, are in no wise to be imbraced or assented vnto by subscription: but such say they are sundry of the orders and ceremonies of the Church of England, therefore not to be imbraced nor yeelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by Subscription.</p>
            <p n="29">29 And first they <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Admon. in principio.</hi> The first obiection.</note> require that nothing should be <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Gods Church, but those things onely which the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his word commandeth.</hi> Now it is supposed that we haue many rites, which are not commanded, as for example, where is the Surplesse commanded? where is the Ring in marriage commanded? where is the Crosse in baptisme commanded? where is kneeling at the Communion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? These and a number of other things are vsed in our Church, which (as it is obiected) God in his holie Word hath no where commanded. To which obiection I answer: First, that if vnder this word <hi>(commanded)</hi> they comprehend things commanded in generall, then these and the like orders of our Church are commanded. If they demand where? I answer, in euery place where God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands vs to obey our Prince. For the meaning of Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is, that we should obey the Prince in all things lawfull: but things <note n="1" place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 23.</note> indifferent, are things lawfull: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God commands vs to obey our Prince in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: But all these things are indifferent: &amp; therfore in all these God commands vs to obey our Prince: yea euen in this my text it is commanded, when it is said; <hi>Let all things be done honestly and by order.</hi> Secondly, if by <hi>(commanded)</hi> they vnderstand a particular command: then I grant that these things are not so commanded: but neither are their owne rites, they so much desire, any where thus comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. A white Surplesse (I confesse) is no where comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: neither is a blacke gowne, or cloake any where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12689:20"/>
Kneeling at the Communion is no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: but neither is sitting or any other gesture which they allow, any where commanded. If our orders may not be receiued, because they are not commanded, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can theirs be imbraced, for they are no where comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. If theirs be not commanded, and yet be lawfull: then ours also may be lawfull though they be not commanded. Let themselues be iudges, let them acquit vs or condemne vs, chuse them whether. Thirdly, as they are not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, so are they no where in holie Scripture forbidden, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly or by consequence: if they bee, let the places be produced; if they be not, then seeing they are neither commanded nor forbidden, the Lord hath left them as things indifferent: and therefore authoritie may command them, and wee may with a good conscience obserue them without sinne. Fourthly, it shall bee conuinced by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and first, what speciall commandement of God was there for <note n="2" place="margin">Hester 9. 21.</note>

If lawfull for the Iewish Church, why not for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian? If it bee said that the Iewish Church was directed by the spirit, it is true: And vnlesse the contrarie could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, why should wee not iudge the like of the Christian Church, which hath more ample promises?

               </hi> and <hi>Mardocheus</hi> did it by speciall and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary directions; they must consider, that we must not flie to extraordinarie motions without sufficient warrant of holie Scripture. And this seemeth to be done by the ordinary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Church: for the Iewes in Shushan kept the <note n="5" place="margin">9. 18.</note> fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the moneth Adar with feasting and ioy: the Iewes of the villages kept the <note n="6" place="margin">19.</note> fourteenth, &amp; <hi>Mardocheus</hi> brought them to an vniformitie by inioining of <note n="7" place="margin">21.</note> both daies.

If any imagine it to be vnlawfull (though that imagination were very strange) let him cast his eie vpon another example, I meane the feast of the <hi>Dedication,</hi> which was no where commanded in the law: yet was solemnly <note n="2" place="margin">1.

To which I answer, that those Apostolike times we honour and reuerence, not onely for doctrine, which then did runne most cleere, as being neerest to the crystalline fountaine, but also for discipline, so farre as the state of those daies could possiblie suffer. But though the doctrine of the Apostles be fully set downe in the Apostles writings, yet the discipline is not so. The reason whereof is because the doctrine is one and the same, eternall and vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore it is called an <note n="15" place="margin">Reu. 14 6.</note> euerlasting Gospel: but the discipline (especially the ceremonies) is for the most part variable, according to circumstance of time and place.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12689:21"/>
onely as may be altered. One kinde of Physicke agrees not to all bodies, neither one kinde of ceremonie to all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: the same Physicke which is good for the bodie when it is yoong, may be dangerous in the same disease when it is old. One maner of discipline may beseeme a citie, and an other a kingdome. One may be good for a Church newly planted, and an other when it is in the flourish. One cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie may be seemely for the time of peace, and an other for the time of persecution. Now to require like where the case is vnlike agrees not with reason. Our Sauiour did cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Communion <note n="3" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 25</note> after Supper, and it was fit hee should so, for the Passeouer by the law was to be eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <note n="4" place="margin">Exod. 12. 6.</note> two euenings: and the Communion was to succeed the Passeouer, therefore it was fit that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion should be instituted in the euening. But for vs to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate it in the morning is farre more conuenient. For I make no doubt but our learned and godly brethren, which seeke reformation, will in this point rather ioine with the Church of England, and with all other Christian Churches which make choice of the morning, then with the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, which celebrate it in the euening after supper. And to proceed, in the Apostles time they did baptise in <note n="5" place="margin">Act. 8. 36.</note> riuers and fountaines; shall we therefore leaue our Churches, and baptise our children in riuers to the imitation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles? that imitation were vndiscreet, for they liued in time of persecution, and therefore were glad to take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of time and place. We liue in time of peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Churches (God be thanked) are open vnto vs. If God for our sinnes should lay persecution vpon vs, we must be content to doe as they did. And there is no doubt, but if God had giuen them that libertie, which he hath granted vs, they would haue done in this point as we doe, and haue thanked him for the blessing of peace. In the Apostles time the Ministers liued by voluntarie <note n="6" place="margin">Act. 4. 37.</note> contributions, or by their owne <note n="7" place="margin">Act. 20. 34. 1. Cor. 4. 12.</note> handie labours, for how could they doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise? They liued not onely in persecution, but their enemies the Leuiticall Priests had the tithes during the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12689:22"/>
standing of the Temple. But now when tithes are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Ministers of the Gospell by Christian Princes, shall wee returne to handie labour, or voluntarie contributions? In the Apostles time, the people sold their possessions, and laid the money <note n="8" place="margin">Act. 4. 37.</note> at the Apostles feete; but shall our people be tied of necessitie to doe the like? In the Apostles time there were no Christian Colledges, nor Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities founded; shall we therefore dissolue our famous Vniuersities, and damme vp the welsprings of learning? In the Apostles time it was hard to finde any Christian Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals for the poore; but is this a reason that now we should haue none?

But what? shall once applying of water be for euer vnlawfull, because it was brought in by heretikes? our controuler confesseth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, and affirmeth that it is vsed <hi>in most reformed churches.</hi> And surely it is not onely lawfull, but in some cases more conuenient: for where thrice hath beene abused to signifie three Gods, there once may bee expedient to betoken one God: likewise in cold countries, especially in winter time, and the rather when the childe is weake. Some flowers may grow in the wildernesse, and some things may proceed from heretikes, and yet not vnseemely to be vsed in the Church of Christ.

a ceremonie which the primitiue Church deuised, and our nationall Church hath iudged comely and conuenient, onely because it had the happe to bee handled of papists? Not whatsoeuer heretikes, idolaters, or any wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons haue done or saide, but what they haue done or saide heretically, idolatroussie, wickedly, is to be abandoned, so farre as it is euill: but whatsoeuer in their actions is fit or requisite to be done, is from God, and therefore in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect not to be abhorred. Lastly, if they call them popish, because they were abused in poperie, we confesse it to bee true, they were abused to idolatrie, and that most shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: The belles were rung to Masse, the Surples was worne at Masse: In the Church they saide their Masse: in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit they maintained their Masse: But what can bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all this?

Indeed wisedome requireth that a safe course be taken for preuention of euill where danger appeareth, which our late Queene of famous memorie most religiously performed, whose zeale in plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and establishing Gods true religion and abolishing of superstition, was nothing inferior to the zeale of <hi>Hezechias.</hi> She found the firie flames burning the bodies of the liuing, and the bones of the dead: she graciously quenched them. She found the Scriptures locked from the people in a strange language: she vnclasped the booke, and gaue it to her people to meditate thereupon day and night. She found the candle of the Gospel quite extinguished: she did light it againe (as it were) as the beames of the Sunne. She found the people worshipping of images, creeping to crosses, committing idolatrie in euerie thicket, and vnder euery greene tree: Will you see her with <hi>Hezechias</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in pieces the brasen serpent? then behold and looke backe to her royall <note n="1" place="margin">The Queenes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions 23.</note> Iniunctions, commanding to <hi>Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, vtterly extinct and destroy all shrines, couering of shrines, all Tables, Candlesticks, Trindals, and rolles of Waxe, Pictures, Paintings, and all other monuments of fained miracles, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, idolatrie and superstitions, so that there remaine no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the same in walles, glasses, windowes, or els where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Churches, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>That</hi>

For whereas the crosse was either permanent or transient: the permanent being solemnly adored in the Church of Rome, she altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished, and the transient also for the most part. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in common life the crossing of the forehead was super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiously vsed, and the like were still to be feared, if it were permitted to popular practise: therefore that was discreetly remooued. In the Sacrament of the Supper the vse of cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing was of shorter continuance, and the papists doe vse it rather like coniurers then Christians: &amp; therefore there was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12689:24"/>
no cause why there it should be continued. In Baptisme it was more ancient and more free from superstition &amp; actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adoration; therefore Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> retained the crosse in Baptisme as her godly brother did before her, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous, so farre as she might conueniently, to frame a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to those primitiue times. What rust this ceremonie had gathered, the wisedome of our Church hath wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; Fot the crosse is not appointed to be made by the Lay people, but onely by the Minister; and by him in Baptisme onely; and then not as a darke or dumbe ceremonie which might be mistaken, but with an expresse declaration of the meaning and signification thereof, to the end that the same might be freed from all superstitious construction. And to the inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither is it to be doubted, but if time had discouered any such abuse, that religious Prince would soone haue reformed it.

For what though some belles haue beene rung to the sacrifice of idols, may no bell therefore bee rung to the seruice of the liuing God? and shall not onely the particular abused be counted abhominable, but shall those innocent things which neuer were so abused, bee eternally blemished? vndoubtedly this is but a fancie, which hath no warrant from the words of <hi>Esay:</hi> for hee speaketh plainly of the couerings of idols, which without doubt were particularly abused to idolatrie. But if the staine sticke onely to the particular thing actually polluted, then this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument cannot greatly be vrged against the surplesse: for not many of Queene <hi>Maries</hi> surplesses doe now remaine, and if they did, the matter were soone remedied, and time it selfe in short time would weare them away. Neither can it be at all vrged against the crosse in baptisme: for a popish Priest maketh one crosse, and the Minister of the Gospell makes an other; heere are diuers indiuiduall actions, and consequently diuers particular crosses: therefore in this case the pollution of the one, cannot spot and defile the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet what if that very particular polluted (the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being taken away) may bee imploied in the seruice of Almightie God?

34 Now fourthly let vs consider whether they be Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, wherein wee affirme that the Church of England doth approch no neerer to the Iewes, then the law of God and the state of Christianitie doth permit. For what is it that they controle vnder the name of Iewish? is it their meaning that we should vse nothing in the Christian Church, which was vsed by the Iewes? <note n="7" place="margin">Nehem. 8. 4.</note>

But both these things our reproouers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, by their owne practise. Wherefore it is agreed that some things vsed by the Iewes, may be retained: and yet they are retained, not because they are Iewish, but because they are decent. Beside these ceremonies of decencie and order, the Iewes had other, which by the ordinance of God were <note n="9" place="margin">Colloss. 2. 17.</note> types of Christ, and these as wee all confesse are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly <note n="10" place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> abrogated, and neuer to be resumed, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, sacrifices and such like. But can it be prooued, that we vse any such thing in the Church of England? let it bee granted that Leuiticall garments in regard of their mysticall representation are abolished: yet how can it appeere that any of our garments are Leuiticall? Suppose there be some resemblance in matter of forme, what then? is the Church of Christ bound so farre to auoide all conformitie with the Iewes, that she may not at all resemble them in a matter of decencie? Our musicall harmonie they would likewise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish as Iewish, but they haue not yet prooued, that church musicke vocall or instrumentall, is such a Iewish ceremony as ought to be abrogated. The princely Prophet <note n="11" place="margin">1. Chro. 25. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Dauid</hi> brought into the Church the melodie of musicke, for the better praising &amp; lauding of God. For the sweetnesse of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicall sounds doth insinuate it selfe into the soule of man, preparing the affections for the seruice of God, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp the heart towards heauen, delighting the minde, kindling deuotion, and rauishing the spirit with celestiall ioy.

what then? yet in that they come to the Church I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice, yea and I will reioice.

            <p n="35">35 Fiftly, it is obiected that our ceremonies are scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous: <note place="margin">The fift obiection.</note> let vs therefore consider what a scandall is, and how many kindes of scandall. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> comming from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifieth to halt, is properly that part of the trap, whereto the baite is tied, which being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, the beast pulles the trap vpon his owne head. Metaphorically it is taken for that which is an occasion to hurt or grieue an other: it is often ioined with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a stumbling-blocke, &amp; may be expounded by it. For whereas a Christian should go forward in the way of godlinesse, a scandall may be called a word or a deed, which is laide as a blocke in his way, whereby he may fall or stumble, or any way be hindred in his vertuous course. Scandall is of two sorts, giuen or taken; to giue scandall, or to scandalize, is to doe or say any thing which is apt to prouoke vnto sinne, by greeuing the godly, wounding the weake, reioicing the wicked. Some things doe scandalize, because they haue a scandalizing nature, as all sinne and wickednesse. Some things doe scandalize accidentally, because they are scandalously vsed: and so things indifferent may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come scandalous. First, when they are deuised for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill purpose, as <note n="12" place="margin">Sozomen lib. 6. Hist. eccl. cap. 26.</note> the <hi>Eunomian</hi> heretikes deuised to powre water but once in Baptisme, and not thrise, to crosse the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinitie: In which age, if any should haue left the custome of the Church, in applying it thrise, and haue followed the Eunomians in doing it but once, hee should haue giuen a very scandalous example: for he might haue beene probably thought to haue fauoured their heresie whose example he followed. Secondly, when things origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12689:28"/>
deuised for good, are abused to euill: As in Spaine certaine hereukes abused the thrise applying of water in Baptisme, to signifie three gods, which gaue an occasion to <note n="1" place="margin">Ep. l. 1. c. 41.</note> 
               <hi>Gregorie,</hi> as also to the Councell of <note n="2" place="margin">Concil. 2. Tol. 4. c. 5.</note> Toledo, to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in Spaine it should be applied but once. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a thing indifferent may become scandalous in regard of the circumstance of time, person or place: as for example, if one in Spaine after the constitution of Toledo should haue applied water thrice; this (though done in simplicity) had beene scandalous in regard of the time, because here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes did then vse it to strengthen their heresy of three gods. Moreouer, although meats forbidden by the ceremoniall law, after the death of Christ became indifferent; yet if a weak brother not perswaded of the indifferency, should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse himself <note n="3" place="margin">Ro. 14. 15.</note> offended, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy eating in his presence should be scandalous in respect of the person. Againe, though meat offered to Idols might lawfully be eaten, yet to eate in the <note n="4" place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 10.</note> temple of the Idoll were euill in app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arance, and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in respect of the place, because it might seeme to bee done in honour of the idoll, so it might greeue the godly and be an occasion of falling to thy weake brother, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the idolaters in their impietie. A scandall taken not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is when that which is not scandalously done, is tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as scandalous either by errour or calumniation. By er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as when therest of the <note n="5" place="margin">Ios. 22. 16.</note> Tribes were offended with the tribe of <hi>Ruben, Gad,</hi> and the halfe tribe of <hi>Manasses,</hi> for erecting an altar vpon the borders of Iordan, which they supposed to be erected for sacrifice, but was indeed onely a memoriall that they had a part in the God of Israel; of which when they were truely informed, they corrected their errour, they rested satisfied, and all imagination of scandall was taken away. By calumniation, a good thing may be blamed for scandalous, as when Christ himselfe to the disobedient was made a <note n="6" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12689:29"/>
but is the scandall giuen, or is it onely taken? If we giue any scandall, let it appeere wherin, &amp; to whom. And first, is there any ceremony in our Church, which is of a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing nature? And to begin with the Surples, is it a thing in the owne nature simplie vnlawfull? not so; for those which most spurne at it both in <note n="9" place="margin">T. C. l. 3. pag. 262.</note>

Now if the crosse be simplie vnlawfull, wherein consisteth this vnlawfulnesse? is the very making of a crosse a thing so repugnant to godlinesse, that whosoeuer shall make it though it be but with his finger, shall presently sinne? but this to my knowledge no man obiects: for they allow it in <note n="14" place="margin">Treatise of the crosse. fol. 3.</note>

And therefore a sacrament is not onely a signe to signifie, but also a seale of the liuing God, establishing our hearts in the couenant of grace. Whereby it is apparent that the crosse is farre different from a sacrament; for it is not a seale, but onely a signe; not commanded of the Lord, but appointed by the Church; not as a confirmation of his couenant, but as a memoriall of our dutie. Wherefore it doth not appeare to be of a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing nature, and therefore a wise and <note n="21" place="margin">Goul. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in Cyp. epist. 56.</note> iudicious man liuing in reformed churches where the crosse is not vsed, doth call it plainly a thing indifferent. Let vs now consider whether it be scandalous in respect of the vse. And first dare any man affirme that it was deuised to a scandalous end? that doth not appeere, but rather the contrarie. For among the Iewes to die vpon <note n="22" place="margin">Deut. 21. 23.</note> 
               <hi>a tree</hi> was a cursed death, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romanes the death of the crosse was full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch. Wherefore the Iewes seeing the poore estate of Christ and his shamefull death, did thinke him vnwoorthy the title of their glorious Messias, and many of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did scorne to beleeue in a crucified God. But the true Christians reioiced <note n="23" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>in the crosse of Christ,</hi> that is, in Christ crucified, not onely in Christ rising, ascending and sitting in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12689:30"/>
glorie, but they reioiced in his crosse, that is, in his death &amp; passion which he suffered vpon the crosse, for his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is our exaltation, his death our life, his crosse our crowne, his reproch our glorie. And whereas the heathen did reproch the children of God with it, the Christians set the signe of it in their foreheads, <note n="24" place="margin">T. C. lib 1. pag. 170.</note> 
               <hi>to testifie that they were not therefore ashamed of the same God.</hi> And this the great controller of our Church confesseth to be done of a <note n="25" place="margin">ibidem.</note>

For ceremonies depend vpon the doctrine, especially of the free grace of God and merits of Christ. So long as this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is preserued pure, the ceremonic is pure, when the doctrine declineth, the ceremonie is peruerted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note n="26" place="margin">Goul. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Goulartius</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>the old Christians did vse the signe of the crosse without superstition, because the doctrine of the merits of Christ preserued them from errour which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward crept in.</hi> When the doctrine was corrupted, no maruell if the ceremonie were defiled, as it came to passe in poperie, where it was very scandalously abused. But if it were scandalous onely in respect of the abuse, then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse being remooued, the scandall it selfe is likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued. Now can any man say, that it is abused in the Church of England? for doe we adore it with diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? all the world may know that we detest and abhorre all such abhomination. Doe wee superstitiously ascribe anie grace or vertue vnto it? let our very enemies be our iudges. And surely if the puritie of doctrine preserue from supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then who can accuse the Church of England, wherein the doctrine of Christ is so purely taught as euer it was in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Church vpon the face of the earth since the Apostles time? But peraduenture they will say, that our Church doth vse it scandalously in respect of some circumstances of time, person or place. Indeed we vse it in the Church at the time of Baptisme, as our forefathers haue done before vs, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12689:30"/>
liued either in or neere the Apostolike age: But that wee vse it scandalously, wee vtterly denie. For who are they which are scandalized? They <note n="*" place="margin">In the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding of the Popes attire made by certaine ministers of London, as also T. C. vide Archb. Whit. p. 252.</note> answer, that the papists are some weake aad some obstinate: weake, which haue made some steppe to the Gospell, and yet are not fully scowred from their former rust: and these (as is imagined) thinke that the sacraments get reuerence by the ceremonies, as namely by the crosse and surples: and that they want some thing they should haue, where these are not vsed. In which errour they are said to be strengthened by our vsing of them. And the stubborne and obstinate doe heereby take occasion (as is supposed) to blaspheme the Gospell, and to hope that the rest of their trumperie shall likewise in time be receiued. And by this meanes they grow hardened and frozen in their dregs. But if the Papists be weake and not wilfull, <note place="margin"> Beza ep. 8.</note> there is great hope that as they haue alreadie made some step from popish opinions by meanes of good instruction: so these silly imaginations may likewise by the like meanes in time be remooued. For this doth not inforce any abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ceremonies, but it requireth more diligence in instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And for the stubborne papists which stop their eares against all instruction, wee need not regard them. When the Pharisies were displeased with the Disciples of Christ for eating with unwashed hands, Christ rendred a sufficient reason in defence of their fact; but the Pharisees notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing were offended; then Christ answered: <note n="1" place="margin">Matth. 15. 14.</note>

Neither is a Church bound vpon euery pretended offence, presently to alter her publike decrees: for that were nothing els but ridiculous leuitie. Indeed it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of euerie Church, carefully to prouide that nothing bee decreed which may minister iust occasion of offence: and likewise to establish her ceremonies with such sufficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and cleerenesse of doctrine, as may preuent so far as is possible all sinister constructions and taking of offence: which points are already in ample maner performed by the church of England. But it will be replied that many things are lawfull which are not expedient; meats offered to idols were lawfull, yet euill to him that eateth offensiuely. So our garments may be lawful, yet euill to him that weareth them offensiuely. So the crosse may be lawfull, yet euill to them that vse it offensiuely. And thought the offence commeth by the weaknesse of our brother, yet charitie bindeth vs to refraine from that which offendeth our brother. And they stand much vpon <note n="1" place="margin">1.

                  </gap>sh so long as the world standeth, rather then hee would offend his brother.</hi> The answer whereunto may bee this, that the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12689:31"/>
case is vnlike: for first those meats whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth speake, were matters of priuate action of common life: But we speake of the publike ceremonies of our Church. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> was at his owne choice, no law restraining his libertie, but our ceremonies are commanded by lawfull authoritie Thirdly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> by forbearing flesh did preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice none but himselfe: But wee in forbearing the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies should preiudice the authority of the Prince. Fourthly, S. <hi>Pauls</hi> practise did further and not hinder the course of his Ministerie, but as the case now standeth, our refusall of ceremonies might be a meanes to silence our selues, and to stoppe the course of our preaching, which is a dutie so necessarie, that it may not be omitted, no not for feare of a scandall. Fiftly, though eating of those meats were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue to some, yet the not eating we doe not finde to haue beene offensiue to any: But in our ceremonies some are offended because they are vsed, and some are offended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not vsed, and that more iustly, because the not vsing of a thing so commanded is disobedience to the Prince, and may prooue a very scandalous and pernicious example. If they say that charitie bindeth me to respect the one; I answer, that the same charitie bindeth mee to regard the other: and dutie bindeth me to honour and obey my Prince. Wherefore in a mixt congregation what shall I doe? for both will be offended: the one if I vse them, the other if I vse them not. Surely in such a case I thinke it my part, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feruent praier, diligent studie, and Christian conference, to consult with mine owne conscience; and finding the thing commanded, to bee no way contrarie to the word of God: I will hold it my dutie to obey my Prince. And as for those which shall be offended with my fact, I will in the spirit of meekenesse, both publikely and priuately, render them a reason of my doing, instructing them from time to time in the doctrine of things indifferent, and the dutie of a subiect to his Prince. But if they will not be thus satisfied, if they refuse to hearken and still continue stiffe in their owne opinions: let them take heed lest the saying of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:12689:32"/>
may be applied vnto them: <hi>Concerning the</hi>

Many take offence at their brethren for vsing the names of Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Candlemas, and the like: as though it were a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous peece of Popery, but admit that these feastiuities had their names of the masse, (though some learned men are of an other opinion) yet suppose it were so: those that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with this word Christmas, as fauouring Poperie, might bee offended with <hi>Bolteshazzar</hi> as fauouring Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme But they will say it renueth the memorie of the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable masse, be it so, and withall it may renew the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our deliuery from the masse.

But why should we be bound to their

example? Indeed in the same nation, and vnder the same gouernment it is fit there should be an vniformitie, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas the Iewes in the Prouinces kept the feast of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> vpon the fourteenth day of the moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> and the Iewes in <hi>Shusan</hi> vpon the fifteenth: Mordocheus authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">Hest. 9. 21.</note> by the King reduced them to an vniformity by inioining them both daies.

Yet we cannot but maruell that men will vrge vs to conformitie with forraine Churches to which we owe no subiection, and will not conforme themselues to their owne mother the Church of England in whose bosome they liue, and whereof they are members. But to whom shall we conforme our selues, and whose patterne shall wee follow? for the reformed churches differ one from another, as hath beene in part declared in their celebration of holidaies. Peraduenture they will saie that wee must follow the best. But how shall we know which are best, vnlesse the reformed Churches would haue a generall meeting in a publike Councell, and make vs a finall determination? and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture that would not be voide of inconuenience: for that might be best for one, which is not best for another. If in this case wee should be tied to follow the most ancient, then Geneua it selfe must be cast in an other mould, which our reproouers will not allow to bee of equall perfection. But whatsoeuer our reformers say, it is cleere that they haue alwaies one eie fixed vpon the face of Geneua, yet Geneua hath some popish orders (if you call all orders po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish which haue beene vsed in poperie) as well as wee: as hath beene declared in their custome of godfathers and godmothers; and some popish orders they keepe, which are not imposed vpon vs in the Church of England as the wafer cake: which was more scandalously abused in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, than any thing that we inioin, yea then the crosse it selfe. For the wafer cake was not onely made an idoll, but such an

            <p n="32">32 If you relie vpon reasons artificially deduced, are they probable or demonstratiue? if probabilities onely,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12689:35"/>
what trueth is there in the world so sound, but a carping wit may finde some probabilities against it? The holy Scripture hath beene oppugned, though without all trueth, yet with some probabilitie. And reason it selfe can borrow a reason from nature, to reason against faith. But how shall the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of a subiect bee discharged in disobeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of his Prince vpon deceiueable probabilities? Indeed, if you can produce any one necessarie and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratiue reason, to prooue that the things imposed vpon you are contrarie to Gods word, then it must needs bee confessed, that you are bound in conscience to refraine: for we must rather obey God then man. But what if you thinke a reason to be necessarie when it is not? may not you be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for such as haue vnnecessarilie troubled the Church of God? your reasons out of Scripture against our orders, when they come to the scanning, prooue no such matters of necessitie as you pretend.

            <p n="40">40 But peraduenture you will replie, that howsoeuer your arguments be in themselues, yet to you they seeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciblie to conclude our orders to be vnlawful: according to the saying of S. <hi>Paul. I</hi> 
               <note n="2" place="margin">Rom. 14. 14.</note> 
               <hi>know and am perswaded through the Lord Iesus, that there is nothing vncleane of it selfe, but vnto him that iudgeth any thing to be vncleane, to him it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.</hi> In regard wherof, many of you pretend that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie required is against your conscience: but beware lest this conscience proove an erronious conscience. If you say that an erronious conscience bindeth so farre, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is done against it is sinne in the doer, and therefore though conformitie in it selfe were lawfull, yet because you iudge it vnlawfull, in you it were sinne: If this be your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12689:35"/>
then tell mee I praie you, whether the errour of the conscience take awaie the sinne of the soule in disobeying the lawfull commandement of lawfull authoritie? If it bee cleere that it doe not, because transgression is transgression, and sinne is sinne, though an erroneous conscience crie a thousand times to the contrarie. Then see I beseech you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what perplexities you cast your selues. If you should conforme, you tell vs that you should sinne, because it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your conscience; and if you do not conforme, wee must tell you that you sinne, because it is vniustifiable diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Thus if your conscience vpon iust trial shall proue erronious, you are euery way insnared and intangled: but if you stand vpon the cleering of your conscience, as though it were void of all errour, then let it so appeare by the holy Scripture, and let not such vehement affirmations bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by such weake and feeble inducements. It behoueth you which withstand the ceremonies established by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred authoritie of such a religious Prince, and such a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church, to stand vpon such pregnant and infallible proofes, as may vndoubtedly perswade the conscience that the things commanded are vnlawfull: or if you cannot, then (without all question) you are bound in conscience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your conscience, or at lest to suspend your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But how shall this be done? If heeretofore you haue fixed both eies vpon the one side, vouchsafe now to cast one eie vpon the learning, wisdome, &amp; grauitie of the other. If heretofore you haue greedily deuoured the bookes of the one, vouchsafe now without preiudice to reade and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is said by the other. If heretofore you haue looked vpon your owne reasons through the vapour of affection, and therfore haue conceiued them to be greater and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier then in trueth they were: dispell now all mists and clouds of partiallitie, and pray to God in humilitie, that his precious trueth may shine vnto you. If you doe thus, then peraduenture those reasons which heeretofore seemed gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants in your eies, may prooue like little dwarfes, and those
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12689:36"/>
which heeretofore obtruded themselues, to a minde sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticate with partialitie as demonstrations, may perhaps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to a pure and single eie nothing else but slender and sillie collections. And for the better performance, let mee intreat you to haue alwaies one eie fixed vpon the nature of things indifferent, and the other vpon the dutie of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to his Soueraigne.</p>
            <p n="41">41 Some men will say that they could bee content to yeeld, but onely because they haue so long withstood by preaching and practising the contrarie. Those men in so saying, approoue the orders of the Church of England for lawfull, and condemne their owne former and present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance for vnlawfull: and therefore if they carrie so tender a conscience as they pretend, why then doe they not leaue that disobedience which their conscience iudgeth vnlawful, and imbrace that obedience which they know to be lawful? But they imagine that in so doing their credit should be ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished with a note of inconstancie. As though it were any credit to bee constant in euill things, or any discredit to change for the better. Indeed a good name is a precious ointment, and a good reportis much to be regarded: but if the question come betweene you and the Prince, the church, and the lawes vnder which you liue, I hope it is no disparagement for you, to bow, to bend, and to learne obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And I would wish that such men which set so high a price vpon their owne reputation would propose vnto themselues the example of S. <note n="1" place="margin">Cor. 10. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> who sought not his owne profit, but the profit of many, that they might bee saued. To seeke the good of an other is charitie. To seeke the glorie of Christ is pietie.

If you haue the humilitie of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> you would rather seeke Iesus Christ then your owne credit. And such ingenuous dealing would be honorable in the eies of true iudgement. If Saint <hi>Austin</hi> forsooke his owne errours to follow a trueth discouered by a Donatist, how much more should you imbrace the trueth, being discouered vnto you by the reuerend Fathers of our Church?</p>
            <p n="42">42 Some perhaps will say, they could be content in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of themselues, but they refraine in regard of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

Therefore it behooueth you which heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue beene ring-leaders to disobedience, heereafter to shew your selues perswaders and patterns of obedience: and as heeretofore being missed your selues, you haue missed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so being resolued your selues, it is your dutie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue others. And our hope is, that those which are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, the Lord will in time reueale it vnto them.

If you my brethren will but obserue this moderation, then I trust you will not forsake the preaching of the Gospell which is a ring of gold; although there were cleauing vnto it a ceremonie (as it were) of straw.</p>
            <p n="44">44 Secondly, remember the commandement of God. <note n="3" place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Let euerie soule be subiect to the higher powers:</hi> behold the face of our gracious Soueraigne, and consider what a griefe it must needs bee vnto him, to see those which are indued with learning and vertue, not to haue learned the vertue of obedience. Wee all acknowledge him to be supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour ouer all persons, &amp; causes ecclesiastical and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: is he gouernour of all persons, and shall he not gouerne you?

to your oth or no.</p>
            <p n="45">45 Thirdly, regard your mother the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land so wailing and wringing her hands to see such distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her own bowels, such glorious stars to lose their light, such links to be broken off from her golden chaine. ô what a rent, what a grieuous rent is made in the vnseamed coat of Iesus Christ? you refuse the crosse and surples for feare of a scandall, but this renting of the Church is indeed a scandall, a most heauie and Iam entable scandall. And this is told in <note n="4" place="margin">2. Sam. 1. 20</note> 
               <hi>Gath, and published in the streets of Ashkelon,</hi> it makes the daughters of the Philistines reioice, and the daughters of the vncircumcised triumph. For the Papists sport themselues and clap their hands, while the godly grieue and mourne in Sion. The Scripture speaking of the debate between the seruants of <hi>Abraham &amp; Lot,</hi> doth adde that the <note n="1" place="margin">Gen. 13. 7.</note> Cananites and the Perizzites dwelt then in the land, to signifie that though their contention in it selfe was euill, yet it was worse because the enemies of God which would reioice at it, were then in the land. So belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I say vnto you, these contentions are euill in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but the worse, because the papist is now in the land.

Hee deuiseth and plotteth to vndermine both Church and common-wealth, while we are contending one with another. And as you reioice the Papists, so you encourage the Brownists, who builde their conclusions vpon your premises, and put your specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in practise. For haue not your ringleaders proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that our gouernment by Bishops is popish, our litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie popish, our ministring of baptisme with the crosse po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, our kneeling at the Communion popish; our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for publike administration, popish; our holidaies, popish; and almost euerie thing popish?

               <hi>be not partakers in her sinnes, and that yee taste not of her plagues:</hi> haue vpon your former premises, gathered a practicall conclusion, and made an actuall separation and rent from the Church of England. And surely my brethren, as they had their original from your positions, so now they are strengthened by your practises: for they may well thinke that such learned and vertuous men, so famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed Preachers, knowing a <hi>Wee pronounced against them if they preach not the Gospell,</hi> would neuer suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be silenced for matters which they iudged indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and therefore they will take it as granted, that the things you sticke at, are in your opinion simplie vnlawfull. Vpon this dangerous position they will builde an other, for if the Liturgie of the Church of England as it is inioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at this day to be performed, be such as a Minister can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not execute his function with a good conscience: then they conclude, that neither may the people heare it with a good conscience, because their presence were an approbation of it: thus the vnquiet wit of man, will still be working, euen till it runne it selfe vpon the rocke of his owne destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore (my deare brethren) I beseech you, as you tender the good of the Church to lay aside all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious humors. Let there not bee found in you a spirit of contradiction and singularitie: but follow those things which concerne peace, and wherewith one may edifie an other. Let vs consider one an other to prouoke one an other to loue and good works. Bend your selues to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the quiet of the Church, and keepe the vnitie of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the bond of peace: Which is rather to be expected at your hands, because the points in question are the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like constitutions of the venerable conuocation, which is the Church of England representatiue, in whose voice your owne voice is included. Some peraduenture will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie that if this reason be sound, then the reuerend Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time should haue subscribed to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, because it was then decreed by the Conuocation.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12689:38"/>
But I answer, that there is not the like reason. For against their popish conclusions the blessed Martyrs had euident and necessary demonstration of holy Scripture, to which all dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Againe, the matters they stood vpon, were substantiall points of religion, whereas our controuersies are of a lower nature. And surely as probable induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must yeeld to necessarie, so amongst probable (of which sort are all reasons deduced from the authoritie of man) the priuate must giue place to the publike. Will you haue the iudgement of master <hi>Caluin,</hi> in this point also?

            <p n="46">46 Fourthly, looke vpon those reuerend Fathers and Bishops of our Church, by whose hands and voices that

blessing was powred vpon you, which made you ministers of holie things. Haue you not at your ordination made a promise, and at your institution taken a reuerent oth of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall obedience? Wherefore let mee exhort you which haue taken this oth, and being admonished by your Bishop, oppose your selues notwithstanding against the laudable discipline of our Church, to enter into your owne soules and vprightly to consider, whether while you pretend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, you doe not that which is vncomely for conscie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? And for our Bishops, ò what an anguish will it bee to their soules, if those voices which ordained you, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to depriue you? And what a comfort would it be both to them, and to all your brethren of the Ministerie, if we might ioine together against the common enemie, and bee linked in euerlasting chaines of loue one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And heere most reuerend Fathers, though in your wisedome you finde it fit that authorized lawes be put in execution, yet remember that the offenders are your owne children in the Lord, and by Gods mercie your assistants in dispensing the precious trueth of Iesus Christ, and many of them very learned and laborious in the Church of God, adorned with manifold vertues and graces of the spirit, and therefore let all your proceedings towards them be with a tender heart and a tender hand. Consider the multitude of papists, and the insulting of vaine-glorious Iesuits; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how sinne and iniquitie euerie where abound; and what need the Church hath of their learned labours: and therefore in the name of God trie all meanes in Fatherly maner to reduce them, endeuour according to your godly wisedome to giue them full satisfaction of their doubts, and to make the equitie of the required subscription plaine and manifest vnto them, that their consciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing resolued, they may proceed as before, in the worke of the Lord, for this will tend much to the glorie of God, the good of the Church, your owne comfort, and the sauing of many thousand soules.

            <p n="47">47 Finally, beloued, call to mind the flocke of Christ, that depends vpon you: their profiting in religion was the comfort of your hearts, your ioy and your crowne, the seale of your Ministerie; they heard you as the Angels of God, yea as Iesus Christ, and could haue beene content to haue plucked out their owne eies and haue giuen them to you. And therefore if there be any loue, any bowels of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, forsake not the lambes of Iesus Christ, whereof the holie Ghost hath made you ouerseers. For let me tell you, that your loue to the flocke ought rather like a golden chaine to draw you, then the pleasing of any particular man to withdraw you. Which I speake lest peraduenture anie of my brethren hauing tasted the sweete liberality of the Laitie, should seeke rather to fit their humors then to doe their owne dutie. And heere I would exhort the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people to imploy their wits rather about matters of faith and repentance, then to intermeddle with the rites of the Church: for the kingdome of God consisteth not in these externall ceremonies, but in righteousnesse &amp; peace, and ioy in the holie Ghost. They shall finde more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in praier to God, in the works of charitie, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the deedes of the flesh, then in troubling themselues with such fruitlesse disputes. And yet in some the minde transported with zeale growes verie violent, like a fire in their bones. And therefore hauing once this setled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that our rites are vnlawfull, they bend themselues with might and maine against them, kindling and cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their owne opinions in others; yea they will not spare their purses but incourage and inflame men with golden e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, a verie potent kinde of perswasion: but it is the shepherds dutie not to wander after the sheepe, but to go before them like stars, instructing them in the right waie: so their zeale which now is misguided, shall be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

with knowledge, and both pastor and flocke shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the eies of the Lord To conclude, let vs all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by one rule, that wee may minde one thing. And the Lord of heauen blesse this land, both Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Lord blesse this Church and the Ministers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. O Lord in thy mercie make vp the rents and breaches of Sion. O gracious father knit our hearts to thee, and one to an other, that we may loue and feare thy name, and keepe the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace. Grant this O God of all grace and peace, for thy Sonne our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sauiour his sake, to whom with thee and the holy Ghost be rendred all praise, glorie and maiestie in the Church, from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Amen.</p>
