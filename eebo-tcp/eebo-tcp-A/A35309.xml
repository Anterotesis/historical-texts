            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NO Man can poſſibly be ſo great a Stranger to his own courſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Life, as not to diſcover the ſpreading growth of ſin; by our own woful experience we find it to be too true, that when with delight and complacency we inure our ſelves to the practice of lighter ſins for quality and degree, at laſt growing impudently confident, we fear not to comply with the Devils Temptations to Sins of a deeper die, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when occaſion and opportunity preſents us with a fair invitation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, for cuſtom in ſin (by the juſt Judgement of God) unhappily deprives the Sinner of all ſenſeof, and remorſe for Sin; upon this ſtupidity and ſenſeleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience, there unavoidably follows a ready yeilding to any wicked actions, that are but probably and temptingly propounded.</p>
            <p>Commonly the beginnings of ſin are baſhful and modeſt, the Devil is ſo politick in his contrivances to compaſs our eternal ruine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he modeſtly lays his foundation with temptations to ſins (that in the eye of carnal reaſon) ſeem little and inconſiderable; if he chance to find us ſo facile as readily to comply with thoſe, then like a confident Beggar he importunately ſollicites our conſent to greater ſins; nay, ſuch is the unluckly conſequence and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable danger of ſin, that it frequently falls out, that the courteous Sinner to ſecure himſelf from the ſhame that attends ſome little ſins, thinks himſelf neceſſitated to conceal their guilt by the commiſſion of greater ones.</p>
            <p>He therefore that ſincerely deſires to ſecure his ſoul from the mortal wounds of groſſer ſins, muſt be ſure at firſt not to diſregard leſſer ſcares, for a modeſt and private way of ſinning, will at laſt conclude in a publick and ſhameleſs committing of ſin.</p>
            <p>Our Alwiſe God hath thought good by the leaſt, to hedge in and ſecure obedience to the greater Commandments, he therefore that dares frequently attempt to encroach upon this encloſure, and ſecurely violate the leſſer cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, will at laſt grow impudently bold, and daringly invade Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, in commanding us in matters of greater moment; he that neglect to pay tites of mint and cumming, will quickly let go the weightier things of the Law; a Laſcivious g<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> The beſt way therefore to ſecure our ſelves from the Devils danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temptations, is couragiouſly to reject his allurements to little ſins, and then he will utterly deſpair of prevailing with us in groſſer impieties.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly we may fooliſhly propoſe to our ſelves certain bounds and limits in our proceedings in the way of ſin, but when once we have forfeited the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Protection and Aſſiſtance, by our frequent deviations, it to too often falls out that men violently ruſh upon deſtruction, never conſidering whether their Souls are poſting, till they find themſelves amidſt the infornal Regions of Darkneſs, a clear demonſtration of this truth, you have here preſented to your ſerious conſideration in the following lamentable paſſages.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Thomas Reignolds</hi> (as it appears by his own Confeſſion, and the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>port of his Neighbours) was from his very infancy much addicted to ſeveral vices; his Parents (though poor) yet kept him at School ſo long, till he was able in a compotent manner to read in the Bible, but by his own careleſsneſs, and his Parents forgetfulneſs of their duty to call upon him to read, when he was apprehended and caſt into a Priſon, he could hardly read at all, for a week or fortnight at leaſt he denied that he could ever read, but at laſt being diſcovered to be a Lyar herein, by the Miniſter of the Pariſh where he lived, he was deſired by him to read the 51. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which he did ſo pittifully, that he ſeldom pronounced a whole word true, being ſharply reproved for this great loſs, which would have been very advantageous to him in order to his preparations for death, which was then poſting upon him, he began with a ſigh or two to confeſs how careleſs he had been in ſerving God, both in publick in the Church, and in private in his Cloſet duties; he ſpent very many Sabbaths in idleneſs, in ſporting and playing, and ſeveral in the Ale-houſe; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Houſe of <hi>Thomas Corfield,</hi> who lived near unto the Houſe of <hi>John Stephens,</hi> where he committed the following Murthers. Laſt Summer Aſſizes he was Arraigned at <hi>Salop,</hi> for ſtealing ſix pounds out of the Houſe of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Maddox,</hi> and though with dreadful imprecations he continued to deny that he had the Money, yet upon his Tryal there was ſo good evidence (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral very probable circumſtances) brought in againſt him, that he was in great danger of being found guilty, his beſt friend to ſave his life, was <hi>John Stephens,</hi> whom he now will required, by murthering his Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter: he was not twenty years of Age, when be acted theſe following villanies:</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wenſday</hi> being the 22. of <hi>January</hi> laſt paſt, the day before <hi>Thomas Reignolds</hi> committed the following murthers, he was not then to be found, that night he lay at <hi>Corlfieds</hi> houſe, and the Mother and Siſter of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Reignolds</hi> coming late there to look for him, <hi>Corfield</hi> and his Wife return'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49472:3"/>
them this anſwer, that he had not been in their Houſe of three months before, this <hi>Corfield</hi> did (as <hi>Reignolds</hi> ſaith) without his knowledge or conſent. The next morning intending to return to his Fathers Houſe; as he went home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very early, he called at the houſe of <hi>John Stephens,</hi> to inquire for a pair of Gloves, which he ſuppoſed he might leave there the evening before; not finding them there, <hi>John Stephens</hi> being to go to <hi>Stoke</hi> Caſtle, to his accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed days labour, <hi>Thomas Reignolds</hi> accompanied him part of the way towards <hi>Aldon.</hi> Not far from the houſe of <hi>John Sthephens</hi> there is a Broomy Cloſe, where <hi>Reignolds</hi> left him, telling <hi>John Stephens</hi> that he would go and ſearch there for his Gloves, for he did not know (as he ſaid) but he might have dropt them there the day before; no ſooner had he parted with <hi>John Stephens,</hi> and had entered into the Cloſe, but as he was hanging down his head, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently looking for his Gloves, two men (one in Black and the other in light Gray Cloaths) appeared to him, asking him what he ſought for, he ſaid for a pair of Gloves which he had loſt; they bid him not trouble himſelf about his Gloves, for if he would be ruled by them, and do as they would have him, he ſhould not want Gloves or any thing elſe; he asked their names, which they gave to him; he in black called himſelf <hi>William Pugh,</hi> and the other <hi>Richard Tallet;</hi> theſe two perſons appeared in ſo good Habit, that the talked with them (as he ſaith) with his Hat in his hand, and when once he had entered into diſcourſe with them, he had no power to leave their company, when therefore he had promiſed them obedience upon the forementioned conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they turned about and enquired the names of ſeveral Neighbouring Towns, as <hi>Ludlow, Onibury, Staunton,</hi> and <hi>Bromfield;</hi> not long after (as he ſaith) they propoſed to him the following murther, and being asked by the Miniſter (to whom he firſt made this confeſſion) what induced him to embrace their motion to ſo barbarous an action, he ſaid, that he thought <hi>John Stephens</hi> who had ſold a Cow about three Weeks before, had received the money for her, without delay therefore or any further ſcruple, <hi>Thomas Reignolds</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe two men up to the Houſe of <hi>John Stephens,</hi> he as was ſaid before, was gone to work to the Houſe of the Right Worſhipful Sir <hi>Samuel Baldwyn; Thomas Reignolds</hi> therefore with the two men after him, entering into the houſe, he found <hi>Alice Stephens</hi> Spinning at the Wheel, near unto the fire, ſhe being very heavy of hearing, he inſenſibly came behind her, and laying hold of her under her Chin, he drew back her head with the one hand, and with the other he ſo ſuddenly cut her throat, that ſhe had not time ſo much as to ſay, Lord have Mercy upon her ſoul, no ſooner had he thus imbrued his hands in this innocent blood, but he looked behind him, but could not (as he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) ſee the two Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49472:3"/>
As yet his conſcience was not awakened, neither was he in the leaſt troubled for what he had done, or terrified with beholding this poor creature lying in her own Blood. Leaving therefore her dead body, he began to ſearch the houſe for the reward which the Devil (or his own wicked thoughts) propoſed to him for this horrible Murther, but finding no Money (for as it hapned it was not then received) he met with nothing that he could conveniently carry away, ſave only her wedding Rings, as he was above in the Chamber buſily ſearching about, he eſpied <hi>Martha</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Alice Stephens</hi> comming homewards, (for ſhe happened to be out of doors when her Mother was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered) the better therefore to ſecure himſelf by concealing this firſt murther, to add Blood to Blood; in purſuance of this his curſed reſolution, he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left the Chamber, and poſted towards the door of the houſe, and no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was this young girl entred in, but he laid Violent hands on her, and being much too ſtrong for her (ſhe was about 14. or 16. Years of age) he ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut her throat alſo, that ſhe had time to ſay no more, but where's my Mother.</p>
            <p>When he had thus inhumanely butchered theſe two innocent ſouls, he not not long after, returned back again to the houſe of <hi>Thomas Corfield,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued drinking there the greateſt part of that day.</p>
            <p>This double Murther was committed between Nine &amp; Eleven of the Clock on Thurſday the 23d. day of <hi>January,</hi> in the beginning of the night he left <hi>Corfields</hi> houſe, and went back towards the houſe of <hi>John Stephens,</hi> and entring thereinto, he dragged <hi>Martha Stephens</hi> from the door (where he left her, after he had Murthered her,) into a Hovil joyning to the houſe, then taking ſome Fire from the Harth, he conveighed it into ſome Straw that was in the Hovil, and thereby he burnt the houſe, and with it conſumed to Aſhes the greateſt part of both their Bodies.</p>
            <p>Thus having by murther and fire moſt inhumanely deprived this poor man (not only of the beſt part of his worldly comforts, but alſo of the greateſt part of his goods, which by his hard labour he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>o their reſt, and the doors of the houſe ſhut, he conveighed himſelf in through a wall that was broken down on the back-ſide of the houſe; and laying himſelf down upon his bed, he thought to take ſome reſt, but the inward gripes and pangs of his guilty conſcience, did ſo intolerably tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and torment him, that he could not lay his eye-lids together.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore he could find no reſt within doors, he roſe up again, and

went out of the houſe, inſtantly the two men (as he confidently ſaith) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him again, the firſt queſtion that they aſked him, was, whether he had any Enemies in the Town, whereunto he return'd this anſwer, that he had two, naming <hi>Edward Maddox,</hi> who (as was ſaid before) indited him the laſt Summer <hi>Aſſizes</hi> for ſtealing ſix Pounds out of his houſe; and <hi>Richard White</hi> (both of <hi>Aldon)</hi> who went to the Juſtince for a Warrant to appehend him. They aske him, if he would not be revenged on them, whereunto he reply'd, how ſhould he be reveng'd on them, they tell him, by conſuming all that they had.</p>
            <p>Upon this ſuggeſtion his deviliſh malice inſtantly complied with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengful motion, wherefore being reſolutely bent to follow their helliſh direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, he went back into his Fathers houſe, and took out thence (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, unknown to any of the Family) a large ſtick of fire; with it in his hand he poſted to the houſe of <hi>Edward Maddox</hi> of <hi>Aldon,</hi> intending firſt to fire his houſe, but perceiving the wind to blow the fire towards his Fathers houſe, for fear leſt that alſo ſhould be burnt with it, he deſiſted from his purpoſe there, and went immediately to the houſe of <hi>Richard White</hi> of the ſame Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and about Mid-night he put the fire into ſome Broom wherewith his Oven was covered to keep it dry, and never left blowing it, till it began to flame when he had done this work of the Devil, he went into a cloſe at the end of the Town, to ſee the iſſue thereof; and (as he ſaith) he walked ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times about it, being willing to return to the houſe, and quench the fire, before it broke out into a violent flame, but he could not (as he confeſſes) find the way out, he was ſo terrified and amazed. Had not therefore the fears that ſeized upon <hi>Richard White</hi> and his Wife, in beholding <hi>Stephens</hi> houſe on fire, with the ſtrong jealouſies that his Wife and Daughter were murthered before the houſe was burnt, they alſo with three ſmall Children had been conſumed to Aſhes, with their Dwelling Houſe, out Houſes, Grain, Hay, Impliments of Husbandry, and Houſhold-ſtuff, with this houſe the next houſe was fired and burnt to the ground, and the reſt of the Town was in very great danger. All this time whilſt theſe two houſes were Burning this barbarous Villian ſtood upon the edg of the Common (called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons Mind)</hi> where he did the Murther and fired the firſt houſe.</p>
            <p>Now all perſons began to ſuſpect <hi>Thomas Reignalds,</hi> he fearing therefore leſt he ſhould be taken upon ſuſpition, reſolves not to enter the Town again, but inſtantly to betake himſelf to the woods, and as he was flying his two old companions appeared to him again, no ſooner did he ſee them, but he began to diſcover his fears and jealouſies to them, they encouraged him with fair promiſes that he ſhould not be taken, and (as he ſaith) they went with him to a Hay barn belonging to Mr. <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

there they continued talking with him, till he was faſt a ſleep, the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he did awake, his guilty Conſcience (as he confeſſes) did ſo terrify and torment him, with the lamentable cries of that Innocent Blood he had ſo barbarouſly ſpilt, that he found as little eaſe, as if he had been laid upon a Bed of Thorns. Under theſe horrours, and terrors, he paſt away the day; on Friday night, thoſe two men appeared to him again, telling him that he was very ſecure there, and ſo perſwaded him to alter his reſolution of flying that night, he being very drowſy quickly fell a ſleep; waking again the next Morning, though he miſs'd his companions; yet he found his old terrours were mightily encreaſed; and he was beyond expreſſion affrighted with the horrid repreſentations of the grave and hell, whether he feared his Soul and Body were poſting. In this miſerable condition he continued all Saturday, at night his miſerable comforters viſited him again: the firſt queſtion that now they propoſed to him, was whether he were not hungry, he ſaid, yes I am very hungry, and more thirſty (and well indeed he might for from Thurſday to Saturday-night, he had not taſted a bit of Bread, or drunk ſo much as a drop of of Water) they tell him that if he would follow them, they would bring him where he ſhould have both Meat and Drink. It is not to be douted but that he chearfully embraced their Motion. Inſtantly therefore they went with him to the houſe of <hi>Richard Jennings</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>Onibury,</hi> which <hi>Thomas Reignolds</hi> confeſſes he broke open, thereupon they entred with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, where he drank <hi>Metheglin,</hi> and took from thence a <hi>Cheeſe</hi> and a <hi>Loaf</hi> of Bread, which were taken with him next day. (He was asked whether theſe two men did Eat and Drink with him, he ſaid no, they only ſtood by him) when therefore by this means he had allaid the violence of his hunger and thirſt, theſe two men returned with him to the Hay-Barn again, ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageing him not to fly, but however his intentions were about Cocks-Crowing (when he had taken a little reſt) to forſake the Barn, and fly for his life, but when he was once fallen aſleep, he did not awake till Sunday-morning when he was apprehended.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> he received his Tryal, he pleaded guilty: and on the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following the Sentence was paſſed upon him; he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be Hang'd in Chains on <hi>Aldons Mind,</hi> near the place where he did the murther. Accordingly on <hi>Thurſday March</hi> the <hi>20th.</hi> he was Executed.</p>
            <p>He expreſſed much ſorrow for what he had done, and was troubled at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as the Murther of the Girle; he wept much on <hi>Wenſday,</hi> the day before he received the Sentence, and no ſooner did he ſee <hi>John Stephens,</hi> but he fell upon his knees, deſiring him with much earneſtneſs to forgive him.</p>
