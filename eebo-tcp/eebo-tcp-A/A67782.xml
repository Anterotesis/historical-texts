         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whole Duty
OF
A CHRISTIAN:
OR,
The Character of a true Beleever,
that walks in some measure answerable to
the Gospel, his Christian profession, and the
millions of Mercies he hath received. In reading whereof reflect upon your selves, and see
what comparison there is between that you are, and what
you should be: and then with blessing from above, it will much
further you in your way to Heaven: for therefore are we
Christians in name only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because we think our selves

Of your <hi>learning</hi> I cannot so well judge, or of your <hi>subtill disputations;</hi> but

            <p>§ 3. Men are apt to carp against what the <hi>Minister</hi> speaks, though he
bring the <hi>Word</hi> for his warrant; but the <hi>Beauty of Holinesse</hi> hath often
stolen away the <hi>hearts</hi> of the gainsayers, and won their <hi>affections</hi> even
against their <hi>wills.</hi> Religion hath a <hi>truth</hi> and a <hi>power</hi> in it: people will
never beleeve the truth of a <hi>doctrine</hi> in our <hi>mouthes,</hi> where they see not the
<hi>power</hi> thereof in our <hi>lives.</hi> Nor can it be denied, but that <hi>words</hi> are of
more efficacy and authority when <hi>deeds</hi> follow. But take some instances
whereof we have ample experience. And first observe how it fares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Pastors</hi> and their <hi>people;</hi> for from the <hi>Pastors example</hi> they all take
fire, as one <hi>torch</hi> lights many.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Pastors are the glasse, the scool, the book,</l>
               <l>Where peoples eyes do learn, do read, do look.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Every private <hi>Christian</hi> ought to be a <hi>common line</hi> in <hi>Christianity;</hi> but the
<hi>Minister</hi> is or should be as a <hi>set copy of sanctification</hi> to the rest.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The learned Preachers words, though plain,</l>
               <l>To plain men truth may preach:</l>
               <l>But Pastors pious practice doth,</l>
               <l>A holy life them teach.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>§ 4. And so on the contrary: All men like <hi>sheep</hi> are prone to <hi>go astray.</hi>
but if the <hi>bellweather</hi> or leading sheep takes a <hi>vagary,</hi> all the <hi>flock</hi> will <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>

<hi>presidents,</hi> even following our <hi>guides</hi> untill we have lost our <hi>selves:</hi> which

and us. A <hi>sick head</hi> makes a <hi>distempered body;</hi> a <hi>blinde eye</hi> endangers all

            <p>§ 1. THis <hi>Christian indeed,</hi> this true Beleever is one, that God (of his
free grace and good pleasure) hath chosen, and elected to eternall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66022:3"/>
life before the foundation of the world; and whom Christ hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cious bloud.</p>
            <p>§ 2. He is effectually called, and become a new Creature by regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
being both begotten and born anew of God by the immortall
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed of the Word, and the Spirits powerfull working with it. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this new birth there is no being saved, as our Saviour himself affirms,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>§ 3. He is industrious after the means of grace, loves to hear Christs
voice, and delights in it, as finding a sweet rellish therein; is able to
know when Christ speaketh, and when the tempter; he receives the Word
not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the Word of God, with all
readinesse; for he resists not as the wicked do, but obeys Christs call;
which worketh in him mightily: for he findes it by experience quick, and
powerfull, and sharper then any two edged sword; piercing even to the
dividing asunder of the soul and spirit, and of the joynts and marrow;
and to the discerning of the very thoughts, and the most secret intents of
the heart.</p>
            <p>§ 4. His heart is circumcised, or rather God takes away the stony
heart out of his flesh, and gives him a new heart; in which he writes his
Law, and puts a new spirit into him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his own Spirit; causing him to
walk in his statutes, and keep his ordinances so as to do them.</p>
            <p>§ 5. God sheds his love abroad in his heart by the holy Ghost, who
witnesseth to his conscience, that he is become the childe of God; whereby
he hath union, and communion with Christ; partakes of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and becomes like God in holinesse.</p>
            <p>§ 6. He is brought out of darknesse into marvellous light, hath his
eyes opened to see the wonders of Gods Law; and that vail, or curtain
which before was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>awn over his heart (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15, 16.) taken away, and
is turned from the power of Satan unto God.</p>
            <p>§ 7. He is ashamed of his former conversation, bewailes, and mourns
bitterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sins, actuall and originall, of omission and commission,

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> known; lesser, as well as greater: yea, as well for the evil
which cleaves to his best works, as for his evil works; being more grieved
for offending so good a God, then for that it doth, or might bring him
shame, or punishment in this life, or in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll.</p>
            <p>§ 8. He now findes that the Law is spirituall, binding the heart as
well as the hands; to which holy and just rule he brings all his thoughts,
words and actions; and so sees himself out of measure sinfull, as being
guilty of all manner of concupiscence; having broken every one of those
righteous precepts (<hi>Exodus</hi> 20.) more times and waies then he hath haires
on his head; not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing able of himself to think a good thought: for that
all the powers of his soul, and members of his body, are who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
corrupted.</p>
            <p>§ 9. He sees himself as guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne (being in his loyns,) as
any Heir is liable to his Fathers debt; and esteems it the Mother, and
Nurse of all: finding it like the great wheel in a clock, that sets all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66022:3"/>
wheels on moving, while it seems to move slowest; and therefore hates
and bewails it, as the most foul, hatefull, secret, deceitfull, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
evil.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <p>§ 1. VVHereupon finding himself in a lost condition, and confessing
that he hath deserved all the plagues of this life, and of that
which is to come; and groaning under the burthen of sinne, utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of all help in himself: he is solicitously carefull in the use of the
means, to attain faith in the promise of Gods merey made in Christ, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
no rest untill he get some assurance, vehemently hungring and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
after, and earnestly praying for the pardon of sinne, waiting on the
Lord with patience.</p>
            <p>§ 2. He humbly, unfainedly, and freely confesseth all his sins so far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
he is able, with the severall circumstances which aggravate the same, to
his own shame and Gods glory.</p>
            <p>§ 3. He will take a holy revenge on himself, even to the denying of
his own reason and affections, his credit, carnall friends, profits, pleasures,
and whatever else might hinder: and by restoring goods or monies evil
gotten, though it were long since, and when he was a servant; in case he
be able.</p>
            <p>§ 4. He unfainedly desires to forsake all sinne, as being in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
dead to it, Christ (by his Spirit) having freed him from the power
and dominion thereof, and in part abolished it; at least he so parts from
all iniquity, and hates every false way, that no one sinne doth raigne in
him: for when he doth commit any evil, it is full sore against his will, as
being led captive to it by the strength of Satans temptations and his own
corruptions; for he never commits it freely and willingly, and with full
consent: he allowes not of the evil he does, no he will not premeditately,
and in times not utterly deserted, do the least evil that the greatest good
may come of it: neither is there any sinne he knows by himself (were it
formerly never so pleasing to him) but he desires as heartily, that he might
never commit it, as that God should never impute it. He likewise ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
sinne throughly and universally, and therefore is throughly grieved for the
abominations that are done by others; to the dishonour of God, and
slander of religion, or the ruin of mens souls.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Nor does he only abhor and depart from evil, but he cleaves unto
that which is good: he is not only dead to and made free from sin, but as
he hath once been the servant of sin, so he becomes the servant of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse:
and as he hath been instrumentall to Satan, so he will now be
as active to serve Christ; and be as fruitfull in good works, as he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been in evil works.</p>
            <p>§ 6. He is conformed to the Image of Christ, and is led by the Spirit;
walks in newnesse of life, lives holily, justly and unblameably, for now he
walks not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, and brings forth the fruits of
the Spirit, mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. so that he is changed and renewed in
every part, power and faculty: his understanding is enlightned, his minde
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66022:4"/>
renewed, his will changed, his affections sanctified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he who thinks
he beleeves, and findes not a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
            <p>§ 1. HE goes often and upon all occasions unto God in prayer, in
which lies all his strength; yet not as his, but as it is the interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Gods own Spirit in him, poured out in the Name of Christ, and
according to his will: for being truly sensible of his sins and wants, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
chiefly prayes for the pardon of sinne, the effusion of grace, and for the
assistance of Gods Spirit: that he may more firmly beleeve, more soundly
repent, more zealously do, more patiently suffer, and more constantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe
in the practice and profession of every duty. Nor does he for the
most part fall into prayer without meditation and preparation; nor utter
words without dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on and affection; nor without some assurance and
perswasion, that God will hear and grant his requests: yea, he mostly takes
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice of his enlargements in prayer, and of the successe afterwards, and is
accordingly thankfull or humbled; not that he measureth Gods hearing
his suit by his present answer, or his present answer by his own sense; he
will pray (at least in some poor measure) at all times, striving against
deadnesse of spirit and distractions, as an heavy burthen.</p>
            <p>§ 2. He hears the Word with attention, mindes, observes, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
it carefully; receives and applies whatsoever precept or promise is
spoken out of the Word, as spoken by God to himself in particular; is
astonished at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eepnesse of Gods wisedom, power and goodnesse; seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
meditating upon the the Nature, Attributes, Word and Works of
God: he layes it up in his heart, ponders on it in his mind, and practiseth
it in his life: neither will he approach unto the Lords Table, without due
examination and preparation.</p>
            <p>§ 3. He is enligtned with the saving knowledge and hid things of the
Gospel; and to see truth from error, good from evil; together with his
own wretched nesle by sinne, and the riches of Gods free grace and mercy
in Christ towards his own soul; he is not ignorant of the Principles of
Religion, as most aged people are; but is able and ready to give a reason of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he hope that is in him.</p>
            <p>§ 4. He loves and longs after a powerfull and searching Ministry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all earthly treasures, as finding a greater necessity of spirituall then
corporall food; and therefore will take any pains, or be at any cost, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any disgrace to injoy it.</p>
            <p>§ 5. He is never offended at any wholsome truth, be it never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toothsome,
but affects that Ministry most which most layes open and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
his own sinne; even therefore coming to the light, that his deeds
may be made manifest. When he hears his own sins spoken against, he
does not apply the same unto others, as is the manner of too many; nor is
he wise to defend the evil he does, but loves to be admonished; nor will he
after warning and conviction from the Word, go on in an evil way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his principall care is to be saved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66022:4"/>
§ 6. He will not mock his admonisher, scoff at the means to be saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor make himself merry with his own damnation, as the desperately wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
do. He turns not his back upon any truth, nor flies from any instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
he hateth not the light: yea he loves that Minister best, that most
makes manifest the secrets of his heart; as knowing that God is in him
of a truth. He will not refuse a Pardon because he dislikes the Messenger.
Indeed he least regards those Ministers that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> world admires, as well
weighing what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Ioh. 4. They are of the world, therefore speak
they of the world, and the world heareth them: we are of God, he that knoweth
God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us: hereby know we the Spirit
of truth, and the spirit of errour,</hi> ver. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>§ 7. He will not plead against God, nor ask a reason of his actions; if
he meets with hard Scriptures, he runs not into errour, not is offended, but
suspends his judgement, and blames his own blindnes: you may know him
from an unbeleever by this, he is wise to defend the truth when he hears it
spoken against, but never argues against it; whereas the unbeleever (being
prompted by Satan) can most subtilly argue against the truth, though he
hath not a word to speak for it; yea, he thinks it religion enough if he can
but dispute against the religious, which is a manifest signe of a wicked
man. Briefly, he neither carps nor frets against a faithfull Minister, nor
seeks to intrap him, or pervert what he delivers, but prayes for him, and is
ready to speak in his defence.</p>
            <p>§ 8. He hath an high estimation of the Ministers, and means by
which he was converted, and findes more sweetnesse in the Gospel then in
any thing else in the world.</p>
            <p>§ 9. Spirituall judgements, (as a famine of the Word, the blindnesse of
mens mindes, hardnesse of their hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) he accounts more wofull then
any judgement the world can be sensible of.</p>
            <p>§ 10. He is not of a reprobate judgement, in thinking good evil and
evil good; neither hath he a base esteem of Gods people and their wayes,
as it fares with our scoffing adversaries, who look upon zeal and holinesse
with the devils spectacles; nor so farre from being holy himself that he
hates holinesse in others, or so stupidly sottish as the rude rabble, who will
profes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that they love Christ, yet hate all such as any way resemble him.
He will take heed of persecuting the godly either with hand or tongue;
and as he will not condemn the j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, so he will not justifie the wicked, nor
favour them.</p>
            <p>§ 11. He is so farre from taking offence when none is given, that he
will not be offended when offences come; as at the scandalous lives of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
or at the multitude of heresies that are daily broached, though they
grieve his very soul; but when strange things happen, he makes a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
construction thereof.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. V.</head>
            <p>§ 1. HE prayes for the enlargement, and rejoyces at the progresse of the
Gospel, and in the common good of the Church; and so at the
graces or good successe of any member in particular, and will be some way
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66022:5"/>
instrumentall for Christ, praying for and earnestly desiring the salvation
of others; and likewise endeavouring to win all he can to Christ; rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
no lesse when any good thing is done by others, then if himself did
it. He highly respects all such as any way promote the Gospel, and is
thankfull to them.</p>
            <p>§ 2. He is willing to be at cost to serve the Lord, will freely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
carnall things, where he partaketh of spirituall things; and counts the
same as a due, not as a benevolence: yea, he thinks it most just, that they
who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel; and that as freely as men
of other Callings: which signe or character shews, a world of men that
professe themselves Christians to be but counterfeits.</p>
            <p>§ 3. He beleeves impartially the whole Word of God, threats and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
as well as promises; and things above the reach of reason, as well as
what experience hath made plain to him; he feels the power and efficacy
of Gods Word and Spirit, perswading his conscience, that his sins are
pardoned in Christ, and he in favour with God; so that he can truly apply
Christ, and all his benefits and promises unto his own soul; trusting in
him, and casting himself only upon him for pardon and salvation.</p>
            <p>§ 4. He hath a sweet and sanctified peace in his conscience, arising
from the assured forgiven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse of his sins, a sound and strong joy in the
Lord, and in his Word through beleeving; not seldom the holy Ghost
inwardly setting to Gods privy seal, by sudden refreshings falling like the
dew upon his heart, and establishing his soul before the Lord, especially
after holy duties; yea, his hope (as being built upon Gods word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises)
fills him with such joy unspeakable, that is makes him rejoyce even
in tribulation.</p>
            <p>§ 5. He sometimes loseth the efficacie, feeling and comfort of faith,
but the seed and habit of faith alwaies remaineth. He is often and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
assaulted with fears and doubtings, but in the issue he alwaies gets
the conquest, and is the more as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ured for having been so much assaulted,
and does so much the more strive to make his calling and election sure,
and to be assured of future happiness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> after this his earthly pilgrimage.</p>
            <p>§ 6. Or, if he have but a weak faith, yet it is sound, against which the
very gates of hell shall never prevail, for he never utterly falls away from
the grace of God, but perseveres in the truth, and in well doing to the end;
and therein finds also a blessed thriving, and gracious progresse in true
holinesse.</p>
            <p>§ 7. He is perfectly justified by the bloud of Christ, freed from the
rigour of the Law, and in some good measure from the spirit of bondage;
is often in combate between the flesh and the spirit, but the spirit in the
end ever gets the upper hand.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="6" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
            <p>§ 1. ANd as he beleeves in his heart, so he is not ashamed of the crosse
of Christ, but will professe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he truth boldly in all estates, and in
times of suffering, and publish what Christ hath done for his soul, to
Gods glory and the comfort of others: yea, if called to it, he will (God
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66022:5"/>
assisting him) lay down his life for Christ and the Gospel, and rejoyce
also that he is counted worthy.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Neither is he high-minded, but more fears the want of grace,
then confides in what he hath, for he works out his salvation with fear
and trembling; and trusts not in the least to his own strength, but is
ever jealous and suspitious, lest his heart should deceive him; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
by Gods grace, not to use any unlawfull means, nor yeeld to any
thing against the truth, for the avoiding of what he fears, be it burning at
a stake; as knowing and being fully perswaded, that all things shall work
together for the best unto him. And indeed the fear of God, (which is
his continuall guardian) keeps him in some measure from the fear of
death, and terrour of the world; for he fears not them that can only kill
the body, in any degree like him, that after he hath killed can cast both
body and soul into hell. Nor does he grutch to los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a temporall life, when
in lieu thereof he shall obtain an eternall Crown of glory.</p>
            <p>§ 3. He is wonderfully inflamed with the love and estimation of
God and of Christ, especially upon the ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rn of his prayers, or the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of some mercy; the which he shews by his hating of evil, and by
his constant obedience and the delight he hath in keeping of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
and by his willingnesse to be at cost or suffer for him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he so in love with the world or any thing in it, as that it shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
his love to God; yea he so loves and longs for Christs appearing,
that he may be united to him and enjoy his presence, that his daily prayer
is, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Again, He intirely loves, and highly esteems Gods people, not out
of any carnall or sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then they that pervert their wayes though they be rich, and loving
them best that serve God most: He is prone to justifie them, and speak in
their defence when he hears them reviled, slandered or contemned by
wicked and ungodly men, though he incur their displeasure by it.</p>
            <p>§ 5. He does not estrange himself from the people of God in their
misery, but is ready to minister unto them when they stand in need, and
use any means for their relief. He will solicit great ones in their behalf,
and in Christs cause, though he indanger himself thereby: and can be as
earnest a suitor at the throne of Grace for others that are in distresse, as
for himself, even thirsting and studying how he may do them most good,
as participating and being touched with compassion, and having a fellow-feeling
both of the misery and felicity of others, as one member hath of
another, especially of the Churches, as a member hath of the whole
body. Neither can he rejoyce in his own peace and welfare, while the
Church and people of God are in distresse, whose welfare he prefers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his own.</p>
            <p>§ 6. He delights in the Saints company above all others, as finding an
heavenly sweetnesse in their conference and society, where every ones
words do savour of grace and wisedom; and when in every company he
shall either do good or receive good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:66022:6"/>
§ 7. And as he loves and delights in holy company, so he loathes evil
company: neither will he have any fellowship with the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or be in league with the wicked, as Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Scoffers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but avoid all needlesse society with them.</p>
            <p>§ 8. He rejoyceth when the righteous are exalted, and grieves when

the duties of Prayer, reading, repeating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and instructing his
children and servants.</p>
            <p>§ 3. He is zealous to admonish, reclaim and reduce such as go astray;
and to save those among whom he lives, out of duty and thankfulnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to
God and his Redeemer, and out of love to them.</p>
            <p>§ 4. He is ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed of the world for goodnesse, and suffers some way for
Christ; at least, he is evil spoken of for well doing, and rejoyceth therein,
or in whatsoever he suffers; well considering, that all his sufferings in this
life are not worthy that glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e shall enjoy in the next.</p>
            <p>§ 5. His graces and goodnesse gains him more enemies, and breeds
him more danger, then vice and wickednesse does another man: but he is
more pleased then displeased at it, for he knows by the worlds hating of
him, that he is not of the world, but that Christ hath chosen him out of
the world: and that he some way discovers the worlds treasons and deceits.
He knows also that to be the worlds friend, is to be Gods enemy; yea he
esteems it an honour to be evil spoken of by evil men (because when a
thing is best they will like it least:) and a grace to be disgraced for Christ,
who was far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e more disgraced for him. Besides, the single approbation of
one wise experimentall Christian, is enough with him to countervail the
disdain and dislike of a whole Parish of sensualists; and an ounce of credit
with God, more worth then a talent of mens praises. And how little is
that man hurt, whom malice condemns on earth, and God commends in
Heaven? If he cannot avoid their malice and evil words; he will be sure
not to deserve them, which is much at one upon the matter: for as the best
confutation of their slanders, is (not by our great words, but) by our good
works: so his conscience knowing him innocent, like a constant friend
takes him by the hand, and cheers him against all his miseries. However,
he will not in the least wrong his conscience, to avoid the imputation of
singularity. The scoffs of Atheists shall not beat him off from his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
No, is he does well, hath Gods word for his warrant, and glory for
his aim, nothing can daunt or discourage him. Neither the threatnings of
fire, nor the fair and large promises of cunning and cruell adversaries;
neither pain nor losse can make him shrink from Christ; much lesse the
censures and scoffs of lewd persons. The conscience of good intentions,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66022:6"/>
let their successe be what it will; is both a sufficient discharge, and comfort
to his generous minde.</p>

         <div n="8" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
            <p>§ 1. HE will first labour to inform, and then hearken to and obey the
voice of conscience together with the motions of Gods Spirit;
consider anothers case by his own, and in a good measure do to all others
as he would have others do by him.</p>
            <p>§ 2. He is just and upright in his dealings, and desires to pay every
one his due: he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

for which they are branded by the holy Ghost, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 21. He will
not detain wages or workmens hire (a crying sinne that this City groans
under:) He is faithfull to such as put him in trust: if a servant, he purloyns
not, nor deceives in going to market: nor did ever any but hypocrites pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
care of piety towards God, and yet be unmercifull and unjust to
men: yea, it is Devil like, and double damnation, to pretend piety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
villany, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. And indeed, our faith in Christ is best seen in our
faithfulnesse to men; our invisible belief by our visible life. And woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou know whether thou art a Beleever or no? this will infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
thee: thy faith in the Commands will breed obedience, in the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

               </gap>
would try themselves by this touchstone, and consequently either be what
they seem (reall Christians,) or seem as they are (none of Christs,) so
should they not shame Religion by professing it; whereas now, they make
the way of truth evil spoken of: yea, for their sakes the name of goodnesse
is blasphemed all the day long, and an ill reporr taised upon them that
serve God in truth: yea, they have made our savour to stink in the eyes of
all the people, and put a sword into the hands of prophane men to slay us,
as wofull experience shews: for by reason of such, how do the devil and
his limbs triumph over the religious! yea, the Saints are not only reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
the truth disgraced, and Religion it self scandalized; but this gives
occasion to others to blaspheme God, and to doubt whether all Divinity
be not meer Policy, and the Scriptures a Fable, whereby millions are so
hardened, that they even protest against their own conversion: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, if you either love God or his people, if you either care for other
mens souls or your own, remove this stumbling block, and no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your selves; for though he that is not a true Christian may be just,
yet he that is not just cannot possibly be a true Christian.</p>
            <p>§ 3. And as he is just in getting, so he is neither profuse in spending,
nor backward (according to his ability) in releeving Christs members for
his sake, but will give back a considerable part of all he hath to God; and
acknowledge, that he is only a Steward (not an Owner) of what he doth
possesse.</p>
            <p>§ 4. He is not sordidly covetous, nor given to filthy lucre: for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
person is an Idolater, and hath no inheritance in the Kingdom of
Christ and of God, and therefore cannot possibly be a <hi>Beleever:</hi> nor do we
read of one godly person in the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> that was covetous. He is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66022:7"/>
contented with things necessary, and desires not great matters: for if he
have food and raiment, he will therewith be content: considering how
they that will needs be rich, fall into temptations and snares, and into
many foolish and noysome lusts, which drown men in perdition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
and that the desire of money is the root of all evil; which
while some lusted after, they erred from the faith, and pierced themselves
through with many sorrowes. He will neither defraud nor oppresse his
brother in any matter: he will not deal unjustly in line, in weight, or in
measure. He lusteth not after forbidden fruit, nor coveteth that which is
anothers. He will not remove his neighbours Land mark, nor conceal
any Deeds or Writings that make for his neighbours advantage. If his
neighbour suffer prejudice or losse in any thing belonging to him, through
his or his servants means, he will make him recompence to the full. In
case his Cattell break into his neighbours ground, and eat his corn or
grasse; he will willingly, and without compulsion satisfie for the damage.
He will not detain the poor workmans hire untill the morning, least his
family should want bread for the present. He loves Justice in the least
things, and desires rather to buy what he would have, then that it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him: chusing to eat his own bread, and to drink water out of his own
cistern. He hateth gifts, least they should corrupt his judgement and make
him partiall. Nor is he legally just, or conscionable according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
only, but piously just. If his conscience tells him, that he hath any
way prejudiced his neighbour, though there be none to witnesse against
him; though it be unknown to the party himself that suffers the damage,
he will make him satisfaction, and never think he merits by it. If he finde
any thing, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth desires and endeavours to finde out the owner, that he
may restore it. He will not take advantage from his neighbours poverty
or simplicity, to oppresse or cousen him. He will not compound with Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
for ten shillings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the pound, when he is able to pay all. He will
not take an enemies goods, or the goods of an Heathen; though it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Line; without making satisfaction, or re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urning a valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;
though the Laws of the Land will bear him out in it: yea
although he have Letters of Markq, for his warrant, unlesse there be some
other cause. If he make an oath or promise, though to his and Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and to his great disadvantage; he will faithfully perform it, and not
violate the same. Before he useth the extremity either of Law or of Arms,
he offers conditions of peace; and before he will fall to blowes, he will try
what reason will do, soundly examine the cause, and hear what the party
can say for himself: and after that, he will rather suffer and yeeld some
part of his right, then do wrong, contend or go to Law. For he will not do
all he may, least evil men speak ill of him, or insult, as they are very prone
to do, by reason of their spight at religion. Lastly, he seldom but gets the
victory; yea it is rare if he be vanquisht, either in going to Law or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
war; because he never undertakes war or suit without just cause, and
to a good intent. Yea it is rare also, if this be not the issue: the lesse he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets
the more he hath; and the lesse he thirsts after these temporall things,

§ 5. Neither love nor hatred shall rob him of his judgement, or make
him partiall. He will neither esteem father, nor, mother, nor wife, nor
childe, so as to disobey God in the least for their sakes. He will not wrong
his children by a former wife, to give that which is due unto them, unto
the children of a second wife: but he will make his first-born Heir, and
give him a double portion of all that he hath. If his sonne be stubborn
and disobedient, a rioter and a drunkard; he will not nourish him in
it, but inflict due punishment upon him according to his demerits. He
will not seek to save a murtherer from death; least he make the whole
Land guilty of bloud. No, be it his own sonne, least in saving him from a
temporall shame and punishment, he should bring upon him an eternall:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd in liew of saving his body, he should destroy his soul. Besides, he will
rather his own childe shall be destroyed, then God dishonoured, and his
Law not executed. It matters not to him what others would do, nor
what all the world sayes; if they bring not a written word, they prevail
nothing: he will go on in his uprightnesse, and not shame to be singular:
as more fearing Gods anger then the worlds scorns. Neither custom nor
example of his fore-fathers will he follow, without or against the written
word. No, he will not follow <hi>Paul</hi> himself, any farther then he followes
<hi>Christ.</hi> He remembers how vain, ignorant and sinfull his former conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
(which he received by the traditions of his fathers) was: and thinks
it too much to continue still therein. Nor will he take incouragement
from the Saints falls, to do the like: but they shall serve him as Sea-marks,
to make him beware. Indeed when things are of a doubtfull nature, he
will take the surest (not the strongest) side, and which draws nearest to
probability: and where the Law written doth cease, he will observe that
which is allowed by the practice and custom of the godly and religious.</p>

            <p>§ 1. HE is neither Drunkard nor Glutton, he neither tarries long at the
Wine, nor goes often to it, as is the custom of too many; indeed,
whether they are <hi>Christians</hi> or no I cannot easily be satisfied.</p>
            <p>§ 2. He is no Health-drinker; for he abhors drunkennesse, as the root
of all evil, and rot of all good, and scorns the reputation of good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
He is none of those that <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of; who have eyes full of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and that cannot cease to sinne: that gaze upon every fair face, and
lust after every beautifull woman. He will not be caught, nor yeeld to the

and lyeth in wait for him at every corner. Yea he is wise enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that it may not be a woman, but the devil in the likenesse of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as some have thus been cheated.</p>
            <p>§ 3. He denies ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and lives soberly and
chastly in this present world, keeping the members of his body holy; for
if he hath not the gift of continency he will marry his speech is not lewd,
or obscene, nor useth he any lascivious behaviour, nor does <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

§ 4. It is not his manner to curse be he never so much provoked, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will he take the Name of God in vain, but reverently use his Titles
in his Talk: much lesse will he swear by his Name, except upon urgent
occasion, and being lawfully called to it before a Magistrate: least of all
dares he swear by or invocate that which is no god; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amely by any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Idol, which carnall men ignorantly call petty oathes: No, but as he
will not swear, so he fears an Oath.</p>
            <p>§ 5. He will speak the truth from his heart, and not willingly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditately
either lye or equivocate, much lesse will he allow himself in it
or seek to defend it; for such as will do so, have not as yet past the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
birth.</p>
            <p>§ 6. In bearing witnesse he will speak the whole truth impartially,
without fearing or favouring either party, that is, as well what makes for
the Defendant though an enemy, as for the Plaintiff being his friend or
Master: neither will he conceal a wicked device, when by revealing the
same it may be prevented.</p>
            <p>§ 7. He loves, and fears, and bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eves, and serves the Lord, and seeks
his glory, and the good of others in every thing; at least, he desires and
endeavours so to do. He will omit no oportunity of doing good,
nor do evil though he hath opportunity. He remembers his Vow in
<hi>Baptism,</hi> and is carefull to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o far forth he will be humbled. He tempteth
not to evil, but draweth all he can to goodnesse. He will behave himself
honestly and unblameably before those among whom he lives: that he
may not dishonour God, nor offend either those that are within, or those
that are without. He will never sufter base thoughts of God to finde har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in his heart, deal he never so harshly with him; being more prone
to complain of his sinne then of his punishment: for he will turn his
eyes inward, and read his sinne in his punishment: and instead of murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for the few things he wants, be thankfull for the many things he
enjoyes. Whereas others that are unbeleevers, will do something for
God; when it makes for their own ends, he will suffer for him, and hold
out in his works where Satan dwells and keeps his throne. And what they
do for fear of the Law, he does for love of the Gospel. As who are <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers</hi>
indeed, is only known where the power of godlinesse is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
where a <hi>Christian</hi> in name only, will scoff at a <hi>Christian</hi> indeed: for
in such times, many will superstitiously adore the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the <hi>Crosse</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> and worship the dead <hi>Saints</hi> in a cold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
while they worry the living in a cruell persecution. For <hi>Christ</hi> is
stoned by many that are called <hi>Christians,</hi> though no otherwise then the
Heathen Images are called gods. But the Beleever, as he will not go on
in an evil way, though flattered by never so good successe: so he will not
be discouraged in a good way, though he meets with ill successe, because
he is more carefull to please God then men. Nature is like glasse, bright
but brittle: the resolved <hi>Christian</hi> like <hi>gold,</hi> which if we rub it, or beat it,

the dog that returns to his vomit, or the sow that was washed to her wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

means; he seeks not to <hi>Witches, Wisards</hi> or <hi>Southsayers</hi> in his distresse, or to
be resolved of his doubts: but to <hi>Gods Word</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> and to <hi>God</hi>
himself by prayer: and in praying to him, he desires not outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
so much as <hi>Gods</hi> blessing upon them; he desireth not so much food
and rayment, as that God will give them power to nourish, warm and
comfort him, knowing that except that be granted, they cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do it. And so of riches, wisedom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He desires not so much a
great estate as a contented minde. He desires not riches, that he may lay

his gifts. And as he prayes for Gods blessing, so he neglects not to use
the means. When he hath attained his end, or receives any mercy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts his ears and
heart in this and other cases, against Satans temptations: yea, upon the
least change, he can forgive him as heartily as he desires God should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him: yea, he loves and wishes well, and can willingly do good to them
that do evil to him; even desiring his greatest enemies conversion, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his prosperity. He rejoyceth not at anothers fall, but is grieved
both for their sins and miseries: nor is he grieved at any ones good, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at his gifts, and the graces of <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit in him.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Through the study of vertue and Christian prudence, he makes
the servile passions of his minde (fear and anger,) subject to the more
noble faculties of his soul, reason and understanding. As appears in the
provocation of an enemy; for let him be injured, he will both forbear
and forgive: well considering, that <hi>it is the glory of a man to passe by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:</hi>
and that it is greater fortitude to overcome his own passions, then
to vanquish a City. Wherefore, instead of returning like for like, he will
pacifie his enemy with milde words and gentle behaviour: which may be
resembled to Milk that quencheth wild-fire, or Oyl that quenches Lime
which by water is kindled: and thinks it enough for one to be angry at
a time. He is not like our Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ians and <hi>sonnes of Belial,</hi> who when they
are displeased with others, will fly in their Makers face, and tear the
Name of their Saviour in pieces: even swearing away their part in that
bloud which must save them if ever they be saved. Nor like our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
whom the Devil hath so blinded and bewitched, that they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for the way, and strive for the wall even to the death: and kill one
another, as though either of their honours were of more worth, then both
their souls. Or admit one get the victory, miserable is that victory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66022:9"/>
thou overcomest thine enemy; and thy passions, yea the Devil in the
mean time overcomes thee: perhaps thou slayest his body, but the Devil
slayes thy soul. Nor like those fools you see walking in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi>
that like two Cocks of the game, peck out one anothers eyes to make
the <hi>Lawyers</hi> sport. No sayes he, why shovld I vex my self, because ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath vexed me? Or why should I do my self a shrewd turn, because
another would? And admit carnall reason shall alledge to him, that his
enemy is unworthy to be forgiven: rectified reason will answer, but <hi>Christ</hi>
is worthy to be obeyed, who hath commanded me to forgive him. And
well may I bear with him, when his Maker bears with me: and forgive
him, when <hi>Christ</hi> hath forgiven me much more. Nor can any repute
him a coward for this his humble patience: the true coward is your Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spur,
that fears the blasts of mens breath, and not the fire of <hi>Gods</hi> wrath:
that trembles at the thought of a Prison, and yet fears not hell fire. But
the Beleever is <hi>as bold as a Lyon</hi> if his cause be good: yea to speak rightly,
there is no such coward, none so valiant as the Beleever: without Gods
warrant he dares do nothing, with it any thing. He fears none but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of the highest, and runs away from nothing but sinne. Indeed
he more fears the least sinne then the greatest torment; as may be seen in
the <hi>Martyrs</hi> that noble Army. But he is so far from fearing an impotent
enemy, that he fears not death it self: no not the <hi>Day of Iudgement,</hi>
1 Joh. 4. 17. Luk. 21. 25, to 29. yea he is so strong withall, that he is able
to prevail with <hi>God,</hi> Gen. 32. 26, 28. Exod. 32. 10. And overcome the
<hi>world,</hi> the <hi>flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 14. and 5. 4. Gal. 5. 24. and all this
by his faith, patience and prayer: and not seldom does he overcome his
enemy too by well-doing: for he lives so well, that his back-biting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
are either put to silence, or constrained to praise <hi>God,</hi> and speak
well of him.</p>
            <p>§ 3. He hath learnt (from <hi>Gods</hi> dealing with him) to be mercifull, as
his heavenly Father is mercifull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even to his beast. Nor do any that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble

they can expect that their master in Heaven should be mercifull to them:
and certainly, should they be deprived from ever having the help or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

            <p>§ 1. HE is not the worse or prouder, for prosperity or outward blessings,
but the better and more thankfull for them: he is bettered also by
affliction, and makes a gain of his losses; and being in distresse, as he
prayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or deliverance, so he is accordingly thankfull when delivered: yea,
he will mak vowes, and so promise amendment, that he is as carefull to
perform the same when he is delivered, which a wicked man never does.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:66022:9"/>
§ 2. He seeks God in all he does, and acknowledges him in all he
either receives or suffers: he observes the severall passages of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
acknowledging all things to be ordered thereby, and that it exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to the least hair on his head: hath a comfortable experience of his
disposing all to work for the best unto him; admires the same, and his
goodnesse therein, and is accordingly thankfull for it: yea he keeps a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
or Register of <hi>Gods</hi> speciall mercies and deliverances, and of his
own often and great provocations, and not seldom meditates thereon:
neither does he murmur when he wants any thing, as most of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
poor do, whose whole life, language and religion, is nought else but a
continued act of muttering and murmuring: perhaps they want many
things for their bodies, because they slight whatsoever is of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ered them for
their souls; and because God the giver is not in all their thoughts excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to blaspheme him, and to spend his Day in the devils service, for they
never minde how God hath appointed it his Market-day for their souls:
now these brutish Animals are very sensible if they want never so little,
and for that they murmur; but they injoy millions of mercies which
they never cordially give thanks for: and I wish they were often put in
minde, how many thousand <hi>Israelites</hi> were destroyed in the wildernesse,
only for that grievous sinne of murmuring, though their streights and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
were far greater; but as good blow in the dust as speak to these.
And as they have no reason, so they will hear none, only such as truly fear
God know that he owes them nothing; yea, whatever they enjoy on this
side hell, they think themselves unworthy of it.</p>
            <p>§ 3. He honours and obeyes his Parents, and God accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spereth
him, and prolongeth his dayes. If they stand in need, he will nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
and maintain them, as they did him in his need. If a servant, he
serves his Master in singlenesse of heart, as unto Christ, not with eye-service,
but out of conscience. And the Lord is with him, and prospereth
all he takes in hand; gives him such favour in his Masters sight,
that he trusteth him with all he hath. Yea the Lord blesseth his Master,
and all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he family fares the better for his sake. He will not be charitable
with his Masters goods, nor wastfull with his Parents. If a Master, he
useth his servants so, as considering that himself is a servant to a greater
Master. To a good servant he is kinde and liberall: and having staid
long with him, and done him good and faithfull service, he will at the
end of his years, not only make him free, but give him a bountifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
answerable to the good service he hath performed; and by this he
is more inriched. He will not bid his servants tell lyes, or being at home
to say he is abroad. He loves not to rail, or speak evil of <hi>Magistrates;</hi> as
being sent of God, for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of
them that do well.</p>
            <p>§ 4. He is not glad of pretences against obeying the <hi>Magistrates</hi>
command, but will obey Authority as the Ordinance of God; and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e subject more out of conscience then fear, as placed by God over
him: and to all their Laws, if they crosse not Gods Law; for otherwise
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66022:10"/>
he will lose his liberty, part with the right hand of profit, and the right
eye of pleasure; yea, lose his life rather then a good conscience, and sinne
against God; for he will not disobey God to obey great ones. In choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them, he will have respect to their piety and fitnesse; and not to
wealth, favour or any other either private or base ends.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Whereas many love peace but regard not truth; and others ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
all for truth without caring for peace; he together with truth, loves, and
studies, and labours to have a lawfull peace with all men, and so seeks it,
that he will suffer rather then do wrong: and to avoid offence, he will be
overruled in indifferent things; as Christ gave him an example, when he
paid Pole-money.</p>
            <p>§ 6. If a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> he will not be partiall in any cause, nor will he
either for fear or favour do any thing against the truth; or give sentence
against his conscience, or use his power in favour of the wicked; but be just
in shewing mercy, severe to the evil, cherishing and protecting the good.</p>
            <p>§ 7, If a <hi>Minister,</hi> he will not preach to please but to profit: nor will he
dare to serve at the Altar without being holy.</p>
            <p>§ 8. He is faithfull to his friend, for his love extends to his soul: he
will speak of his faults to his face, of his vertues behind his back. The
deep and devillish plots of wicked Politicians never enter into his
thoughts, because the fear of God keeps them out. Or if they offer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
themselves, they have not the least admittance: for he (so far forth as
he can) refrains all dispute with sinne, Satan or his instruments.</p>
            <p>§ 9. He is no Neuter when Gods cause is in question, but he will help
the Lord against the mighty. He imployes himself in some lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
he lives not idely. He will not company with wicked persons, for
fear of being infected by them: nor joyn in Marriage either with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or prophane persons, least he should learn their customs. Nor give his
children in marriage to them for the same reason. He is carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his childrens chastity: and therefore he will in due time provide
fit matches for them. Be he Parent, Master or Magistrate, he will think
it no disparagement to his greatnesse, if Christs Ambassadour shall as he
is bound, require him to give some testimony that he is a <hi>Christian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he intrudes himself to the Lords Table. Yea, he will as Christ hath
commanded him, be ready to give a reason of the hope that is in him,
though in the presence of others that are not so rich, ancient or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as himself, though he was never in so many years examined: and in
deed none but proud and ignorant persons, will stand upon comparisons
in Gods worship; for pretend they what they will, the genuine reason
is, they are ashamed to make known their ignorance.</p>

be he never so wicked, well knowing, that God may change his heart in
a moment: neither will he conclude one to be a wicked, man, or an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
for appearances, or moates, or some sudden eruptions or common
infirmities, or for sinnes before conversion, or for this or that single act
of grosse impiety, when the main tenor and course of his life besides is
a continuall current of honesty and goodnesse; though he may suspend
his good opinion in case of some unexpected misdemeanour, or for lesser
evils, either affected or often repeated. He is tender-hearted, and can
bear with the infirmities of the weak, and is ready to cherish them that
are cast down. He does not expect a full grow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§ 2. He will neither backbite others, nor give ear to backbiters of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Neither lend Satan his tongue to utter, nor his ears to hear, nor
his heart to beleeve lyes and slanders. He will not les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by traducing one that wrong him: he will not lessen his own shame and
blame, by traducing one he hath wronged; as too many do. He wonders
not so much at anothers ingratitude to him, as at his own unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to God. He will pardon many things in others, which he will not
tolerate in himself. He will neither arrogate to himself, nor derogate
from another: neither vilifie other mens doings, nor over highly
prize his own. He will not condemn, censure or slight that which

               </gap>e understands not. To finde gall in a Pidgion, a knot in a Bulrush,
where is none, is none of his humour. In relating an enemies words,
he will neither adde to them, nor diminish from them. The faults of a
few, shall not make him uncharitable to all; nor the goodnesse of many,
make him credulous of the rest. He envies none for doing, or faring, or
being better esteemed then himself.</p>

            <p>§ 1. HE is more knowing then the men of the world; for as he hath
the light of the Spirit, and the eye of faith above them, so the
Word of Christ dwelleth in him plentifully in all wisedom and spirituall
understanding: and he increaseth daily in the knowledge of God, and of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; because God reveals himself to him
in a great measure as to his friend. Besides, his knowledge is about the
best things; and one drop of soul wisedom and saving knowledge, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66022:11"/>
by the fear of God, is more worth then all humane learning. And to
this knowledge, unbeleevers are meer strangers. Yea be they never so wise
and learned in other things, they have only the theory of this wisedom;
they can prattle of it by roat, but they know not what it is by effect and
experience. Yea if a man want faith, holinesse, the love of God, and the
Spirit of God to be his teacher; he shall not be able really, and by his
own experience, to know the chief points of Christian Religion; such as
are <hi>faith, repentance, regeneration,</hi> the <hi>love o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints</hi> means; when every one of these are easie and familiar
to the meanest and simplest Beleever. And the reason is, the Beleever
digests his knowledge into practise, and imployes it to the glory of the
giver, his neighbours good, and the furthering of his own salvation. He is
neither ungrounded in the Principles of Religion, nor unconscionable in
the practice. Each Book or Sermon, both increaseth his knowledge and
lessens his vices. Yea he will pick something out of every thing, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
honey from the self same thing that others will poyson. Anothers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the truth shall make him love it the more; for he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> instructed both
by similitude and contrariety. Whereas let the unbeleever know never so
much, he is resolved to be never the better: and they who are unwilling
to obey, God thinks unworthy to know. Whence it is also, that as what
the Beleever doth is good for the matter, so he will do it well also for the
manner: and in all his actions observe, whether his ends be good or evil;
for he will do good actions with good intentions; and not be moved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them by ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e end, as is the unbeleever. Nor is he puffed up either with
his knowledge or parts; well knowing that he is ignorant of many
things, for a few that he understands; and that he falls short of others
in what he most excells. Nor will he build upon his knowledge, but in
cases doubtfull he will advise with others: Yea he will submit to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
advice, even of his inferiour or maid-servant.</p>
            <p>§ 2. He is not erronious in his judgement, he neither affects curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
nor singularity; which is the foolish ambition of unblest understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
But he wholly applies himself to those things which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in his Word; and to the confirmation of received truths; which
is the meeknesse and humility of the best judgements; and so is wise
according to sobriety. Nor does he so cry up Justification, as to cry
down and quite overthrow Sanctification. He reades and hears with

               </gap>es all good
and happy like himself; and accordingly proves a means of
bringing many to Heaven, and that two wayes: First, whereas others by
their evil example, are a means to destroy many; he by his good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is a means to save many. For he is upright and sincere hearted to
God and man. He is none of those that professe God with their words,
and with their works deny him. He is not double-tongued; but as he
thinks in his heart, so he speaks with his mouth; and as he is led by his
conscience, so his conscience is led by truth. In fine, he is known from
another man, only by the holinesse and uprightnesse of his life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
Yea all may read in his life, that he beleeves in his heart: and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66022:12"/>
are forced to say, This is a good God, whose servant is so good: or, This
is a good, holy and operative Religion; that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s changes and transforms
men into new Creatures. For his life is like a precious and sweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume;
whose savour spreads it self, and is pleasant to all that come near.
Yea, he sowes those good works that remain to posterity, and are reaped
by succession; and he shall be happy in making others so. But secondly,
as the wicked draw all they can to Hell by their allurements and subtill
perswasions; so he drawes all he can to Heaven, by his admonitions and
sweet compellations. He loves the soul of his Neighbour, and therefore
he will tell him of his faults, and the Judgements of God due unto the
same. Yea rather then let one go headlong to destruction, he will violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pluck him out of the fire; for he hath not only zeal, but courage to do
good t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he is not lukewarm, nor will he suffer discretion to eat up his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
as it fares with common professors. For he had rather hazzard
the censure of some, then hinde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the good of others. Yea rather then be
guilty of other mens sins by his cowardly silence, he can afford to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
and thought out of his wits by the world; reputed a fool, and
pointed at in the streets. For he prefers Gods favour before all the worlds;
and his glory before his own credit. Not that he wants wit, or deserves
contempt; for his zeal is mixed with discretion, and he makes knowledge
the pilot of his devotion: but his love to God is such, as he cannot bear
with them that are evil. His righteous soul is vexed with seeing, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the uncleanly conversation of their unlawfull deeds. Yea it cuts his
very heart to hear Christ so wounded with oathes, blasphemies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
who is the life of his life, and soul of his soul. And his love to
sinners also, for his zeal against them, is a sweet compound of love and
anger: for though he hates the vices of a wicked man, yet he loves his
person: he can chide him sharply, and yet at the same time pray for him
heartily. Whereby he not seldom save<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his brother, for he findes favour
in the sight of God, and prevails with him for things hard to be obtained.

            <p>§ 2. He hath low and mean thoughts of himself; therefore the Lord
makes him excell, and shews his strength by him. He abhors to think
himself better then others, because God blesseth him more with outward
blessings, or hath bestowed more inward gifts and graces upon him then
upon others: well knowing that God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace
to the humble. He is not lifted up, nor cast down with mens flatteries or
slanders. He forgets his good deeds, and therefore God remembers them:
he remembers his evil deeds, therefore God forgets them. He is not envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
nor given to stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; but of a meek and quiet spirit; peaceable, gentle
and easie to be intreated. He affects rather plainnesse then pomp: and
will rather refuse places of honour, then eagerly pursue after them. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stands so secure, but he will take heed least he fall: and prefers an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fear, before a presumptuous confidence. He makes conscience of small
sins, least they should prove wedges to greater. When he is tempted to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66022:12"/>
evil, the fear of God keeps him innocent. And it is alwai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>§ 1. SO you have (in part) seen; how he loves, and fears, and serves the
Lord, and seeks his gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry and the good of others: but (which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
observable) shall I shew you how the Lord bles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth him in every thing
he takes in hand, or that does befall him? I pray observe the severals, and
then if you be not yet a Beleever, you will neglect no means, indeavouror
opportunity to obtain such a blessed condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the particulars are many,
ile mention a few only. First if he be in prosperity, as he shall be sure to
have plenty of all outward things, if God sees that it would be good for
him; so that he shall lend to others, but shall not borrow himself. He
will be accordingly thankfull, and as God blesseth him more or lesse, so
will he do good; and the more rich, the more rich will he be in good
works, and the more ready to distribute and communicate. For he is
pitifull, and ready to shew mercy where is need; and to defend, rescue and
deliver the oppressed, out of the hands of their enemies and oppressors, if
he have power and opportunity to do it. And by reason of his bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the poor, he becometh more rich, so that he is not more ready to
pray for blessings in his want, then he is to give thanks for them being
obtained. And be he never so rich, he is not high minded; neither does
he trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God. For in his prosperity
he forgetteth not his former low estate; but is ever medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ating upon, and
admiring the Lords goodnesse towards him. Yea he sets a <hi>Memo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>andum</hi>
upon every remarkable mercy, that he may not forget it: and admires
that God should set his delight and love upon him, and choose him above
many others: and this makes him strive to surpasse others in his love and
service to God again. Whereas unbeleevers, when they are waxed fat with
the good blessings of God, they will spurn with the heel, and forsake
God that made them: not once regarding the strong God of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but provoke him with strange Gods and other abominations:
but it fares not so with the Beleever, neither doth he so requite the Lord.
And as he is thankfull to the Author, so likewise to any that he shall
make instrumentall for his good: thinking himself bound to remember
and requite good turns.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Secondly, if he falls into adversity or any kind of distresse; he
knowes it is sent of the Lord in love, and to do him good, and to give
him occasion of rejoycing afterwards. He w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l considers, that scarce any
thing more proves us his, then his stripes: that stripes from the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are so farre from arguing his displeasure, that contrarily there are few
better tokens and pledges of his adoption and love: and that they are
bastards and not sonnes who are without correction. And so it is, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66022:13"/>
as many as God loves, he rebukes and chastens. And as it is sent for his
good, so it doth him good: crosses in his estate, diseases in his body, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies
in his minde, are medicines to his soul: the impairing of the one,
is the repairing of the other. His sinne dies with his fame, or with his
health, or with his peace, or with his outward estate. Yea it both lessons
his sins, and increaseth his graces: for God sends him afflictions both
for his instruction and reformation, to scout away the rust of corruption,
and to try the truth of his sanctification; for the increase of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the exercise of his faith, and the improvement of his zeal, and
to provoke his importunity, and to double his obligation; to greaten each
other grace, and to augment his glory. Again, he inflicts a lesse punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to avoid a greater: and by smarting in his body, state or name, he
is saved from smarting in his soul. He is chastened that he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
not confounded: his worser part, to wit his body, state or name is
impoverisht; that his better part, that is, his soul may be saved in the day
of Judgement. But see it in some particulars, as first how it makes him
humble and thankfull: for he not only calls to minde his own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
of the least mercy he still injoyes; and how he hath provoked the
giver; (for he is ever meditating of what Christ hath done and suffered
for him, and how he hath provoked Christ:) but he also compares what
he suffers, with what he might have suffered; arguing thus with himself,
He that hath taken this from me, might have taken more: he that afflicts
me for a time, could have held me longer: he that hath touched me in part,
could have stricken me in whole: he that laid this upon my body, hath
power to lay a greater rod both upon my body and soul, without doing me
the least wrong. And so goes on, I was born a childe of wrath, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God might have left me in that perishing condition and chosen others,
he hath of his free grace adopted me and left others. And this makes him
cry out, O the depth! as a mercy beyond all expression: saying further, O
my soul, thou hast nor room enough for thankfulnesse! And the truth is,
if we could but seriously think upon our deliverance from hell fire, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
would be thought cause enough to make us both patient and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
though the things we now delight in be taken from us. And sure I
am, nothing can be too much to endure for those pleasures in Heaven
which shall endure for ever. O that we could keep fast in our memories
but these two things! and upon all occasions make use of them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
withall, that the least mercy is beyond our best merit. And no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
remedy for impatience, then to cast up our receits, and compare them
with our deservings. But secondly, Gods corrections are his instructions;
his lash<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s lessons, his scourges schoolmasters, his chastisements advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to him; by feeling of smart he learns to decline the cause. Yea,
this hath taught him to fly from the works of darknesse at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
and to consider as well the bitternesse of what will follow, as the
sweetnesse of a momentary pleasure; and so cleared his sight, that he can
now discern sinne in all he thinks, and speaks, and does; for he is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
his wants and weaknesses; the hardnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of his heart, want of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66022:13"/>
faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, it abundantly increaseth his joy and comfort: for
admit Satan and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> world should deprive him of all outward comforts
at once; yet God at the same time will supply the want of these, with
comforts farre surpassing and transcending them: as first, the assurance
of the pardon of sinne alone, is able to clear all storm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the minde: it
teacheth misery, as sicknesse, poverty, famine, imprisonment, infamy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
even to laugh; for then let death happen, it matters not: when a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
hath sued out his pardon, let the Assizes come when they will, the
sooner the better. But to this is added the peace of conscience, the marrow
of all comforts, otherwise called the peace of God, which passeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and surpasseth all commending; for never did man finde
pleasure upon earth, like the sweet testimony of an appeased conscience
reconciled unto God, cleansed by the bloud of the Lambe, and quieted by
the presence of the holy Ghost. As the Martyrs felt, who even clapt their
hands for joy in the midst of the flames; and were even ravisht before
they were permitted to dye: so great, and so surpassing all expressing is
the peace and comfort of a good conscience. Again thirdly, Affliction
bringeth with it the company of God himself; <hi>I will be with you in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
saith God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 15. As when those three were cast into the
fiery furnace, <hi>Dan. 3.</hi> there was presently a fourth came to bear them
company, and that was God himself, <hi>ver.</hi> 23, to 27. and his presence makes
any condition comfortable, were a man even in hell it self. See more
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 52. And as his sufferings abound, so his consolation also aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>2 Cor.</hi> 1. 5. Indeed the unbeleever laughs more, but that laughter is
only the hypocrisie of mirth: they rejoyce in the face only and not in
the heart: nor can it be solid comfort, except it hath his issue from a
good conscience; whereas Gods Word teacheth, and a good conscience
findeth, that even the tears of those that pray, are sweeter then the joyes of
the Theater. But this is not all, for according to the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ibulations laid upon
him and borne by him, shall the retribution of glory be proportioned. I
might go on, and shew how it makes him pittifull and compassionate to
others: evils have taught him to bemone all that affliction makes to
groan; and sundry the like which I may not here stand upon. And
this is enough to shew, that affliction in generall makes much for his
advantage: now see how he is a great gainer by each particular crosse:

            <p>§ 4. Fourthly, Let there be never so many plots laid to destroy him,
he is in perpetuall safety: for the Lord not only gives his Angels a charge
over him, to keep him in all his wayes; but himself is ever at hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him and keep him as the apple of his eye, so that all his enemies are
not able to do him hurt; for God is his help, and strength, and deliverer;
yea, God by his providence disposeth of things so, that what in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and what they contrived to be the means of his hurt, turns to his
great good; and what they intended for his destruction, becomes the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
means of his preservation. Again, the Lord is more specially present
with him, when he is in the greatest danger; that he may fight for him
against his enemies, and give him victory over them; that he may su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
him when he faints, and crown him when he overcomes; that he
may be exact in taking notice of his sufferings, count his wanderings, put
his tears into his bottle, and enter all into his Register. Nor is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66022:14"/>
more patient to put up wrongs, then God is ready to revenge them
and right him: and the reason is, Christ takes what is done to him, or
any one of his members, as done to himself. And indeed he that despiseth,
traduceth, or any way wrongs him for his goodnes; his envy strikes at the
Image of God in him; by whose Spirit he both speaks and acts. And to
murmur against any of Gods Mes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>engers (as thou art apt enough to do,)
is to murmur against God himself that sent them: take notice of this
you that carry an aking tooth against every godly man you know. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall Sorcery or Witchcraft have the least power to do him hurt. In
a word, there cannot so much as an hair fall from his head, without the
speciall appointment of his heavenly Father, who will suffer nothing to
befall him, but what shall make for his servants benefit and his own glory:
for admit God gives his enemy leave and power to kill him, he shall not
hurt but pleasure him, as I shall shew when I come unto it.</p>

pain makes him not forget the health of his whole body; one dayes or
weeks sicknesse, makes him not forget many years health. He is not so
sensible of a present distresse, nor so ingratefull for favours past, as not to
remember many years injoyments, more then one weeks misery. Yea, he
considers that it is in great love that God thus visits him: that he dealeth
mercifully with him, least he should fall from him and despair; that he
beateth him, least he should grow proud and forget him, and so peris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he findes by experience, that as every other affliction rubs off some

sicknesse cuts the very throat of all his vices; be it pride, lust, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or the like; for the very worst Fever can come, does not more
burn up his bloud then his lust; and together with sweating out the
surfits of nature, at the pores of the body, he weeps out the sinfull corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his nature, at the pores of his conscience. And indeed God scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
his flesh, to this end only, that his spirit may be saved in the day of
Jesus Christ. And the like of old age; his soul waxeth, as his body
waineth, and he is wisest to prescribe, when his bones and sinewes are

God hides his face, and seems to have utterly forsaken him, and to

thereof hath drunk up his spirit, so that in his own apprehension God is
become his mortall enemy, as it fared with <hi>Iob,</hi> yet all this is for his good,
and shall do him good: yea this extream severity of God argues favour;
for nothing more usuall then for God to work joy out of fear, light out
of darknesse, and to bring to the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> by the gates of hell,
and thus he deals with his dearest darlings. When he meant to blesse <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
he wrestles with him as an adyersary, even till he lamed him: when

was dead, buried, and stunk again: no question to teach us, that we must
be cast down by the Law, before we can be raised up by the Gospell; and
become fools before we can be truly wise. Nor hath he cause to fear, be
his case never so desperate; for God will measure his patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make
it proportionable to his suffering, and equall his strength to his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:

grievous his exigent, the more glorious his advancement. But the last

Or if they do, they shall be so sanctified, that they shall rather pleasure

be carried into Gods barn as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was, the other cast into the fire like

which others can scarce do being compelled. Yea, the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects
him against his enemies, who fear the Jayl more then they fear
Hell; and stand more upon their silver, or their sides smarting, then upon

their souls. Good <hi>Magistrates</hi> also are the breath of his nostrils and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect

            <p>§ 1. NInthly, His very sins and infirmities by Gods grace do work his
good, and he is by much the better for them, for he will from
hence grow more holy. Yea, he gains strength by every fall: for hence
issues deeper humiliation, stronger hatred of sinne, fresh indignation
against himself, more experience of his hearts deceitfulnesse, renewed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
untill sinne be brought under: it makes him more earnest with
God by prayer, to keep a more careful watch over himself; to pity others
more, and censure them lesse when they offend or are overtaken: to rest
wholly upon the assistance of Gods Spirit, and to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cribe all glory to him,
of whom whatsoever he hath he holds. True, his offending God brings
much misery upon him, and God seems to have left him, and to reject his
prayers and humiliation: but at length, and so soon as the poor soul cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to do ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, and learns to do well, the Lord repenteth him of the evil;
and not only delivers him, but returns with the greater interest of joy and
felicity. Indeed the Lord lets him know what it is to lose his favour, and
makes him tugg hard by prayer, and to persevere a long time in kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and asking: but at length he will be sure to give him what he desires,
or that which is better for him; for the prayer of faith, from the knees
of humility and a broken heart, will conquer even the Conqueror. Indeed,
the case may be such that he cannot pray, or not to purpose; as in time of
sicknesse, by reason of the extremity of pain: but then he can send to the
<hi>Congregations,</hi> &amp; intreat them to pray for him. Besides, all his former pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and meditations, do serve to ayd him in his last straits, and meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the center of his extremity; yeelding though not sensible relies, yet
secret benefit to his soul. Yea (which is best of all) he hath the benefit of
<hi>Christs</hi> intercession in Heaven, and of the prayers of all the <hi>Saints</hi> on <hi>earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. Tenthly, The malice of Satan shall make much for his good: for
if Satan be sent to buffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> or to winnow him as he
would have done <hi>Peter,</hi> it is that he may not be exalted: his malice shall
prove the occasion of much good to him, as it did to the <hi>incestuous Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian:</hi>
or if God lets him loose upon him as it did upon <hi>Iob,</hi> it shall but
advance the glory of God, manifest this Beleevers patience, occasion his
own shame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so the Devil shall be over-shot in his own bow, and
wounded with his own weapon. And so it is, that to all whom God hath
any interest in, this <hi>Scorpion</hi> shall prove a medicine against the sting of
the <hi>Scorpion.</hi> For though he aym at despair and destruction, yet God ayms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
at humiliation and conversion, yea at consolation and salvation: and when
the sinner is sufficiently humbled, Satan shall be cashiered; that <hi>Horse-leach</hi>
shall be taken off, when he hath sufficiently abated the vicious and
superfluous bloud; so that he shall be healed by wounding, exalted by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:
Satan shall help him to the destruction of his flesh (his corruption,)
and the edification of his soul.</p>

§ 3. Eleventhly, Death, the last and strongest enemy of all, shall do
him the greatest good of all. He may be killed, but he cannot be hurt nor
conquered: for even Death, that Fiend, is to him a friend: like the <hi>Red Sea</hi>
to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that put them over to the <hi>Land of Promise,</hi> whiles it drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their enemies. It is his bridge from woe to glory, for dying he sleeps,
and sleeping he rests from all the travels of a toylsome life, to live in joy
and blisse for evermore. It is to him the end of all sorrowes, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

the whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> he lives in. Whereas many, yea multitudes, even an

fare the worse for a wicked man and an unbeleever. Besides, his
prayers shall profit many; for he is more prevalent with God, to take away
a judgement from a People or a Nation, then a thousand others. And he
counts it a sinne to cease praying for his greatest and most malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;

            <p>§ 5. The pain of the body, is but the body of pain, the anguish of the
soul, is the soul of anguish: For should we first burn off one hand, then
another, after that each arm, and so all the parts of the body, it would be
deemed intollerable, and no man would endure it for all the profits and
pleasures this world can afford; and yet it is nothing to that burning of
body and soul in hell: Should we endure ten thousand years torment in
hell, it were grievous; but nothing to eternity: Should we suffer one
pain, it were miserable enough; but if ever we come there, our pains shall
be for number and kindes, infinitely various, as our pleasures have been
here; every sense and member, each power and faculty both of soul and
body, shall have their severall objects of wretchednesse, and that without
<hi>intermission,</hi> or <hi>end,</hi> or <hi>ease,</hi> or <hi>patience</hi> to endure it, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 5. &amp; 16. 23.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 12. &amp; 5. 22. &amp; 23. 33. Yea the pains and sufferings of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
are ten thousand times more then can be imagined by any heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heaven, and can rather (through necessity) be endured, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
It is a <hi>death</hi> never to be painted to the <hi>life 5</hi> no <hi>pen</hi> nor <hi>pencill,</hi> nor

            <p>§ 7. Now add <hi>eternity</hi> to <hi>extremity,</hi> and then consider <hi>hell</hi> to be <hi>hell</hi>
indeed. For if the <hi>Ague</hi> of a year, or the <hi>Colick</hi> of a moneth, or the
<hi>Rack</hi> of a day, or the <hi>burning</hi> of an hour be so bitter here; how will it
break the hearts of the wicked, to feel all these beyond all <hi>measure,</hi> beyond
all <hi>time;</hi> yet is all this truth, save that it comes farre short of the truth;
this is much, it is not near all. For as one said, Nothing but the <hi>eloquence</hi>

            <p>§. 1. BUt for the better confirming of this so important a truth; in
these Atheistical times: See some reasons to confirm it: As
First, if the <hi>Sun</hi> which is but <hi>a creature,</hi> be so bright and glorious;
that no mortal Eye can look upon the brightnesse of it! how glorious
then is <hi>the Creator</hi> himself? or that light from whence it receives its light,
If the <hi>frame of the Heavens,</hi> and <hi>Globe of the Earth</hi> be so glorious; which
is but the <hi>Lower House,</hi> or rather <hi>the Footstool of the Almighty,</hi> as the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> phraseth it, <hi>Isa. 66. 1. Matth. 5. 35. Act. 7. 49.</hi> how glorious and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
is the Maker thereof, and the <hi>City</hi> where he keeps his <hi>Court?</hi> Or
if Sinners, even the worst of wicked men, and <hi>Gods</hi> enemies; have here
in this earthly pilgrimage, such variety of injoyments to please their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
senses; as who can expresse the pleasurable variety of <hi>objects</hi> for the
<hi>sight,</hi> of <hi>meats,</hi> and <hi>drinks</hi> to satisfie and delight the <hi>taste;</hi> of <hi>Voyces,</hi> and
melodious <hi>sounds</hi> to recreate the <hi>hearing;</hi> of <hi>sents,</hi> and <hi>perfumes</hi> provided
to accommodate our very <hi>smelling;</hi> of <hi>recreations</hi> and <hi>sports</hi> to <hi>bewitch</hi> the
whole <hi>man:</hi> And the like of <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>profit,</hi> which are <hi>Idols,</hi> that
carnal men do mightily <hi>dote upon,</hi> and take pleasure in: (though these
earthly, and bodily joyes are but the body, or rather the dregs of true
joy,) what think we must be the soul thereof? <hi>viz.</hi> those delights and
pleasures, that are reserved for the <hi>Glorified Saints,</hi> and <hi>Gods</hi> dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> Again</p>
            <p>§. 2. Secondly, If natural men find such pleasure and sweetnesse;
in <hi>secular wisdom, lip-learning,</hi> and <hi>brain knowledge;</hi> For even <hi>mundane</hi>
knowledge hath such a shew of excellency in it; that it is highly <hi>affected</hi>
both <hi>by the good and bad;</hi> As O <hi>the pleasure!</hi> that rational men take
therein; It being so <hi>fair a Virgin,</hi> that every <hi>clear eye</hi> is in love with her,
so <hi>rich a pearl</hi> that none but <hi>Swine</hi> do <hi>despise it;</hi> yea among all the <hi>Trees</hi>
in the <hi>Garden,</hi> none so takes with rational men as the <hi>Tree of knowledge:</hi>
(as <hi>Satan</hi> well knew, when he set upon our <hi>First Parents</hi>) insomuch that
<hi>Plato</hi> thinks, in case <hi>wisdom</hi> could but represent it self unto the <hi>Eyes;</hi>
it would set the <hi>heart</hi> on <hi>fire</hi> with the love of it: And others affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, that
there is no lesse difference between the <hi>Learned,</hi> and the <hi>Ignorant;</hi> then
there is between the living and the dead; or between <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Beasts:</hi>
And yet the pleasure which natural, and moral men take in secular, and
mundane knowledge and learning; is nothing comparable, to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that an <hi>experimental Christian</hi> finds in the Divine, and <hi>supernaturall
knowledge</hi> of <hi>Gods Word:</hi> which makes <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> prefer it <hi>before
the honey, and the honey comb</hi> for sweetnesse; and to value it <hi>above thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of gold and silver;</hi> yea before <hi>pearles and all precious stones</hi> for worth:
How sweet then s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all our knowledge in <hi>Heaven</hi> be? for <hi>here we see but

yea if the very worst of men, <hi>Drunkards, Blasphemers</hi> and the like; though
they most spitefully scoffe at, and backbite the people of <hi>God;</hi> yet when
they know a man <hi>sincere, upright,</hi> and <hi>honest;</hi> cannot choose but <hi>love,
commend</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> him in their <hi>hearts;</hi> as it fared with <hi>Herod</hi> touching

            <p>§. 4. Or rather if <hi>Gods</hi> own people, are so ravished with the <hi>graces,
and priviledges</hi> which they in joy upon earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the <hi>assurance of the pardon

but <hi>glorification begun:</hi> what will they be, when they shall injoy the <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of glory</hi> in <hi>Heaven?</hi> As see but some instances, of their present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
here below: First, if we were never to receive any reward,
for those small labours of love, and duties we do to the glory of <hi>God,</hi> and
profit of others; we might think our selves sufficiently recompensed in
this life; with the calm, and quietnesse of a good conscience; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
of a vertuous and holy life: That we can do and suffer something
for the love of <hi>Christ,</hi> who hath done and suffered so much to save us:
That by our w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rks the majesty of <hi>God</hi> is magnified; to whom all homage
is due, and all service too little: For <hi>godlinesse</hi> in every <hi>sicknesse</hi> is a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,</hi>
in every <hi>contention</hi> an <hi>Advocate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in every <hi>doubt a School man,</hi> in all
<hi>heavinesse</hi> a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and a <hi>comforter</hi> unto whatsoever estate it comes;
making the whole life as it were a perpetual <hi>Halelujah.</hi> Yea <hi>God so sheds
his love abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,</hi> that we are in <hi>Heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we come thither. Insomuch, that as the <hi>fire</hi> flyeth to his <hi>Sphear,</hi> the
<hi>stone</hi> hastens to the <hi>Center,</hi> the <hi>River</hi> to the <hi>Sea,</hi> as to their end and rest;
and are violently detained in all other places: so are the hearts of <hi>Gods</hi>
people, without their <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> their last end and eternal rest
and quietnesse, never at rest: like the <hi>needle touched with the loadstone,</hi>
which ever <hi>stands</hi> quivering and trembling, untill it enjoyes the full and
direct <hi>aspect of the Northern pole.</hi> But more particularly,</p>
            <p>§. 5. How does the assurance of <hi>the pardon of sinne</hi> alone, clear and
calm all storms of the mind? making any condition comfortable, and the
worst and greatest misery to be no misery.</p>
            <p>To be <hi>delivered</hi> of a <hi>Child,</hi> is no small <hi>joy</hi> to the <hi>mother:</hi> but to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from sin,</hi> is a far greater <hi>joy</hi> to the <hi>soul.</hi> But to this we may adde
the <hi>joy of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and the <hi>peace of conscience;</hi> otherwise called <hi>the
peace of God which passeth all understanding.</hi> These are priviledges, that
make <hi>Paul</hi> happier in his <hi>chain of Iron,</hi> then <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his <hi>chain of gold:</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> more merry under <hi>stripes,</hi> then <hi>Caiapha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> upon the <hi>Iudgement
seat.</hi> And <hi>Stephen</hi> the like under that <hi>shower of stones.</hi> Pleasures are
ours, if we be <hi>Christs:</hi> Whence those expression<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>Holy Ghost, The

all that put their trust in thee rejoyce, let them even shout for joy. Rejoyce ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
and again I say rejoyce rejoyce, with joy unspeakable, and full of glory.
Our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our conscience. Your hearts shall rejoyce, and
your Ioy shall no man take from you</hi> &amp;c. So that it is a shame for the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
not to be <hi>joyful:</hi> and they sin, if they rejoyce not, whatever their
condition be. The <hi>Eunuch</hi> no sooner felt the pardon of sin, upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>§. 7. True it is, none can <hi>know</hi> the spiritual <hi>joy,</hi> and comfort <hi>of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
but he that <hi>lives the life of a Christian,</hi> Joh. 7. 17. as <hi>none could learn
the Virgins song, but they that sang it,</hi> Rev. 14. 3. No man can <hi>know the
peace of a good conscience,</hi> but he that <hi>keeps a good conscience:</hi> no man
knowes the <hi>hid manna,</hi> and <hi>white stone, with a new name written in it; but
they that receive the same,</hi> Rev. 2. 17.</p>
            <p>The world can see a <hi>Christians</hi> outside; but the raptures of his soul, the
ravishing delights of the inward man, and joy of his spirit for the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his sins, and the infusion of grace, with such like spiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
more glorious then the <hi>States of Kingdomes;</hi> are as a covered
messe to men of the world.</p>
            <p>But I may appeal to any mans conscience, that hath been softned with
the unction of grace, and truly tasted <hi>the powers of the world to come:</hi> To
him that hath <hi>the love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost;</hi> in
whose soul the light of grace shines: whether his whole life be not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
halelujah; in comparison of his natural condition. Whether he
finds not his joy to be <hi>like the joy of Harvest?</hi> or as <hi>men rejoyee when they
divide a spoyl,</hi> Isa. 9. 3. Whether he finds not more joy in goodnesse, then
worldlings can do, <hi>when their wheat, wine, and oyl aboundeth,</hi> Psal. 4. 7.
&amp; 53. 17. Yea he can speak it out of experience, that as in prophane
joy, even in laughter the heart is sorrowful: so in godly sorrow, even in
weeping the heart is light and cheerful. The face may be pale, yet the
heart may be calm and quiet. So S. <hi>Paul, as sorrowing, and yet alwaies
rejoycing,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 10. Our cheeks may run down with tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our mouthes sing forth praises. And so on the contrary,</p>

            <p>Well may a carelesse worlding laugh more; as what will sooner make

merry within. <hi>Light is sown to the righteous, and joy for the upright,</hi>
Psal. 97. 11. <hi>My servants saith God shall sing, and rejoyce: but they shall
weep, &amp;c.</hi> Isa. 65. 14.</p>
            <p>§. 8. Indeed we are not <hi>merry enough,</hi> because we are not <hi>Christians
enough:</hi> because sin is a cooler of our joy, as <hi>water</hi> is of <hi>fire.</hi> And like
<hi>the worm of Ionah his Gourd;</hi> bites the very root of our joy; and makes
it wither. Yea sin like <hi>a damp,</hi> puts out all the <hi>lights</hi> of our pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and deprives us of <hi>the light of Gods countenance,</hi> as it did <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 51.

            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:66022:20"/>
So that the fault is either, First, in the too much sensuality of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
that will not forge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the pleasures of sin, or the more muddy joyes
and <hi>pleasures of this world;</hi> which are <hi>poysons to the soul,</hi> and drown our
joyes: as <hi>Bees</hi> are <hi>drowned</hi> in <hi>hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y,</hi> but <hi>live</hi> in <hi>vineger.</hi> Men would
have spiritual joy, but withal they would not part with their carnal joy:
Yet this is an infallible Conclusion, there is no enjoying a <hi>wordly Paradise
here,</hi> and another <hi>hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 9. Or secondly, the fault is in the <hi>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te,</hi> not in the <hi>meat;</hi> in the
folly of the <hi>judgment,</hi> not in the <hi>pearl:</hi> when a grain of corn is preferred
before it. To taste spiritual joyes, a man must be spiritual: for <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
relisheth onely the things of the Spirit;</hi> and like loveth his like. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a spiritual man, and spiritual joyes; there is as mighty an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
and enjoying; as between <hi>fleshly meat,</hi> and a <hi>carnal stomack.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the want of this taste and apprehension, condemneth the <hi>world</hi> to be
carnal; but magnifies the joyes spiritual, as being above her carnal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.
Or</p>
            <p>§. 10. Thirdly, herein lyes the fault; few feel these joyes in this
life; because they will not <hi>crack the shell,</hi> to <hi>get the kernel:</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<hi>pare the fruit,</hi> to <hi>eat the pulpe;</hi> not <hi>till the ground,</hi> to <hi>reap the harvest.</hi>
They flye the <hi>Wars,</hi> and thereby lose the glory of the <hi>victory.</hi> They
will not <hi>dig</hi> the craggy <hi>Mountain,</hi> to find the <hi>mine of gold.</hi> Not <hi>prune the
vine,</hi> therefore <hi>enjoy</hi> not <hi>the fruit.</hi> They flye <hi>moritification,</hi> and therefore
attain not the sweet <hi>spiritual consolation;</hi> which ever attends the same.
And so much for the Reasons, The Use may be four fold.</p>
            <p>§. 11. First, are the <hi>joyes of Heaven</hi> so unspeakable and glorious?
how then should we admire the love, and bounty of <hi>God;</hi> and blesse his
name, who for the performance of so small a <hi>work;</hi> hath proposed so great
a <hi>reward?</hi> And for the obtaining of such an happy <hi>state,</hi> hath imposed
such an easie <hi>task.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 12. Secondly, who would not serve a short <hi>apprentiship,</hi> in <hi>Gods
service here?</hi> to be made <hi>for ever free in glory.</hi> Yea, who would not be a
<hi>Philpot</hi> for <hi>a moneth,</hi> or a <hi>Lazarus</hi> for <hi>a day,</hi> or a <hi>Stephen</hi> for <hi>an hour;</hi> that
he might be in <hi>Abrahams bosome for ever?</hi> Yea what pain can we think
too much to <hi>suffer?</hi> what little enough to <hi>do?</hi> to <hi>obtain eternity</hi> for this
<hi>incorruptible Crown of glory in Heaven,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 4. where <hi>we shall have all
teares wiped from our eyes.</hi> Where we shall cease to sorrow, cease to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
cease to sin. Where <hi>God</hi> shall turn all the <hi>water</hi> of our afflictions;
into the pure <hi>wine</hi> of endlesse, and unexpressible comfort. Yea had
<hi>Queen Eliz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>r it: she would

               </gap>an be too much to endure, for those pleasures which
shall endure for ever.</p>
            <p>§. 13. You shall sometimes see an <hi>hired servant,</hi> venture his life for
his new <hi>Master;</hi> that will scarce pay him his <hi>wages</hi> at the years end: and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66022:20"/>
can we suffer too much for our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master;</hi> who gives every one
that serveth him not <hi>fields,</hi> and <hi>vineyards,</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> pretended, 1 Sam. 22.
7, &amp;c. nor <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> is pleased to boast of <hi>Caesar;</hi> but
even <hi>an hundred fold more then we part withall here in this life; and eternal
Mansions in Heaven hereafter,</hi> Joh. 14. 2.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a moment; causeth us
a far most excellent, and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18. where
note the incomparable, and infinite <hi>difference</hi> between the <hi>work,</hi> and the
<hi>wages: light affliction,</hi> receiving <hi>a weight of glory;</hi> and <hi>momentary afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
eternal glory.</hi> Suitable to the reward of the wicked, whose empty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
live and dye in a moment; but their unsufferable punishment, is
interminable and endlesse. Their <hi>pleasure</hi> is <hi>short,</hi> their <hi>pain everlasting;</hi>
our <hi>pain</hi> is <hi>short,</hi> our <hi>joy eternal. Blessed is the man that endureth tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for when he is tryed, he shall receive the Crown of life,</hi> James 1. 12. a
Crown without cares, without rivals, without envy, without end. And
nothing we suffer here, can be compared; either to those <hi>woes</hi> we have
<hi>deserved in Hell;</hi> or those <hi>joyes</hi> we are <hi>reserved to in Heaven.</hi> Think we
then but upon those two places; and the remembrance there of is enough,
to raise up our soules from our selves; and make us even contemn, and
slight what ever our Enemies are able to do: as our <hi>Forefathers</hi> did the
<hi>flames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what though thy sufferings be never so sad?</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The gain with hardnesse, makes it far lesse hard.</l>
               <l>The danger is great, but so is the reward.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The sight of glory future, mitigates the sense of misery present. As
<hi>Iacobs service</hi> seemed the lighter, by having his beloved <hi>Rachel</hi> alwayes
in his eye. The poor <hi>Traveller</hi> thinking on his <hi>Inne,</hi> goes on more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
And the <hi>Bondman,</hi> by calling to mind his <hi>year of Iubilee.</hi> So that
if we droop at present, it is for want of considering the future.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Wherefore</hi> eye not the stream thou wadest through:</l>
               <l>But the firm land thou tendest too.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Compare the <hi>seed time</hi> with the <hi>Harvest:</hi> look up from the <hi>root</hi> to the
<hi>fruit. Lazarus</hi> was for a time extream miserable; what then? his <hi>sores</hi>
and <hi>sorrowes soon ceased,</hi> but his <hi>joyes</hi> shall <hi>never cease:</hi> his <hi>pain</hi> did <hi>soon
passe,</hi> his <hi>joy</hi> shall <hi>never passe away.</hi> Again</p>
            <p>§. 14. Thirdly, How is it possible? he should dote upon these transitory
things below; that but seriously thinks upon what is reserved for us in
<hi>Heaven?</hi> As O the folly and madnesse of those; that prefer <hi>Earth,</hi> yea
<hi>Hell</hi> to <hi>Heaven, time</hi> to <hi>eternity,</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> before the <hi>Soul;</hi> yea the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
estate</hi> before either soul or body. These are <hi>the worlds Fooles;</hi> who
care not what their <hi>end</hi> is; so their <hi>way</hi> may be pleasant. Mere <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
that prefer an <hi>Apple</hi> before their <hi>Inheritance! Besotted sensualists;</hi>
that see not how their present pleasures soon vanish like smoke. That
consider not how <hi>this life</hi> of ours; if it were not <hi>short,</hi> yet it is <hi>miserable;</hi>
and if it were not <hi>miserable,</hi> yet it is <hi>short.</hi> That suffer themselves to be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66022:21"/>
so <hi>bewitcht, with the love of money;</hi> and their <hi>hearts</hi> to be <hi>riveted to the
earth;</hi> to be so inslaved to their <hi>lust,</hi> to make <hi>gold</hi> their <hi>god,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
the stern of their consciences. For else the one would <hi>fly from</hi>
present sinful <hi>pleasures,</hi> with as great zeal; <hi>as</hi> now <hi>they seek after them.</hi>
Neither would the other like <hi>Iudas</hi> sell <hi>Christ</hi> for <hi>thirty pence;</hi> who is not
to be valued with many <hi>millions of worlds:</hi> did they but seriously think
of <hi>those treasures of wisdom and riches,</hi> Col. 2. 3. <hi>that will never fade,</hi> those
comforts that are everlasting. They would not be such fooles, as to <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their estates,</hi> by <hi>making themselves worse:</hi> nor <hi>impoverish their soules,</hi> to
<hi>inrich their bodies.</hi> Much lesse would they <hi>sell both soul and body, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
a great estate:</hi> which when gotten, they have not power to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of. For such is their sottishnesse, they never think that dear, which
stands them in no lesse price then their own soules. For in them is that
fulfilled; <hi>Nihil cuique se vilius:</hi> the vilest, basest, and cheapest thing we
have, we hold our selves.</p>
            <p>§. 15. Yet no wonder; for this is the misery, that notwithstanding
<hi>God</hi> hath set <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> before us; and given us our
<hi>choyce:</hi> Offering <hi>Heaven</hi> to all that will confide in, serve and obey him:
threatned <hi>Hell,</hi> in case we forsake him; to serve <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>Satan:</hi> few men have
faith to believe either. Yea being <hi>fleshly, not having the spirit:</hi> they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nothing, but that they are led to by sense. Otherwise, did men but
really believe either of these: they would not instead of obeying <hi>Christs Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
make the <hi>World</hi> only <hi>their god,</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> or <hi>profit</hi> alone their <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men fear a <hi>Iayl,</hi> more then they fear <hi>Hell:</hi> and stand more upon their
<hi>silver,</hi> or <hi>sides smarting;</hi> then upon their <hi>soules:</hi> and regard more the <hi>blasts
of mens breath;</hi> then the <hi>fire of Gods wrath:</hi> and tremble more at the
thought of a <hi>Sergeant,</hi> or <hi>Baily;</hi> then of <hi>Satan, and everlasting perdition.</hi>
Else they would not be hired, with all the worlds wealth, multiplyed as
many times as there be sands on the <hi>Sea shore;</hi> to hazard in the least, the
losse of those everlasting joyes before spoken of. Or to purchase, and
plunge themselves into those caselesse, and <hi>everlasting flames of fire and
brimstone in Hell:</hi> there to try body and soul, where shall be an inumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
company of <hi>devils,</hi> and <hi>damned spirits</hi> to <hi>affright</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> them;
but not one to <hi>comfort,</hi> or <hi>pity</hi> them.</p>
            <p>§. 16. But O the madnesse of these men! that cannot be hired to
hold their <hi>finger</hi> for <hi>one minute,</hi> in the weak <hi>flame</hi> of a farthing <hi>Candle;</hi> and
yet for trifles, will plunge themselves body and soul, into those endlesse,
and infinitely scorching flames of <hi>Hell fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a <hi>King</hi> but threatens a <hi>Malefactour</hi> to the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> to the <hi>Rack,</hi> to the
<hi>wheel;</hi> his bones tremble, a terrible palsie runs through all his joynts:
but let <hi>God</hi> threaten the unsufferable tortures of <hi>burning Topheth;</hi> we stand
unmoved, undaunted. And what makes the difference? the one we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as present, the other is as they think uncertain, and long before it
comes, if ever it do come. Otherwise it could not be; since the <hi>soul of
all sufferings,</hi> are <hi>the sufferings of the soul:</hi> Since as <hi>painted fire,</hi> is to <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial;</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:66022:21"/>
such is <hi>material,</hi> to <hi>Hell fire.</hi> And yet if <hi>fire</hi> be but <hi>cryed</hi> in the
<hi>streets:</hi> we run and bestir our selves, how to <hi>quench</hi> it; or at least how
to avoid it. O that men would <hi>believe the God of truth! (that cannot
lye)</hi> touching spiritual, and eternal things, but as they do these tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
and transitory. O that thou! who art <hi>the sacred Monarch of this
mighty frame!</hi> wouldest give them hearts to believe at least thus much;
That <hi>things themselves</hi> are in the <hi>invisible World,</hi> in the <hi>World visible</hi> but
<hi>their shadowes</hi> onely. And that whatsoever wicked men injoy here; it is
but as in <hi>a dream;</hi> their plenty is but like <hi>a drop of pleasure,</hi> before <hi>a River
of sorrow</hi> and <hi>displeasure:</hi> And whatsoever the godly feel, but as <hi>a drop
of misery,</hi> before <hi>a River of mercy and glory.</hi> That though thou the great,
and just <hi>Iudge</hi> of all the world; comest slowly to Judgment: yet thou
wilt come surely. As the <hi>Clock</hi> comes slowly, and by <hi>minutes</hi> to the <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet it strikes at last: That those are onely <hi>true riches,</hi> which being once
<hi>had,</hi> can <hi>never be lost.</hi> That <hi>Heaven</hi> is a <hi>Treasure worthy our hearts,</hi> a <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
worth our lives:</hi> That when all is done, <hi>how to be saved,</hi> is <hi>the best
plot.</hi> That there is not mention of one, in the whole <hi>Bible;</hi> that ever
<hi>sinned without repentance;</hi> but he was <hi>punished without mercy.</hi> For then
there would <hi>not be a Fornicator, or Prophane person as Esau; who for a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of meat, sold his inheritance,</hi> Heb. 12. 16. Then they would not be of
the number of those; that so doted upon <hi>purchases,</hi> and <hi>Farmes,</hi> and
<hi>Oxen;</hi> that <hi>they made light of going to the Lords Supper,</hi> Luke 14. 18, 19, 20.
Nor of the <hi>Gadarens</hi> mind; who preferred their <hi>Hogs</hi> before <hi>Christ.</hi> Then
would they know it better to want all things; then that <hi>one needful thing:</hi>
whereas now they desire all other things, and neglect that one thing
which is <hi>so needful.</hi> They would hold it far <hi>better and in good sadnesse,</hi>
to <hi>be saved</hi> with a few, as <hi>Noah</hi> war in the <hi>Ark:</hi> then <hi>in good fellowship</hi>
with the multitude, to be <hi>drowned in sin, and damned for company.</hi> Nor
would they think it any disparagement to their wisdomes; to change their
minds, and be of another judgment to what they are.</p>
            <p>§. 17. Wherefore my Brethren; let me beseech you, not to be such
<hi>Atheists,</hi> and <hi>fooles,</hi> as to <hi>fall into hell</hi> before you will <hi>fear it:</hi> when by
<hi>fearing it,</hi> you may <hi>avoid it;</hi> and by neglecting it, you cannot but fall
into it. What though it be usual with men, to have <hi>no sense of their souls;
till they must leave their bodies:</hi> yet do not you therefore <hi>leap</hi> into <hi>Hell,</hi> to
keep them <hi>company.</hi> But be perswaded to bethink your selves <hi>now:</hi> rather
then when it will be <hi>too late,</hi> when the <hi>Draw-Bridge</hi> will be taken up; and

all, to see that they are Believers? Wouldest thou then
have it fare so with thee? Wouldest thou have thy very poysons turned
into cordials? thy terrours, changed into pleasures? and thy greatest
evils made beneficial unto thee? Wouldest thou be loosed from the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66022:22"/>
chains of thy sins, and delivered from the chains of plagues? Wouldest
thou have the same <hi>Christ,</hi> with his precious Blood to free thee, that shall
with his Word sentence others? As who would not, except Satan hath
strangely bewitcht him? If thou wouldest, I say, then learn of this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi>

rehearse touching his knowledge, belief, and life; for I have onely brake

moved thereat, yea, he is as heartily vexed for any dishonour done to
him, as for any disgrace offered to himself. He hath an holy care and
endeavour in all places and companies, to walk so as he may win glory to
<hi>God,</hi> honour his profession, and give no offence or occasion to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of <hi>God</hi> to speak evil of him; he acknowledgeth all good to come
from <hi>God,</hi> and that all glory is to be given to him; and accordingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to honour and serve him with his riches, wisdom, and what
other gifts or abilities he hath; neither is he dumb in publishing his
praise, nor backward to justifie him in his Judgments. He will not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
an Image, or <hi>God</hi> in the Image; he seldom sells things tending to
Idolatry, or any other sin, or uses lots in sporting. He fears <hi>God,</hi> and
fears sin, and this dispelle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> in him all other false, fond, and foolish fears,
which others that are void of the fear of <hi>God,</hi> are grievously and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
perplexed withal; as namely, he fears not that his serving of <hi>God</hi>
will prove his undoing, he neither fears nor observes the flying of Fowles,
the signs of Heaven, the sight of a live Snake, the crossing of an Hare, the
croaking of a Raven, the screeching of an Owl, the howling of a Dog, the
dreaming of Gardens, green Rushes, or dead friends; to eat an Egg in
Lent, or flesh on a Friday never racks his conscience; whether the Crow
cryes even or odd in a morning, or whether he leaves the crosse on his
right or left hand as he goes; whether it be Childermas Day or not, when
he takes a Journey, or undertakes any businesse, or whether the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller
falls from or towards him, it is all one to him; nor does stumbling
at a threshold presage any evil to him at all; he never crosses his breast,
nor sprinckles his face when he is to go abroad, nor nailes Horse-shooes
at his door, and yet speeds never the worse; neither old Wives, nor
Stars are his Counsellors; a Night-spel is none of his guide, nor Charms
his <hi>Physitian; Erra Pater</hi> is no part of his Creed; neither weares he Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulets,

Table as well as the second, and the second as well as the first; framing
his will to <hi>Gods</hi> Will in every thing, even labouring to be perfect, and
holy, as his Father in Heaven is; and to imitate <hi>Christ,</hi> be conformed
to his likenesse, and to be holy as he was in all parts of his conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that at all times and in all companies; as conscientious alone
and in private, where <hi>God</hi> only sees him, as if his greatest enemy, or all
the world did behold him; he hath a spirit without guile, and is more
desirous to be good then so accounted, and more seeks the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
then the shew of it; and therefore keeps a narrower watch over his
very thoughts then any other can do over his actions, and is accordingly
grieved for them. He makes conscience of the smallest things required
or forbidden in the Word; and is as careful to shun the very occasions of
sin, or least appearances, or first mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions of sin as actual sin it self; not
daring to gratifie Satan in committing the least sin, or neglect <hi>God</hi> in
omitting the smallest precept.</p>
            <p>§. 2. He does not serve <hi>God</hi> by the precepts of men, not fear his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
for breaking their traditions; neither does he think himself san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by outward performances, as do our Formalists and <hi>Protestants</hi> at
large, who stand more upon circumstance then substance, and upon out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
priviledges then inward graces, but he serves God in spirit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Christs Gospel,</hi> for he lives and believes, and hears, and invocates,
and hopes, and fears, and loves, and worships <hi>God</hi> in such manner as his
Word prescribes, without addition or deminution; neither doth he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the examples of the greatest number, or the greatest men, or the
greatest Schollers, because <hi>Christ</hi> hath plainly told him, That few of
either sort (compared with the multitude) shall be saved; of which small
number he strives to be.</p>
            <p>§. 3. All which he performs with chearfulnesse, being ever willing
and ready to do good; and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>incerity and simplicity, with a single
heart, without by-ends, as loving righteousnesse and mercy, and doing
good duties merely out of love to <hi>God</hi> and goodnesse, and because <hi>God</hi>
commands them that he may be glorified, and others edified thereby; yea
he would do what he is able out of love to <hi>Christ,</hi> though himself should
never have credit nor benefit by it here, nor hereafter; earnestly desiring
grace that he might more honour him, and grieving that he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66022:23"/>
most sordidly do) take liberty to sin, because <hi>God</hi> is merciful, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares
to execute judgment speedily; or defer his repentance, because
the <hi>Theef</hi> upon the Crosse was heard at the last hour: but he will even
therefore the more fear him because he is merciful; and therefore be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because he is not under the Law, but under grace.</p>
            <p>§. 4. And lastly, having thus done, and performed his utmost, not to
merit by it, but to expresse his thankfulnesse to him that hath done, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and suffered so much for him; he confesseth himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
servant, and that in all he comes far short of performing his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
yea, he acknowledgeth, that it were just for <hi>God</hi> eternally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him. Well may he be comforted by the graces which <hi>God</hi> hath
given him, as an earnest penny of those eternal Mansions in Heaven;
but he will not be exalted by them because they are not his graces, but
the Graces of <hi>God</hi> in him, and wrought by his Spirit: yea, he so abhors
to attribute or ascribe ought to doing, that he counts his very righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
no better then filthy rags, ascribing every good thought, word, and
action which proceeds from him to Free Grace, for he looks back to the
rock out of which he was hewen, and is not onely humbled thereby, but
forced with an holy admiration to wonder at the marvellous and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
change which <hi>God</hi> hath wrought in him, and also instructed to trust
onely to <hi>Christs</hi> obedience, in whom onely our good works are accepted,
and for whom alone they are rewarded. To shut up all, he endeavours

the fruits of our Sanctification, and though faith alone justifieth, yet ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
faith is never alone, but ever accompanied with spiritual graces,
the beauties of the soul, and good works the beauty of graces; yea, they
are as inseparable as the root and the sap, the <hi>Sun</hi> and its light; and as
<hi>Fire</hi> may be discerned by heat, and life by motion, so a mans faith may be
discerned by the fruits of it. Nor can any one be deceived except he
desires to deceive himself, for every particular man is either the Child of
<hi>God,</hi> or the Child of the Devil, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath it, for there is not a
mean betwixt them; and there be more differences between the Children

Beasts, whereof I have named not a few; for whatsoever you may find
the one (herein set forth) to speak, think, or do, the other does the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;

of contraries and be satisfied; I speak this to Naturians onely, for the

regenerate man knowes the one to be so by what he is, and the other by
what he hath been; neither is there one of all these signes or characters
but each experienced <hi>Christian</hi> finds it in some degree written in his heart,
as his conscience can bear me witnesse. And would you know whether
you belong to <hi>Christ?</hi> This will inform you, you will (by help from

               </gap>earful to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a good opinion of himself, as the false is unwilling to be driven from
it; let such an one take special notice in the first place, that there are
three sorts of true and sound <hi>Christians,</hi> as the Apostle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> makes
the distinction, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 12, 13. the first sort are <hi>babes</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> viz. such
as are new born, or but weakly qualified with the graces of <hi>Gods Spirit.</hi>
A second are <hi>strong men,</hi> as having the gifts of the Spirit lively, and in
power: The third are <hi>Fathers,</hi> such as have had long experience in the
powerful practice of Christianity, and been long exercised in all kinds
of well doing. This done:</p>
            <p>§. 2. Secondly, let him know, That as <hi>God</hi> requires no other obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in the best then Evangelical, so he looks not for the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and degree of grace from <hi>Bubes,</hi> and <hi>strong men,</hi> or from strong men
and <hi>Fathers,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> accepteth of every man according to the grace he

is both the Father of mercies, and the Authour of mercy and compassion
in others? Yes undoubtedly; as let it be granted, that thy knowledge
is still small, thy faith weak, thy charity cold, thy heart dull and hard,
thy good works few and imperfect, and all thy zealous resolutions easily
hindered and quite overthrown with every small temptation, yet <hi>God</hi>
that worketh in us both the will and the work will accept the will for the
work; and that which is wanting in us, <hi>Christ</hi> will supply with his own
righteousnesse; he respecteth not what we can do so much as what we
would do, and that which we would perform and cannot, he esteemeth it
as though it were performed; thus he taketh an heart desirous to repent
and believe for a penitent and believing heart, whereas take away the
will and all acts in <hi>Gods</hi> sight are equal. Well might I doubt of my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

<hi>Asahs</hi> heart was perfect; so our failings be not wilful, though they be
many and great, yet they cannot hinder our interest in the promises of
<hi>God;</hi> an honest and sincere heart bears out many errours in the eye of
mercy, <hi>God</hi> will not see weaknesses where he sees truth; yea, if we hate
our corruptions, and strive against them, they shall not be counted ours:
<hi>It is not I,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, but the sin that dwelleth in me,</hi> Rom. 7. 20. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
were it not so, what would become of us? for the work of grace
though it doth not suffer <hi>Christians</hi> to live as they list, yet it doth not
inable them to live as they would; it is not so broad as to allow of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
nor so narrow but it will permit of corruption.</p>
            <p>§. 5. But fifthly, least the former considerations should not serve, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me ingeniously to these questions:</p>
            <p>Dost thou not find that the Word and Spirit hath wrought an apparant
change in thy judgment, affections, and actions to what they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly?
Is not <hi>Christ</hi> thy greatest joy, sin thy greatest sorrow, and grace
the prime object of thy desires? Art thou not careful in the use of the
means, to attain faith in the promise of <hi>Gods</hi> mercy made in <hi>Christ?</hi> Dost
thou not love <hi>God,</hi> and the people of <hi>God;</hi> yea, art thou not prone to
speak in their defence when thou hearest them reviled, and contemned
by wicked and ungodly men? Dost thou not rejoyce when the righteous
are exalted, and grieve when the wicked bear rule? Dost thou not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y for the salvation of others? Is it not grievous to thee to
hear <hi>God</hi> blasphemed, and dishonoured? Dost thou not make conscience
of sanctifying his <hi>Sabbaths?</hi> Art thou not as conscientious alone, and in
private where <hi>God</hi> onely sees thee, as if thy greatest enemy, or all the
world did behold thee? Dost thou not make conscience of evil thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
grieve for thy unprofitablenesse under the means of grace, for the evill
which cleaves to thy best actions, and for sins of omission? When thou
dost any thing amisse dost thou not accuse thy self? if any thing well, dost
thou not give all the praise to God? Whatever thou enjoyest on this
side Hell, dost thou not think thy self unworthy of it? Dost thou not
more fear the want of grace then con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide in what thou hast? Art thou
not evil spoken of for well doing? Dost thou not love zeal and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66022:25"/>
in others? Thou art not of a reprobate judgement, touching things,
actions, and persons, accounting good evill, and evill good, nor dost thou
think the worse of a man for having of a tender conscience: Thou art not
so offended when offences come as to think the worse of the way of truth,
yea, when strange things happen dost thou not make a wholesome constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
thereof? If so, my soul for thine thou art a true Believer, and not
an hypocrite, whatever thy failings be; yea, if thou shouldest finde but a
few of these signes in thy self, thou needest not much fear thine estate, for
a few Grapes will shew that the plant is a Vine, and not a Thorne; yea,
where there is any one grace in truth, there is every one in their measure:
if thou art sure thou hast love, I am sure thou hast faith; for they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as
inseparable as fire and heat, life and motion; and so of other graces.</p>
            <p>6. §. But sixthly, for I will go yet further with thee; suppose nothing
that I have hitherto said will satisfie thee, and that thou wilt not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
any of these graces to be in thee, yet still thy case may be good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
for a <hi>Christian</hi> in times of spirituall distemper and desertion, is as
one in a swound, in which case the soul doth not exercise her functions, he
neither hears, nor sees, nor feels, yet she is still in the body: <hi>Christ</hi> is as the
<hi>Sun</hi> to our souls, and we are like <hi>Elementary bodies;</hi> which lighten and
darken, cool and warm, die and revive; as the Sun presents or absents it
self from them. Whence it comes to passe that we have so much crying out
in horrour of conscience, I am damned, I am damned; yea, it is a wonder
to see how many truly humbled sinners, who have so tender consciences,
that they dare not yield to the leaste vill for the worlds goods, and refuse no
means of being made better; turn every probation into reprobation, every
dejection into rejection; and if they be cast down they cry out, they are
cast away; but in such distempers a man is not a competent Judge in his
own case, as in humane Laws there is a nullity held of words and actions
extorted, and wrong from men by fear; because in such cases a man is
held not to have power, or command in some sort of himselfe. A troubled
soul is like troubled water, we can discern nothing cleerly in it; wherefore
in such cases a man must call to remembrance the times past, and how it
hath been with him formerly, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 2, to 12. and likewise
<hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 31. Thus must thou do, and then if ever thou hadst true
faith wrought in thy heart it can never be clean extinguished; and so of
love and godly sorrow, for the gifts and calling of <hi>God</hi> are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29. I the Lord change not. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 6. And the weakest
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, if true, though it be not the like strong, yet it is the like preciou faith
to that of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> whereby to lay hold and put on the perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of <hi>Christ;</hi> yea, the truth of grace, be the measure never so small,
is alwayes blest with perseverance; and if grace but conquer us first, we
by it shall conquer all things else, whether it be corruptions within us, or
temptations without us; yea, to speak rightly, thou art the better to be
thought of, and the lesse to be feared for this thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear, for no man so truly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66022:26"/>
loves, as he that feares to offend: and good is that fear which keeps us from
evill acts, yea, as a bleeding wound is better then that which bleeds not, so
thy very complaint of sin springing from a displeasure against it shewes,
that there is something in thee opposite to sin, viz. that thou art penitent
in affection, though not in action; even as a Childe is rationall in power,
though not in act; neither was the <hi>Centurion</hi> ever so worthy as when
he thought himselfe most unworthy; for all our worthinesse is in a capabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
misery.</p>
            <p>7. §. But here by the way observe one caution, as the <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ister</hi> must not

                  </gap>re,</hi> so the <hi>tent</hi> must not be bigger then the <hi>wound.</hi>
Though the grievousnesse of our sins should increase our repentance, yet
they should not diminish our faith, and assurance of pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Because the <hi>Law</hi> is not more a <hi>Glasse</hi> to shew us our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ins, then the
<hi>Gospel</hi> is a <hi>Fountain</hi> to wash them away; wherefore cast not both thine
eyes upon thy sin, but reserve one to behold the remedy; look upon the
Law to keep thee from <hi>presumption</hi> and upon the Gospel to keep thee from
<hi>despair;</hi> this is both a sweet and an even course. But as an empty <hi>Vessel</hi>
close luted, though you throw it into the midst of the <hi>Sea,</hi> will receive no
water, so all pleas are in vain to them that are deafned with their own
feares; for as <hi>Mary</hi> would not be comforted with the sight and speech of
<hi>Angels,</hi> no not with the sight and speech of <hi>Iesus</hi> himselfe, till he made her
know that it was <hi>Iesu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

conscience with the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> and sheds his love into the heart; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will do, no Creature can take off wrath from the conscience, but he
that set it on; wherefore the <hi>God</hi> of peace give you the peace of God,
which passeth all understanding, yea, O Lord, speak thou <hi>musick</hi> to the
wounded conscience, <hi>thunder</hi> to the seared; that thy Justice may reclaim
the one, thy mercy relieve the other, and thy favour comfort us all with
peace and salvation in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>

            <p>1. §. The comfort of what hath been said in these seven last Sections,
is intended and belongs to weak <hi>Christians,</hi> troubled consciences, and
those that would fain do better; but let no unbeliever, impenitent, or
prophane person meddle with it, for all such are to know that their very
best services, as praying, and fasting, and receiving, and giving of Almes,
&amp;c. (because they are not done in faith, and obedience to the Word, and
that <hi>God</hi> may be glorified thereby) are no better in <hi>Gods</hi> account then if
they had slain a <hi>Man,</hi> or cut off a <hi>Dogs neck,</hi> or offered <hi>Swines blood,</hi> or
blessed an <hi>Idol,</hi> as himself affirmes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 3. Nor will <hi>God</hi> accept of any
action, unlesse it flowes from a pious and good heart, sanctified by the
Holy Ghost; yea, civill honesty severed from true piety, humility, saving

neither accept nor reward, but account of their morall vertues as of shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or glistering sins; because they spring from pride, ignorance infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
self-love, and other such carnall respects, as many examples prove,
namely, <hi>Cains</hi> sacrificing, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 12. the <hi>Iews</hi> fasting, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

23. and the like, whose outward works were the same which the godly
perform; and what saith <hi>Austine</hi> most excellently, There is no true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
where there is no true Religion; and that conscience which is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the Word, even when it does best does ill, because it doth it not in
faith, obedience, and love.</p>
            <p>2. §. Secondly, let them know, that being out of <hi>Christ,</hi> they are bound
to keep the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3. or stand liable to suffer the penalty
thereof for not keeping it; for though this be the condition of the New
Covenant, <hi>Believe and thou shalt be saved;</hi> yet all that they have to trust
unto is, <hi>Do this and live, Rom.</hi> 10. 5. and cursed is every one that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. And I wish that they would seriously think of it, and what
need they have of <hi>Christ,</hi> whom they rather persecute then obey his Gospel
in love.</p>
            <p>3. §. Indeed let them get a true lively and justifying faith; Put ye off,
concerning the former conversation, the <hi>old man,</hi> which is corrupted
through the deceivable lusts, and be renued in the spirit of your mindes;

guilt, but for every thought, word, and action of yours from your infancy,

that of <hi>Caput Imperii,</hi> professing that he had rather be a Saint and no <hi>King,</hi>
then a <hi>King</hi> and no Saint; yea, <hi>Ignatius</hi> said, he had rather be a Martyr
then a <hi>Monarch.</hi> Besides, experience proves greatnesse, nobility, and
riches, to be a most deceitfull rule to walk by; for, <hi>the Kings of the earth

against his Christ,</hi> Psal. 2. 2. And in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 16. we read of no lesse then
two and thirty <hi>Kings</hi> in a cluster that were every one drunk; and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
that a thousand of the chief Princes of <hi>Israel</hi> committed fornication,
and were all destroyed for their labour in one day, <hi>Numb. 25. 9. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 8.
yea, of twenty <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iudah</hi> which the Scripture mentions, we read of
but six that were godly, and of eighteen <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> all but two are
branded by the Holy Ghost for wicked, and yet this Nation was <hi>Gods</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and chosen people out of all the world; and lastly, when the <hi>Rulers</hi>
sate in counsell against <hi>Christ,</hi> none spake for him but <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> Joh. 7.
50, 51. All which shews; that it is neither a good nor a safe way to imitate
other mens examples, be they never so rich, never so great; or if we sinne
together, we shall be sure to perish together; as when those <hi>three and
twenty thousand Israelites committed fornication</hi> after the example of the
chief <hi>Princes,</hi> they were every one destroyed, both leaders and followers,
<hi>Numb. 25. 9. 1 Cor 10. 8.</hi> and as when those other <hi>Cities</hi> followed <hi>Sodoms</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:66022:28"/>
Just, they were all consumed with <hi>Sodoms</hi> fire, <hi>Iude 7.</hi>

            <p>3. §. But thirdly, admit thou couldest alledge for thine excuse, that
thou dost but as most of the wife, learned, and greatest Scholars in the
Land do, yet all were one, this could not excuse thee; for first, <hi>Not many
wise men after the flesh are called, but God hath chosen the foolish things of
the world to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ crucified was foolishnesse to the wise Sages</hi> of the world, 1 Cor. 1. 23.
It pleaseth <hi>God</hi> for the most part to <hi>hide the mysteries of salvation from the
wise and learned, and to reveal them unto babes,</hi> Matth. 11. 25. Luke 10. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
yea, the saving knowledge of <hi>Christ is hid to all that are lost,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3. but
if once men abuse their knowledge and learning to <hi>Gods</hi> dishonour, and
comply with Satan and the world against the Church (as how many Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in all ages of the world have resembled <hi>Trajan,</hi> who was indued with
great knowledge and other singular vertues, but defaced them all by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Christianity, and opposing the power of godlinesse) in this case he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that knowledge which once they had from them, as he took heat from
the fire when it would burn his children, <hi>Dan. 3. 27. I will destroy the tokens
of the Sooth-sayers</hi> (saith God) <hi>and make them that conjecture sooles; I
will turn the wise men backward, and make their knowledge foolishnesse,</hi> Isa.
44. 25. And again, <hi>He taketh the wise in their own craftinesse, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of the wicked is made foolish,</hi> Job 5. 13. And justly are they forsaken of
their reason, who have abandoned <hi>God,</hi> yea, most just it is, that they who
want grace should want wit too, for which read <hi>2 Thess. 2. 10, 11, 12.</hi> Thus
I might go on and shew, that we may not imitate the actions, nor follow
the examples of the best and holiest men in every thing they do, though
we have some plausible reasons for our doing so, and also good and holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
in our so doing, or if we do, that we may go to Hell notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>

of the greatest men, nor of the greatest Scholars, nor of the best and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest

            <p>I answer; As a <hi>Rule</hi> directeth the Artificer in his work, and keepeth him

<hi>2 Pet. 1. 19. Ephes. 2. 20. Gal. 6. 16. Iohn 5. 39.</hi> And it hath ever been
the care of <hi>Christians</hi> to stick close to the written Word, having always and
in all cases an eye thereunto; and without this written Word, a man in the
world is as a <hi>Ship</hi> on the <hi>Sea</hi> without a guide; yea, he that lives without

For if he see a man convincd that he is nothing so as he ought to be, (that

and 5. 9. Mark 16. 16. John 3. 36. Isa. 59. 20. Neither was it ever heard that
any ascended into <hi>Heaven</hi> without going up the stayes of obedience and
good works, that any have attained unto everlasting life without faith,
repentance and sanctification, for even the <hi>Thief upon the Crosse</hi> (whom
you ignorantly alledge) believed in <hi>Christ,</hi> and shewed the fruits of his
faith in acknowledging his own sin, reproving his fellow, and confessing
our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> even then when his <hi>Apostles</hi> denied and forsook him, in
calling upon his name, desiring, and confidently trusting by his means and
merits to have everlasting life. And indeed, the very end of <hi>Gods</hi> elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of <hi>Christs</hi> redeeming us was, <hi>That we might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e holy,</hi> Ephes. 1. 4.
Matth. 19. 17. and therefore he bindes it with an Oath, <hi>That whomsoever
he redeemeth out of the hands of their spirituall enemies, they shall worship
him in holinesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of their lives,</hi> Luke 1. 70. to
76. 1 Pet. 2. 24. they therefore that never came to be holy were never cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
never redeemed; other Scriptures to this purpose are many, see one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Tit. 2. 12, 14. 1 Pet. 2. 24. Matth.</hi> 19. 17. nor ought any indeed to <hi>call
upon Christ,</hi> or once to name him with their mouths, except they <hi>depart
from iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. Neither doth the <hi>Thiefes</hi> example make any
whit for the comfort of procrastinators; for First, we read not that ever
he was outwardly called untill this very hour; Secondly, though there was
one saved at the last hour that none might despair, yet there was but one
that none should presume; and millions who had lesse iniquity have found
lesse mercy. Thirdly, the <hi>Thiefes</hi> conversion was one of the Miracles,
with the glory whereof our Saviour would honour the ignominy of his
Crosse. Again, Fourthly, the <hi>Thief</hi> was saved at the very instant of time
when our Saviour triumphed on the Crosse, took his leave of the world,
and entered into his glory. Now it is usuall with Princes to save some
hainous Malefactors at their Coronation, when they enter upon their
Kingdomes in triumph, which they are never known to do afterwards,
which circumstances being rightly considered, together with the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
change so suddenly wrought in him, as I shewed before, his example
will yield little encouragement to men of thy condition; nor was his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
conversion ever intended in <hi>Gods</hi> purpose for a temptation, and yet by
Satans policy working upon wicked mens depraved judgements, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
hearts in wresting this Scripture, it hath proved (by accident) the
losse of many thousand souls, and take heed it prove not thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase; to which
end let not Satan any longer bewitch you, so to think upon <hi>Gods</hi> mercy, as
in the mean time to forget that he is also just and true; and so much for
answer to those two objections, which Satan findes more prevalent then all
the rest he is able to invent.</p>

         <div n="30" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. 30.</head>
            <p>1. §. Now to winde up all with a word of exhortation, if thou beest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't,
and resolvest upon a new course, let thy resolution be peremptory
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66022:30"/>
and constant, and take heed thou harden not again, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines,</hi>
the <hi>young man</hi> in the Gospel, <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> did. Resemble not the
<hi>Iron</hi> which is no longer soft then it is in the <hi>fire:</hi> be not like those that are
Sea-sick, who are much troubled while they are on Ship-board, but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well again when they are come to shore; for that good (saith <hi>Gregory</hi>)
will do us no good which is not made good by perseverance. If with these
premonitions the Spirit shall vouchsafe to stir up in thine heart, any good
motions and holy purposes to obey <hi>God,</hi> in letting thy sins go, <hi>quench not,</hi>
grieve not <hi>the Spirit,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 19. <hi>return not with the Dog to thy vomit,</hi>
lest <hi>thy latter end prove seven-fold worse then thy beginning,</hi> Matth. 12. 43,
45. As it fared with <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, and <hi>Iuda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> the traitor. O it is a
fearfull thing <hi>to receive the grace of God in vain;</hi> &amp; a desperate thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
warned of a <hi>Rock,</hi> wilfully to cast our selves upon it! Neither let Satan
perswade you to deferre your repentance, no not an hour, lest your resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
proves as a false conception which never comes to bearing; for as ill
Debtors put off their Creditors, first one week, then another, till at last
they are able to pay nothing, so deal delayers with <hi>God.</hi> Besides, death
may be sudden, even the least of a thousand things can kill thee, and give
thee no leasure to be sick.</p>
            <p>2. §. Secondly, or if death be not sudden, repentance is no such easie
work as to be put off to sicknesse; and though true repentance be never
too late, yet late repentance is seldome true; and indeed there is small
hope of repentance at the hour of death, where there was no regard of
honesty in the time of life, and Millions are now in Hell who thought they
would repent hereafter; not being wise enough to consider that it is with
sin in the heart as with a tree planted in the ground, which the longer it
groweth, the harder it is to be pluckt up; or a nail in a post, which is
made faster by every stroke of the Hammer: As what saith the Holy Ghost,
<hi>Can the Black Moor change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? then may ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
do good that are accustomed to do evill,</hi> Jer. 13. 23.</p>
            <p>3. §. Thirdly, or suppose after many years spent in the service of sin
and Satan thou art willing to relinquish thy lusts, and offer to <hi>God</hi> thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and best devotions at the last gaspe, will he accept of them? No, he
hath expresly told us the contrary, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to 32. yea, is it likely that
<hi>God</hi> will accept of thy dry bones when Satan hath suckt out all the marrow?
That he will give his heavenly and spirituall graces at the hour of death, to
those who have contemned them all their life? Yea, is it not most just and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
if <hi>God</hi> will not be found of those that were content to lose him? If he
shut his ear against their prayers calling to him for pardon, that stopt their ears against hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Voice calling upon them for repentance? The Lord hath
made a promise to late repentance, not of late repentance; if thou convertest
to morrow thou art sure of grace, but thou art not sure of to morrows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
if in any reasonable time we pray he wil hear us, if we repent he wil
pardon us, if we amend our lives he will save us; but for want of this timely
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66022:31"/>
consideration <hi>Dives</hi> prayed, but was not heard; <hi>Esau</hi> wept, but was not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied;
the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> knockt, but wore denied: and so thousands have
cried unto God at the hour of death, and found no repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance, but they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as they lived, and went from despair unto destruction. Wherefore, as
you tender the good of your own soul, set upon the work presently; provide
with <hi>Ioseph</hi> for the dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th to come; and with <hi>Naob</hi> in the dayes of thine
health build the <hi>Ark</hi> of a good Conscionce against the floods of sicknesse;
imitate the <hi>Ant,</hi> who provides her meat in Summer for the Winter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
yea, do it while the yerning bowels, the bleeding wounds, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
arms of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> lie open to receive you; whiles ye have
health, and life, and means, and time to repent; and make your peace
with <hi>God.</hi> As you tender (I say) the everlasting happinesse and welfare of
your almost lost and drowned soul, as you expect or hope for grace or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for joy and comfort, for <hi>Heaven</hi> and salvation, for endlesse blisse and
glory at the last; as you would escape the direfull Wrath of <hi>God,</hi> the
bitter Sentence and Doome of Christ, the never dying sting and worm of
Conscience, the tormenting and soul-scorching flames of Hell, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
separation from <hi>Gods</hi> bli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>full presence, abjure, and utterly renounce
all wilfull and affected evill. To which end;</p>
            <p>4. §. In the next place, be diligent to hear Gods Word powerfully
preached, which is the sword of the Spirit, that killeth our corruptions,
and that unresistable Cannon-shot, which beateth and battereth down all
the strong holds of u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n and Satan.</p>
            <p>5. §. Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ponder and meditate seriously on <hi>Gods</hi> inestimable love
towards us, who hath not spared to give his onely beloved Son out of his
bosome to die for us, and to purchase thereby every good thing we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
either for soul or body, even to the least bit of bread we eat; and this
will make thee (if thou hast any ingenuity) to direct all thy thoughts,
speeches and actions to his glory, as he hath directed thy eternall salvation
thereunto, and often force thee to break out into this or the like expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
What shall I render unto thee, O Lord for all thy benefits? but love
thee my Creator, and become a new creature.</p>
            <p>6. §. Fourthly, consider that the Lord beholdeth thee in all places, and
in every thing thou dost; even as the eyes of a well-drawn Picture are
fastened on thee which way soever thou turnest; yea, consider him as a
just judge, who will not let sin go unpunished, and this will make thee keep
a narrower watch over thy very thoughts then any other can do over thine
actions.</p>
            <p>7. §. Fifthly, if thou wilc be safe from evill works, avoid the occasions
at least if thou wilc keep thy self from iniquity, have no fellowship with
the workers of iniquity, for it is not more hard to finde vertue in evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
then to misse vice; <hi>They were mingled among the Heathen</hi> (faith the
Psalmist) and what followes, <hi>they learned their workes,</hi> Psal. 106. 35. yea,
how soon was peter changed, with but comning into the High Priests
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66022:31"/>
Hall; and the like with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> which made <hi>David</hi> to say so
soon as he had considered it, <hi>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for
I will keep the Commandements of my God,</hi> Psal. 119. 115. knowing that he
could not do the one without the other. And indeed, the choice of a
mans company is one of the most weighty actions of our lives, for our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
well or ill-being depends on that election, and many a man had been
good that is not, if he had but kept good company.</p>
            <p>8. §. Sixthly and lastly, but chieftly &amp; principally, omit not to pray for
the assistance of Gods Spirit, otherwise thy strength is small; yea, except
<hi>God</hi> give thee repentance, and remove all impediments that may kinder,
thou canst no more turn the self then thou couldest at first make thy self;
<hi>We are not sufficient of our selves to think,</hi> much lesse to speak, least of all to
do <hi>that which is good,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. John 15. 4, 5. we are swift to all evill,
but to any good immoveable; wherefore beg of <hi>God</hi> that he will give you
a new heart, and when the heart is changed, all the members will follow
after it, as the rest of the Creatures after the <hi>Sun</hi> when it ariseth; impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
him for grace, that thou maiest firmly resolve; speedily begin, and
continually persevere in doing, and suffering his holy Will; desire him to
informe and reforme thee so, that thou maiest neither mis-believe nor mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live;
to regenerate thy heart, change and purifie thy nature, subdue thy
reason, rectifie thy judgement, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> forgetting that prayer is the key of Heaven,

            <p>And now for conclusion, if thou receivest any power against thy corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
forget not to be thankfull, and when <hi>God</hi> hath the fruit of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
he will not spare to sowe much where he reaps much. Consider what
