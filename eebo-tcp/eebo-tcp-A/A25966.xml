            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE AND Right Reverend Father in GOD HENRY Lord Bishop of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AMong the unhappy Irregularities that crept into our Church in the licentious days of Vsurpation, none has proved so difficult to be reformed as that of Baptizing Children in Private Houses, when there is no necessity requiring it; and that too with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Form of Administration.</p>
            <p>For not only they who are Dissenters from us in the main, but (alas!) too many who profess themselves of us, and would take it ill not to be reputed very good Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> persist obstinately in this Error; and what is worse, are apt to express a high resentment, if the Clergy deny to comply with them, while they at the same time refuse to hear the Church.</p>
            <p>But it is our happiness, that their Obstinacy, tho' great, cannot exceed or tire the pious Industry and unwearied Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Religious Prelacy, to reduce us to that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Decency and Order for which our Church has been ever as Venerable as Eminent.</p>
            <p>Of this your Lordship is a very signal instance, whose Zeal to free our Church from this vile Corruption is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to that Authority which you deservedly bear in it, and has gone a great way so successfully in the Cure of that part which you more immediately adorn and govern,
<pb facs="tcp:62403:3"/>
that we are almost assured to see it perfected there by Your Lordship's Hand; as we are encouraged to hope it will be through the Kingdom, by the healing Applications of its Chief and worthily Most Reverend Metropolitan.</p>
            <p>And since what is acted by our Governours in a higher Sphere, commands our imitation in our inferior Stations; I, who am not in circumstances of manifesting my obedience in a Reformation, can only testifie my good inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, in a weak endeavour of another kind, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatise that takes sanctuary under the Vmbrage of Your Lordship's name. For which, while I offer it to Your Lordship, as an humble acknowledgment of former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, I must beg the additional one of Your Pardon; and I cannot despair of that for any thing that wishes well to a design You have still been forward to promote: And in that have added to many others, one more grand Evidence of our happiness in Your Presidency over us, which labors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our Practice to the Purity and Splendor of those Rules that ought to influence and direct it.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I fear to offend as much by a tedious Apologie, as by the unworthy Present I would excuse; and shall make only this for the Imperfections of this Piece, That the Author has so much of the Cares, and so little else of the World, as not to be supplied with leisure and Books for an elaborate performance, such as might be fit to offer to the Churches Service, and Your Lordship's Patronage; than which there is nothing more in the Ambition of,</p>

            <head>MINISTRATION OF Publick Baptism OF INFANTS To be used in the CHURCH.</head>
            <p>AS it is an Affliction that through a strange Deservency of the Primitive Zeal, in the exteriour Worship of our God, so Solemn and Eminent a part thereof, as the Publick Celebration of the Sacrament of Baptism, should be so much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected (not to say oppos'd) as to stand in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62403:4"/>
need of Patronage and Assertion; so it is an Advantage to engage in the defence of a Practice as Antient as Christianity it self, and as general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received (till of late) without Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Dispute. Since therefore that devout and excellent Office labours under such unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Circumstances, and that no other Pen has been purposely employed to redress the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance: One of the meanest of its Admirers, has ventur'd to expose his Weakness for its Cause, rather than suffer it by appearing Friendless, to fall into more contempt.</p>
            <p>Let him not be thought herein to presume on his own Abilities (which he is conscious how small they are) since he espouses a Cause so arm'd with Truth, Antiquity and Reason, that it cannot be a sufferer, ev'n by the weakest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement: Which makes him imitate the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Champion, accosting the Philistin Giant, and despise the Armour of fallacious Sophistry, as sufficiently guarded and secur'd by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness of that Truth which he maintains. And he cannot doubt, but that the better it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern'd, it will have the greater Prevalency, and in spite of Opposition, become more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror.</p>
            <p>For the Conviction then of such who refuse to bring their Children into the place of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62403:4"/>
Worship, the Church, to receive their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation into the Christian Religion, by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptism, there in the Face of the Congregation; but either through Obstinacy, Pride, or Ignorance, contend to have that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice perform'd within their Houses: It may perhaps be pertinent to proceed in this Method, and propose to their consideration.</p>
            <p>First, The Rubrick of our Church prefix'd to the Office of Publick Baptism of Infants.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Consent in this particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Eastern and Western Churches.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Ground of this Rubrick, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what strength of Antiquity and Reason it relys.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Power of the Church to make this Injunction, and the indispensable Obligation that lies on them to obey it.</p>
            <p>And lastly, To answer the most material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that are usually made against the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this Duty.</p>
            <p>But here while the necessity of bringing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the Church, to receive their Baptism, is asserted, it must be understood to mean it with a Supposition of their being in a condition fit to be carried abroad; for in case of Sickness and extream necessity, where there is danger of their dying Unbaptiz'd, the Church has allow'd

State; and the Church by performing those Offices of Baptism, and the like, in the places, and at the times of their more solemn meetings, did sufficiently declare those times and places to be the properest for such Administrations.

And this unparallel'd Wickedness was the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Churches and Baptisteries: By which it appears, not only that Fonts for publick Baptism were then in use, but that they had been of much antienter standing; for had there not been such places long before, how ridiculous had it been for the Father to say, That the like wickedness had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been committed (for the Interrogation here is much stronger than a Negative) and to wonder at it as a new and unheard of Thing.

And that this may not seem an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst bringing Children to be Baptiz'd in the Church, let it be remember'd, that though the Baptism was sometimes administer'd without the Church; yet the Examination and Abrenuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were always made within it.

               <hi>Greg. Turonensis</hi> shews, That the Font in which <hi>Clodoveus</hi> was Baptiz'd by <hi>Rhemigius,</hi> was placed in the Church. This is the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that gives occasion to our Rubrick, and the Reasons are as prevalent.</p>
            <p>Two we have mention'd in the Rubrick it self, and even those are by the wise and serious consideration of the Church, thought sufficient to procure an admonition to the people, that it is <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rubrick before Publick Baptism.</hi>
               </note> most convenient that Baptism should not be Administer'd but upon <hi>Sundays</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Holy-Days, when the most number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come together: (Which still argues the place of Administration to be the Church)</p>
            <p>The first Reason respects the Parties baptiz'd, that they may have Witnesses of their Initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the latter, the Persons present, that they may be reminded of their own Profession and Vow made to God. The first has been ever thought so necessary by the Church, That in such cases of necessity wherein it allows of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Baptism, yet it still injoyns the Children so Baptiz'd to be brought afterward into the Church, and there to be received in Publick, upon sufficient testimony of the validity of their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62403:10"/>
Private Baptism in the use of all the Essentials to it. And it must certainly be a great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to any so Baptiz'd in private, upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and consequently in haste, to be assured that nothing Essential to his Baptism was then omitted, and that the Church had such satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction thereof, that it added those exteriour Rites and Accidentals that are the Ornaments and Appendages of a due Administration of that Holy Sacrament: The omission of which Rites the Church never did allow, but upon some ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent necessity; and not then upon any account but the uncertainty of their Future State who leave the World without this Badge of their Christianity.</p>
            <p>And for this reason 'tis, that the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did so press the dispatch of Baptism, that the persons to be Baptiz'd, whether Adult or Infants, should be brought to Church, lest sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should deny them the happy opportunity of coming thither, and allow them only an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as well homely for the insolemnity, as for the privacy of its performance. Wherefore, says <note n="(g)" place="margin">Orat. in Sanct. Bapt.</note> St. <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,</hi> Let us be Baptiz'd to day, lest to morrow it be the effect of force; let us not defer a Blessing, as if it were an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, till Sickness or some other danger compel us to embrace it: And a great deal more he has
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62403:10"/>
to the same purpose. Wherefore we may conclude this with that of <note n="(h)" place="margin">De Rit. Eccles. Cathol. lib. 1. cap. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Durantus</hi>; Parents are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be admonish'd and exhorted, that as soon as they can without danger they bring their Children to the Church, and take care that they be Baptiz'd with the solemn Ceremonies thereof; especially since by reason of their tender age they are in infinite hazard of being prevented by an early death. Which argues, That besides the benefit of having the Congregation present to testify their being received into the number of Christ's Church, it is an honor and advantage of it self, to have so decent and solemn a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>The second advantage mention'd in the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick is that of the Congregation's being put in mind of their Baptismal Vow, by hearing it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and it is not a small help to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a Promise to have frequent <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums</hi> of it. How readily, not to say how willingly, we forget our Vows of Obedience and new life, is but too obvious in our daily violations of them; and it is an act of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Charity in those who remind us of them. So that whoever with-holds his Child from the Publick Baptism, deprives the Congregation of a charitable office, which might perhaps have an influence on some or other there, in order to amendment and Salvation.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62403:11"/>
            <p>But besides these Reasons, there are others of no less weight and moment hinted in the Office of Publick Baptism of Infants, tho' not mention'd in the Rubrick; and those are,</p>
            <p>First, The veneration due to the Sacrament it self, as a main part of God's Holy Worship: And, Secondly, The just regard and deference due to the Churches, as places set apart and consecrated to his Service.</p>
            <p>That Baptism is a great and solemn part of God's Holy Worship, it is to be hoped, will not need much proof to any one who has had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and advantage to receive it. They who hold more Sacraments than Two, have yet allow'd in the title of the <note n="(i)" place="margin">Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum Janua.</note> Entrance and In-let to the rest. 'Tis that Sacred office wherein we solemnly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our selves to God: wherein we enlist our selves Souldiers under the Banner of our Saviour, and receive that <note n="(k)" place="margin">Tesseram Militarem.</note> Military Badge that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes us from his Enemies, and take those <note n="(l)" place="margin">Signa ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoria.</note> Oaths that oblige us to fight his Battels manfully.</p>
            <p>'Tis the solemn Celebration of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship wherein we express our esteem of it to be such, that we dare bid defiance to the Devil for its sake: that we renounce the Pomps and Glories of the World, and neglect the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Allurements of the Flesh, the gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Appetites and Inclinations to embrace
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62403:11"/>
it. 'Tis that Solemnity wherein we declare our unfeigned belief of, and assent to all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Christian Faith; and wherein we stipulate and vow to perform a ready and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience to all the commands of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And sure an Act of such general concern and universal benefit, an Act of so much piety and perfection, should be performed in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and religious manner: And Solemnity we know is never perfect but in publick; neither does Religion tend so much either to the Glory of God, or the Edification of our Brethren, when retir'd and private, as when conspicuous and eminent. Besides, if we consider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Sacrament of Baptism (the only Rule, according to an <note n="(m)" place="margin">Sher Rel. Assemblys. p. 291.</note> eminent Person in our Church) whereby to determine the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and circumstances of any Action, we shall find never to be performed properly but in publick, because it is of a publick nature, as it concerns the whole society of Christians; and therefore is as well to be done in the presende, as by the Authority of the Church, when the Celebration may be most publick and awful. For where can it be so but in the midst: of the great Congregation? The publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies for Religious Worship held by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church in places separated by

            <p>Now this Power being granted, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow, that what our Mother does so lawfully command, we must readily and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively obey; for in refusing, we sin as much against Heaven that has given this Commission to the Church, as against its Delegate, our grave and reverend Mother; and however we may arrogate to our selves the specious title of her Sons, are no longer worthy to be called so. For by our refractory and stubborn carriage, we destroy her Being as a Church, whence we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived our own as Christians. There is no Body can subsist without Oeconomy, nor Oeconomy without Subordination: For as there is variety of Offices to be performed, so there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parts and Agents adapted to the several Imployments and Operations; some for the Authoritative, and others for the Executive Part. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi>

('tis sure they should) be the more afraid to alienate the property, and sacrilegiously rob God of his interest to transfer it to another: And when they meet with any that were witnesses of their Dedication, they cannot without shame and confusion let them see how they have contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the good intentions of their Parents, broke all the Promises of their Sureties, and frustrated all the Prayers of the Congregation made in their behalf. The Third instance is in the Prayer of Consecration; where it is no small Argument to prevail for God's assent to the Petitions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in behalf of the Child to be regenerated, That he would regard the Supplications of his Congregation, and comply therewith in sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Water to the Mystical washing away of Sin, and in granting that the Child ready to be Baptiz'd therein, may receive the fullness of his Grace, and ever remain in the number of his Faithful and Elect Children.</p>
            <p>Where we see the Church has a great Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the prevalency of the Prayers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; esteeming its united force a kind of holy Violence, that does as it were wrest Blessings from the Almighty, as an ancient <note n="(l)" place="margin">Dionys. Areop. Lib. de Ecclesiast. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarch.</note> Author inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the design of the Assembly to intend: Telling us, That the whole Sacred Assembly is gathered to assist at, and celebrate the safety
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62403:14"/>
and deliverance of the Person Baptiz'd, and to return thanks for it to the Divine Beneficence.</p>
            <p>But still this Congregation whose Prayers are thought thus efficacious, must be such an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of which the Minister may safely and truly say, <hi>Thy Congregation</hi>; for there can be no vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in the Prayers of any but God's Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that is none of his, which is not As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in the place which the Church has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and by its Allowance and Authority. Now private Houses were never allow'd of by the Church, much less commanded to be the places of Publick Baptism; and they who so il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legally Assemble there, are as much guilty of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the Church, as they who meet in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited numbers or places, are of a Riot in the State.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Instance is the receiving the Child; when the Minister, having first named and Baptiz'd him, and still holding him in his Arms, uses these words, as it were of Matricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>We receive this Child into the Congregation of Christ's Flock,</hi> &amp;c. Which reception does not only mean the whole body of the universal Church, but as well that representative part thereof then present, and consenting to it as Proxy for the whole. And the Minister's Embracing the Child, is for the same end as the Imposition of Hands
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62403:15"/>
in Baptism was of old; which <note n="(m)" place="margin">Durant de ritib. Eccles. Cathol. lib. 1. cap. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Durantus</hi> tells us signified the Reconciliation, by which he that was without the Church, a Child of Wrath, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Catechism, was in the Church received into the Church's favour, and made a Child of Grace.</p>
            <p>And besides all this, our Church for farther prevention of the performance of this Publick Office in Private, has in cases of necessity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and injoyn'd a Private Form of Baptism, to be administred to those, who by reason of Sickness cannot be brought abroad without peril of their lives. Which we find by an antient <note n="(n)" place="margin">Concil. Vernense. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. 7. tent. 756.</note> Council to be an Indulgence, only on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of invincible necessity; and rather than such who cannot be safely brought to Church, should die Unbaptiz'd, they may have this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament administred to them at home; but this still with an injunction, that if they out-live their Sickness, as soon as they are fit to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad, they should be brought to <note n="(o)" place="margin">Rubr. <hi>in the Office of Private Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,</hi> &amp; Ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale Romanum, Ordo supplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diomissa super Baptisatum.</note> Church, that those Prayers and Rites which were before omitted in the Office, may be there publickly supplied: which is a most convincing Argument of the Church's sense in this matter, as well as of its determination; and should be sufficient of it self to oblige every genuine and obedient Son to acquiesce therein. But since, by sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62403:15"/>
we find many refractory and undutiful; the next and last thing will be to enquire into their Objections against this duty, or Pleas for not performing it.</p>
            <p>As for Objections against it, there are truly none; for to urge that St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, and the Apostles Baptiz'd their Converts every where, in Lakes, and Ponds, and Rivers, in Houses, Fields and Prisons, does not at all make against the administration of Baptism now in Churches only. For what they did then in the Infancy of the Church, was suited to its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and it was then impossible to have large Assemblies, and much more Churches for that purpose, till Christianity gain'd ground and obtain'd in the World; and to argue that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism ought not to be administred in Churches, because it was not so at first, is as ridiculous, and inconsequent, as 'twould be to say, That we should not live in Houses now, because 'tis known the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who were God's People, dwelt at first in Tents.</p>
            <p>For their not having Churches and Fonts for Baptism, was not because they were unfit, or unnecessary, but because they could not have them; as <note n="(p)" place="margin">Lib. 2. Angl. Histor. cap. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Beda</hi> says of the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> That in the beginning of Christianity there, where their Churches could not be so soon erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62403:16"/>
the People were generally Baptiz'd in Rivers; but we find that quickly discontinued, and Fonts provided for that purpose.</p>
            <p>To all which there needs only this be added, That <note n="(q)" place="margin">Terful. Carthag.</note> he who said every day was the Lord's, and every hour and time fit and convenient for Baptism, yet did not affirm the same hability of place; for he could not so well say of Place as of Time, If it is conducing to the Solemnity, it is insignificant as to the Grace conferr'd; for tho' it does not tend to the <hi>Esse,</hi> yet it does to the <hi>Bene esse</hi> of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>For it has been generally allowed, That God is more immediately present, upon general oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, in the places of his Publick Worship than elsewhere; his presence being there in St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>Sacratior &amp; commendatior:</hi> Who likewise affirms it to be a very convenient providence, that God should confer his Favours in that place where his Name is praised; and that Man should receive them there where he does praise it.</p>
            <p>But not to insist longer on this point, let us proceed to consider the other Reasons pretended for Baptising Children at home; or rather why their Parents are unwilling to bring them to the Church.</p>
            <p>And indeed, among the richer sort we find it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62403:16"/>
to be nothing but a piece of state. For if their Children, by reason of indisposition of Body, cannot be brought abroad, as some pretend, why are they not then contented to have the Private Office of Baptism administered to them, according to the direction and practice of the Church? which certainly they would desire, if that were the true or only reason. And if they think there is no significancy or virtue in the Ceremony of the Publick Office, why do they then so eardest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend to have it used in Private? By which they sufficiently discover, That not the indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of their Childrens Bodies, but of their own Minds makes them neglect the Church, celebrate a Sacrament at home, for which the Publick is the only proper place.</p>
            <p>That they ought not to be complied with herein is certain; because God is no respecter of persons: And tho' we find it sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to the Children of Kings, it was only on supposal of their having consecrated Chapels in their Palaces. And for all this, we find both Princes themselves and their Children Baptiz'd in the Church: Many examples whereof are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <note n="(r)" place="margin">De gestis Longobardor.</note>

               <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> tell her. And it would be happy if all Parents would weigh the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of having their Children early Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God, before wickedness can obtain a prepossession in them, against the seeming incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, which the tenderness of their Age may suffer.</p>
            <p>But that which is state and indulgence in the great, changes shape, and pretends to be shame in those of meaner rank and fortune; and they usually alledge their backwardness in bringing their Children to be Baptiz'd in the Church, to proceed from their inability to have things in <hi>decorum,</hi> as to their own Apparel, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the Company, as is usual. Or else that they would not be thought at so low an ebb as not to have wherewithal to gratifie the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62403:17"/>
Minister for his attendance; which by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of several of them appears to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived notion of their circumstances who bring their Children to Church to be Baptiz'd, as if they did it to save charges, since for that there are no Fees due. To answer the first there needs little else be said, than that the prodigality of some ought not to oblige others, nor be proposed for their imitation; much less be a reflection on them for avoiding it, than which nothing can more justifie their Prudence and Sobriety. That such Treats and Entertainments were disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the Church, we have the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of St. <note n="(w)" place="margin">Orat. in Sanct.

               <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi>; who thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his Auditory: <q>'Tis ill to say, where is the Gift that I shall offer for my Baptism? where are my new Cloths? where shall I have Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the Entertainment of my Gossips? Do not in a matter of such moment as that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, regard things so minute and trivial. Suffer not your self to be withdrawn from it by an affection so base and abject. This Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is above those things that lye within the prospect of the Eye: Make your self your Offering: put on Christ for a Garment, and nourish me with an honest and praise-worthy conversation. Thus I, thus God desires to be entertain'd. There is nothing in esteem with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62403:18"/>
God which is not in the power of a poor Man to bestow upon Him: That even in this, those of meaner fortune should not be discouraged, as not having wherewithal to vie with the great and wealthy. Indeed, in other things there is disparity between Riches and Poverty; but in this, he that is readiest and chearfullest, is still the richest and the most acceptable.</q>

            <p>There might several Councils be produced wherein to avoid Levity, and Intemperance <note n="(x)" place="margin">Concil. Colon. 2. cap. 15. Censora pro abus. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formand.</note> Baptism is forbid to be administered in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, but in case of extream danger; and where 'tis likewise forbid to make great Feasts and Banquets after it; which even in 1549. was censured as a Heathen Custom, and they that used it were termed <hi>parum Christiani</hi>; and wherein 'tis expresly said <note n="(y)" place="margin">Concil. Mogunt. 4. cap. 16.</note>, That a due reverence may be shewn to that great Mystery, it is earnestly advised, that Baptism may not be Administered in the Afternoon, when Men are charged with Wine and Delicacies; but in the Morning, in the time of Divine Service, and that with great Sobriety and Devotion: And 'tis there recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Civil Magistrate to suppress all Feasts and Banquets afterwards, or at least to reduce them to a moderation becoming Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. So that not to follow this ill fashion, is so far from being a disgrace to any one, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62403:18"/>
'tis as well our Prudence as our Duty to avoid it.</p>
            <p>Then for the other excuse, of being unwilling to be thought unable to pay the Minister, 'tis idle and impertinent: Because nothing can or ought to be demanded for the Administration of Baptism, according to the Rules of the Church. Nor should the Clergy accept of any Fees for Baptizing Children in Private Houses, since if it is any part of their Office or Duty, as in cases of necessity, they are both by Religion, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and express <note n="(z)" place="margin">Capit. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardi Archiep.

            <p>Tho' it has been objected to some, who argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Baptism of Infants with the Publick Office, to be Administred in the Church, and refused the Administration of it in Private Houses, but in great necessity, and then in the Private Form; that several good and eminent Divines were not so strict and scrupulous, but did often condescend, upon request, to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Baptism in the Publick Form in Private Houses, and to Children under no indisposition of body, and consequently no necessity to be Baptiz'd at home.<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62403:19"/>
            <p>made out, till there are more sufficient Reasons given on that side than there can be produced to the contrary: And it will be hardly found, that ever the Bishop was permitted to tolerate the Administration of Baptism in Private, unless in case of necessity; and then not in the Publick Form, but where there were <note n="(b)" place="margin">Concil. Constantinop. 3. Can. 3.</note> Oratories to do it. And if some eminent Divines transgress this Rule, that should be no Argument for others to follow them in an Error, any more than the Defects and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Men of Quality should be for their equals or inferiors to endeavour to resemble them. But their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken notice of, and urged so unhappily by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, should put them in mind of a speedy reformation. And that the People may not expect this compliance, nor the Clergy use them to it, let it be seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, That this Expectation has been still imputed to the pride and contemptuousness of the Laity; and their Compliance, to the flattery and obsequiousness of the Clergy. Let it be consider'd how great an <hi>indecorum</hi> it is to perform a Publick Office, that is of publick nature, in Private; and a Private Office in the Publick Form. Let the late date of this Custom in our Church be look'd into, and the occasions of it. It proceeded either from the scruples and disputes about Ceremonies, when to avoid them, those who were no lovers of them had their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Baptiz'd at home by such conscientious Conformists as could dispence with their Rule, says <note n="(c)" place="margin">Concil. Provin. Colon. cap. 7. de administrat. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Concil. Colon. 2. Decret. 15.</note> Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>; or else it ows its original to the fatal time of Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Impiety, when there was no King in our <hi>Israel</hi>; and when all God's solemn Worship was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted as Prophaneness: Then the Orthodox, who would not comply with that prevailing Schism, were forced to retire and perform those Acts in Private, which they could not be allow'd to do in Publick. And sure the very remembrance that this Use was introduced by such
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62403:19"/>
means, should make it odious and abominable to all who have the Honesty, the Loyalty, or the Religion to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the practice of those days. Then let us not contend for a custom begun on so unhappy an occasion: Let not that be our choice now, which was then the effect of Tyranny and Compulsion; but let us consider how great an affliction it was to the Sons of the Church to be denied the priviledge of performing that Office as well as others publickly; and how gladly they would have done it if permitted. And if even in these our days we were interdicted the Administration of Publick Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, and driven from the Church and the Congregation, how would we grieve and complain, what an injury and injustice should we think were offer'd us, and how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous would we be to injoy the benefit which now we slight? But if neither God's glory, nor our own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage quicken us in this Duty, let at least Emulation move us, that we may not be out-done by our Neighbours of the French and Dutch Congregations; whose zeal in this particular of bringing their Children to their Churches to be Baptiz'd, tho' at great distance from them, will rise in judgment against us for our neglect. No length of way, nor scarce any indisposition, can prevail with them in <hi>Scotland</hi> to keep their Children from the Church, but they carry them several Miles to be Baptiz'd, that it may be done in Publick; and they thought it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible favour when a Toleration was granted them for Private Baptism in case of great necessity. That it was usual heretofore for Mothers when they found their Children ill, to run with them to the Church that they might be Baptiz'd, we find by St. <note n="(d)" place="margin">Aug. in Psal. 51. enar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio.</note>

This then being so lovely, and of so good report, if there be any Virtue, if there be any Praise, if there be any Zeal for God's Glory, and the Edification of his Church, let us think thereon.</p>
            <p>To recommend which to the serious consideration of the People, that they may not persist in their unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able expectation of compliance from their Ministers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such Prohibitions, Obligations, and Engagements to the conorary, nor conceive a prejudice against them for refusing it; but that both of them may yield a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and chearful Obedience to the Church in performing its Commands, and celebrating the great and venerable Sacrament of Baptism with all due grandeur and solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is the whole design of this small Tract: which if it may conduce in any thing to the end intended, will by that success become a most ample and agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation to the Author.</p>
