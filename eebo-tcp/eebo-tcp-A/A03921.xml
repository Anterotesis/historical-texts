            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The first; for, I helde it my deutie, to certifie you of the notable abuses dayly committed by a great number of very bad fellowes, who vnder the couller of Office and seruice, doe mightely abuse both Iustice and Iustices: which in this Booke is largely discouered. The next; for, your Honor being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of certified, such bad fellowes shalbe the soner lookt into, and their outragies quallified: so that the soner by you, the like mischieues may be preuented. What I haue done, is in loue and Zeale: Both which, I doubt not, but they will excuse my boldnesse: And so the worke be acceptable in your good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I will not regarde the mallice of the threatning Cunny-catcher; who hath sworne, if I publish this Booke, they will do me what mischiefe they can. But how little I regarde their windie wordes, they may well perceiue by my proceedings: if this worke had beene worth a Talent, it should haue beene your <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

and if heereafter I shall be better able, your honor shall not faile, but finde me ready to do your honor seruice, euen to the vttermost of my power. Thus assuring my selfe safe shielded with your fauour, to whome I present this Booke, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you to take the full view of this Black Dogge of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, I humbly, and in all dutie, cease to be tedious: praying to the Almighty, to lengthen long your dayes, with encrease of all vertue and honor, and after this lyfe, to send you to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happinesse, and ioyes endlesse. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Readers, for my Repentance was so welcome, and so much the better because it was mine: in some parte to satisfie your courtesies, I thought it my part to present you with thankes, and more, with my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond labour: which albeit, it be both my especiall cost and trauell, yet it is yours: and so I may say, for you are willing to paye the prize of the Black Dogge of Newgate. Meruaile not Gentlemen, that you pay so deare for a Dogge, indeed a Curre: I wish you all well, and though three halfe-pence be a Dogs price, yet if you according to my Poesie, accept my Penne and Paper, it will counteruaile the charge of six pence. You haue knowne me better if you euer knew me, and neuer worse if you now know me: But for I haue read some bookes of Philosophie, I thought it best to be my selfe, not as I was, for I hope you are otherwise perswaded, but as I am, and so to liue or die. But for it is no better then the Blacke Dogge of Newgate: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you not to thinke your time ill bestowed in the reading, nor the prise great which you gaue for it. When you haue perused it, if you like it not, say the Dogge came from New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, hang him vp, and rend the Paper in peeces, and I will be your debter a worke of better acceptance, yet let me giue you to vnderstand by the way, that this Dogge, and many Dogs of his kinde, haue I knowne a great while, and if I had not had great occasion, I would neuer haue bestowed so much time <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

this Dogge nor any of his kinde to be as they haue beene, the murtherers and vtter vndooing at the least of an infinite number, to be shadowed by the name of Seruant at Newgate, at this time I thought good faithfully to giue you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that he who was euer able to keepe a good Dogge, and now to make choyse of his seruants in Newgate, did in my sight, thrust this Dogge by the head and shoulders out of Newgate, making choise of men insteed of Dogges: and more I dare say, neuer shall a Curre in shape of man commit the like abuses, during his time in Newgate. No more for the Dogge of Newgate, but for this Dogge of mine, wish me still well, I will neuer doe you ill, so to your content as I wish, I leaue you and me to my better content when God will.</p>

                  </hi>
               </note> I haue many times beene in hand with thee to giue me some notes vpon thy knowledge, as concerning the notable abuses committed by a sort of dissolute fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, who are in very deed the worste members in a common-wealth; I meane infamous cunnicatching knaues, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually seeke the spoile of others to inritch themselues, and now is the time thy helpe will do me some pleasure: for at the request of a very friend, I was mooued to write something of worth, wherevpon I made choise of the blacke Dog of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to be a subiect to write vpon, wherein I could not choose, diuers strong reasons especially moouing therevnto, but in that tytle shadow the knauerie, villanie, robberie, and Cunni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catching, committed daily by diuers, who in the name of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and office, were as it were attendants at Newgate. Againe I did choose to giue my booke that title, aswell to satisfie some who yet thinke there is some spirit about that prison in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a black Dog: of which fonde imagination to put them out of doubt, I thought good to giue them to vnderstand, that indeed there is no such matter. The third reason was, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Newgate a prisoner, and ouerthrowne by these kinde of
<pb facs="tcp:6511:14"/>
bad people with their cunnycatching, in most vile and wicked manner, in so much that whilest I there languished in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, I did both heare and see many outragious iniuries by them committed on diuerse sorts of people: the premisses consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I doe intreate thee to let me haue thy helpe to set downe some of their villanies committed in thy knowledge, and I will not be slack to present this booke, being finished, into their godly hands: who will assuredly giue them condigne punishment, as also prouide, that the like mischiefes shal neuer be any more put in practise by any notable villaines.</p>
            <p>Indeed you say well, and I agree: but yet you know I am a poore man, and am a Pisoner. Againe, it is ill medling with edge tooles. As you comprehend them in the name of a Dog: so if they be angrie, they will bite, and play the deuill in their like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. They haue parlous heads, store of money, and some good friends: all which I want. Neither will I name any: but if their knaueries were knowen, it would be thought the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes as fit for these Cunnycatchers, as Newgate is for mee, who am rather kept in to bribe them, then to answer any offence I haue committed: yet seeing you haue begun well, I would wish you end no worse: and for my part, tell you one of their knaueries, and Ile tell another: so that ere we haue done, if we tell all, the Cunny-catcher will thinke we haue tolde too much. But by your leaue a word, I wil name no man, for if they should be named, their friends would be angry: and more then that, I rather wish their amendment, then their publike infamie: of which motion if you like, begin when you will, and when you are weary rest you, and I will go on with it: for our matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all one, no doubt our conclusion will be to the like effect.</p>
            <p>Godly, wise, honorable, worshipful, &amp; gentle Reader, know first there be an infinite number of this sect and company of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny catchers, therfore it were an endlesse peece of worke to name them all: but for I know too many of them, and haue likewise <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aide for my acquaintance with them, it may be exspected I should name some of them, which for the inconuenience might thereby insue, I thought good to craue <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that
<pb facs="tcp:6511:14"/>
behalfe, assuring you, that they are easie enough to be knowne by their coullers: but what wicked parts they haue performed, I will not faile but make manifest. Therefore, first I desire you to imagine, that these fellowes, these Cunny catchers I would say, do promise to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world great matters: as for example. They will vndertake if a man be robd by the way, they will helpe the party offended to his money againe, or to the theeues at the least. Likewise, if a Purse be cut, a House broken, a peece of Plate stole, they will promise the like: mary, to further this good peece of seruice, they must haue a Warrant procured from some Iustice at the least, that by the sayd general Warrant, they may take vp all suspected persons: which being obteined, then marke how notably therewith they play the knaues, how shamefully they abuse the Iustices who graunted the Warrant, &amp; how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouslie they abuse a great sort of poore men, who neither the Warrant mentioneth, nor the partye agreeued in any wise thought to molest or trouble: and for they shadow all their villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vnder coullor of some especiall warrant, let it suffise thee to read the sequell, &amp; then iudge of their abuses, as they deserue.</p>
            <p>Now first will I begin with their petty practises in theyr lewd actions. Say there is a man or two robd by the high way not farre from London: the rumor heereof being bruted in the Citty, these fellowes will be sure to haue intelligence with the first, in what manner the men were robbed, how much money they lost, &amp; where they dwell: the reason is this, The Cunny-catchers haue alwayes abroad some odde fellowes which are inquisitors of purpose, who alwayes what they heare rumord, they presently come and certifie their good maisters Cunny-catchers, of all whatsoeuer, how, where, and when this robberie <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as committed: presently away goes <hi>F. H.</hi> or <hi>N. S.</hi> or some of that sect, and inquires out the partie that was robd: with whom, if <hi>H.</hi> or <hi>S.</hi> hap to meete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> withall, some occasion shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly be found to intrude themselues into the company of them be robbed: and after some circumstances, the Cunny catcher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to tell of a strange robbery committed in such a place, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was shamefully done: and withall, they will cast some
<pb facs="tcp:6511:15"/>
words a farre off, as who should say in effect: if I be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued I know the theeues, and it may be, that if I might speake with him or them that were robd, happily I should direct them how they might take the villaines.</p>
            <p>All this while the Cunnicatcher taketh no notice of them that were robbed, neyther doth the Cunnicatcher make any shew, that they knew any such matter to be done to any in the companie.</p>
            <p>Now the poore men that were robbed, hearing their smoth speaches, one of them begins very heauily to shape his tale in this, or such like manner. My honest friende, I know too well that such a robberie was done, and in very deede I was the man was robbed in such a place, and at such a time as you speake off. I beseech you good friende, stande me in what stead you may: and if you can helpe me againe to my money, or to take the Theeues, I will not onely thinke my selfe greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you, but I will also please you to your content. I am a poore man, I pray you do mee what pleasure you may, good sir, I beseech you. These and such like speaches he vseth.</p>
            <p>The Cunnicatcher presently ioyneth ishues with him, and with much cunnyng he tempereth his talke. To be short, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth all the pleasure he can do him: but quoth he, you know I am a stranger vnto you, and I know not whether you will vse mee well or no: It may be, when I haue done you good, you will lyghtly rewarde mee. But Ile tell you what Ile do: Giue mee but fourtie shillinges in hand to beare my charges the time I may search for them, and yf I do not deserue it, I will restore it agayne, and loose all my laboure: yf you lyke of this motion, so it is: yf not, I will not deale in your matter hot nor colde.</p>
            <p>When the man that was robbed, heareth him so briefe, yet loth to part company on the suddaine: he intreateth to know the Cunnicatchers name, and where he dwelleth. To this question, an other of the Cunnicatchers companions maketh this reply.</p>
            <p>Honest man, you neede not doubt of his good meanyng to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes you: This is such a one as may do you pleasure, yf he
<pb facs="tcp:6511:15"/>
please to vndertake it. Then he roundeth the man in the eare, and telleth him his name is <hi>E. H.</hi> and that he knoweth all the Theeues about London, and that he hath done more good in helping men to their owne, then can be deuised to be done by a hundred others, praysing him for a wonderfull good member in a Common wealth: further certifying the partie where this <hi>E. H.</hi> dwelleth, and with an oth whispering, he wysheth him to giue him some .xx. s. and then agree what he shall giue him more when the Theeues be taken, making many protestations, that he neede not to misdoubt of <hi>E. H.</hi> his honest dealing with him in any respect.</p>
            <p>Presently the poore man putteth his hand into his pocket, and out he puls an Angell: then saith he; M. <hi>H.</hi> I haue heard of you before, and for I haue heard nothing but well of you, I am the willinger to deale with you: truly here is an angell for you, and I will giue you a gallon of Wine at the Tauerne, and if you doe me good in this matter, I will giue you xx. s. more: then with some intreatie, he desireth him to take it in good part, and so giueth him the money.</p>
            <p>The Cunny-catcher taketh the money verye quaintly, as though he would refuse it, but in the end he pockets it vp, and is willing to go to the Tauerne, where after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> drinking a gallon or two of Wine, they conclude of the former matter: and <hi>E. H.</hi> will out of hand get the theeues into Newgate, and so much he promiseth to perfome vpon his honest fidelitie, not letting to say, if he do it not, he dare be hanged for it.</p>
            <p>Then the day is appointed, when within a weeke the partie robbed shall come to Newgate to know what newes, and for that time they part, the honest man to his home or about his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, the Cunny-catchers to some other odde place about <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir knauerie, where they laugh at the Cunny, deuising how to get him in for more money, neuer intending to do any thing in the matter, which they haue vndertaken for the honest man, whose angell they drinke merrily.</p>
            <p>Nowe we will leaue this man for a while to his busines of more profit, and I will proceede with the Cunny-catchers for
<pb facs="tcp:6511:16"/>
their practises.</p>
            <p>These Cunnicatchers are neuer idle: and therefore it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth next, to let you vnderstand of a notable peece of seruice the sayd <hi>H.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> playde with a friende of mine.</p>
            <p>It happened my friende being some time in question, could not misse but he must needes haue acquaintance with these odde shauers: and thus it fell out. My friend being in a Tauerne drinking with some of his acquaintance, whilst they were drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, in comes <hi>H. S.</hi> who presently vsed great courtesie to my friend: but to be short, they tooke full suruey of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, his good cloake, and neate apparrell, which was enough for them to imagine that my friend had store of money: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they asked if he would giue them a pottle of Wine? which he willingly granted: and so after one pottle, he gaue them another: the reckoning payde, and the company ready to depart, quoth <hi>S.</hi> to <hi>E. H.</hi> I pray you hearke in your eare.</p>
            <p>Presently he whispereth. Thus it is, my fellow hath a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to take you: therefore in kindnesse I wish you to drawe to your pursse, and giue him an Angell to drinke, and I wil vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take he shall not see you at this time.</p>
            <p>My friend hearing his tale tend to a Cunny-catching effect, he begins to sweare they are Cunny-catching knaues, and they shall not wrong him in any respect.</p>
            <p>To be short, the Cunny-catcher sends for a Constable, and charges the party aforesaid with fellony: the Constable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be in office (but not to be such bad fellowes) he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently apprehendeth the party: which done, the Cunny-catchers seeing the prisoner in safe keeping, disfurnished of his weapons, they presently require the prisoner of the Constable, and they will be his discharge: which the Constable did, thinking no lesse then they were right honest men.</p>
            <p>Now marke what followed. As these two knaues were a bringing this party charged with fellony to Newgate, one of them offereth for xx. s. to set him free: of which, when the party had considered, knowing though he were cleare of that he was charged, yet if he lay in Prison till the Sessions, it would
<pb facs="tcp:6511:16"/>
be greater charges. When he was on Newgate stayres redy to go into the Gayle, he was content to leaue his cloake, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he had in his pursse, and his weapons which were in the Constables hand pawne for the xx. s. which the Cunny-cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers tooke, and discharged the prisoner without any more to doe.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the aforesaid Cunny-catchers meete with this their Cunny of xx. s. price, and an other who was knowne to bee as they terme him a good fellow about the towne in his companie.</p>
            <p>And where meete they, but in a Tauerne not farre without Bishops gate, where these two poore Cunnies had spoken for supper: amiddest their good cheere, in comes <hi>H.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> bidding them be merry with their fare. One of these two being an odde fellow and in dread of these Cunny-catchers, knowing them very perfectly set on the best face he could, and bad them wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, intreating them to sit downe, and doe as they did, of which proffer the Cunny-catchers accepted willingly, and sate downe with them and eate and drunke merrily: supper being ended, the reckoning was cald for, the shot paide, and althings discharged, the Cunnies would faine haue beene gone.</p>
            <p>Nay quoth <hi>N. S.</hi> for of the two he was the grimmer knaue and had most skill to talke, I must let you know that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am sorry to doe. Yet if you will doe your selues good you may vse vs well, and we will not vse you amisse, to be short, thus it is, such a man was robd within this weeke, and he hath got out a warrant for you two by name. Hee hath lost ten pounds: now if you will restore the money, and bestowe xx. s. on vs two to drinke for our paines, we will vndertake to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atisfie the partie and be your discharge, if not, we haue a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant, and you must answer it at Newgate.</p>
            <p>This back reckoning is something sharpe, but there is no remedy, either pay so much money, or else must a Constable be sent for, and so to Newgate as round as a hoope.</p>
            <p>To be shorte, this was the conclusion, the Cunnyes paide downe xi.l. euery penny, whereof ten pound was to be paide
<pb facs="tcp:6511:17"/>
to the man in the moone, for I dare take it vpon my death nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these Cunnies did offend any such man, in manner as these knaues had charged them.</p>

               </note>Well then to the first Cunny againe at his time appointed, he commeth to the wise man of Newgate to inquire what is done in his matter, and at Newgate the Cunny findeth his odde acquaintance with <hi>E. H.</hi> who at the first sight hath the time of the day for him, much curtesies, but to the tauerne they must to debate the matter, where they must haue a pottle of the best. Whilest the Wine is a filling, the Cunny-catcher sheweth what great paine he hath taken to come by the theeues, and how hardly they mist of them: but for it is best to vse few wordes, the Cunny-catcher from one day to an other still driueth off the Cunny, who is still in hope that the Cunny-catcher meaneth good faith, whereas indeed he neuer made accoumpt what faith was: so to be short, if the theeues robd him of some fiue or sixe pound, he hath got or he finde where he is, a drie shauing as much as forty or fiftie shillings more.</p>
            <p>I tell thee <hi>Zawny</hi> me thinkes these are notable vyllanies, &amp; pittie they should not be punished, who liue by no other meanes but practising such prankes as these be.</p>
            <p>Againe this is a generall rule to the Cunny-catcher, that when or where he meetes with such a one as hath beene at any time committed to Newgate, if that fellow haue good appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell on his back, the Cunny-catcher taketh acquaintance of him and a quarte of Wine they must needes drinke, when the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comes to paiment, the Cunny-catcher hath brought no money from home that day, so by the others drawing of his pursse to pay for the wine, he knoweth what lyning is in it, then if he haue money, the Cunny-catcher is in hand with him for a bribe, some odde crowne or an Angell to drinke: if the man
<pb facs="tcp:6511:17"/>
be in any fault, fearing the worst, he will not stand with him for a tryfle: if he be in no fault, perhaps he tels, in fayth you are deceiued in me, I am not he you take me for, and so parteth and giueth him nothing.</p>
            <p>Presently the Cunny-catcher vseth all meanes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o knowe where he lyes, which when he hath done, within a night or two away goes this knaue with some olde warrant to the Constable of that liberty, crauing his ayde to apprehend a bad fellow who is thought to haue done much mischiefe, but for a suertye he auoucheth him for an arrand theefe, and that he hath beene in Newgate. Upon these speeches the Constable goes with this <hi>H.</hi> where the poore man lyes, and apprehends him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaies him to Newgate, laying some Iustices commaundement on him, where he lyes till the sessions, vnlesse he come of round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with a bribe to the Connycatcher: but say the Connycatcher be mistaken in this fellowes pursse, &amp; that he haue not so much as he supposed, yet the Connycatcher is so strong of faith, that he will not beleeue the contrary: so by this meanes the poore man lyeth in prison till he be quite a beggar, without releas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till the proclamation at the Sessions, at which time he is not worth the ground he goes on, neither knoweth he, being vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerthrowne how to haue any remedy: which is pittifull and lamentable.</p>

haue his due of these knaues, and I holde it my duty to reueale whatsoeuer is to the good of a common-wealth; and so I will, though the Cunnycatcher sweare to giue me a cut in the legge for my labour, and now <hi>Zawny</hi> I pray thee go forward.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, though I want eloquence, yet you shall see I haue a rowling toung, deepe knowledge, and am a rare fellow to bewray many matters touching Cunny-catching.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Greene</hi> God be with thee, for if thou hadst beene a liue, knowing what I know, thou wouldst as well haue made worke as matter, but for my part I am a plaine fellow, and what I know I will not be meale mouthed, but blab I wist, and out it must: nay and out it shall, for as the Comedian sayd: <hi>Plenus rymarum sum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know twenty and twenty of these fine Cunny-catchers, who learne of the fencers to double a blow, knowing what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the button, and the bob: yet for the Author hath onely vsed foure letters for two names, let them stand, and when I name <hi>E.</hi> he must thinke <hi>Zawny</hi> can see whilst there is an eye in his head. <hi>H.</hi> is <hi>aspirationis nota,</hi> and no letter indeed, therefore I care not if this Cunny-catching <hi>H.</hi> were wypte out of the letters rowe to hang on the Gallowes, who is fitter to be a sipher to make vp a number at Tyborne, then to be a man of so bad condition. As for a pottle of Wine he cares not who he hangd so he may haue it, if it be but the Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N.</hi> is the first of the second name the Author vseth. No knaue I warrant you: and as for <hi>S.</hi> if he be in some sorte a knaue to be prooued? he will be contented, nay he must in spight of his teeth disgest the name of a Cunnycatcher, for by that arte being not worth one groate a yeare, he is able by his fine wit to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne himselfe in his Sattin dublet, Ueluet hose, his Hatt lynde with Ueluet, his silke stock, his Rapter and Dagger gilt, his goulden brouche, and all things correspondent as might seeme a man both of witte and liuing. And now I, according to my promise to the Author, will haue a cast at these fine Cunny-catchers, and I will not slaunder them in any wise, but speake the trueth vnto death. If I say more then I will prooue,
<pb facs="tcp:6511:18"/>
I will neuer byd you trust <hi>Zawny</hi> againe.</p>
            <p>Not long since, at a Tylting vpon triumph on the Crowna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion day: many good subiects with ioy assembled the place of Triumph, as well reioycing to see the Queenes most excellent Maiestie, as also to see the Tylting performed, by sundry noble and right honorable personages.</p>
            <p>Amongst the rest, there comes a woman with sixe pounds in her purse, which the Cutpursse met withall, she as it seemed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more minde on the pleasures of the present day and time, then she had of hir pursse.</p>
            <p>The Iousts ended for that day, the woman thinking all had beene well, takes her way homewarde with a friend of hirs, yet by the way, this good woman must needs drinke with her friend a pinte of Wine: but heere was the mischiefe, when the Wine was to be payde for, the woman mist her pursse, and looking on the strings, with a colde heart she might perceiue hir pursse was cut away.</p>
            <p>Hir friend to comfort hir, bad hir take no thought, for he knew a man would helpe hir to hir pursse againe, and saith he, we will presently go to him, for I know where he dwels.</p>
            <p>The woman thanked hir friend for his courteous offer, and away they go to <hi>E. H.</hi> his house, where they found him, to whom they brake the matter wholy how it was, desiring his helpe. Presently he had them in the winde, and had them wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, promising that if they would content him for his paynes he would doe hir good, asking hir what she would willingly bestowe to haue hir money againe: at the first worde she offered him fortie shillings. All this was well, and they agree to meet <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he next day about White hall, where they shall haue answer to <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eir content: and so after they had drunke a quarte of Wine at the Tauerne, for that night they parted.</p>
            <p>The next day, according to promise they met, and this <hi>E H.</hi> had in his company a man, who he sayd was a Constable, but whether he sayd truely or no I wyll not say, but to the matter: They appoint the woman to go to a friends house hard by, and she should heare more anon. Away went she, as they had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:6511:19"/>
hir, and away go they to looke for Cutpurses.</p>
            <p>I warrant you they sought not long, but heere they met with a Cutpurse, whom they take by the sleeue: and there they meete with an other as good a cutpurse as the former, and so they take at the least a dosen Cutpurses: which when they haue done, the Cunnicatcher begins to rayle mightely, swearing they shall some of them be hanged: but to Prison they shall all go, vnles this money be had agayne, shewing a Warrant, or a peece of paper at the least: which is sufficient to beare the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatcher harmeles, as he sayeth.</p>
            <p>Now the Cutpurses, though they be all cleere of this matter, yet they begin to quake for feare, offering rather then they will goe to Prison, they will make vp the money, so that <hi>E. H.</hi> will promise to giue it them againe when the cutpurse shalbe kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, who cut the purse in deede. This motion the Cunnicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher liketh indifferently: and so of these dosen of cutpurses, he taketh of some more, and of some lesse, that the summe is largely made vp: which done, they are all discharged, mary they must haue some twentye shillings ouerplus for their paynes and kindnesse shewed to the cutpurses, all which is graunted.</p>
            <p>To be shorte, no Cutpursse scapte their handes, but he paide a share, so that there was gathered the first day at the least ten pounds amongst Cutpurses, and the next day this <hi>E. H.</hi> mette with the Cutpursse, who cut the pursse indeed, of whome he tooke the money, with the vantage, and let hym goe, without answering the matter: and to conclude, the woman had foure pound of hir money againe, and so the matter was no more spoken of.</p>
            <p>I thinke this was a peece of knauery, if you talke of kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, and yet this is no knauerye in respect of that I will shewe you in this next discouerie of their Cunny-catching.</p>
            <p>At the Tearme time, these fellowes, <hi>H.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> haue had great booties by their practises in this arte, and this is their manner.</p>
            <p>In the morning away they goe to Westminster hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where
<pb facs="tcp:6511:19"/>
they know the Cutpursse wyll be about his businesse, but the Cunny-catchers are not without a couple, who are their consorts: who assoone as they come to the Hall, thrust in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the thickest, and there they listen to heare if any pursse were cut that day.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the Cunny-catchers, they take their standings, one of them at the Water side, the other in some close place, at an other gate: so that lightlye a Cutpursse cannot come out of the Hall, but one of them shall spye him, and take him by the sleeue, if the Cutpursse haue done any thing, worde is presently brought to the Tauerne, whether the Cunny and the Cunny-catcher are gone to drinke. Nowe if it be some small summe, the Cunny-catcher sheweth the Cunny a good countenance, but if it be a large summe, as sixe pounds, or vpwardes, the Cunny-catcher dissembling his intent, wyll not stay but the drinking a pottle of Wine.</p>
            <p>The Cutpursse intreats their company, and offereth both Wine and a breakefast, but all is in vayne, the Cunny-catcher wyll not carry, swearing a great oathe, hee is sorrye that it was his chaunse to see this Cunny or Cutpursse this day, for there is a mischiefe doone, and hee feares some wyll smoake for it. At this the Cutpursse is afearde, but hee for that tyme scapeth their fyngers, for the Cunny-catcher wyll car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie no longer.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Cunny-catcher sendeth presentlye one of his company to seeke out the partye who had his pursse cutte, which he performeth with dilligence, and meeting with him, he tels the partye that hee heard hee lost his pursse at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, and if he wyll be aduised by him, he wyll helpe him to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he most of his money againe.</p>
            <p>This honest man glad to haue parte againe of his mony, offereth at the first worde, the one halfe to haue the other, assuring this odde fellowe for certaintye, that hee lost tenne pounds.</p>
            <p>Well (saith this Factor for the Cunnycatcher) if your leasure wyll serue to goe with me, I wyll bring you to one
<pb facs="tcp:6511:20"/>
dooth partly knowe who cut your pursse, therefore it is your waye to followe his counsayle, and I warrant you, my life for it, but you shall haue your desire.</p>
            <p>Heereat the honest man is glad, and willyngly goeth along with him to a place where he knoweth <hi>E. H.</hi> abideth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: Now being met, the Wise man of Newgate begins at the first dash, to tell them whereabout they come, euen in as ample manner, as if the man who had his pursse cut, had tolde the tale himselfe.</p>
            <p>No meruaile though the Countrey man doe wonder a while at the matter, but in the end, he telleth him it is so indeed, and according to the first motion they agree, which is the one halfe for the other: the Countryman willing to referre the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wholy to this Cunny-catchers discretion.</p>
            <p>Then away goes the Countreyman with <hi>H.</hi> the Cunny-catcher, to a Iustice, to whome he signifieth in euery respect, how his pursse was cut, desiring of the Iustice a warrant to take vp all suspected persons: of which motion the Iustice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to do Iustice, graunts his warrant, and giues it to <hi>H.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ling him to certifie him what shall be done on that behalfe, as the Warrant intendeth.</p>
            <p>This Warrant obteined, the Cunnycatcher is as pleasant as a Pye, taking his leaue of the Iustice, away goes the Countryman and his good friends with him, and to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne straight, where they spend some time in drinking a pottle of the best Wine, which the Countryman must pay for: which done, <hi>H.</hi> taketh his leaue of his clyent, promising him not to be slacke in his businesse, which done, they part; the Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to his lodging or as his occasion serueth, and the Cunny-catcher about his facultie.</p>
            <p>Now woe to the Cutpursses, for as <hi>H.</hi> happeneth to meet with them, they must to Newgate, shewing Warrant suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a greater matter.</p>
            <p>But you must take notice, that of a dozen or sixteene Cutpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses who he hath apprehended, he is sure enough that he whith cut the pursse indeed shall be none of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6511:20"/>This honest company of Cutpursses being all in Newgate, <hi>H.</hi> goes presently and certifies the Iustice, what a sort of nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Theeues he hath taken, desiring the Iustice to sende for them at his pleasure, to examine them about the Country mans Pursse, assuring the Iustice that they are cunning Theeues, and that he dare lay his lyfe, they will confesse nothing: which in deede the Iustice findeth true; for, they being examined, will confesse as much as neare a whit.</p>
            <p>To Newgate away they goe againe, where they make all meanes to <hi>H.</hi> to stande their friende, shewing their innocencie: yet rather then they will lie in Prison, one offereth ten shyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, an other twentie shyllinges, some more some lesse, as they are of abilitie: offering farther, to giue besides the summe, euery one something to <hi>H.</hi> for his good worde to the Iustice, that they may be set at libertie.</p>
            <p>Now the Cunni-catcher hath the matter as he would wysh it, and taking their money first, he presently goes to the Iustice and cirtifieth him, that these which he hath apprehended, did none of them cut the Pursse: and for he hath gotten knowledg who did, he desireth that they may be bayled.</p>
            <p>The Iustice glad to heare the trueth is knowen, is willing to set them at libertie; which vpon their bayle he graunteth. Of this money the Countrey man hath neuer a penny, and all these Cutpursses are set at libertie.</p>
            <p>Which done, <hi>H</hi> seeketh diligently for the Cutpursse, who did the matter in deede: with whom when he meeteth, he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to tell him how sore the Iustice is against him, and now earnestly the Countrey man will pursue the Law: and further he sweareth, that some of them who were in Newgate <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Iustice playnely, that he cut the Pursse.</p>
            <p>This peale ringes nothing well in the Cutpursses eares, who can finde no fauour, but to Newgate: yet vpon intreatie made by the Cutpursse, the Cunni-catcher promiseth, that for his part he will do him any good he can, wishing the Cutpursse, as he is wise enough, so it were good for him to hold his owne, and confesse nothing to the Iustice, what profe soeuer come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:6511:21"/>
him, and in so doing, it may lie in his power to do him good; telling him further, that the man who lost the money, though he be sore bent against him, yet he will partly be rewled by him.</p>
            <p>Well, to Newgate marcheth this <hi>H.</hi> with his Cutpursse: where he to welcome him for all his fayre wordes, he clappeth on his legges a good payre of Boultes and Shakels: which done, he sendeth for the Countrey man, and telleth him of these good tydinges, how the Theefe is taken, and how he hath vsed him.</p>
            <p>The next way they take, is to the Iustice, to whom <hi>H.</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth how the case standeth, rayling mightely against the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pursse, euen in the worst maner he can deuise: saying, it will be euidently proued that he cut the Purse, and none but he: further he requesteth, that the Cutpursse may be examined. The Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pursse is sent for, who to euery question the Iustice can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, hauing taken out his lesson (Confesse and be hanged) hath his answere ready, so that there can be no aduantage ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by his examination.</p>
            <p>The Iustice returneth him to Newgate againe to abyde till the next Sessions, requiring the partie to be bound to giue eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against him: but the Countrey man dwelling farre from London, and it being long to the next Law day, alleadgeth, he can not be in the Citie at that time, for he is a poore man, and hath great occasion of busines, so that he cannot be there to giue euidence, neyther can he say, yf he would, any thing against that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>artie: for so farre as he can remember, he neuer saw that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low before in his lyfe.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>H.</hi> promiseth, that it wilbe prooued against the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pursse: so the Countrey man and <hi>H.</hi> take their leaues of Iustice, making shew as though they woulde come again<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> though it be no part of <hi>H.</hi> his meanyng.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>H.</hi> goeth straight to Newgate, where he falles in hand with the Cutpursse, swearing vnto him by his honestie, that he hath laboured the partie who had his Pursse cut, to take his money againe, and not to giue euidence against him, answering
<pb facs="tcp:6511:21"/>
him with many othes, that yf he may haue his money againe, he will presently goe out of the towne. The Cutpursse taking <hi>H.</hi> his hand, that no man shall giue euidence against him at the Sessions, doth presently send abrode to his friendes for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: which as soone as it commeth, he deliuereth to <hi>H.</hi> and withall a large ouerplus, because he will be suer of <hi>H.</hi> his fauour.</p>
            <p>This done, <hi>H.</hi> goes to the Countrey man, and tels him he got no more but sixe or seuen pound, of which if he will accept, and proceede no further against the partie, he hath it to pay him: mary he will not be knowen to the Countrey man, but that he had that money of some friendes of the Cutpursses, who vpon the former condition, is willing it should be payde, yf not, to haue his money agayne.</p>
            <p>The Countrey man hauing haste out of the Citie, is glad to take it: out of which summe, if it be seauen poundes, <hi>H.</hi> must haue halfe: so that the poore man of ten poundes, hath but three pound ten shillinges, whereas the Cunni-catcher by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt hath got at one hand and an other, very neare fourtie Marke: the money sharde, the Countrey man takes Horse, and away he rides: Againe, <hi>H.</hi> his mouth is stopt, and the next Sessions the Cutpursse is quit by Proclamation, no man being there to giue euidence against him.</p>
