            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>YOV that are freed from the Slavery of a corrupt Education; and that in spite of human Precepts, Examples and Presidents, can hearken to the Dictates of Scripture and Reason:</p>
                  <p>For your sakes I am content, that these Collections of mine, as also my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents should be exposed to publick view; In hopes that having well considered, and compared them with Scripture, you will see reason, as I do, to question a belief so prevalent (as that here treated of) as also the practice flowing from thence; they standing as nearly connext as cause and effect; it being found wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, to extirpate the latter without first curing the former.</p>
                  <p>And if the Buffoon or Satyrical will be exercising their Talents, or if the Biggots wilfully and blindly reject the Testimonies of their own Reason, and more sure word, it is no more than what I expected from them.</p>
                  <p>But you Gentlemen, I doubt not are willing to Distinguish between Truth and Error, and if this may be any furtherance to you herein, I shall not miss my Aim.</p>
                  <p>But if you find the contrary, and that my belief herein is any way Heterodox. I shall be thankful for the Information to any Learned or Reverend Person, or others, that shall take that pains to inform me better by Scripture, or sound Reason, which is what I have been long seeking for in this Country <hi>in vain.</hi>

                  <p>In a time when not only <hi>England</hi> in particular, but almost all <hi>Europe</hi> had been labouring against the Vsurpations of Tyranny and Slavery, The <hi>English, America,</hi> has not been behind in a share in the Common calamities; more especially <hi>New-England,</hi> has met not only with such calamities as are common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that they have bewitched some even so far, as to make them self destroyers, and others in many Towns, here and there languish'd under their Evil hands. The People thus Afflicted miserably scratch'd and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and that the same Invisible Furies did stick Pins in them, and scal'd them, distort and disjoint them, with a Thousand other Plagues: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drag them out of their Chambers, and carry them over Trees, and Hills Miles together, many of them being tempted to Sign the Devils Laws.</hi>

                  <p>Or whether a Zeal governed by blindness and passion, and led by president, has not herein precipitated us into far greater wickedness (if not Witchcrafts) than any have been yet proved against those that suffered;</p>
                  <p>To be able to distinguish aright in this matter, to which of those two to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Miseries is the present W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>k. As to the former, I know of no sober Man, much less Reverend Christian, that being ask'd dares affirm and abide by it, that Witches have that power; <hi>viz.</hi> to Commissionate Devils to kill and destroy. And as to the latter, it were well if there were not too much of truth in it, which remains to be demonstrated.</p>
                  <p>But here it will be said, what need of Raking in the Goals that lay buried in Oblivion. We cannot recall those to Life again that have suffered, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it were unjustly; it tends but to the exposing the Actors, as if they had proceeded irregularly.</p>
                  <p>Truly I take this to be just as the Devil would have it, so much to fear dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging men, as not to endeavour to detect his Wiles, that so be may the sooner, and with the greater Advantages set the same on foot again (either here or else where) so dragging as through the Pond twice by the same Cat. And if Reports do not (herein) deceive us, much the same has been acting this present Year in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And what Kingdom or Country is it, that has not had their bloody sits and turns at it. And if this is such a catching disease, and so universal, I presume I need make no Apology for my Endeavours to prevent, as far as in my power, any more such bloody Victims or Sacrifices; tho indeed I had rather any other would have undertaken so offensive, tho necessary a task; yet all things weighed, I had rather thus Expose my self to Censure, than that it should be wholly omitted. Were the notions in question, innocent and harmless, respecting the Glory of God, and well being of Man, I should not have engaged in them, but finding them in my esteem, so intollerably destructive of both. This together with my being by Warrant called before the Iustices, in my own Iust Vindication, I took it to be a call from God, to my Power, to Vindicate his Truths, against the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> Assertions, which are so prevalent; for tho Christians in general do own the Scriptures to be their only Rule of Faith and Doctrine, yet these Notions will tell us, that the Scriptures have not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, nor at all described the crime of Witchcraft, whereby the culpable might be detected, tho it be positive in the Command to punish it by Death; hence the World has been from time to time perplext in the prosecution of the several Diabolical mediums of Heathenish and Popish Invention, to detect an Imaginary Crime (not but that there are Witches, such as the Law of God
<pb facs="tcp:49354:5"/>
describes) which has produced a deluge of Blood; hereby rendering the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God not only void but dangerous.</p>
                  <p>So also they own Gods Providence and Government of the World, and that Tempests and Storms, Afflictions and Diseases are of his sending; yet these Notions tell us, that the Devil has the power of all these, and can perform them when commission'd by a Witch thereto, and that he has a power at the Witches call to act and do, without and against the course of Nature, and all natural causes, in afflicting and killing of Innocents; and this is that so many have died for.</p>
                  <p>Also it is generally believed, that if any Man has strength, it is from God the Almighty being: But these notions will tell us, that the Devil can make one Man as strong as many, which was one of the best proofs, as it was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, against Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> the Minister; tho his contemporaries in the Schools during his Minority could have testified, that his strength was then as much superiour to theirs as ever (setting aside incredible Romances) it was discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be since. Thus rendring the power of God, and his providence of none Effect.</p>
                  <p>These are some of the destructive notions of this Age, and however the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of them seem sometimes to value themselves much upon sheltring their Neighbours from Spectral Accusations. They may deserve as much thanks as that Tyrant, that having industriously obtained an unintelligible charge against his Subjects, in matters wherein it was impossible they should be Guilty, having thereby their lives in his power, yet suffers them of his meer Grace to live, and will be call'd gracious Lord.</p>
                  <p>It were too <hi>Icarian</hi> a task for one unfurnish'd with necessary learning, and Library, to give any Iust account, from whence so great delusions have sprung, and so long continued. Yet as an Essay from those scraps of reading that I have had opportunity of; it will be no great venture to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l siastical History, does acknowledge to be by the singular Providence of God; Christians having then begun to degenerate from the Gospel, and to betake themselves to Heathenish learning. And in the <hi>Mercury</hi> for the Month of <hi>February,</hi> 1695, there is this Account [<hi>That the Christian Doctors conversing much with the writings of the</hi> Heathen <hi>for the gaining of Eloquence. A Counsel was held at</hi> Carthage, <hi>which forbad the reading of the Books of the</hi> Gentiles.]</p>
                  <p>From all which it may be easily perceived, that in the Primitive times of Christianity, when not only many Heathen of the Vulgar; but also many learn'd Men and Philosophers had imbraced the Christian Faith; they still retained a love to their Heathen-learning, owhich as one observes being transplanted into a Christian Soil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, soon proved productive of pernicious Weeds, which over-ran the face of the Church, hence it was so deformed as the Reformation found it.</p>
                  <p>Among other peruicious Weeds arising from this Root, the Doctrine of the power of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and Witchcraft as it is now, and long has been understood, is not the least; the Fables of <hi>Homer, Virgil, Horace</hi> and <hi>Ovid, &amp;c.</hi> being for the Elegancy of their Language retained then (and so are to this Day) in the Schools; have not only introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but established such Doctrines to the poisoning the Christian World. A certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Expresses it thus [that as the Christian Schools at first brought Men from Heathenism to the Gospel, so these Schools carry Men from the Gospel to Heathenism, as to their great prfection] and Mr. <hi>I.M.</hi> in his <hi>Remarkable Providences,</hi> gives an account that (as he calls it) an Old Counsel did Anathematize all those that believed such power of the Devils, accounting it a Damnable Doctrine. But as other Evils did afterwards increase in the Church (partly by such Education) so this insensibly grew up with them, tho not to that degree, as that any Counsel I have ever heard or Read of, has to this day taken off those <hi>Anathema</hi>'s; yet after this the Church so far declined, that Witchcraft became a Principal, Ecclesiastical Engine (as also that of Heresie was) to root up all that stood in their way; and besides the ways of Tryal that we have still in practice, they invented some, which were peculiar to themselves; which when ever they were minded to improve against any Orthodox believer, they could easily make Effectual: That Deluge of Blood which that <hi>Scarlet Whore</hi> has to answer for, shed under this notion, how amazing is it.</p>
                  <p>The first in <hi>England</hi> that I have read of, of any note since the Reformation, that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts this Doctrine, is the famous Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> he (as also Mr. <hi>Gaul,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bernard, &amp;c.</hi> seems all of them to have undertaken one Task, they) taking notice of the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of irregular ways to try them by, invented by Heathen and Papists, made it their business and main work herein to oppose such as they saw to be pernicious. And if they did not look more narrowly into it, but followed the first, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> whose Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (as theirs also) had forestall'd him into such belief, whom they readily followed; it cannot be wondered at: And that they were men liable to Err, and so not to be trusted to as perfect guides, will manifestly appear to him that shall see their several receits laid down to detect them by ther Presumptive and Positive ones. And consider how few of either have any foundation in Scripture or Reason; and how vastly they differ from each other in both, each having his Art by himself, which Forty or an Hundred more may as well imitate, and give theirs, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> being without all manner of proof.</p>

Besides this, when her attendants had left her without so much as one pin about her, that so they might prevent some fear'd inconveniencies; yet she would ever now and then be miserably hurt with Pins which were found stuck into her Neck, Back and Arms, however, the Wounds made by the Pins would in a few minutes ordinarily be cured; she would also be strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distorted in her Joynts, and thrown into such exorbitant <hi>Convulsions</hi> as

I will not here inquire of our <hi>Siduces,</hi> what sort of Distemper 'tis shall stick the Body full of <hi>Pins,</hi> without any Hand that could be seen to stick them; or whether all the <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers</hi> in the World would be willing to be Evaporated into certain ill habits of Body producing a <hi>Distemper,</hi> but of the <hi>Distemper</hi> my Reader shall be Judge when I have told him something further of those unusual Sufferings. I do believe that the <hi>Evil Angels</hi> do often take Advantage from <hi>Natural Distempers</hi> in the Children of Men to annoy them with such further Mischiefs as we call <hi>preternatural.</hi> The Malignant <hi>Vapours</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi> of our Diseased Bodies may be used by <hi>Devils,</hi> thereinto insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating

as engine of the Execution of their Malice upon those <hi>Bodies</hi>; and perhaps for this reason one Sex may suffer more Troubles of some kinds from the <hi>Invisible VVorld</hi> than the <hi>other,</hi> as well as for <hi>that reason</hi> for which the Old <hi>Serpent</hi> made where he did his <hi>first Address.</hi> But I Pray what will you say to this, <hi>Margaret Rule</hi> would sometimes have her Jaws for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly pulled open, whereupon something <hi>Invisible</hi> would be poured down her Throat; we all saw her swallow, and yet we saw her try all she could by Spitting, Coughing and Shriking, that she might not swalow, but one time the standers by plainly saw something of that odd <hi>Liquor</hi> it self on the outside of her <hi>Neck</hi>; She cried out of it as of <hi>Scalding Brimstone</hi> poured into her, and the whole House would Immediately scent so hot of <hi>Brimstone</hi> that we were scarce able to endure it, whereof there are score; of Witnesses; but the Young Woman her self would be so monstrously <hi>Inflam'd</hi> that it would have broke a Heart of Stone to have seen her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies, <hi>this</hi> was a thing that several times happen'd and several times when her Mouth was thus pull'd open, the standers by clapping their Hands closethereupon the distresses that otherwise followed would be diverted. Moreover there was a <hi>whitish Powder</hi> to us <hi>Invisible</hi> somtimes cast upon the <hi>Eyes</hi> of this Young Woman, whereby her <hi>Eyes</hi> would be extream'y incommoded, but one time some of this <hi>Powder</hi> was fallen actually <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> upon her Cheek, from whence the People in the Room wiped it with their Handkerchiefs, and somtimes the Young Woman would also be so bitterly scorched with the unseen <hi>Sulphur</hi> thrown upon her, that very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:49354:11"/>
the <hi>Spectres</hi> bragg'd and laughed in her hearing about an exploit they had lately done, by stealing from a Gentleman his <hi>VVill</hi> soon after he had written it; and within a few hours after she had spoken this there came to me a Gentleman with a private complaint, that having written his <hi>VVill</hi> it was unaccountably gone out of the way, <hi>how</hi> or <hi>where</hi> he could not I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine; and besides all this, there were wonderful <hi>Noises</hi> every now and then made about the Room, which our People could Ascribe to no other Authors but the <hi>Spectres,</hi> yea, the Watchers affirm that they heard those frends clapping of their hands together with an <hi>Audibleness,</hi> wherein they could not be Imposed upon: And once her Tormentors pull'd her up to the <hi>Cieling</hi> of the Chamber, and held her there before a very Numerous Company of <hi>Spectators,</hi> who found it as much as they could <hi>all do</hi> to pull her down again. There was also another very surprising circumstance about her, agreeable to what we have not only <hi>Read</hi> in several Histories concerning the <hi>Imps</hi> that have been Imployed in <hi>Witchcraft</hi>; but also known in some of our own afflicted: <hi>We once thought we perceived some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing stir upon her Pillow at a little distance from her, whereupon one present lnying his hand there, he to his horr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But that which was more singular in this matter, was that she could not use these <hi>words</hi> in those penetrating discourses, wherewith she would sometimes address the <hi>Spectres</hi> that were about her.

Not only in the <hi>Swedish,</hi> but also in the <hi>Salem</hi> Witchcraft the Inchanted People have talked much of a <hi>White Spirit</hi> from whence they received marvellous Assistances in their Miseries; what lately befel <hi>Mercy Short</hi> from the Communications of such a <hi>Spirit,</hi> hath been the just Wonder of us all, but by such a <hi>Spirit</hi> was <hi>Margaret Rule</hi> now also visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

Moreover a Minister having one Day with some Importunity Prayed for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of this Young Woman, and pleaded that she belong'd to his Flock and charge; he had so far a right unto her as that he was to do the part of a Minister of our Lord for the bringing of her home unto God; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now the <hi>Devil</hi> hindred him in <hi>doing</hi> that which he had a <hi>right</hi> thus to do, and whereas <hi>He</hi> had a <hi>better Title</hi> unto her to bring her home to <hi>God</hi> than the <hi>Divel</hi> could have unto her to carry her away from the <hi>Lord, he</hi> therefore humbly applied himself unto <hi>God,</hi> who alone could right this matter, with a suit that she might be rescued out of <hi>Satans</hi> Hands; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly upon this, tho' she heard nothing of this transaction she began to call that Minister her <hi>Father,</hi> and that was the Name whereby she every day before all sorts of People distinguished him: the occasion of it she says was <hi>this,</hi> the <hi>white Spirit</hi> presently upon this transaction did after this manner speak to her, <hi>Margaret, you now are to take notice that</hi> (such a Man) <hi>is your Father, God has given you to him, do you from this time look upon him as your Father, obey him, regard him as your Father, follow his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and you shall do well</hi>; And tho' there was one passage more, which I do as little know what to make of as any of the Rest, I am now going to relate it; more than three times have I seen it fulfilled in the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Inchanted and Possest Persons, whom the Providence of God has cast into my way, that their Deliverance could not be obtained before the <hi>third Fast</hi> kept for them, and the third day still obtain'd the Deliverance, altho' I have thought of <hi>beseeching of the Lord thrice, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

me for that <hi>Service.</hi> I have not been insensible of a greater danger at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending me in this fulfilment of my Ministry, than if I had been to take Ten Thousand steps over a Rocky Mountain fill'd with <hi>Rattle-Snakes,</hi> but I have consider'd, he that is wise will observe things, and the <hi>Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Explication</hi> and confirmation of the <hi>biggest part</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> which <hi>I have seen</hi> given in these things, has <hi>abundantly paid me</hi> for observing them. Now in my visiting of the Miserable, I was always of this opinion that we were Ignorant of what <hi>Powers</hi> the <hi>Devils</hi> might have to do their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs in the shapes of some that had never been explicitly engaged in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical Confederacies,</hi> and that therefore tho' many <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> had been fairly detected <hi>on Enquiries</hi> provoked and begun by <hi>Specteral Exhibitions,</hi> yet we could not easily be too jealous of the <hi>Snares</hi> laid for us in the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Satan</hi>; the World knows how many <hi>Pages</hi> I have Composed and Published, and particular Gentlement in the Government know how many <hi>Letters</hi> I have written to prevent the excessive Credit of <hi>Specteral Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,</hi> wherefore I have still charged the <hi>Afflicted</hi> that they should <hi>Cry</hi> out of no body for Afflicting of 'em. But if that this might be any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they might <hi>privately</hi> tell their minds to some one Person of <hi>discretion</hi> enough to make no <hi>ill use</hi> of their communications, accordingly there has been this effect of it, that the Name of <hi>No one</hi> good Person in the World ever come under any blemish by means of any <hi>Afflicted,</hi> Person that fell under <hi>my</hi> particular cognisance, yea no one Man, Woman or Child ever came into any trouble for the sake of any that were <hi>Afflicted</hi> after <hi>I had once begun</hi> to look after 'em; how often have I had this thrown into my dish, that many years ago I had an opportunity to have brought forth such People as have in the late storm of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> been complain'd of, but that I smother'd all, and after that storm was rais'd at <hi>Salem,</hi> I did my self offer to provide Meat, Drink and Lodging for no less than Six of the Afflicted, that so an Experiment might be made, whether <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Fasting</hi> upon the removal of the distressed might not put a Period to the trouble then rising, without giving the <hi>Civil Authority</hi> the trouble of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting those things which nothing but a Conscientious regard unto the cries of Miserable Families, could have overcome the Reluctancies of the Honourable Judges to meddle with; In short I do humbly but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm it, there is not that Man living in this World who has been more desirous than the poor Man <hi>I to shelter</hi> my Neighbours from the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of <hi>Specteral Outcries,</hi> yea I am very jealous I have done so much <hi>that way as to Sin</hi> in what I have done, such have been the Cowardize and Fearfulness whereunto my regard unto the dissatisfactions of other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple has precipitated me. I know a Man in the World, who has thought he has been able to Convict some such <hi>Witches</hi> as ought to Dye, but his respect unto the Publick <hi>Peace</hi> has caused him rather to try whether <hi>He

could not renew them by Repentance:</hi> And as I have been Studious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the <hi>Devils</hi> of their expectations to set people together by the Ears, thus, I have also checked and quell'd those forbidden curiosities, which would have given the <hi>Devil</hi> an invitation to have tarried amongst us, when I have seen wonderful <hi>Snares</hi> laid for <hi>Curious</hi> People, by the secret and future things discovered from the <hi>Mouths of Damsels possest with a Spirit of divination</hi>; Indeed I can recollect but one thing wherein there could be given so much as a Shadow of Reason for <hi>Exceptions,</hi> and that is my allowing of so many to come and see those that were <hi>Afflicted,</hi> now for that I have this to say, that I have almost <hi>a Thousand times</hi> intreated the Friends of the Miserable, that they would not permit the Intrusion of any Company, but such as <hi>by Prayers</hi> or other ways might be helpful to them; Nevertheless I have not absolutely forbid all Company from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Haunted Chambers, partly because the Calamities of the Families were such as required the Assistance of <hi>many Friends</hi>; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have been willing that there should be <hi>disinterested Witnesses</hi> of all sorts, to confute the Calumnies of such as would say <hi>all was but Imposture</hi> and partly because I saw God had Sanctified the Spectacle of the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the Afflicted unto the Souls of many that were Spectators, and it is a very Glorious thing that I have now to mention — The Devil have with most horrendousoperations broke in upon our Neighbourhood and God has at such a rate over-ruled all the Fury and Malice of those Devils, that all the Afflicted have not only been <hi>Delivered,</hi> but I hope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so savingly brought home unto God, and the Reputation of <hi>no one</hi> good Person in the World has been damaged, but instead thereof the Souls o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>IN the Evening when the Sun was withdrawn, giving place to Darkness to succeed, I with some others were drawn by curiosity to see <hi>Margaret Rule,</hi> and so much the rather because it was reported Mr. <hi>M</hi> — would be there that Night: Being come to her Fathers House into the Chamber wherein she was in Bed, found her of a healthy countenance of about seventeen Years Old, lying very still, and speaking very little, what she did say seem'd as if she were Light-Headed. Then Mr. <hi>M</hi> — Father and Son came up and others with them, in the whole were about 30 or 40 Persons, they being sat, the Father on a Stool, and the Son upon the Bedside by her, the Son began to question her, <hi>Margaret Rule</hi>; how do you do? <hi>then a pause without any answer. Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> What do there a great many Witches sit upon you? Answer. <hi>Yes. Q.</hi> Do you not know that there is a hard Master? <hi>Then she was in a Fit</hi>; He laid his hand upon her Face and Nose, but, as he said, without perceiving Breath; then he brush'd her on the Face with his Glove, and rubb'd her Stomach (her Breast not covered with the Bed-cloaths) and bid others do so too, and said
<pb facs="tcp:49354:15"/>
it eased her, then she revived. <hi>Q.</hi> Don't you know there is a hard Master? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, <hi>Reply</hi>; Don't serve that hard Master, you know who. <hi>Q.</hi> Do you believe? Then again she was in a Fit, and he again rub'd her Breast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time <hi>Margaret Perd</hi> an attendant assisted him in rubbing of her. The Afflicted spake angerely to her saying don't you meddle with me, and hastily put away her hand) he wrought his Fingers before her Eyes and asked her if she saw the Witches? <hi>A.</hi> No, <hi>Q.</hi> Do you believe? <hi>A.</hi> Yes. <hi>Q.</hi> Do you believe in you know who? <hi>A.</hi> Yes. <hi>Q.</hi> Would you have other People do so too, to believe in you know who? <hi>A.</hi> Yes. <hi>Q.</hi> Who is it that Afflicts you? <hi>A.</hi> I know not, there is a great many of them (about this time the Father question'd if she knew the Spectres? An attendant said, if she did she would not tell; The Son proceeded) <hi>Q.</hi> You have seen the Black-man hant you? <hi>A</hi>
                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, <hi>Reply</hi>; I hope you never shall. <hi>Q.</hi> You have had a Book offered you, hant you? <hi>A.</hi> No, <hi>Q.</hi> The brushing of you gives you case, don't it? <hi>A.</hi> Yes. She turn'd her selfe, and a little Groan'd. <hi>Q.</hi> Now the Witches Scratch you and Pinch you, and Bite you, don't they? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, then he put his Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Breast and Belly, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Cleaths over her, and felt a Living thing. as he said, which moved the Father also to feel, and some others; <hi>Q.</hi> Don't you feel the Live thing in the Bed? <hi>A.</hi> No. <hi>Reply,</hi> that is only Fancie. <hi>Q.</hi> the great company of People increase your Torment, don't they? <hi>A.</hi> Yes. The People about were desired to withdraw. One Woman said, I am sure I am no Witch, I will not go; so others, so none withdrew. <hi>Q.</hi> Shall we go to Prayers, Then she lay in a Fit as before. But this time to revive her, they waved a Hat and brushed her Head and Pillow therewith. <hi>Q.</hi> Shall we go to PRAY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Spelling the Word. <hi>A.</hi> Yes. The Father went to Prayer for perhaps half an Hour, chiefly against the Power of the Devil and Witchcraft, and that God would bring out the Afflicters: during Prayer-time, the Son stood by, and when they thought she was in a Fit, rub'd her and brush'd her as before, and beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to others to do the like, after Prayer be proceeded; <hi>Q.</hi> You did not hear when we were at Prayer, did you? <hi>A.</hi> Yes. You dont hear always? you dont hear sometimes past a Word or two, do you? <hi>A.</hi> No. Then turning him about said, this is just another <hi>Mercy Short: Margaret Perd</hi> reply'd, she was not like her in her Fits. <hi>Q.</hi> What does she eat or drink? <hi>A.</hi> Not eat at all; but drink <hi>Rum.</hi> Then he admonished the young People to take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Saying it was a sad thing to be so Tormented by the Devil and his Instruments: A Young-man present in the habit of a Seaman, reply'd this is the Devil all over, Than the Ministers withdrew. Soon after they were gon the Afflicted desired the Women to be gone, saying, that the Company of the Men was not offensive to her, and having hold of the hand of a Young-man, said to have been her Sweet-heart formerly, who was withdrawing; She pull'd him again into his Seat, saying he should not go to Night.</p>

That there are Witches is not the doubt, the Scriptures else were in vain, which assign their Punishment to be by Death; But what this Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft is, or wherein it does consist, seems to be the whole difficulty: And as it may be easily demonstrated, that all that bear that Name cannot be justly so accounted, so that some things and Actions not so esteemed by the most, yet upon due Examination will be found to merit no better Character.</hi>

                     <p>In Answer to this last, Sir, you replyed to the Gentleman that present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that you had nothing to Prosecute against me; and said as to your Sentiments in your Books, you did not bind any to believe them, and then again renew'd your promise of meeting me, as before, tho' not yet performed. Accordingly, tho' I waited at Sessions, there was none to object ought against me, upon which I was dismissed. This gave me some reason to believe that you intended all should have been forgotten; But instead of that, I find the Coals are fresh blown up, I being supposed to be represented, in a late Manuscript, <hi>More Wonders of the, &amp;c.</hi> as Traversing your Discourse in your Faithful discharge of your Duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And such as see not with the Authors Eyes, rendred <hi>Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Witlins,</hi> &amp;c. and the Arguments that square not with the Sentiments

It must needs be that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come, but wo to him by whom they come.

                     <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you a genuine account of my Sentiments and Actions in this Affair; and do request and pray, that if I err, I may be shewed it from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or sound <hi>Reason,</hi> and not by quotations out of <hi>Virgil,</hi> nor <hi>Spanish Rhetorick.</hi> For I find the <hi>Witlings</hi> mentioned, are so far from answering your profound questions, that they cannot so much as pretend to shew a distinction between Witchcraft in the Common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and Possession; Nor so much as to demonstrate that ever the <hi>Iews</hi> or primitive <hi>Christians</hi> did believe, that a Witch could send a Devil to Afflict her Neighbours; but to all these, Sir, (ye being the Salt of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WHereas you intimate your desires, that what's not fairly, (I take it for granted you mean truly also,) represented in a Paper you lately sent me, containing a pretended Narrative of a Visit by my Father and self to an Afflicted Young Woman, whom we apprehended to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Diabolical Possession,</hi> might be rectified: I have this to say, as I have often already said, that do I scarcely find any one thing in the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whether respecting my Father or self, either fairly or truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. Nor can I think that any that know my Parents Circumstances, but must think him deserving a better Character by far, than this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive can be thought to give him. When the main design we managed in

Visiting the poor Afflicted Creature, was to prevent the Accusations of the Neighbourhood; can it be fairly represented that our design was to draw out such Accusations, which is the representation of the Paper.

will prove this to be little less than a gross (if not a doubled) Lie; and to be somewhat plainer, it carries the Face of a Lie contrived on purpose (by them at least, to whom you are beholden for the Narrative) Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and Basely to expose me. For you cannot but know how much this Representation hath contributed, to make People believe a Smutty thing of me; I am far from thinking, but that in your own Conscience you believe, that no indecent Action of that Nature could then be done by me before such observers, had I been so Wicked as to have been inclin'd to what is Base. It looks next to impossible that a reparation shoud be made me for the wrong done to, I hope, as to any Scandal, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemish'd, tho' weak and small Servant of the Church of God. Nor is what follows a less untruth, that 'twas an Attendant and not my self who said; if <hi>Rule</hi> knows who Afflicts her, yet she wont tell. I therefore spoke it that I might incourage her to continue in that concealment of all Names whatsoever; to this I am able to furnish my self with the Attestation of Sufficient Oaths. 'Tis as far from true, that my apprehension of the Imp. about <hi>Rule.</hi> was on her Belly, for the Oaths of the Spectators, and even of those that thought they felt it, can restify that 'twas upon the Pillow, at a distance from her Body. As untrue a Representation is that which follows, <hi>Viz.</hi> That it was said unto her, that her not Apprehending of that odd palpable, tho' not visible, Mover was from her Fancy, for I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perswade her that it might be but Fancy in others, that there was any such thing at all. Witnesses every way sufficien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> can be produced for this also. 'Tis falsely represented that my Father felt on the Young-woman after the appearance mentioned, for his hand was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver near her; Oath can sufficiently vindicate him. 'Tis very untrue, that my Father Prayed for perhaps half an Hour, against the power of the Devil and Withcraft, and that God would bring out the Afflictors. Witnesses of the best Credit, can depose, that his Prayer was not a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour, and that there was no more than about one clause to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the close of the Prayer, which was of this import; And this clause also was guarded with a singular wariness and modesty, <hi>Viz.</hi> If there were any evil Instruments in this matter God would please to discover them: And that there was more than common reason for that Petition I can satisfie any one that will please to Inquire of me. And strange it is, that a Gentleman that from 18 to 54 hath been an Exemplary Minister of the Gospel; and that besides a station in the Church of God, as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable as any that his own Country can afford, hath for divers years come off with Honour, in his Application to three Crown'd Heads, and the chiefest Nobility of three Kingdoms, Knows not yet how to make one short Prayer of a quarter of an hour, but in <hi>New-England</hi> he must be Libell'd for it.

                     </p>
                     <p>Yours, almost the whole of it, is concerning the Narrative I sent to you, and you seem to intimate as if I were giving Characters, Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:49354:20"/>
and Libell's <hi>&amp;c.</hi> concerning your self and Relations; all which were as far from my thoughts, as ever they were in writing after either your self, or any other Minister. In the front you declare your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension to be, that the Afflicted was under a Diabolical Possession, and if so, I see not how it should be occasion'd by any Witchcraft (unless we ascribe that Power to a Witch, which is only the Prerogative of the Almighty, of Sending or Commissionating the Devils to Afflict her.) But to your particular Objections against the Narrative; and to the first my intelligence not giving me any further, I could not insert that I knew not. And it seems improbable that a Question should be put, whether she knew (or rather who they were) and at the same time to charge her, and that upon her Life, not to tell, and if you had done so, <hi>I</hi> see but little good you could promise your self or others by it, she being Possest, as also hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it inculcated so much to her of Witchcraft. And as to the next Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection about company flocking, <hi>&amp;c. I</hi> do profess my Ignorance, not knowing what you mean by it. And Sir, that most of the Questions did carry with them a presupposing the things inquired after, is evident, if there were such as those relating to the <hi>Black<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>man</hi> and a Book, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her hearing the Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (related in the said Narrative, which <hi>I</hi> find no Objection against.) As to that which is said of mentioning your self first discoursings and your hopes that your breeding was better (I doubt it not) nor do <hi>I</hi> doubt your Father might first apply himself to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but my intelligence is, that you first spake to the Afflicted or Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, for which you had the advantage of a nearer approach. The next two Objections are founded upon mistakes: <hi>I</hi> find not in the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative any such Question, as how many Witches sit upon you? and that her Breast was not covered, in which those material words, (with the Bed-Cloaths) are wholly omited; <hi>I</hi> am not willing to retort here your own Language upon you; but can tell you, that your own discourse o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> it publickly, at Sir <hi>W. P</hi>'s Table, has much more contributed to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the Reply, if she could she would not tell, whether either or both spake it it matters not much. Neither does the Narrative say you fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As to that Reply, that is only her fancy, <hi>I</hi> find the word (her) added. And as to your Fathers feeling for the live Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after you had felt it, if it were on the Bed it was not so very fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> from her. And for the length of his Prayer, possibly your Witnesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fully exact, it was as near as Memory could bear away; but should be glad to see one more perfect (which yet is not to be expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing none writ at the time) You mention the appendix, by which <hi>I</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Second Visit, and if you be by the possessed belyed (as being half an hour with her alone (excluding her own Mother) and as telling her you had Prayed for her Nine times that day, and that now was her Laughing time, she must Laugh now) <hi>I</hi> can see no Wonder in it,; what can be expected less from the Father of Lies, by whom, you Judge, she was possest.</p>
                     <p>And besides the above Letter, you were pleased to send me another Paper containing several Testimonies of the Possessed being lifted up, and held a space of several Minutes to the Garret floor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they omit giving the account, whether after she was down they bound her down: or kept holding her: And relate not how many were to pull her down, which hinders the knowledge what number they must be to be stronger than an Invisible Force. Upon the whole, I suppose you expect I should believe it; and if so, the only advantage gain'd, is that which has been so long controverted between Protestants and Papists, whether Miracles are ceast, will hereby seem to be decided for the latter; it being, for ought I can see, if so, as true a Miracle as for Iron to swim, and that the Devil can work such Miracles.</p>
                     <p>But Sir, leaving these little disputable things, <hi>I</hi> do again pray that you would let me have the happiness of your approbation or confutation of that Letter before referred to.</p>
                     <p>And now, Sir, that the God of all Grace may enable us Zealously to own his Truths, and to follow those things that tend to Peace, and that your self may be as an useful Instrument in his hand, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to ruin the remainders of Heathenish and Popish Superstitions, is the earnest desire and prayer of yours to command, in wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Having received as yet no Answer to mine of <hi>Novem.</hi> the 24th. except an offer to peruse Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> relating to the Doctrinals therein contain'd: Nor to my last of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the 18th. In which <hi>I</hi> did again pray that if <hi>I</hi> err'd <hi>I</hi> might be shewed it by Scripture, <hi>Viz.</hi> in believing that the Devils bounds are sett, which he cannot pass; That the Devils are so full of Malice that it cant be added to by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: That where he hath power he neither can nor will omit Execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; That it's only the Almighty that sets bounds to his rage, and that only can commissionate him to hurt or destroy any; And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to detest as erroneous and dangerous, the belief that a Witch can Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionate Devils to Afflict Mortals; That he can at his or the Witches pleasure assume any shape: That Hanging or Chaining of Witches can lessen his Power of Afflicting, and restore those that were, at a distance, Tormented by him. And whether Witchcraft ought to be understood now in this Age, to be the same that it was when the Divine Oracles were given forth, particularly, those quoted by Mr. <hi>Gaule</hi> in that cited Head (<hi>Wonders of the Invisible World</hi>; Mr. <hi>Gaules</hi> IV. Head, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Witches) which do so plainly shew a Witch, in Scripture-sense to be one that maligne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that pretend to give a Sign in order to seduce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For I have never understood in my time, any such have Suffered as Witches, tho' sufficiently known; But the only Witch now inquired after, is one that is said to become so by making an Explicit Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Devil, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Devil appearing to them, and making a compact mutually, promising each to other, testified by their signing his Book, a material Book, which he is said to keep, and that thereby they are Intituled to a power, not only to Afflict others, but such as is truly exorbitant, if not highly intrenching upon the prerogative of him who is the Soveraign being; For who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> not.</p>
                     <p>Such explicit Covenant being as is said in this Age reckoned essential to compleat a Witch: Yet I finding nothing of such covenant (or power thereby obtain'd) in Scripture, and yet a Witch therein so fully describ'd, do pray that if there be any such Scriptures I may be directed to them, for as to the many Legends in this case I make no account of them; I Read indeed of a Covenant with Death and with Hell, but suppose that to be in the Heart (or <hi>Mental</hi>) only, and see not what use such explicit one can be of between Spirits, any further than as 'tis a Copy of that <hi>Mental</hi> which is in the Heart. The dire effects and consequences of such notions may be found written in indellible <hi>Roman</hi> Characters of Blood in all Countreys where they have prevail'd, and what can less be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49354:21"/>
expected when Men are Indicted for that, which, as 'tis impossible to prove so, for any to clear himself off, <hi>Viz,</hi> Such explicit Covenant with the Devil, and then for want of better Evidence, must take up with such as the Nature of such secret Covenant can bear, as Mr. <hi>Gaule</hi> hath it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Distracted Stories, and strange and Foreign Events, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by endeavouring to find it, tho by it's but supposed effects; By the same Rules that one is put to purge himself of such Compact, by the same may all Mankind.</p>
                     <p>This then being so Important a case, it concerns all to know what Foundations in Scripture is laid for such a Structure; For if they are deficient of that Warrant, the more Eminent the Architects are the more dangerous are they thereby rendered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These are such considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as I think will vindicate me in the esteem of all Lovers of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in my endeavours to get them cleared. And to that End, do once more pray, that you would so farr oblige me as to give your Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Confutation of the above Doctrinals; But if you think silence a Vertue in this case, I shall (I suppose) so far comply with it as not to loose you any more time to look over my papers. And if any others will so far oblige me, I shall not be ungrateful to them; Praying God to guide and prosper you, I am, Sir, yours to my power, [<hi>He that doth Truth, cometh to the Light.</hi>]</p>

these assertions, above rehearsed, being apparently liable to a like Male Construction, and no less dangerous, are therefore as I said highly needful to be explain'd, and that in a most publick manner. For were they to be understood Litterally and as they are spoken, it must seem as if the Authors were Introducing among Christians very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Doctrines, such, as were they asserted by the best of Men, yet ought to be rejected by all, <hi>&amp;c. Viz.</hi> That 'tis the Devil that brings the most of Evils upon Mankind, by way of Infliction, that do befall them; And that the Witch can Commissionate him to the performance of these, with many others as dangerous Doctrines, and such as seem in their tendency to look favourably upon the Antient <hi>Pagan</hi> Doctrine of this Countrey, who did believe that God did hurt to none, but Good to all, but that the Devil must be pleas'd by Worshipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whom came all their Miseries, as they believed. For what were all this but to Rob God of his Glory in the highest manner, and giving it to a Devil and a Witch; Is it not he that has said shall there be Evil in a City and the Lord hath not done it? But if any are fond of their own notions because some Eminent Men have before now asserted them; they may do well to compare them with that excellent Saying, <hi>Wonders of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible World,</hi> pag. 7. <hi>About this Devil there are many things, whereof we may reasonably and prositably be inquisitive, such things I mean as are in our Bibles reveal'd to us; according to which if we do not speak on so dark a Subject, but according to our own uncertain and perhaps Humoursom Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, there is no Light in us.</hi> Or that other, pag. 75. <hi>At every other Weapon the Devil will be too hard for us</hi>] For 'tis most certain that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notions, Weapons and Practices have been taken up with; And that the event has been answerable, the Devil has been too hard for such as have so done. I shall forbear to instance from the Dogmatical part; and shall mention some practices that as much need explaining. <hi>Mem. provid. Relat. to Witch. pag.</hi> 29, 30, 31.

                     <p>To which I have nothing to object, but it might be a good Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; But considering that the Book is gone forth into all the World, cannot but think the Salve ought to be proportion'd to the Sore, and the notice of the Devils wiles as Universal, as the means recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them.

If this were done by the Power or Vertue of any ord'nance of Divine Institution, it is well, but would have been much better if the Institution had been demonstrated, or was there any Physical Vertue in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hand.

                     <p>AFter more than a Years waiting for the performance of a reiterated promise from one under singular obligations, and a multitude of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to have done it sooner, The utmost compliance I have mett with, is (by your Hands) the sight of four Sheets of recinded Papers, but I must first be obliged to return them in a Fortnight, and not Copied, which I have now complied with: And having read them am not at all Surprized at the Authors Caution in it, not to admit of such crude mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and impertinent absurdities, as are to be found in it to spread. He seems concern'd that I take no notice of his several Books, wherein, as he saith, he has unanswerably proved things to which I might reply, that I have sent him Letters of quotations out of those Books, to know how much of them he will abide by, for I thought it hard to affix their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49354:23"/>
Natural consequences till he had opportunity to explain them. And saith that he had sent me (Mr. Baxters <hi>Worlds of Spirits</hi>) an ungainsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (tho I know no ungainsayable Book, but the Bible) which Book I think no Man that has read it will give such a Title to but the Author, he speaks of my reproaching his publick Sermons, of which I am not conscious to my self, unless it be about his interpretation of a <hi>Thunder Storm</hi> (that broke into his House) which savoured so much of Enthusiasm.</p>
                     <p>As to those papers, I have (as I read them) noted in the Margin where, in a hasty reading, I thought it needful, of which it were unreasonable for him to complain; seeing I might not take a Copy, thereby to have been inabled, more at leasure to digest what were needfull to be said on so many Heads; and as I have not flatter'd him, so for telling what was so needful, with the hazard of making so many Enemies by it, I have approved my self one of his best Friends: And besides his own sense of the weakness of his Answer, testified by the prohibition above, he has wholly declined answering to most of those things that I had his promise for, and what he pretends to speak to, after mentioning, without the needful Answer or Proof drops it.</p>
                     <p>His first main Work is after his definition of a Witch, which he never proves (without saying any thing to Mr. <hi>Gauls</hi> Scriptural description, tho' so often urged to it, and tho' himself has in his Book recommended and quoted it) is to magnifie the Devils Power, and that as I think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond and against the Scripture, this takes him up about 11 <hi>Pages,</hi> and yet in <hi>Page</hi> 22 again returns to it, and as I understand it, takes pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Tho' our Saviour and his Apostles accounts this the chief or principal proof of his Godhead, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.30, 31. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.37, 38. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.30. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to forbear quoting that which the Scripture is most full in, do only say that he that dares assert the Devil to have such a Miraculous Power had need have other Scriptures than ever I have seen. In <hi>Page</hi> 12. our Author proceeds and states a question to this effect, If the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil has such Powers, and cant exert them without permission from God, what can the Witch contribute thereunto? Instead of an Answer, to this weighty objection, our Author first concedes, that the Devil do's ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily exert their Powers, without the Witches contributing to it, but yet that to the end to increase their guilt he may cheat a Witch, by making her believe her self the Author of them. His next is, if Witchcraft be, as <hi>I</hi> suppose it is, the skill of applying the Plastick Spirit of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the consent of the Witch doth naturally contribute to that mischiefs that the Devil does. And his last answer runs to this effect, Is it not the Ordination of God, that where the Devil can get the consent of a Witch for the hurting of others, the hurt shall as certainly be as if they had set Mastiff Dogs upon them, or had given them Poyson into their Bowels; and Gods Providence must be as great in delivering from one as from the other, and this it seems is not only his Belief, but the most Orthodox and most learned answer that our Author could pitch upon. If Witchcraft be as <hi>I</hi> suppose it is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is it not the Ordination of God, that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What is all this but precarious, and begging the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and a plain dropping the Argument he cannot manage; however, to amuse the Ignorant, and to confound the Learned, he hooks in a cramp word, if not a nonentity, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Plastick</hi> Spirit of the World, for who is it either knows that there is a <hi>Plastick-Spirit,</hi> or what it is, or how this can any way serve his purpose.</p>
                     <p>He then proceeds to <hi>Scripture</hi> Instances of Witches, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and where <hi>I</hi> thought it needful, <hi>I</hi> have, as <hi>I</hi> said, shewed my dissent from his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He accounts it unreasonable to be held to the proof of his defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Witch, which he makes to consist in a Covenant with the <hi>Devil</hi>; and chuses rather a tedious process about a Pistol to defend him from it, which indeed is one particular way whereby <hi>Murder</hi> has been Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so the Dore becomes Culpable; But his definition of a <hi>Witch,</hi> which as <hi>I</hi> said, still remains to be proved, is to this effect, That a <hi>Witch</hi> is one that Covenants with, and Commissions <hi>Devils</hi> to do mischiefs, that she is one in Covenant, or that by Vertue of such Covenant she can Commissionate him to Kill. The not bringing Sculpture to prove these two, is a sufficient demonstration there is none; and so that our Author leaves off just where he began, <hi>viz.</hi> in a bare Assertion, together with his own Biggoted experiences, hinting also at multitudes of Histories to confirm him in the belief of his definition. Here being all that I take notice of to be considerable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49354:24"/>And now, Sir, If you think fit improve your Friendship with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor for the Glory of God, the Soveraign Being, the good and welfare of <hi>Man-kind,</hi> and for his real and true Interest, as you see it convenient, put him in mind, That the Glory of God is the End why <hi>Man-kind</hi> was made, and why <hi>He</hi> hath so many Advantages to it. That the Flames we have seen threatning the utter extirpation of the Country, must own their Original to these dangerous Errors (if not Heresies) which if they remain Unextinguished, may and most likely will be acted over again.</p>
                     <p>That 'tis more Honour to own an Error in time, than tenaciously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter full Conviction to retain it. But if our Author will again Vindicate such matters, please to acquaint him, that I shall not any more receive his Papers, if I may not Copy and use them; and that when he does, instead of such abstruse matters, I still pray his determination in those things I have his promise for.

                     <p>I Having had not only occasion, but renewed provocation to take a view of the Mysterious Doctrines, which have of late been so much contested among us, could not meet with any that had spoken more, or more plainly the sense of those Doctrines (relating to the <hi>Witchcraft</hi>) than the Reverend <hi>Mr. C.

                     <p>And if in Witchcraft the Devil by means of a Witch does the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, how 'tis possible to distinguish it from Possession, both being said to be performed by the Devil, and yet without an Infallible distinction there can be no certainty in Judgment. And whether it can be proved that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church in any Age before, or in our Saviours time, even in the time of their greatest Apostacy did believe that a Witch had power to Commissionate Devils to do Mischief.</p>
                     <p>So much to the Questions. These were sent as my belief: That the Devils bounds are sett, that he cant pass; That the Devils are so full of Malice, that it cant be added to by Mankind; That where he hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer he neither can nor will omit executing it; That 'tis only the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty that lets bounds to his rage and that only can Commissionate him to hurt or destroy. And now I shall give you the Summary account of his four sheets above mention'd, as near as memory could recollect, in Ten Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Devils have in their Natures a power to work Wonders and Miracles; particularly that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were not mistaken in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Devils might be cast out by <hi>Beelzebub</hi>; and that our Saviours Answer does not oppose that Assertion; and that he hath the Power of Death, that he can make the most Solid things Invisible; and can In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly bring P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yson and force it down Peoples Throats.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That to assert this Natural, wonderful Power of the Devil, makes most for the Glory of God, in preserving Man from its effects,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yet this Power is restrained by the Almighty, as pleaseth him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That a Witch is one that makes a Covenant with the Devil.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That by vertue of such a Covenant, she arrives at a Power to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionate him,</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That God has ordain'd, that when the Devil is call'd upon by the Witch, tho' he were before restrained by the Almighty, the desired mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs ordinarily shall as certainly be performed, as if the Witch had
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49354:25"/>
lodged Poyson in the Bowels of her Neighbour; or had set Mastiff Dogs on them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That the Witches Art of applying the <hi>Plastic Spirit of the World</hi> to unlawful purposes, does Naturally contribute to the mischiefs done by the Devil.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That that God which restrain'd an <hi>Abimelich</hi> and a <hi>Laban</hi> from hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, does also restrain the Witch from Calling upon or Improving the Devil, when he will not have his Power so exerted.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. That to have a Familiar Spirit, is to be able to cause a Devil to take bodily shapes, whereby either to give responses, or to receive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for doing mischief.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. That this is the Judgment of most of the Divines in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whether <hi>English, Dutch or French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This as I said, I took to be most material in the four sheets sent to me as his belief, and is also all the performance he has yet made of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral promises; which ten Articles being done only by memory, lest thro' mistake or want of the Original, I might have committed any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, I sent them to him that, if there were any, they might be rectified: But instead of such an Answer, as might be expected from a Minister and a learn'd Gentleman, one Mr. <hi>W</hi>— shewed me a Letter writ by Mr. <hi>C. M</hi>— to himself, which I might read, but neither borrow nor Copy, and so, if I were minded, could give but a short account of it.</p>
                     <p>And passing over his hard Language, which, as I am conscious to my self; I never deserv'd (relating to my writing in the margin of the four sheets; and to these ten Articles) so I hope I understand my Duty, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to imitate him in retorting the like. Among his many words in his said Letters, I meet with two small Objections; one is against the word (<hi>Miracle</hi>) in the first Article, the word, I say, not the matter, for the works he artributes to the Devil are the same in their being above or against the Course of Nature and all Natural causes, yet he will not admit of these to be call'd Miracles, and hence he reckon's it the greatest difficulty he meets with in this whole affair, to distinguish the works of the Devil from Miracles. And hence also he concedes to the Devil the Power to make the most Solid things Invisible, and Invisibly to bring Poyson and force it down Peoples Throats, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Which I look upon to be as true Miracles as that. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 18. and this is the sense I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the word in, and in this sense, he himself in the four sheets ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it; for he has an objection to this effect, <hi>Viz.</hi> [If the Devils have such power, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> then Miracles are not ceas'd; and where are we then? (his Answer is) Where! even just where we were before, say I] so that it seems the only offence here is at my using his words. His second objection (for weight) is against the whole ninth Article, and wonders
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49354:26"/>
how 'tis possible for one Man so much to misunderstand another; Yet as I remember, he speaking of the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> in the said four sheets says, she had a familiar Spirit, and that [a Spirit belonging to the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible World, upon her calling appear'd to <hi>Saul</hi>] &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and if so 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he gave responses, he also tells of <hi>Balaam,</hi> that it was known that he could set Devils on People to destroy them, and therefore how this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection should bear any Force I see not; The rest of the objections are of so small weight that once reading may be sufficient to clear them up, and if this be not so, he can, when he pleases, by making it Publick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Margins I writ, Convince all People of the truth of what he asserts; But here 'tis to be noted, that the 2 <hi>d.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi> and 5<hi>th.</hi> Articles he concedes to, as having nothing to object against them, but that they are his belief; and that the 6<hi>th.</hi> and 7<hi>th.</hi> he puts for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to an objection which he thus frames, <hi>Viz.</hi> If the Devil have such powers but cannot exert them but by permission from God, what can the Witch contribute thereto. And thus I have faithfully performed what I undertook, and do solemnly declare, I have not intentionally in the least wronged the Gentleman concern'd, nor design'd the least blemish to his Reputation; but if it stands in competition with the Glory of God, the only Almighty Being, his truths and his Peoples welfare, I suppose these too valuable to be trampled on for his sake, tho' in other things I am ready to my power (tho' with denying some part of my own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest) to serve him. Had this Gentleman declin'd or detracted his four sheets, I see not but he might have done it, and which I think there was cause enough for him so to have done, but to own the four sheets, and at the same time to disown the Doctrine contain'd in them, and this knowing that I have no Copy, renders the whole of the worse aspect.</p>
                     <p>And now I shall give you a further account of my Belief, when I have first premised, that 'tis a prevailing Belief in this Countrey, and elsewhere, that the Scriptures are not full in the Description of, and in the way and means how to detect a Witch, tho possitive in their Punishment to be by Death; and that hence they have thought themselves under a necessity of taking up with the Sentiments of such Men or Places that are thought worthy to give rules to detect them by: And have accordingly practised, <hi>viz.</hi> In searching for Tets for the Devil to suck; Trying whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the suspected can say the Lords Prayer; And whether the Afflicted falls at the sight, and rises at the touch of the supposed Witch; As also by the Afflicted or Possessed giving account who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng these my belief is, that 'tis highly Derogatory to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Wise Lawgiver, to ascert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he has given a Law by <hi>Moses,</hi> the Penalty whereof is Death; and yet no direction to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereby to know and detect the culpable, till our <hi>Triumvirate</hi> Mr.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49354:26"/>
                        <hi>Perkins, Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> had given us their receits, and that that fourth Head of Mr. <hi>Gauls,</hi> being so well prov'd by Scripture is a truth, and contains a full and clear Testimony, who are Witches culpable of Death, and that plainly and from Scripture, yet not excluding any other branch, when as well proved by that infallible rule. And that the going to the Afflicted or Possessed, to have them Divine who are Witches by their Specteral sight, is a great wickedness, even the Sin of <hi>Saul</hi> (for which he also Died) but with this difference, the one did it for Augury, or to know future Events, the other in order to take away Life; and that the searching for Tets; the experiment of their saying the Lords Prayer; the falling at the sight and rising at the touch of the supposed Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, being all of them foreign from Scripture, as well as reason, are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to be abhor'd and repented of. And that our <hi>Salem</hi> Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, either respecting the Judges and Juries, their tenderness of Life, or the Multitude and pertinency of witnesses, both Afflicted and Confessors, or the Integrity of the Historians, are as Authentic, and made as certain as any ever of that kind in the World; and yet who is it that now sees not through it, and that these were the Sentiments that have procured the sorest Affliction, and most lasting infamy that ever befel this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and most like so to do again, if the same notions be still entertain'd and finally that these are those last times, of which the Spirit speaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>And now ye that are Fathers in the Churches, Guides to the People, and the Salt of the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I beseech you consider these things; and if you find the Glory of God diminisht by ascribing such power to Witches and Devils; His truths oppos'd by these notions; and his People aspersed in their Doctrines and Reputations, and indangered in their Lives; I dare not dictate to you, you know your duty as Watchmen, and the Lord be with you.</p>
                     <p>But if you find my belief contrary to sound Doctrine, I intreat you to shew it me by the Scripture; And in the mean time blame me not if I cannot believe that there are several Almighties; for to do all sorts of wonders, beyond and above the Course of Nature, is certainly the work of <hi>Omnipotency.</hi> So also, he that shall Commissionate or Impower to these, must also be Almighty; and I think it not a sufficient <hi>Salvo,</hi> to say they may be restrain'd by the most High; and hope you will not put any hard Construction on these my Endeavours to get information (all other ways failing) in things so needful to be known; praying the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Guidance and protection, I am Yours to the utmost of my Power.</p>

                        </gap>d Dialogue intituled, <hi>Some miscellany Observations,</hi> &amp;c. of which, your self is the suppos'd Author (and which was so serviceable in the time of it) is yet liable to a male construction, even to the endangering to revive what it most opposes, and to bring those practices again on Foot, which in the day thereof were so terrible to this whole Country: The words which <hi>I</hi> suppose so liable to Miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, are <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. B. <hi>Who informed them</hi>? S. <hi>The Spectre,</hi> B. <hi>very good, and that's the Devil turned Informer. How are good Men like to fare against whom he hath particular Malice</hi>!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is but a Presumption, and Wise Men will weigh Presumptions against Presumptions. There is to be no Examination without grounds of Suspicion. Some Persons Credit ought to be accounted too good to be undermined so far as to be suspected on so slight a ground: and it is an Injury done them to bring them upon Examination, which renders them openly Suspected. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but for Persons already suspected and of Ill fame, it may occasion their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examin'd.</hi> In which these words ('tis but a presumption, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>) (and some Persons credit, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>) (and <hi>I</hi> will not deny but for Persons already suspected, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>) this <hi>I</hi> take to be waving to discuss those points, the speaking to which might at that time have hindered the usefulness and success of that Book, rather than any declaring the Sentiments of the Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hor. But notwithstanding many Persons will be ready to understand this, as if the Author did wholly leave it with the Justice, to Judge who are Ill Persons, such as the Devils Accusations may fasten upon; And that the Devils Accusation of a Person, is a Presumption against them of their guilt; and that upon such presumptions, they may be had to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, if the Justice counts them Persons of ill fame (for the Author I suppose knows that the bear Examination will leave such a stain upon them, and well if their Posterity escape it!) as the length of a Holy and unblameable Life will be found too short to Extirpate. And if the Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice may go thus far with the Devils Evidence, then the addition of a story or two of some Cart overset, or person taken Sick after a quarrel, might as well be thought sufficient for their Commitment, in order to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49354:27"/>
their Tryal as 'tis call'd (tho' this too often has been more like a Stage Play, or a <hi>Tragicomical Scene</hi>) and so that otherways useful Book, may prove the greatest Snare to revive the same practices again.</p>
                     <p>These things being so liable, as I said, to such male construction, it were needful that Men might be undeceiv'd, and the matter more fully demonstrated, (<hi>Viz.</hi>) That the Devils Accusation is not so much as any presumption against the Life or Reputation of any person, for how are good Men like to fare, if his malicious accusations may be taken as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of their Guilt; and that his acusations as they are no presumption against persons of unspotted Fame, so neither are they to be heard, or any ways regarded, against persons tho' otherways of ill Life, much less for their having long since had their Names abused by his outcries, or by the Malice of Ill Neighbours; and that Justice knows no difference of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; that if this Evidence be sufficient to bring one person 'tis so to bring any other to Examination, and consequently to the utmost extent of odium, which such Examination will certainly expose them to, for who can know any other, but that as the one may be Maliciously accused by Devils and a Devilish report gone before it; so that another who has not been so much as accused before, being more Cunning or more seeming Religious, might yet be more guilty: the whole depending upon Invisible Evidence, of which Invisible stuff tho' we have had more than sufficient, yet I find (among other Reverend Persons) your Names to acertain Printed Paper, which runs thus,</p>

                           <p>Here being an Encouragement to all good Men, to send in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markables as are therein expressed, I have sent in the following, not that I think them a more sensible demonstration of the being of a future State (with rewards and Punishments) or of Angels good and bad, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> than the Scriptures of truth hold forth, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Or than any of those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demonstrations God has given us; for this were Treacherously and Perfidiously to quit the Post to the Enemy; the <hi>Saducee, Deist,</hi> and <hi>Atheist</hi> would hereby be put in a condition so Triumphantly to deny the Exis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Agency thereof. As that a few Sories told (which at best must be owned to be fallible and liable to misrepresentations) could not be thought Infallibly sufficient to demonstrate the truth against them. I have heard that in Logick a false Argument is reckon'd much worse than none; Yet supposing that a Collection of Instances may be many ways useful, not only to the present but succeeding Ages, I have sent you the following remarkables, which have lately occurred, the certainty of which, if any scruple it, will be found no hard matter to get satisfaction therein: But here, not to insist on those less occurrents, as the sudden Death of one of our late Justices, and a like Mortallity that fell upon the two Sons of another of them, with the Fall of a Man that was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provision to raise the New Northern Bell, which, when it was up, the first person, whose death it was to signifie, was said to be a Child of him, who by Printing and speaking, had had as great hand in procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49354:28"/>
the late Actions as any, if not the greatest; And the Splitting the Gun at <hi>Salem,</hi> where that furious Marshal, and his Father, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> was rent to pieces, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> As to all these it must be owned, that no man knows love or hatred by all that is before him, much less can they be more sensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of the Existence and Agency of the <hi>Invisible World,</hi> than the Scriptures of Truth afford, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> tho' the Rich Man in the Parable might think otherwise, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> who was seeking to send some more sensible Demonstrations thereof to his Brethren, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> In that Tremendous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon this Countrey, by the late amazing Prosecution of the People here, under the Notion of Witches; whereby 20 Suffered as Evil doers (besides those that died in Prison) about ten more Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and a hundred Imprisoned, and about two hundred more Accused, and the Countrey generally in fears, when it would come to their turn to to be Accused; and the Prosecution and manner of Tryal such, that most would have chosen to have fallen into the hands of the Barbarous Enemy, rather than (under that notion) into the hands of their Brethren in Church Fellowship; and in short, was such an Affliction as far exceeded all that ever this Countrey hath laboured under.</p>
                           <p>Yet in this Mount, God is seen; when it was thus bad with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed People, a full and a sudden stop is put, not only without, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Inclination of many, for out of the Eater came forth Meat: Those very Accusers which had been improved as Witnesses against so many, by the Providence of the most High, and perhaps blinded with Malice, are left to accuse those in most High esteem, both Magistrates and Ministers, as guilty of Witchcraft, which shewed our Rulers, that necessity lay upon them, to confound that which had so long confounded the Countrey, as being unwilling themselves to run the same risque; this that was in the Event of it to this Countrey, as Life from the Dead, is most easie with him, in whole Hands are the Hearts of all Men, and was a very signal deliverance to this whole Countrey. No less Observable wat it, that tho' at the time when the Devils Testimony, by the Affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>And thus, Reverend Sir, I have, as I understand it, performed my Duty herein, for the Glory of God, and the well being of Men. And for my Freedome used in this, and former Writings, relating to the Actors in this Tragedy, I shall not Apologize, but give you the words of one to

whom some can afford the title of Venerable (when he is arguing for that which they have undertaken to ascert, tho at other times, more Diminitive Epithire must serve) it is the Reverend Mr. <hi>R. Baxter</hi> in his Book, <hi>The Cure of Church Divisions,</hi> p. 257, 258. <hi>But</hi> (I pray you mark it) <hi>the way of God is to shame the Sinner, how good soever in other respects, That the sin may have the greater shame, and Religion may not be shamed, as if it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed men to sin; Nor God the Author of Religion be Dishonoured; Nor others be without the Warning; But the way of the Devil is, to hide or justifie the sin, as if it were for fear of Disparaging the goodness of the Persons that committed it; that so he may hereby Dishonour Religion and Godliness it self, and make men believe it is but a Cover for any Wickedness, and as consistent with it, as a looser Life is, and that he may keep the Sinner from Repenting, and blot out the Memory of that warning, which should have preserved After-Ages from the like falls.

                           <p>And now that all that have had a hand in any horrid and bloody practices may be brought to give glory to God, and take the due shame to themselves; And that our Watchmen may no longer seek to palliate (much less give thanks for) such, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> (thereby making them their own) and that the people may no longer perish for want of knowledge in the midst of such means of light; Nor God be any longer dishonoured by false sentiments in these matters, is the earnest desire and prayer of, Sir, yours to my power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                                    <hi>IT is therein conceded</hi> (Preface) That to see Devils and Spirits ordinarily would not be enough to convince Atheists. <hi>P.</hi> 88. Atheists are not to be convinced by stories, their own senses are not enough to convince them any more than sense will convince a Papist from Transubstantiation. (<hi>D. Laderd.) P.</hi> 4. No Spirit can do any thing but by God's will and permission. (<hi>Preface</hi>) 'Tis the free will of Man that gives the Devils their hurting power: And without our own consent they cannot hurt us. (<hi>It is asserted. P.</hi> 222, 223. That it is a perverse opposition of Popery which causes many Protestants not to regard the benefits we receive by Angels. And Ministers are faulty, that do not pray and give thanks to God for their Ministry; and that neglect to teach Believers, what love and what thanks they owe to Angels. <hi>P.</hi> 225. Most good people look so much to God and to Ministers, that they take little notice of Angels, which are God's great Ministers. <hi>P.</hi> 234. The Author dares not, as some have done, judge the Catholick Church to become Anti-Christian Idolaters, as soon as they gave too much Worship to Saints and Angels. <hi>P.</hi> 7. The Blessed Souls shall be like the Angels, therefore may appear here, <hi>P.</hi> 3, 4. 'Tis hard to know whether it be a Devil or a human Soul that appears, or whether the Soul of a good or a bad person. <hi>P.</hi> 61. or the Soul of some dead friend that suffers, and yet retains love, &amp;<hi>c.

When Revengeful things are done, as on Murderers, Defrauders, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> it seems to be from the revengeful wrath of some bad Soul, if it be about Money or Lands, then from a Worldly minded one; some significations of God's mercy to wicked Souls after this Life. <hi>P.</hi> 4. 'Tis a doubt whether besides the Angels (good and bad) and the Souls of men, there is not a third sort, call'd Faries and Goblins. It is unsearchable to us how far God leaves Spirits to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in small things, suspending his predetermining motion.</p>

That he has made a Creature, who has it in the power of his Nature to overthrow Nature; and to act above and against it. Which he that can believe may as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the greatest contradiction. That Being which can do this in the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest thing, can do it in the greatest. If</hi> Moses <hi>with a bare permission might stretch forth his Rod, yet he was not able to bring Plagues upon the</hi> Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>or to divide the Waters, without a Commission from the most high; so neither can that evil Being perform any of this without a Commission from the same power. The Scripture recites more Miracles wrought by Men than by Angels good and bad: Tho this Doctrine be so dishonourable to the only Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Being, as to ascribe such Attributes to the Evil one, as are the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable prerogative of him, who is the alone Sovereign Being; yet here is not all: But as he that Steers by a false Compass, the further he Sails the more he is out of his way; so though there is in some things a variation
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49354:33"/>
from, there is in others a further progression in, or building upon the said Doctrine of the</hi> Maniche.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Men in this Age are not content barely to believe such an exorbitant power to be in the nature of this evil Being; but have imagined that he prevails with many to sign a Book, or make a contract with him, whereby they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to perform all the things abovementioned. Another Account is given hereof,</hi> viz. <hi>that by vertue of such a Covenant they attain power to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionate him. And though the two parties are not agreed which to put it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether the Devil impowers the Witch, or the Witch commissionate him; yet both parties are agreed in this, That one way or other the mischief is effected, and so the Criminal becomes culpable of Death. In the search after such a sort of Criminals, how many Countries have fallen into such Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. That the Devastations made by a Conquering Enemy, nor the Plague it self, has not been so formidable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That not only good persons have thus been blemish'd in their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but much innocent Blood hath been shed, is testified even by those very Books, Cases of Conscience, <hi>p.</hi> 33. Remarkable provid. <hi>p.</hi> 179. Memor. provid. <hi>p.</hi> 28.</p>
                     <p>And (to add) what less can be expected, when Men having taken up such a belief, of a covenanting, afflicting and killing Witch; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the Scripture, finding no footsteps therein of such a sort of Witch, have thereupon desperately concluded; that tho the Scripture is full in it, that a Witch should not live; yet that it has not at all descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the crime, nor means whereby the culpable might be detected.</p>
                     <p>And hence they are fallen so far as to reckon it necessary to make use of those Diabolical and Bloody ways, always heretofore practiced for their Discovery. As finding that the Rules given to detect other crimes, are wholly useless for the Discovery of such.</p>
                     <p>This is that which has produced that deluge of Blood mentioned, and must certainly do so again, the same belief remaining.</p>
                     <p>And who can wonder, if Christians that are so easily prevailed with to lay aside their Sword as useless, and so have lost their Strength (if with <hi>Samson</hi>) they are led blind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now Reverend Fathers, you who are appointed as Guides to the People, and whose Lips should preserve Knowledge; who are set as Shepherds, and as Watchmen, this matter appertains to you. I did write to you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly upon this head, and acquainted you with my Sentiments, request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, if I erred, you would be pleased to shew it me by Scripture; but from your silence, I gather that you approve thereof.

me better, if you had been sensible of any Error. But if in this matter you have acquitted your selves, becoming the Titles you are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with, you have cause of rejoycing in the midst of the calamities: that afflict a sinning World.</p>
                     <p>Particularly, if you have taught the People to fear God, and trust in him, and not to fear a Witch or a Devil. That the Devil has no power to afflict any, with Diseases, or loss of Cattle, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> without a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the most high. That he is so filled with malice, that whatever Commission he may have against any, he will not fail to execute it. That no mortal ever was, or can be able to Commissionate him, or to length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Chain in the least, and that he who can Commissionate him is God; and that the Scriptures of truth not only assign the punishment of a Witch; but give sufficient Rules to detect them by, and that (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Gauls</hi> fourth head) a Witch is one that hates and opposes the word, work, and worship of God, and seeks by a sign to seduce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. That they who are guilty according to that head, are guilty of Witchcraft, and by the Law given by <hi>Moses,</hi> were to be put to Death. If you have taught the People the necessity of Charity, and the evil of entertaining so much as a jealousie against their Neighbours for such crimes, upon the Devils suggestions to a person pretending to a Spectral (or Diabolical) sight; who utter their Oracles from malice, frensie or a Satanical Delusion; that to be inquisitive of such, whose Spectres they see, or who it is that afflicts? In order to put the accused persons life in question, is a wickedness beyond what <hi>Saul</hi> was guilty of in going to the Witch. That to consult with the dead, by the help of such as pretend to this Spectral sight, and so to get Information against the life of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is the worst sort of Necromancy. That the pretending to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Spectres, <hi>i. e.</hi> Devils, with the hand, or by striking these to wound a person at a distance, cannot be without Witchcraft, as pretending to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in erder to deceive in matters of so high a Nature. That 'tis Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to think by making Laws against feeding, imploying, or rewarding of evil Spirits, thereby to get rid of them. That their natures require not sucking to support it.</p>
                     <p>That it is a horrid Injury and Barbarity to search those parts, which even Nature it self commands the concealing of, to find some Excrescence to be called a Tet for these to suck; which yet is said sometimes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as a Fleabite. Finally if you have taught the People what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and practice, as to the probation of the Accused, by their saying, or not saying the Lord's Prayer; and as to praying that the Afflicted may be able to Accuse. And have not shunned in these matters to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the whole mind of God. You have then well acquitted yourselves (in a time of General Defection) as faithful Watchmen. But if instead

of this, you have some by word and writing propagated; others recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended such writings, and abetted the false Notions, which are so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in this Apostate Age, it is high time to consider it.

                     <p>AFter that dreadful and severe Persecution of such a Multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, under the notion of Witches, which in the day thereof, was the sorest tryal and affliction that ever befel this Country. And after
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49354:34"/>
many of the principal Actors, had declared their fears and jealousies, that they had greatly erred in those Prosecutions. And after a Solemn day of Fasting had been kept, with Prayers that God would shew us what we knew not; <hi>viz.</hi> what errors might therein have been fallen into, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And after most People were convinc'd of the Evil of some, if not of most of those Actions. At such a time as this, it might have been justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the Ministers would make it their work to Explain the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the People; and from thence to have shown them, the evil and danger of those false Notions which not only gave some occasion; but in a blind Zeal hurried them into those unwarrantable practices, so to prevent a falling into the like for the future.</p>
                     <p>But instead of this, for a Minister of the Gospel (Pastor of the old Meeting) to abet such Notions; and to stir up the Magistrates to such Prosecutions, and this without any cautions given, is what is truly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and of most dangerous consequence.</p>
                     <p>It is a truth, Witchcraft is, in the Text then insisted on, reckon'd up as a manifest work of the Flesh. <hi>Viz. Gal.</hi> 5.19, But it is as true, that in recounting those other Works (which are indeed Manifest Fleshly Works) the Magistrate was not stirred up against those others; but as if the rest were either not to be taken notice of by him, or as if all Zeal against Murder, Adulteries, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> was swallowed up, and over-shadowed by this against Witchcraft.</p>
                     <p>The description that was then given, was that they were such as made a Covenant with the Devil, and sold themselves to the evil Angels. It seems faulty, that when such Minister is inquired of and requested to give the Reasons, or Grounds in Scripture of such Description; for such Minister to assert that it is the Inquirers work to disprove it. And his saying further, in answer that there are many things true, that are not asserted in Scripture; seems to speak this Language, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Law of God is imperfect, in not describing this Crime of Witchcraft, though it be therein made Capital.</p>
                     <p>These perfect Oracles inform us, concerning <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he sold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to work Wickedness; which may signifie to us, that great height of Wickedness he had arrived at; which yet might be, without his being properly, or justly accounted a Witch; any more than those that are said to have made a Covenant with Death, and with Hell, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Can it be thought that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l those, or such as are there spoken of, are Witches, and ought to suffer as Witches?</p>
                     <p>As the Servants and People of God, have made a Solemn explicit Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 24. 25. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.38. &amp;<hi>c.</hi> So no doubt a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant has been made by <hi>Heathen Indian</hi> Nations, to serve, and adore the Devil; yet even for this, it were very hard to affix the Character of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49354:35"/>
a Witch upon each of those <hi>Heathen</hi> that so do: And accordingly to Execute them as such. It is also possible, that some that have been called Christians, have sealed a Writing, sign'd with their own Blood, or otherways, thereby Covenanting to be the Devil's Servants, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> but from far other grounds, or inducements than what sways with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>; these Heathen hoping to please him, that so he may not harm them. But these having been Educated and Confirmed in the Belief, that by vertue of such Covenant, they shall have a Knowledge and Power more than Humane, assisting of them; this may have prevail'd with some to so horrible a wickedness; for none can seek Evil for Evils sake but as the Serpent in his first tempting of Man, made use of this of the knowledge of Good and Evil; so to teach Men that such effects do usually follow such Covenant, is properly the work of the Serpent; for without this, what inducement, or temptation could they have to make such a Covenant?</p>
                     <p>These having thus chosen a false God, may well be accounted of the worst sort of Idolaters. Yet it does not hence follow that in a Scripture sense, they are thereby become Witches, till they have, or rather till they pretend to have assistances answerable: and do thereby endeavour to deceive others, which endeavours to deceive, by a sign may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous Covenant.</p>
                     <p>But supposing none of all those several sorts of Covenants was intended, it remains that the Covenant, that was understood to be intended, in that Discourse at Old Meeting, is agreeable to the late dangerous Notion that has so much prevailed <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Devil appears to the persons', that they and the Devil make mutual engagements each to other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by signing to the Devil's Book; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> has occasioned the shedding so much Blood in the World, it may be thought to need explaining.</p>
                     <p>For as Reason knows nothing of an Afflicting, Covenanting Witch; so it seems as Forreign from Scripture in general, as it is from the Text then insisted on; which speaks of such wickednesses as are manifestly the works of the flesh: but such Communication with Spirits, the flesh doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly dread even as death it self. Therefore the usual Salvation of the Holy Angels to the best of Men was, fear not; and experience shews, that the most wicked, are most afrighted at the apprehensions of the appearances of Devils; therefore such an explicit Covenanting can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a manifest work of the Flesh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49354:35"/>Yet this is manifest, that the belief of the Witches power to do the things above mentioned, is an ancient belief of the Heathen. And that from them it was received by the Papists, as a part of their Faith, who have since improved upon it, and brought in the notion of a Covenant. But it seems yet a further improvement lately made by Protestants, that such Witches can Commissionate Devils to do those mischiefs, thereby setting the Witch in the place of God; for tho few of the Papists are known to be thus absurd; yet when such Doctrines have been Preached, and Printed in <hi>New England,</hi> they have met with none to oppose; but many to incourage them. Other considerable additions or new improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made here; as the art to knock off invisible chains with the hand, to drive away Spect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And if the law of God be perfect, and exceeding broad, as being given forth by the Omniscient Law-giver; it is exceeding high Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and arrogance, and highly destructive to the lives of Innocents, for any to pretend to give another, and a pretended better description of a crime made thereby Capital, with new rules to try such offenders by,</p>

                           <p>FOR as much as it is the undoubted duty of all Christians to pursue Peace, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.14. even to a reaching of it, if it be possible. <hi>Amos</hi> 12.18, 19. And whereas through the righteous, Soveraign, and awful Providence of God, the grand Enemy to all Christian Peace, has been of late tremendously let loose in divers places hereabout, and more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially among our sinful selves, not only to interrupt that partial peace which we did sometimes enjoy, but also through his wiles and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and our weakness, and corruptions, to make wider breaches, and raise more bitter Animosities between too many of us. In which dark and difficult dispensations, we have been all or most of us of one mind for a time; and afterwards of differing apprehensions. And at last we are but in the dark, upon serious thoughts of all; and after many Prayers, I have been moved to present to you (my beloved Flock) the following particulars, in way of Contribution towards a regaining of Christian Concord; if so be we be not altogether unappeaseable, irrecosileable, and so destitute of that good Spirit, which is first pure, then peaceable; gentle, and easie to be intreated, <hi>Iames,</hi> 3.17. <hi>Viz.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. In that the Lord ordered the late horrid calamity (which afterward plague-like spread in many other places) to break out first in my Family, I cannot but look upon as a very sore rebuke, and humbling providence, both to my self and mine, and desire some may improve it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In that also in my Family were some of both parties, <hi>viz.</hi> Accusers and Accused, I look also upon as an aggravation of that rebuke, as an addition of Wormwood to the Gall.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. In the means were used in my Family, though totally unknown to me or mine (except Servants) till afterwards, to raise Spirits and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions in a no better than a Diabolical way, I do also look upon as a further rebuke of Divine Providence. And by all, I do humbly own this day before the Lord, and his People, that God has been righteously spitting in my face, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.14. And I desire to lye low under all this reproach, and to lay my hand on my mouth.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49354:37"/>4. As to the management of these Mysteries, as far as concerns my self I am very desirous upon further light to own any errors I have therein fallen into, and can come to a discerning of; in the mean while I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge upon after-considerations, that were the same troubles again (which the Lord of his rich mercy for ever prevent) I should not agree with my former apprehensions in all points. As for Instance,</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. I question not but God sometimes suffers the Devil, as of late, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict in shape of not only Innocent, but Pious persons, or so to delude the Senses of the afflicted, that they strongly conceit their hurt is from such persons, when indeed it is not.</item>
                              <item>2. The improving of one afflicted to inquire by who afflicts the other, I fear may be, and has been unlawfully used to Satan's great Advantage.</item>
                              <item>3. As to my writing, it was put upon me by Authority, and therein I have been very careful to avoid the wronging of any.</item>
                              <item>4. As to my Oath I never meant it, nor do I know how it can be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise construed, than as vulgarly, and every one understood, yea and upon inquiry it may be found so worded also.</item>
                              <item>5. As to any passage in preaching, or praying in the sore hour of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress and darkness, I always intended but due Justice on each hand, and that not according to Men but God; who knows all things most perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; however through weakness, or sore exercise, I might sometimes, yea and possibly sundry times unadvisedly express my self.</item>
                              <item>6. As to several that have confessed against themselves, they being wholly strangers to me, but yet of good account with better Men than my self, to whom also they are well known, I do not pass so much as a secret condemnation upon them. But rather seeing God has so amazing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lengthened out Satan's Chain, in this most formidable outrage, I much more incline to side with the Opinion of those that have grounds to hope better of them.</item>
                              <item>7. As to all that have unduly suffered in these matters, either in their Persons or Relations, through the clouds of humane weakness, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's wiles and sophistry, I do truly sympathize with them, taking it for granted, that such as know themselves clear of this great transgression, or that have sufficient grounds so to look upon their dear Friends, have hereby been under those sore tryals and temptations, that not an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary measure of true grace would be sufficient to prevent a bewraying of remaining corruption.</item>
                              <item>8. I am very much in the mind, and abundantly perswaded that God for holy ends (though for what in particular, is best known to himself) has suffered the Evil Angels to delude us on both hands; but how far on the one side, or the other, is much above me to say, and if we cannot reconcile till we come to a full discerning of these things, I fear we shall never come to agreement, or at soonest not in this World.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49354:37"/>9. Therefore in fine, the matter being so dark and perplexed, as that there is no present appearance, that all God's Servants should be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one mind in all circumstances, touching the same: I do most heartily, fervently, and humbly beseech pardon of the merciful God, through the Blood of Christ for all my mistakes and trespasses in so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a matter. And also all your forgiveness of every offence, in this or other affairs, wherein you see or conceived that I have erred and offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, professing in the presence of the Almighty God, that what I have done has been as for substance as I apprehended was duty, however thro' weakness. Ignorance, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> I may have been mistaken. I also thro' grace promising each of you the like of me; so again I beg, intreat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, that Satan, the Devil, the roaring Lion, the old Dragon, the Enemy of all Righteousness, may no longer be served by us, by our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Strifes, where every evil work prevails whilst these bear sway, <hi>Iames,</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. But that all from this day forward may be covered with the mantle of love, and we may on all hands forgive each other heartily, sincerely and thoroughly, as we do hope and pray, that God for Christ's sake would forgive each of our selves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.21. to the end. <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Put on therefore (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</hi> Eph. 4.31, 32. <hi>Let all bitterness, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking be put away from you with all malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another, even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you.</hi> Amen, Amen.</item>

WE judge that all be it in the late and dark time of the confusions, wherein Satan had obtained a more than ordinary liberty, to be sifting of this Plantation, there were sundry unwarrantable, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable steps, taken by Mr. <hi>Samuel Parris,</hi> the Pastor of the Church in <hi>Salem</hi> Village, then under the hurrying distractions of amazing Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet the said Mr. <hi>Parris,</hi> by the good hand of God brought unto a better sense of things, hath so fully exprest it, that a Christian charity may and should receive satisfaction therewith.</p>

In as much as diverse Christian Brethren, in the Church of <hi>Salem</hi> Village, have been offended at Mr. <hi>Parris,</hi> for his conduct in the time of their difficulties, which have distressed them; we now advise them Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably to accept the satisfaction which he hath tendered in his Christian acknowledgment of the Errors therein committed; yea to endeavour, as far as it is possible, the fullest reconciliation of their minds unto commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, in the whole Exercise of his Ministry, and with the rest of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12, 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.3. <hi>Iames</hi> 5.16.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Considering the extream tryals and troubles, which the dissatisfied Brethren in the Church of <hi>Salem</hi> Village have undergone, in the day of sore temptation, which hath been upon them; we cannot but advise the Church to treat them with bowels of much compassion, instead of all more critical, or rigorous proceedings against them for the Infimities dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by them, in such an heart breaking day; and if after a patient waiting for it, the said Brethren cannot so far overcome the uneasiness of their Spirits, in the remembrance of the disasters that have hapned, as to sit under his Ministry; we advise the Church with all tenderness to grant them admission to any other Society of the Faithful, whereunto they may be desired to be dismist. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.13, 14. <hi>Iob</hi> 19.21.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Parris</hi> having (as we understand) with much fidelity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity acquitted himself, in the main course of his Ministry, since he hath been Pastor of the Church of <hi>Salem</hi> Village; about his first call whereunto, we look upon all contestations now to be both unreasonable and unseasonable: And our Lord having made him a blessing to the Souls of not a few, both old and young in this place, we advise that he be accordingly respected, honour'd and supported, with all the regards that are due to a painful Minister of the Gospel. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.</p>

               <p>Some part of the Determination of the Elders and Messengers of the Churches, met at <hi>Salem</hi> Village, <hi>April,</hi> 3. 1695. relating to the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences there.</p>

                     <hi>IF the Distemper in</hi> Salem <hi>Village should be</hi> (which God forbid) <hi>so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable that Mr.</hi> Parris <hi>after all, find that he cannot with any comfort and service continue in this present station, his removal from thence will not expose him to any hard Character with us, nor we hope) with the rest of the People of God, among whom we live,</hi> Mat. 10.14.

               <p>And whether in a crime of such a high nature, the making a slender and general confession, without any proposals of reparations, or due time of probation, ought so far to be accounted sufficient, from such a Pastor to his People.</p>

                     <opener>To the Honourable <hi>Wait Winthrop, Elisha Cook,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Sewall,</hi> Esquires, Arbitrators indifferently chosen, between Mr. <hi>Samuel Parris,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Salem</hi> Village.</opener>
                     <p>THE Remonstrances of several agrieved persons in the said Village, with further reasons why they conceive they ought not to hear Mr. <hi>Parris,</hi> nor to own him as a Minister of the Gospel, nor to contribute any support to him as such, for several Years past; humbly offered as fit for consideration.</p>
                     <p>We humbly conceive that having in <hi>April,</hi> 1693, given our Reasons why we could not join with Mr. <hi>Parris</hi> in Prayer, Preaching, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If these Reasons are found sufficient for our withdrawing, (and we cannot yet find but they are) Then we conceive our selves virtually discharged, not only in Conscience, but also in Law; which requires maintenance to be given to such as are Orthodox, and blameless. The said Mr. <hi>Parris</hi> having been teaching such dangerous Errors, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such scandalous Immoralities, as ought to discharge any (tho ever so gifted otherways) from the work of the Ministry.</p>
                     <p>Particularly in his Oath against the lives of several, wherein he swears that the Prisoners with their looks knock down those pretended sufferers. We humbly conceive, that he that Swears to more than he is certain of, is equally guilty of Perjury with him that Swears to what is false And tho they did fall at such a time, yet it could not be known that they did it, much less could they be certain of it; yet did Swear positively against the lives of such, as he could not have any knowledge but they might be Innocent.</p>
                     <p>His believing the Devil's Accusations, and readily departing from all Charity to persons, tho of blameless and godly lives, upon such suggestions, his promoting such Accusations, as also his partiality therein, in stifling the Accusations of some, and the same time vigilantly promoting others; as we conceive are just causes for our refusal, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Mr. <hi>Parris</hi>'s going to <hi>Mary Walut,</hi> or <hi>Abigail Williams,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting others to them, to know who afflicted the People in their illnesses;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49354:40"/>
we understand this to be a dealing with them that have a familiar spirit, and an implicit denying the providence of God, which alone, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, can send Afflictions, or cause Devils to Afflict any; this we also conceive sufficient to justifie such refusal.</p>
                     <p>That Mr. <hi>Parris</hi> by these Practices and Principles, has been the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and procurer of the sorest Afflictions, not to this Village only, but to this whole Country, that did ever befal them.</p>
                     <p>We the Subscribers, in behalf of our selves, and of several others of the same mind with us (touching these things) having some of us had our Relations by these practices taken off by an untimely Death; others have been imprisoned, and suffered in our Persons, Reputations, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states; submit the whole to your Honours decision, to determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are ought to be any ways obliged to honour, respect and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port such an Instrument of our miseries; praying God to guide your Honours, to act herein, as may be for his Glory, and the future settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Village, in Amity and Unity.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Told you, I had some thoughts concerning Witchcraft, and an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conferring with the Gentleman, who has published several Treatises about Witchcraft, and persons afflicted by them, lately here in <hi>New-England</hi>; but since you have put those three Books into my hands, I find my self engaged in a very hard Province, to give you my opinion of them, I plainly foresee, that should this scribling of mine come to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49354:40"/>
publick view, it would displease all Parties, but that is the least; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is so far out of my Road to set my thoughts to consider a matter on every side, which in it self is so abstruce, and every step I advance therein, if I miss truth (which is a narrow and undivided line) I must tumble down headlong into the Gulph of dangerous error; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I have forced my self to send these few lines, if so be I may clear to you a truth, you now seem to be offended at, because of the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which (you think) lately have and again may be drawn from it, by the ill conduct of some Men. I am not ignorant that the pious frauds of the Ancient, and the inbred-fire (I do not call it pride) of many of our Modern Divines have precipitated them to propagate, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth as well as falshoods, in such an unfair manner, as has given ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Enemy, to suspect the whole Doctrine, these Men have profest to be nothing but a meer trick. But it is certain, that as no lover of truth will justifie an Illegitimate Corollary, tho drawn from a true Proposition; so neither will he reject a truth, because some or many Men take unfair mediums to prove it, or draw false consequences from it: The many Heresies among Christians, must not give a mortal wound to the Essence of the Christian Religion; neither must any one Christian Doctrine be exterminated, because Evil Men make use of it, as a Cloak to cover their own self-ends; particularly, because some men perhaps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all sorts of Christians, have under pretence of Witchcraft coloured their own Malice, Pride and Popularity; we must not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude (first) that there are no Witches (2) or that Witches cannot be Convicted by such dear and undeniable proof, as the Law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in the case of Death (3.) Or that a Witch so Convicted ought not to be put to death. 1. That there are Witches is manifest from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Moses, Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live.</hi> Exod. 22.18. for it is certain God would not have given a vain and unintelligible Law, as this must be of putting Witches to death, if there are no Witches. But you object that this doth not answer our Case, for we have formed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Idea of Witches than what can be gathered from Scriptures; you quote four place, <hi>viz. Deut</hi> 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. from all which you infer that Witchcraft is a maligning and opugning the Word, Works, and Worship of God; and by an extraordinary sign, seeking to seduce any from it, and this you readily grant. But then you say, What is this to Witches now a days? who are said to have made an explicit Covenant with the Devil, and to be impowered by him, to the doing of things strange in themselves, and besides their natural course. This you say does not follow, and herein indeed consists the whole Controversie. Therefore it is necessary, that first of all we clear this point, laying aside those prejudices we may have from the fatal application of this Doctrine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49354:41"/>
to some (who were in your judgment) really at least in Law, and before Men Innocent. In a word, we are seeking after truth, and truth shall and will be truth, in spite of Men and Devils. I do not repeat this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to forestall you, to believe the Doctrine of Witchcraft, as it is above defined, without inquiring into the reason and truth of it; only I desire you to enquire into it, as a thing doubtful. For no Man can be certain of a Negative, unless either the Affirmative imply a contradiction, or he can prove it by certain testimony, to neither of which you pretend; only you alledge it cannot be proved by Scripture, <hi>i.e.</hi> you cannot prove it, nor have seen it proved by any other you have read on that Subject. I am not so vain to think I can do better than the Learned Authors you have consulted with (tho I know not what they have done, for I had no other Book but the Bible, to make use of on this occasion;) but because I am satisfied my self, I am willing to communicate my Reasons, which I divide into Three heads. 1. The appearance of Angels. 2. The nature of Possession. 3. And the Scripture notion of Witchcraft. 1. Good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did appear to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and did eat, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. it seems he wash'd their Feet, it is certain he saw and heard them, therefore there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility in Angels being conversant with men. God is true, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contained in Sacred Writ is true; If we poor shallow Mortals do not comprehend the manner how, that argues only our weakness and ignorance in this dark Prison of Flesh, wherein we are inclosed, during our abode in this vale of misery, but doth not in the least infringe the verity of the Scripture; it is sufficient that we undoubtedly know they have appeared unto Men in bodily shape, and done their Errand they were sent on from God. Now if good Angels have appeared, why may not bad? Surely the Devils, because fallen and Evil, have not therefore lost the Nature of Angels, neither is there any contradiction in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in a bodily shape, now after any more than before their Fall. But you will say, you must allow of the appearances of Good Angels, because of the Scripture testimony; but not of bad, seeing there is no place of Scripture that clearly proves it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. The words in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel do as plainly signifie the Devils outward appearance to our Saviour, when he was tempted, as can be express'd, <hi>and when the tempter came to him he said— but he answered—</hi> the same from St. <hi>Luke</hi> useth to signifie the appearance of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> in the transfiguration, <hi>And behold there talked with him two men</hi>; for what follows, <hi>v.</hi> 31, <hi>who appeared</hi> is used to signifie (not their appearance, but) the manner of their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <hi>in great Glory.</hi> But you'l urge that 'tis very easie to be understood, that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did appear, because they had human bodies; but that it is unintelligible to you, how the Devil being a Spirit can appear, a Spirit, <hi>i.e.</hi> a substance void of all dimensions; therefore the words in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49354:41"/>
the History must not be taken in a literal Sense. Do not mistake; tho some Philosophers are of opinion (which whether true or false, is all one to our present Argument) that a Spirits substance is extended, and hath besides length, breadth and depth, a fourth dimension, <hi>viz.</hi> essential spis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde; yet the same do not say, that pure substance is perceptible by our bodily Senses; on the contrary, they tell us, that Spirits are cloathed with vehicles, <hi>i.e.</hi> they are united to certain portions of matter, which they inform, move and actuate. Now this we must not reject as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because we cannot comprehend the forma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> reason, how a Spirit acts upon matter: For who can give the Reason, that upon the Volition of the human Soul, the Hand should be lifted up, or any ways moved? for to say the Contraction of the Muscles is the Mechanick cause of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion, is not to solve the Question which recurs, why upon Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition should that Contraction ensue which causes that motion? all that I know the wisest Man ever said upon this head is, that it is the will of the Creator; who hath ordered such a species of thinking Creatures, by a Catholick Law to be united to such portions of matter, so and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, or, if you will in the vulgar Phrase, to Organiz'd bodies, and that there should be between them and the several bodies, they are united to, a mutual re-action and passion: Now you see how little we know of the reason, of that which is most near to us, and most certain, <hi>viz.</hi> The Souls informing the Body, yet you would think it a bad Argument, if one should, as some have done, include from this our Ignorance, that there was nothing in us but matter, it is no otherways to deny a Spirits acting a Vehicle. The plainest and most certain things when denied are hardest to be proved, therefore the Axiom faith well, <hi>contra principia, &amp;c.</hi> There are some certain truths which are rather to be explained to young beginners than proved, upon which yet all Science is built, as every whole is more than his part, and of this sort I take these two following,
<list>
                           <item>1. That there are two substances, <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>us &amp; Mens,</hi> Body and Spirit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together different, for the Ideas we have of them are quite distinct.</item>
                           <item>2. That a Spirit can Actuate, Animate, or inform a certain portion of matter, and be united to it: from whence it is very evident, that the Devil united to a portion of matter (which hereafter I'll call a Vehicle) may fall under the cognizance of our Senses, and be conversant with us in a bodily shape. Where then is the reason or need to run to a Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, and forced Interpretation, when the words are so plain, and the literal sense implieth no contradiction, nor any greater difficulty than (as has been said) what ariseth from the Union of the Soul and Body, which is most certain. Now after all to say, God <hi>will not</hi> permit the Devil so to appear, is to beg the question without saying any thing to the preceeding Argument, and it is against the sense of almost all in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>kind;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49354:42"/>
for in all Ages, and all places there have been many Witnesses of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>mons,</hi> all of whom that taught any thing contrary to the right Worship of the true God, were certainly evil ones: and it were most presumptuous, barely to assert that all these witnesses were always deceived, and it is impossible they could all agree to deceive. 2. We come to consider the nature of Possession. The Man possest, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.27. had a Power more than Natural, for he brake the bands, which he could not have done by his own strength: Now from whom had he this Power? The Scripture saith, He had Devils a long time, and often times it had caught him, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> he was kept bound with Chains, and in Fetters, and he brake the bands, and was driven of the Devil into the Wilderness; this Power then was immediately from the Devil, and whatsoever possessed persons does, or suffers things beyond his natural power; he is inabled by the <hi>Daemon</hi> so to do: or to speak more properly, it is the <hi>Damon</hi> who acteth the same, as is plain from St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Relation of this passage, <hi>v.</hi> 5.2. A Man with an unclean Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 3.2. and no Man could bind him, no not with Chains, 6. <hi>v.</hi> but when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshiped him, and the same He <hi>v.</hi> 7. said, I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not, <hi>v.</hi> 10. My name is <hi>Legion,</hi> for we are many, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and he besought him much, that he would not send <hi>them</hi> away out of the Countrey: it is manifest from hence, that it was not the poor Man who was possest, but the Devils who possessed him, by whom the Chains had been pluck'd a sunder, and the Fetters broken in pieces; now here is Divine testimony, that the Devils have actuated a Humane body to the doing of things beyond the Natural strength of that Body, as it was simply united to its humane Soul; how much more then can the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil actuate any other proportion of simple Matter, Earth, Air, Fire or Water; and make it a fit Organ for himself to act in.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But enough of this already, let us rather enquire how the Devil enters info the body of the possest, to move it at his pleasure; this I think he cannot do as a meer Spirit, or by any never so strict Vnion with the Humane Soul, for in that case he is only a tempter or seducer; and nothing above humane strength can be done: But here there being something performed (the bonds broken) by a force which could not proceed from humane strength, it necessarily follows that the Devils entred into the possest, otherways qualified than as a meer Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he did not enter without some portion of matter, to which he was united by the Intermedium, whereof he acted upon and actuated the humane body. Again if it is said that the Devil entred as a meer Spirit, and immediately acted upon and moved that Body; it follows the Devil hath a Vehicle, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain portion of matter (that Body) to actuate and dispose of at will; which is absurd, 1. Because it asserts what it seems to deny,</hi> viz. <hi>the Devils having a Vehicle to act immediately upon, and to be united to a portion of matter (as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49354:42"/>
has been said before) is the same thing. 2. It sights against the Catholick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Law of the Vnion of Soul of and Body, by which the Omnipotent hath ordained the voluntary motion of a humane body to depend upon the Will of its humane Soul, and those that are not voluntary to proceed either from its own Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison, or material force, hence we may certainly conclude, that it is by the Intervening of the Devils Vehicle, that he enters into the Body of the possest. But what if you and I cannot agree about this Notion of possession, must w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> therefore reject the truth it self, and run to a far fetched and intollerable sense of the words; No, our opinions do not alter the Nature of things, it is certain there were persons possest, and it is as certain that the De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

But the consideration of them, who have familiar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, falleth under the head of Witchcraft, which we are to consider in the third place.</hi> 3. <hi>Witchcraft, to inquire into the Scripture Notion of it, and compare whether it be the same with that above d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Witch is impower'd by the Devil to do things strange in themselves, and beside their natural course.</hi> 2. <hi>Prop. The manner how the Witch is impowered to do those strange things, is by Explicit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49354:43"/>
or Covenant with the Devil. For clearing of the first, we will consider the four places above cited, wherein a Witch is called a false Prophet, a false Christ, a Sorcerer, a resister of the truth, and is said to shew signs to seduce the People to seek after other Gods: whence let us note,</hi> 3 <hi>things,</hi> 1. <hi>That those terms Witch, false Christ, false Prophet, and Sorcerer, are all Synonimous</hi>; i.e. <hi>signifie the same thing.</hi> 2. <hi>That a Witch doth do things strange in themselves, and beyond their Natural course: for it were most ridiculous, to alledge that our blessed Saviour, when he said,</hi> there shall arise false Christs, and shall shew great signs and wonders, in so much that (if it were possible) they should deceive the very Elect, <hi>meant that cunning cheats should arise and shew Legerdemain tricks; the words will in no wise bear it, and I believe you are from interpreting them, so it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, they signifie not a feign'd, but a real doing of things, beyond their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural course; therefore the Sorceries of</hi> Elimas <hi>and</hi> Simon <hi>were not simple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, but real effects that could not have been produced by Physical causes in the ordinary course of nature.</hi> 3. <hi>That the end of the Witches shewing these signs, is to seduce the People to seek after other Gods, from which premises I infer, that the Witches have the power of doing those wonders, or strange things immediately from the Devil: they are without the reach of Nature, and therefore above humane power, and no meer Man can effect them; the Witch then who does them must have the power of doing them from another; but who is the other? God will not give his testimony to a lye, and to say God did at any time impower a Witch to work wonders to gain belief to the Doctrine of Devils, were with one breath to destroy root and branch of all revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; no, it cannot be, it is only God's permission, who proveth his People, whether they love him with all their heart, and with all their Soul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Witch has a power of doing Wonders, or strange things immediately from the Devil.</hi> 2. <hi>Proposit, we'll subdivide into these two.</hi> 1. <hi>That there is an express Covenant between the Witch and the Devil.</hi> 2. <hi>That 'tis not reasonable to suppose this Covenant to be transacted mentally.</hi> 1. <hi>The Devil cannot communicate this power, by never so strict a Vnion with the Soul of the Witch; for in that case he is only a tempter, and nothing above humane power can be done, as has been already proved; therefore the Devil who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Witch to do things above humane power, must either appear in an External shape, and instruct him how, and upon what terms he will inable him to do those Wonders; or else he must enter into the body of the Witch and possess it. The Denominacs in the Gospel are such whom the Devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade, by main force, their Soul having no further command of their bodies, which are subjected to the Will of the Devils; whose end is to wound and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment those miserable Creatures, to throw them into the fire, and into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but the Witch, who likewise is possessed, is not treated in such an outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, kis</hi> Daemon <hi>is tame and familiar unto him, and suffers him for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49354:43"/>
a time to live quietly, without any further molestation, then prompting him to do his utmost endeavour to withdraw Men from God; he is not bereaved of his Senses as the poor lunatick, but is conscious of all he does, and willeth all his crimes, he receiveth power from the Devil to do wonders, and doth them to serve the Devils turn. Therefore there must be a Covenant, an express Covenant, between the Devil and him,</hi> viz. <hi>that he shall obey the Devil and serve him, and that the Devil shall both enable him so to do, and also reward him for so doing; for if there is no contract between them, How comes the Witch to know he has a supernatural power? or how can be so peremptorily pretend to do that which is so much above his natural power, not knowing he has a supernatural one inabling him to do the same: There can be no doubt but there was a very intimate commerce between Satan and him; who is call'd by St.</hi> Paul <hi>thou Child of the Devil (not as other unholy men but) in an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial manner, as being the Enemy of all righteousness, who would not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord, it is not to be supposed that he enter'd into this so near a Relation with Satan, with which he is stigmatized, that others may beware of him, without his own knowledge and consent; and is not this a Covenant, an Express Covenant on his part to serve the Devil incessantly, and on the Devils, to impower him to act his Sorceries wherewith he bewitched the People; now I think, I have from Scripture fully satisfied you of the truth of what I offered, in a Discourse at— but since you have told me an Explicit Covenant with the Devil, signifying the Devil's appearing in a bodily shape to the Witch, and their signing an express Covenant, which you say cannot be proved from Scripture. It were most unreasonable to imagine that the ceremonies of this bellish m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>stery are particularly set down in the word of God; therefore we must gather by Analogy and Reason the manner how this express Covenant is transacted: and to that end I'le set down these following Considerations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Under the Law, God did ordain his People in all their matters to have recourse immediately to himself, and depend upon him for Counsil, which they were ready to obey, with full assurance of aid and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from him against their Enemies; this the Devil imitateth by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Oracles among the Heathen, to which all the Kings, Nations, and mighty Conquerors upon Earth did come and paid their humblest A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration to the God (as the Devil blasphemously call'd himself) of the Temple, in which they were imploring his direction and assistance in their doubtful and prosperous affairs. Again, God instituted Sacrifices to put Men in mind of their duty to their Creator, to whom they owe all things, even themselves; but the Devil is not contented with the bare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>imitation hereof; the acknowledgment and worship he receiveth from the deluded World is not enough, tho they offer up unto him innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Hecatombs, unless they cause their Children to pass through the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49354:44"/>
fire unto him. to whom no sacrifice is so well pleasing, as that of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood. And there is no reason to think, that now under the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the Gospel, the Devil hath left off to vie with God, and thereby to ensnare Men. No, it is rather to be feared that his Kingdom doth now more prevail, for by how much the light is greater; so much greater is their condemnation, who do not receive it: it is reasonable to suppose that (seeing the Son of God, when he came to transact with Men, the wonderful Covenant of their Redemption, took upon him their Nature, and was perfect Man) the Devil likewise doth counterfeit the same, in appearing in an humane shape to them, who receive him, and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate themselves with him, and become his Vassals.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Consider, It is not probable that those false Apostles mention'd, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. erred only in Ceremonies or Circumstances, or that their Errors, tho great, did proceed rather from their Ignorance, than from the perverseness of their minds. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. For, for such we may have charity and hope, that God will be merciful unto them, if they sincerely do the best they know, tho they dissent in some, nay many things, from the practices and belief of the Christian Church; but those St. <hi>Paul</hi> threatens with a heavy curse, that their end shall be according to their works; therefore it seems they immediately struck at the very root and being of the Christian Religion, and were the same with them spoken of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. but with this difference, that they did not resist, but behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miracles and Signs which were done by the true Apostle of our Lord, wondered and believed also, and were Baptized; yet being Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers they were unwilling to loose that great esteem they had obtain'd; as it is related of <hi>Simon,</hi> who had bewitched the People of <hi>Samaria,</hi> giving out that he himself was some great one, to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, laying, this Man is the great Power of Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, therefore he could not brook that <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> should have a greater Power than himself; but offered them Money, that on whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eve he laid hands he (that person) should receive the Holy Ghost; which shews him, who thus designed to make Merchandize of the B. Spirit, tho Baptized, to have been no true believer, but still a Sorcerer in the Gall of bitterness, and in the bond of Iniquity; such were those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful workers, who not being able barefaced to resist, did put on Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity as a Mask, that they might undermine the truth, and introduce the Doctrines of Devils. <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Paphos,</hi> were not the only two places where the Devil had such Agents, there was no part of the Earth where his Kingdom was not Established, and where he had not his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries before the preaching of the Gospel; and since the Text telleth us, he hath his Ministers, who do imitate their Master, by being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the Apostles of Christ, as he himself is transformed into an
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49354:44"/>
Angel of light: whose design, in being thus transformed, cannot be to impose upon the Almighty; for whatever shape he appears in, he cannot hide his ugliness from the Eyes of him who is Omniscent, therefore he appeareth thus in the shape of an Angel of light, either to tempt and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the blessed Spirits to rebel against God, or to ensnare wicked Men, who by their hainous crimes (being lovers of themselves, covetous, boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, proud blasphemers) were before disposed to be fit Instruments to serve him, and to enter into league with him. Surely I who am ignorant of the Laws by which the Intellectual World is govern'd, dare not affirm that it is impossible for Satan so to appear, as to hide his deformities from the good Angels, and under that vail to tempt them. But certain I am that it is more consonant to Reason, to think that the Apostles intention here was to reach that the Devil appear'd as a glorified Angel unto Men to gain Ministers, whom he might imbue with the Poyson of his Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Art, and (when he had gotten full possession of them) instruct them by his own Example to transform themselves into the Apostles of Christ, that under that Vizard they might with the greater Advantage promote his ends, and join with him in doing the utmost despite to the Spirit of Grace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Consideration, It is against the Nature of this Covenant, that is should be consuminated by a mental Colloquy, between the Devil and the Witch. I know not how many Articles it consists of, but it is certain from what has been already proved, that the renouncing of Christ to be the Son of God, and owning the Devil to be, and worshipping him as God, are the two chief, to which our Saviour who was accused of casting out Devils by Beelzebub (<hi>i.e.</hi>) of being confederated with Beelzebub) was tempted to consent: <hi>If thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread</hi>: And again, <hi>throw thy self down from hence, for it is written, he will give his Angels charge over thee; and again all these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me</hi>: Whence it is evident that here the Devil laboured to insinuate into our Lord, either to do things rash and unwarrantable, or to suspect his Son-ship, revolt from God his Father, and worship Satan, that he might obtain the glory of the World. Now it has been already said, that when Jesus was tempted, the Devil appeared unto him in a bodily shape; therefore it is agreeable to Reason, that he doth appear in the same manner to all them, whom he also tempteth to worship him: moreover the form of renouncing a Covenant ought to bear resemblance to the form of entring into the same Covenant; therefore Men who are received into the Mystical Body of Christ by God's Minister, who in God's stead expresly covenanteth with and then Administreth the Sacrament of Baptism unto them, must in the like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner go out of, or renounce the said Covenant; and of them there are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49354:45"/>
two sorts, one who through the perverseness of their own hearts, the luere of the World, the fear of Men more than of God abjure their Saviour, turn Apostates, Turks, or Pagans; The other sort is of them who do contract with the Devil to be his Subjects, in the imitation of whom, it is not to be supposed that the Devil will omit any material Circumstances, which tend both to bring them into and confirm them in his Service. To effect which his outward appearance, when he receives his Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens is of greater force than any mental contract, for many wicked men who have denied God and Christ not only in their practice, but also blasphemously in profession, yet have repented, and at last obtained some hope of mercy; I dare not say it is impossible for a Witch to repent and find mercy, the secrets of the Almighty are too high for me; but it is certain, these wretches are strangely hardned, by what passes between them and the Devil in a bodily shape, particularly their worshipping him, which necessarily implies his outward appearance unto them; for no man can apete Evil as Evil, because the Law of self preservation deeply rooted in all men, determineth their wills to pursue that which seems good, and fly from that which seems evil unto them, but the inbred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that every man has of the Devil, is that he is an Enemy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of mankind, therefore every man hath a Natural aversion from him, and consequently cannot formally worship him as such, because the object of worship must be esteemed to be propitious and placable by the worshippers, otherwise if fear alone be the adequate cause of Adoration, it follows that the Devils and damned in Hell do worship God, which is contrary to Scripture, which faith they blasphemed, because of their pains, whence it follows, that they who worship the Devil must have changed the innate Idea that they had of him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is an in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Worrier of Men, and take him to be benign at least to his own; but this change cannot be wrought by any suggestion of Satan unto the minds of Men, whom indeed he mentally tempteth to Lust, Pride and Malice; but it is his greatest Artifice to cause his Insinuations to and in the hearts of Men, as their own natural thoughts, and if conscience discovers their Author and opposes them, then he varnishes them over with the specious colours of pleasure, honour and glory; and so repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents them as really good, to be willed and desired by the Soul, which judgeth of all things without according to the Ideas she hath of them; but because most objects have two, and some many faces, and she not always attends, therefore she often errs in her choice, nevertheless it is impossible for her to apete an object, whose simple Idea is Evil; but the Idea we have of the Devil is such, for we cannot represent him an our minds any otherwise than as the great destroyer of Men, therefore no mental temptation can make us believe this our grand Enemy to be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49354:45"/>
ever Exorable by, or in any measure favourable to us, whence it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, that the Devil to work this change of opinion his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Upon no other consideration is it possible for any Man to worship the Devil? for the Atheists, who deny the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, do likewise deny the Existence of any Spirit good or bad; therefore their drinking the Devils health, even upon their knees (tho a most horrid Crime) cannot be construed any part of worship paid to him, whom they assert to be a Chimera, a meer figment of States men to keep the vulgar in awe. Now I have evinced to you that there are Witches, that the Witch receiveth power from the Devil to do strange things, that there is an express Covenant between the Devil and the Witch, that this Covenant cannot be transacted mentally, but that the Devil must appear in a bodily shape to the Witch; therefore I conclude, that a Witch in the Scripture is such, who has made an Explicit Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Devil, and is impowered by him to do things strange in themselves, and beside their natural course.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49354:46"/>
venture to make use of an Argument, which sheweth neither Art nor Learning in the Author, and it is this, that seeing there are Witches, and that the Law of God doth command them to be put to death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be means to Convict them, by clear and certain Proof, otherwise the Law were in vain; for no Man can be justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who is not fairly convicted by full and certain Evidence.</p>

                        <hi>III. S.</hi> In the last place we are to inquire whether a Witch ought to be put to death or no? you Answer in the <hi>Negative</hi>; because you say that that Law, thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live, is <hi>Iudicial,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth only to the People of the <hi>Iews</hi>; but our Saviour, or his Apostles have not delivered any where any such command, therefore they ought to be suffered to live, this indeed seems somewhat plausible at first view, but upon through Examination hath no weight in it at all for these Reasons, 1. All Penal Laws receive their Sanction from him or them, who have the soveraign Power in any state, as thou shalt not commit Adultery, is a Moral-law, and obligatory over the Consciences of Men in all places and Ages; but the Adulterers shall be put to death is a judicial law, and in force only in that state, where it is enacted by the Soveraign. 2. The Government of the <hi>Iews</hi> was a Theocracy, and God himself did condescend to be their King, not only as he is King of Kings; for in that sense he is, always was, and ever will be supream Lord, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all his Creatures; but in an especial manner to give them Laws for the Government of their State, and to protect them against their Enemies; in one word to be immediately their Soveraign. 3. Our Saviour's Kingdom was not of this World, he was no Judge to divide so much as an Inheritance between two Brethren; nay, he himself sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted patiently to the unjust Sentance of the Governour of the Country in which he lived; therefore both the rewards and punishments annexed to his Laws are Spiritual, and then shall have their full accomplishment, when the Son of Man at the last day shall pronounce, <hi>Come unto me ye blessed, and depart ye cursed into Everlasting fire.</hi> 4. That Soveraigns who have received the Gospel of our Lord, have not therefore lost their Power of enacting Laws for the ruling and preserving their People, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Malefactors even with Death; so that the Criminal is as justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die by our Municipal, as he was heretofore by the Judicial Law among the Jews: How much more then ought our Law to advert against the highest of all Criminals, those execrable Men and Women, who tho yet alive, have listed themselves under Satan's banner, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly Sworn Allegiance to him, to fight against God and Christ; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all unholy Men afford great matter to the Devils of Blaspheming, but these wretches have confederated themselves with the Devils, to blaspheme and destroy all they can; and do you think that these common
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49354:46"/>
Enemies of God and Mankind ought to be suffered to live in a Christian Common wealth, especially considering that we have a President of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to death from God himself, when he acted as King over his own peculiar People. But me thinks I hear you saying, all this doth not satisfie me, for I am sure nothing can be added to the Devils Malice, and if he could, he certainly would appear and frighten all Men out of their wits. I Answer, 1. We must not reject a truth, because we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve all the Questions that may be proposed about it; otherwise all our Science must be turned into Sceptism, for we have not a Comprehensive knowledge of any one thing. 2. When you say, that if the Devil could he would appear and frighten all Men; the Lawful consequence is not that he cannot appear at all, for we have undoubtedly proved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but that we are Ignorant of the bounds that the Almighty hath hath set to him, whose malice indeed, if he were not restrain'd, is so great as to destroy all Men; but the goodness of our God is greater, who hath given us means to escape his fury, if we will give earnest heed to the Gospel of our Saviour, which only is able to comfort us against the sad and miserable condition of our present state, for not only the Devils, but likewise all do conspire against us to work our ruine: The deluge came and swept away all the race (save eight persons) of mankind: the Fire will in time devour what the Water has left, and all this cometh to pass because of Sin; but we who have received the Lord Jesus, look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness. Therefore he, if we purifie our selves as he is pure, will save us (for when he appears we shall be made like unto him; to whom be Glory for ever, <hi>Amen</hi>) from the great destruction that must come upon all the World, and the Inhabitants thereof.

                     <p>THAT great pains you have taken for my Information and Satisfaction in those controverted points relating to Witchcraft, whether it attain the end or not, cannot require less than suitable acknowledgments and gratitude, especially considering you had no particular obligation of office to it, and when others, whose proper Province it was had declined it. It is a great truth, [that the many Heresies among the Christians (nor the lying Miracles, or Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts used by some to induce to the worship of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) must not give a Mortal wound to Christianity or Truth;] but the great question in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49354:47"/>
points still is, what is truth. And in this search being agreed in the Iudge or Rule, there is great hopes of the Issue. That there are Witches is plain from that Rule of Truth, the Scriptures, which commands their punishment by Death. But what that Witchcraft is, or wherein it does consist is the whole difficulty. That head cited from Mr. <hi>Gaule,</hi> and so well proved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (not denied by any) makes the work yet shorter; so that it is agreed to consist in a Malignity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and seeking by a sign to seduce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other sorts or branches, when as well proved by that infallible Rule. That good Angels have appeared, is certain, tho that instance of those to <hi>Abraham</hi> may admit of a various construction; some Divines supposing them to be the Trinity, others that they were Men-messengers, as <hi>Judges</hi> 2.1. and others that they were Angels; but tho this as I said might admit of a debate, yet I see no question of the Angel-<hi>Gabriel</hi>'s appearance, particularly to the B. Virgin; for tho the Angels are Spirits, and so not perceptible by our bodily Eyes, without the appointment of the most high, yet he who made all things by his word in the Creation, can with a word speak things into Being. And whether the Angels did assume matter (or a Vehicle) and by that appear to the bodily Eye; or whether by the same word there were an Idea fram'd in the mind, which needed no Vehicle to represent them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Intellects, is with the All-wise, and not for me to dispute. If we poor shallow Mortals do not comprehend the manner how, that argues only our weakness. Two other times did this glorious Angel appear. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Dan</hi> 9.21. The first of these times was in Vision, as by the text and context will appear. The second was the same as at the first; which being considered, as it will ascertain that Angels have appear'd; so that 'tis at the will of the Sender how they shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, whether to the bodily Eye, or Intellect only. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. The appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Angel to <hi>Joseph</hi> was in a Dream, and yet a real appearance; so was there a real appearance to the Apostle, but whether in the body or out of the body he could not tell; and that they are sent and come not of their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.26. <hi>And in the sixth Month the Angel</hi> Gabriel <hi>was sent from God.</hi> Dan. 9.23. <hi>At the beginning of thy supplication the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came forth, and I am come,</hi> v. 21. <hi>Being caused to fly swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp;c. but from these places may be set down as undoubted truths or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<list>
                           <item>1. That the glorious Angels have their Mission and Commission from the most high.</item>
                           <item>2. That without this they cannot appear to mankind. And from these two will necessarily flow a third,</item>
                           <item>3. That if the glorious Angels, have not that power to go till commissioned, or to appear to Mortals, then not the fallen Angels; who are held in Chains of darkness, to the Iudgment of the great day. Therefore to argue, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the good Angels have appeared, the evil may or can; is to me as if —
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49354:47"/>
because the dead have been raised to life by Holy Prophets, therefore Men wicked Men can raise the dead. As the sufferings, so the temptations of our Saviour were (in degree) beyond those common to Man; he being the second <hi>Adam,</hi> or publick head, the strongest assaults were now improved; and we read that he was tempted, that he might be able to succour them that are tempted, as also that he was led of the Spirit into the Wilderness, that he might be tempted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But how the tempter appear'd to him who was God Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient; whether to the bodily Eye, or to the Intellect, is as far beyond my cognizance, as for a Blind Man to judge of Colours. But from the whole set down this fourth conclusion,</item>
                           <item>4. That when the Almighty Free Agent has a work to bring about for his own glory, or Man's good; he can imploy not only Blessed Angels, but the evil ones in it, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>And left I should be exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the Messenger of Satan to buffet me.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.14, 15.23. An evil Spirit from the Lord troubled him. It is a great truth, we understand little, very little, and that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things, how much less then in spirituals, such as are above humane cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance. - But tho upon the strictest Scrutiny in some natural things, we can only discover our own Ignorance, yet we must not hence deny what we do know, or suffer a Rape to be committed upon our Reason and Senses in the Dark; and say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Devil by his ordinary Power can act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <item>5. That when the Divine Being will imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As to the nature of Possessions by Evil Spirits, for the better understanding of it, it may be needful to compare it with its contraries; and to instance in <hi>Samson,</hi> of whom it was foretold, that he should begin to deliver <hi>Israel,</hi> and how was he inabled to this work? Iudges 13.25. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the Camp</hi>

                              <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49354:48"/>
                              <hi>the</hi> Philistines <hi>shouted against him, and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his Arms became as Flax, that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from his hands,</hi> &amp;c. I might instance further, but this may suffice to show that he had more than a natural strength, as also whence his strength was, <hi>viz.</hi> he was impowered by the Spirit from God. And now will any say, that it was not <hi>Samson,</hi> but the Spirit that did these things, or that there being things done, bonds broken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by a force that could not proceed from humane strength, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit entered into him, otherwise qualified than as me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

If any say this and more too, this doth not alter the truth, which remains, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Spirit of God did inable <hi>Samson,</hi> to the doing of things beyond his Natural strength. And now what remains but upon parity of Reason, to apply this to the case of Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, which may be summ'd up in this sixth Conclusion,</item>
                           <item>6. That God for wise ends, only known to himself, may and has impowered Devils to Possess and strangely to act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>e Bodies, even to the doing of things beyond the Natural strength of that body. And for any to tell of a Vehicle, or Matter used in it, I must observe that General Rule, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Beware left any spoil you through Philosophy, and vain deceit, after the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Christ.</hi> To come next to that of Witchcraft, and here taking that cited head of Mr. <hi>Gaul,</hi> to be uncontroverted, set it as a seventh Conclusion,</item>
                           <item>7. That Witchcraft consists in a maligning and oppugning the Word, Work and Worship of God, and seeking by any extraordinary sign to seduce any from it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.8, 10.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. Do but mark well the places, and for this very property of thus opposing and pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are all there concluded arrant and absolute Witches; and it will be easily granted, that the same that is call'd Witch, is call'd a false Christ, a fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> Prophet, and a Sorcerer, and that the terms are Synonimous; and that what the Witches aim at is to seduce the People to seek after other Gods. But here tht Question will be, whether the Witch do really do things strange in themselves, and beyond their natural course, and all this by a Power immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Devil. In this inquiry, as we have nothing to do with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written verities, so but little with Cabalistick Learning, which might perhaps but lead us more astray, as in the Instance of their charging our Saviour with casting out Devils by Beelzebub, his Answer is, if Satan be divided against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, his Kingdom hath an end; But seeing all are agreed set this eighth Conclusion,</item>
                           <item>8. That God will not give his testimony to a lye. To say that God did at any time impower a Witch to work Wonders, to gain belief to the Doctrine of Devils, were with one breath to destroy root and branch all revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49354:48"/>
And hence 'tis clear the Witch has no such wonder-working Power from God; and must we then conclude she has such a Miraculous Power from the Devil; if so, then it follows that either God gives the Devil leave to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the Witch to make use of this Seal, in order to deceive, or else that the Devil has this Power independent of himself; to assert the first of these were in effect to say, that tho God will not give his testimony to a lye, yet that he may impower the Devil to set to Gods own Seal, in order to deceive; and what were this but to overthrow all revealed Religion. The last if asserted must be to own the Devil to be an unconquered Enemy, and consequently a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Deity, and deserving much thanks, that he exerts his Power no more. Therefore in this Dilemma it is Wisdom for shallow Mortals to have recourse to their only guide, and impartially to inquire, whether the Witches really have such a Miraculous or Wonder-working Power? And 'tis remarkable, that the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. Reckons up Witchcraft among the Works of the flesh, which were it indeed a Wonder-working Power, received immediately from the Devil, and wholly beyond the Power of Nature; it were very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to place it with Drunkenness, Murthers; Adulteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all manifest fleshly works. 'Tis also remarkable, that Witchcraft is generally in Scripture joined with spiritual Whoredom, <hi>i. e.</hi> Idolatry. This thence will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be the same, only pretending to a sign, in order to deceive, seems to be yet a further degree, and in this Sense <hi>Manasseh</hi> and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.6. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.22. used Witchcraft and Whoredoms, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 3.4. The Idolatrous City is called, Mistress of Witchcrafts. But to instance in one place instead of many, that 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. from the 3 to the 12. <hi>v.</hi> particularly 9, and 10. <hi>v.

And hence do set down this nineth Conclusion.</item>
                           <item>9. That the Man of Sin, or Seducer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes use of lying wonders to the end to deceive, and that God in Righteous Iudgment <hi>may send strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions that they should believe a lye, that they might be damn'd, who believe not the truth,</hi> &amp;c.</item>

next head should have been about an Explicit Covenant, between the Witch and the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in this, the whole of it I cannot perswade my self but you must be sensible of an apparent leaning to Education (or tradition) the Scriptures being wholly silent in it; and supposing this to fall in as a depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent on what went before shall say the less to it; for if the Devil has no such Power to communicate, upon such compact, then the whole is a Fiction; tho I cannot but acknowledge you have said so much to uphold that Doctrine, that I know not how any could have done more; however, as I said, I find not my self ingaged (unless Scripture proof were offered) to meddle with it. For as you have in such cases your Reason for your guide, so I must be allowed to use that little that I have, do only say, that as God is a Spirit, so he must be worship'd in spirit and truth. So also that the Devil is a Spirit, and that his rule is in the hearts of the Children of Disobedience, and that an Explicit Covenant of one nature or another can have little force, any further than as the heart is engaged in it. And so I pass to the last, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a Witch ought to be put to death. And without accumulation of the offence do Iudge, that where the Law of any Countrey is to punish by death such as seduce and tempt to the worship of strange Gods (or Idols, or Statues) by as good Authority may they (no doubt) punish these as Capital Offenders, who are distinguished by that one remove, <hi>viz.</hi> to their seducing is added a sign, <hi>i. e.</hi> they pretend to a sign in order to seduce. And thus worthy Sir, I have freely given you my thoughts upon yours, which you so much obliged me with the sight of, and upon the whole, tho I cannot in the general but commend your Caution in not asserting many things contended for by others; yet must say, that in my esteem there is retain'd so much as will secure all the rest (to instance) if a Spirit has a Vehicle, <hi>i. e.</hi> some portion of matter which it acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hence as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily may be inferred that Doctrine of <hi>Incubus</hi> and <hi>Succubus,</hi> and why not also that of Procreation by Spirits both good and bad? Thus was <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> the <hi>Brittish Merlin,</hi> and <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and many others said to be begotten. Again if the Witch has such a Wonder-working Power, why not to afflict? will not the Devil thus far gratifie l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And have none this Mirac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Power, but the Covenanting Witch? then the offence lyes in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, then 'tis not only hard, but Impossible to to find a Witch by such Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as the Law of God requires; for it will not be supposed that they call Witness to this Covenant; therefore it will here be necessary to admit of such as the nature of such Covenant will bear (as Mr. <hi>Gaul</hi> hath it in his 5th. head, <hi>i. e.</hi>) the testimony of the afflicted, with their Spectral sight, to tell who afflicts themselves or others; the experiment of saying the Lords Prayer, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the sight, and rising at the touch, searching for Tets (<hi>i. e.</hi> Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scencies of Nature) strange and foreign stories of the Death of some Cattle, or ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>SInce your design of giving Copies of our Papers (if not to the publick at least) out of your hands, I find my self obliged to make a Reply to your Answer, left silence should be construed an Assent to the positions whereby I think) truth would be scandaliz'd. I remember that some have taught that it is not certain there is any such thing really in being as matter; because the Ideas which we have of our own, and all other bodies, may be caused to arise in us by God, without the real existence of the objects they represent. But this opinion is not only absurd and false, but likewise Atheistical, destroying the veracity of the Almighty, whom it asserts to have determin'd us by a fatal necessity to believe things to be which are not; and I wonder that you should allude unto it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Angels have appeared in a Dream, in a Vision; for we dream also of Trees, Birds, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> are there therefore no such things in nature, because we sometimes Dream to see and hear them, when we are asleep? St <hi>Paul</hi> in his Vision was so far from believing the Objects that were represented to him, to come by the intermedium of his Senses, that he declares, he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49354:50"/>
does not know whether he was in the body, or out of the body; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Instance is in no wise proper. For <hi>Abraham</hi> and the B Virgin did see and hear; and if there were not such things really, as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to them by their Senses, they were deluded, by being made to believe they saw and heard what was not. There is none who denieth God causing thoughts to arise in Mens minds: but thence to infer he maketh Objects which are not, by forming their Ideas in our minds, to appear to us through the Ministry of our Senses as tho they were, is a piece not only of vain, but very dangerous Philosophy. It is true, the good Angels will not appear without the appointment of God, they will not do any one Action, but according to the laws he has prescribed to them. But you say they cannot (which does not follow from your premises) sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing their not appearing to proceed from the defect of their power, and not the rectitude of their will, which fallacy has deceived you into a third Conclusion. For the fallen Angels are not so held under Chains of darkness; but that they can, and do go to fro on the earth seeking whom they may devour. Before their fall they could have appeared if sent, and would not then do any thing without a Divine Command But now they have rebell'd against God, and do all they can to despise him, therefore their not appearing now (if it were true they never did, they never shall appear) must proceed from a restraint they are under, which is accidental not, Essential to their nature; so that the true Conclusion is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fallen Angels, while they are under forcible restraint from God to the contrary cannot appear. But what this (being clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d from the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity you express it in) maketh to the purpose I know not, unless God had promised for a determinate time to detain them under this restraint, I do not understand what you intend by the dead being raised by Holy Men; the most natural inference is, that in imitation of them wicked men by their Inchantments, calling on a <hi>Damon</hi> to appear in the shape of the dead, will pretend that they also can raise the dead. The <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists</hi> are much obliged to you for making Transubstantiation (so much contended for by them) to be of as old a date as the appearance of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and that the one implieth no more contradiction than the other: If so we do well to think seriously whether we are not guilty of great sin in separating from them; for certainly whatever private Mens Notions in this Age may be, yet it is matter of great moment, that all Antiquity (the <hi>Saduce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> the Elder Brethren of our Hobbists excepted) hath believed the appearance of Evil Spirits and their Illusions. I should be too offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous if I offered to explain, how matter, real matter may fall under the cognisance of one of our senses, and not the rest. It is for you to shew the impossibility thereof, if you will build any thing upon your Assertion, to prove which your first Argument is (it seems to me) a Chimera, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49354:50"/>
is not enough, when there are many to whom it seems to be a truth: Your second is very dangerous, and highly derogatory of the honour of God, between whom and the Devil you make comparison more than once as the power of the Almighty must not be confined to be less than the Devils. And again, to deny these three last were to make the Devil an Independent Power and consequently a God. These expressions (which cannot but be very pleasing to the Devil, who vainly boasts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a Being without dependance) are altogether groundless, and very unmeet to proceed from a Christian: Consider what you are a doing, to establish a Doctrine (the contrary whereof the greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind does believe) you run upon such precipices, as if you are mistaken, and that is not impossible, must totally destroy all Religion, Natural and Revealed; for suppose it were generally believed according to you, that the Devil cannot appear, because if he could he must be a God, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, an unconquer'd Enemy, and he doth appear to us as we hear he hath to multitudes, both of the past and present ages: In such a case what remains for us to do; but to fall down and worship him. Upon the head of possession, you have recourse to that instance of <hi>Samson,</hi> who was impowered by God, to the doing of things beyond the Natural strength of common Men, and thence you say, we may least learn the Nature of Possession by evil Spirits, this comparison is indeed very odious, and I had rather think you have fallen into it unawares; for what greater Blasphemy than that God and the Devil do act the bodies, which the one and the other do possess in the same manner; if the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis I laid down had not pleased you, yet you ought not (for fear of being deceiv'd by vain Philosophy, to have run so horrible an extream, as to Assimulate God's manner of working to the Devils, which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily implies, that either their Powers are equal, or at least that they do not diffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in kind but in degree only; than which nothing can be more impious or absurd: for the most possibly perfect Creature, is infinitely distant from the Creator, and there can be no Comparison between them. On the head of Witchcraft, you acknowledge the Witch has not his Wonder-working Power from God; but then you say, the Devil has no such Power to give; for if he had, he must be — This way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning as I noted before, is very dangerous, and I think ought not to be used; besides there is a great fallacy in your Dilemma; which because I perceive, you lay the whole weight of the matter upon it, I will evince unto you. The Devil tho superlatively Arrogant and Proud, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less depends on the first cause for his Being, and all his Powers, without whose Influx he or any other Creature cannot subsist a moment, but must either return to their primitive Nothing, or be continually preserved by the same Power, by the which they were at first produced; therefore the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49354:51"/>
Beings and Powers of all Creatures (because they immediately flow from God) are good, and consequently the simple Actions, as they proceed from those Powers, are in their own nature likewise good, the Evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding only from the Rebellious will of the Creature, wherefore 'tis no Paradox, but a certain truth, that the same Action in respect of the first cause is good, but in respect of the second is Evi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; for instance, the act of Copulation is in it self good, instituted by God, and may be explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willed and desired by the Soul, which sinneth not for exerting the simple Act; but for exerting it contrary to the Laws prescrib'd by God: as in Wedlock and Adultery there is the same specifical natural Action, which consider'd simply, as flowing from a Power given to Man by God is certainly good; but considered with relation to the rebellious will of the Adulterer (who lieth with his Neighbours Wife, whom he is forbid to touch) is a very great Evil. We may say the same of all humane Actions, the Executioner and the Murtherer do the same natural Act of striking and killing: The difference consists in the rectitude of the ones and depravation of the others will. These things premised, what more reason have we to conclude that the Devil (because he shews signs and wonders to gain belief to lyes, which is very contrary to the will of God) must be therefore an Independent Power; than that the Adulterer, the Murtherer, or any other sinner (because their Actions being Evil, of which God cannot be the cause) must be Independent Beings: The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the last is very palpable, and I doubt not but you will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, for it is obvious from what has been said to the meanest Capacity, to distinguish between the Action it self, which is good, and flows from God, and the Circumstances of the Action, the choice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of proceeds from the Iniquity of the Will, wherein doth solely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Sin; the parallel is so exact, that I cannot see the least shadow of reason, why we ought not in like manner to distinguish whatever effect is produced by the Devil; To whom (as to Man) God having given Powers, and a Will to Rule them Powers, is truly and properly the cause of all the Actions (in a Natural, but not Moral Sense) that flow from the Powers he has given. Therefore the Wonder-working Power of the Devil, and the effects thereof, considered as Acts of one of God's. Creatures, are not Evil but Good; the using that Power (which proceeds from the Rebellion of Satan) to bear testimony to a lye, is that one, which constitutes the Evil thereof.</p>
                     <p>And now I have done with your Argument, wherein you have indeed shewn great skill and dexterity in turning to your Advantage, what being fairly stated makes against you, as the Appearance of Angels, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving nicely the rules of Art, and particularly that grand one of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing, nay dissembling the same Art, as when you quote that Scripture
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49354:51"/>
concerning vain Philosophy (of which tho altogether foreign from the matter in hand yet) you intend to serve your self with the Unthinking, who measure the Sense of words by their Jingle, not knowing how to weigh the things they signifie, and truly herein your end is very Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; for you intend both to throw dirt at them that differ from you, and at the same time to cover your self with such a subtle web, through which you may see, and not be seen. What follows, is rather a Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Lecture, such as the Patriots of Sects (who commonly Explain the Holy Scriptures according to their own Dogma's, and so obtrude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Invention for the pure word of God) use with their Auditors, to recommend any Principle they have a mind to establish, than an Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and through disquisition of a controverted point; wherefore I do not think my self obliged to take any further notice of it: especially seeing truth, which for the most part is little regarded in such florid Discourses, and not any prejudice of Education, Interest, or Party, did set me about this subject. I have never been used to Complement in points of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, therefore I hope you'l not be angry, because I have given you my thoughts naked and plain. I have not the least motion in my mind of accusing you of any formal design to injure Religion; I only observe unto you, that your over eager contention to maintain your Principle, has hurried you to assert many things of much greater danger, both in themselves and their consequences, than those you would seem to avoid; which do amount to no more then that, Men being (in the ordinary course of Providence) the Depositories of both Divine and Humane Laws, may (instead of using them to preserve) pervert them to destroy; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is very lamentable.</p>
                     <p>But it is the inevitable consequent of our depraved nature, and cannot be wholly remedied, till Sin, and the grand Author of Sin, the Devil, be intirely conquered, and God be all in all; to whom, with the Son, and Holy Ghost, be Glory for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

That 'tis as good an Argument to say, that because Holy Prophets have raised the dead, therefore wicked Men have a Power to raise the dead.

Satan provoked</hi> David <hi>to number the People.</hi> 2 Chron. 18.21. <hi>And the Lord said, thou shalt intice him, and thou shalt also prevail, go out and do even so</hi>; all which, with many more that might be produc'd, as they will shew the truth of the Conclusion; so that 'tis no odious Comparison to say, that as the Almighty can make use of Good, so also of Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, for the accomplishing of his own wise ends, and can impower either without the help of a Vehicle. For possessions must be numbred among Gods afflictive dispensations, who also orders all the Circumstances thereof. But if any object God is not the Author of Evil, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> you have furnish'd me with a very learned Answer, by distinguishing between the Act and the Evil of the Act, and to which 'tis adapt, but will no wise sute where it is placed, till it be first proved that the Devil hath of himself such Power not only of appearing at pleasure, but of working Miracles, and to the Almighty reserved only the Power of restraining; for till this be proved the Dilemma must remain stable. He that asserts that — Because good Angels have appeared, that therefore the fallen Angels have a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of themselves to appear to Mortals; And that they cannot be imployed by the Almighty; nor that he does not order the manner and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of such appearance, what doth he less than make the Devil an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Power, and consequently a God! So he that asserts that the Devil has a Power of himself, and Independent to work Wonders, and Miracles, and to impower Witches to do the like in order to deceive, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> What doth he less than own him to be an unconquered Enemy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently a Soveraign Deity! and who is it that <hi>is</hi> culpable? he that ascribes such Attributes to the Evil one, or he that asserts that the so doing gives him (or ascribes to him) such Power as is the prerogative of him only who is Almighty? And here Sir, it highly concerns you to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consider your foundations, what proof from Scripture is to be found for your Assertions; and who it is you are contending for. For hitherto no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a proof hath been offer'd from Scripture, which abounds so with the contrary, that he that runs may read, <hi>As shall there be evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it? who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not.</hi> Who among the Gods of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then (of which the Devil is one) can give Rain, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I shall not be tedious in multiplying proofs, to that which all seem to own. For as to that stale plea of Universality, do say that I have read of one, if not several, general Councels, that have not only disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, but Anathematiz'd them that have ascribed such Power to the Devils. And several National Protestant Churches at this day in their Exhortation before the Sacrament (among other Enormous Crimes) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish all that believe any such Power in the Witch, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> to withdraw as unmeet to partake at the Lords Table.</p>

                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:49354:53"/>And I believe Christians in general, if they were asked, would own that what Powers the Devil may at any time have to appear, to afflict, destroy, or cause tempests, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> must be by Power or Commission from the Soveraign Being. And that having such a Commission, not only Hail, but Frogs, Lice, or Flies shall be impowered to plague a great King and Kingdom. And if so, this Sandy Structure of the Devils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and working Wonders at pleasure, and of Impowering Witches to afflict, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> (for to this narrow Crisis is that whole Doctrine reduc'd) the whole disappears at the first shaking.</p>

               <p>The first complain'd of, was the said <hi>Indian</hi> Woman, named <hi>Tituba,</hi> she confessed that the <hi>Devil</hi> urged her to sign a Book, which he presented to her, and also to work Mischief to the Children, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> She was afterwards Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Prison, and lay there till Sold for her Fees.

               <p>The Children complained likewise of two other Women, to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of their Hurt, <hi>Viz.

               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> the 21<hi>st,</hi> Goodwife <hi>Cory</hi> was examined before the Magistrates of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> at the Meeting House in the Village; a throng of Spectators being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to see the Novelty.

should be Alledged against her, she desired that she might go to Prayer, and was answered by the Magistrates, that they did not come to hear her pray, but to examine her.</p>
               <p>The number of the Afflicted were at that time about Ten, <hi>Viz.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Pope,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Putman,</hi> Goodwife <hi>Bibber,</hi> and Goodwife <hi>Goodall, Mary Wolco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Elizabeth Parris,</hi> Daughter to the Minister, <hi>Abigail Williams</hi> his Neice, and <hi>Ann Putman,</hi> which last three, were not only the beginners, but were also the chief in these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations. These Ten were most of them present at the Examination, and did vehemently accuse her of Afflicting them, by Biting, Pinching, Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And they said, they did in their Fits see her likeness coming to them, and bringing a Book for them to Sign: Mr. <hi>Hathorn</hi> a Magistrate of <hi>Salem,</hi> asked her, why she Afflicted those Children? she said, she did not Afflict them, he asked her, who did then? she said, I do not know, how should I know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she said, they were Poor Distracted Creatures, and no heed to be given to what they said; Mr. <hi>Hathorn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> replied that it was the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that were there present, that they were bewitched, and only she (the Accused) said they were Distracted: She was Accused by them, that the <hi>Black Man</hi> Whispered to her in her Ear now (while she was upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and that she had a Yellow Bird, that did use to Suck between her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Accused had any motion of their Body, Hands or Mouth, the Accusers would cry out, as when she bit her Lip, they would cry out of being bitten, if she grasped one hand with the other, they would cry out of being Pinched by her, and would produce marks, so of the other motions of her Body, as complaining of being Prest, when she lean'd to the seat next her, if she stirred her Feet, they would stamp and cry out of Pain there. After the hearing the said <hi>Cory</hi> was committed to <hi>Salem</hi> Prison, and then their crying out of her abated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> the 24<hi>th,</hi> Goodwife <hi>Nurse</hi> was brought before Mr. <hi>Hathorn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Curwin</hi> (Magistrates) in the Meeting House, Mr. <hi>Hale</hi> Minister of <hi>Beverly,</hi> began with Prayer, after which she being Accus'd of much the same Crimes made the like answers, asserting her own Innocence with earnestness. The Accusers were mostly the same, <hi>Tho. Putmans</hi> Wife, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> complaining much. The dreadful Shreiking from her and others, was very amazing, which was heard at a great distance; she was also Committed to Prison.</p>
               <p>A Child of <hi>Sarah Goods,</hi> was likewise apprehended, being between 4 and 5 years Old, the Accusers said this Child bit them, and would shew such like marks, as those of a small Sett of Teeth upon their Arms, as many of the Afflicted as the Child cast its Eye upon, would complain they were in Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which Child they also Committed.</p>
               <p>Concerning these that had been hitherto Examined and Committed, it is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49354:54"/>
among other things observed by Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> (in Print) that they were by the Accusers charged, to belong to a Company that did muster in Arms, and were reported by them to keep Days of Fast, Thanksgiving and Sacraments; and that those Afflicted (or Accusers) did in the Assembly, Cure each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even with a touch of their Hand, when strangled and otherways tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and would endeavour to get to the Afflicted to relieve them thereby (for hitherto they had not used the Experiment of bringing the Accused to touch the Afflicted, in order to their Cure) and could foretel one anothers Fits to be coming, and would say, look to such a one, she will have a Fit presently and so it happened, and that at the same time when the Accused person was present, the Afflicted said they saw her <hi>Spectre</hi> or likeness in other places of the Meeting House Sucking of their Familiars.</p>
               <p>The said Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> being to Preach at the Village, after the <hi>Psalm</hi> was Sung, <hi>Abigail Williams</hi> said, <hi>Now stand up and name your Text,</hi> after it was read, she said, <hi>It is a long Text.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>April</hi> 1. <hi>Mercy Lewis</hi> affirmed, <hi>That she saw a man in White, with whom she went into a Glorious Place,</hi> viz. In her fits, <hi>where was no Light of the Sun, much less of Candles, yet was full of Light and Brightness, with a great Multitude in White Glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Robes, who Sang the Song in</hi> 5. Rev. 9. <hi>and the</hi> 110 <hi>and</hi> 149 Psalms; <hi>And was grieved that she might tarry no longer in this place.</hi> This <hi>White Man</hi> is said to have appeared several times to others of them, and to have given them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how long it should be before they should have another Fit.</p>

                  <hi>April</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> Being Sacrament Day at the Village, <hi>Sarah Cloys</hi> Sister to Goodwife <hi>Nurse,</hi> a Member to one of the Churches, was (tho' it seems with difficulty prevail'd with to be) present; but being entred the place, and Mr. <hi>Parris</hi> naming his Text, 6 <hi>Iohn,</hi> 70. <hi>Have not I chosen you Twelve, and one of you is a Devil</hi> (for what cause may rest as a doubt whether upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her Sisters being committed, or because of the choice of that Text) she rose up and went out, the wind shutting the Door forcibly, gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to some to suppose she went out in Anger, and might occasion a suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of her; however she was soon after complain'd of, examin'd and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>

coming to attend and assist her, as there might be need, the Accusers cryed out of him also, and that with so much earnestness, that he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with his Wife. About this time besides the Experiment of the Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falling at the sight, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> they put the Accused upon saying the Lords Prayer, which one among them performed, except in that petition [<hi>Deliver us from Evil</hi>] she exprest it thus [<hi>Deliver us from all Evil</hi>] this was lookt upon as if she Prayed against what she was now justly under, and being put upon it again, and repeating those words [<hi>Hallowed be thy Name</hi>] she exprest it [<hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy Name</hi>] this was counted a depraving the words, as signifying to make void, and so a Curse rather then a Prayer, upon the whole it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that she also could not say it, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Proceeding in this work of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Commitment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many were sent to Prison.

                              <hi>May,</hi> 14. 1692. Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> arrived with Commission from Their Majesties to be Governour, pursuant to the New-Charter; which he now brought with him; the Ancient Charter having been vacated by King <hi>Charles,</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> (by which they had a power not only to make their own Laws; but also to chuse their own Governour and Officers; and the Countrey for some years was put under an absolute Gom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission-Government, till the Revolution, at which time, tho more than two thirds of the People were for reassuming their ancient Covern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (to which they had encouragement by His then Royal Highness's Proclamation) yet some that might have been better imployed (in another Station) made it their business (by printing, as well as speaking) to their utmost to divert them from such a settlement; and so far prevailed, that for about seven Weeks after the Revolution, here was not so much as a face of any Government; but some few Men upon their own Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be called a Committee of Safety; but at length the Assembly prevailed with those that had been of the Government, to promise that they would reassume; and accordingly a Proclamation was drawn, but before publishing it, it was underwritten, that they would not have it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that they did reassume Charter-Government; so that between Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and no Government, this Countrey remained till Sir <hi>William</hi> arrived; Agents being in this time impowered in <hi>England,</hi> which no doubt did not all of them act according to the Minds or Interests of those that impowered them, which is manifest by their not acting jointly in what was done; so that this place is perhaps a single Instance (even in the best of Reigns) of a Charter not restored after so happy a Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>This settlement by Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> his being come Governour put an end to all disputes of these things, and being arrived, and having read his Commission, the first thing he exerted his Power in, was said to be his giving Orders that Irons should be put upon those in Prison; for tho for some time after these were Committed, the Accusers ceased to cry out of them; yet now the cry against them was renewed, which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned such Order; and tho there was partiality in the executing it (some having them taken off almost as soon as put on) yet the cry of these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers against such ceased after this Order.</p>

                              <hi>Being brought before the Iustices, her chief accusers were two Girls; my Wife declared to the Iustices, that she never had any knowledge of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that day; she was forced to stand with her Arms stretched out. I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest that I might hold one of her hands, but it was denied me; then she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired me to wipe the Tears from her Eyes, and the Sweat from her Face, which I did; then she desired she might lean her self on me, saying, she should faint.</hi>

                              <hi>Iustice</hi> Hathorn <hi>replied, she had strength enough to torment those persons, and she should have strength enough to stand. I speaking something against their cruel proceedings, they commanded me to be silent, or else I should be turned out of the Room. The</hi> Indian <hi>before mentioned, was also brought in, to be one of her Accusers: being come in, he now (when before the Iustices) fell down and tumbled about like a Hog, but said nothing. The Iustices asked the Girls, who afflicted the</hi> Indian? <hi>they answered she (meaning my Wife) and now lay upon him; the Iustices ordered her to touch him, in order to his cure, but her head must be turned another way, least instead of curing, she should make him worse, by her looking on him, her hand being guided to take hold of his; but the</hi> Indian <hi>took hold on her hand, and pulled her down on the Floor, in a barbarous manner; then his hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and the cure was quickly wrought. I being extreamly troubled at their Inhumane dealings, uttered a hasty Speech</hi> [That God would take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them, and desired that God would deliver us out of the hands of unmerciful men.] <hi>Then her Mittimus was writ. I did with difficulty andcharge obtain the liberty of a Room, but no Beds in it; if there had, could have taken but little rest that' Night, she was committed to</hi> Boston <hi>Prison; but I obtained a</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>to remove her to</hi> Cambridge <hi>Prison, which is in our County of</hi> Midldesex. <hi>Having been there one Night, next Morning the Iaylor put Irons on her legs (having received such a command) the weight of them was about eight pounds; these Irons and her other Afflictions, soon brought her into Convulsion Fits, so that I thought she would have died that Night, I sent to intreat that the Irons might be taken off, but all intreaties were in vain, if it would have saved her Life, so that in this condition she must continue. The Tryals at</hi> Salem <hi>coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on, I went thither, to see how things were there managed; and finding that the Spectre-Evidence was there received, together with Idle, if not malicious Stories, against Peoples Lives, I did easily perceive which way the rest would go; for the same Evidence that served for one, would serve for all the rest, I acquainted her with her danger; and that if she were carried to</hi> Salem <hi>to be tried, I feared she would never return. I did my utmost that she might have her Tryal in our own County, I with several others Petitioning the Iudge for it, and were put in hopes of it;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49354:57"/>
but I soon saw so much, that I understood thereby it was not intended, which put me upon consulting the means of her escape; which thro the goodness of God was effected, and she got to</hi> Road-Island, <hi>but soon found her self not safe when there, by reason of the pursuit after her; from thence she went to</hi> New-York, <hi>along with some others that had escaped their cruel hands; where we found his Excellency</hi> Benjamin Fletcher <hi>
                                 <abbr>Esq</abbr> Governour, who was very courteous to us. After this some of my Goods were seized in a Friends hands, with whom I had left them, and my self imprisoned by the Sheriff, and kept in Custody half a day, and then dismist; but to speak of their usage of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and their Inhumanity shewn to them, at the time of their Execution, no sober Christian could bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings; which is the more, considering what a People for Religion, I mean the profession of it, we have been; those that suffered being many of them Church-Members, and most of them unspotted in their Conversation, till their Adversary the Devil took up this Method for accusing them.</hi>

Mr.</hi> Gidney <hi>bid</hi> Aldin <hi>confess, and give glory to God</hi>; Aldin <hi>said he hoped he should give glory to God, and hoped he should never gratifie the Devil; but appealed to all that ever knew him, if they ever suspected him to be such a person, and challenged any one, that could bring in any thing upon their own knowledge, that might give suspicion of his being such an one. Mr.</hi> Gidney <hi>said he had known</hi> Aldin <hi>many Years, and had been at Sea with him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look'd upon him to be an honest Man, but now he did see cause to alter his judgment:</hi> Aldin <hi>answered, he was sorry for that, but he hoped God would clear up his Innocency, that he would recall that judgment again, and added that he hoped that he should with</hi> Job <hi>maintain his Integrity till he died. They bid</hi> Aldin <hi>look upon the Accusers, which he did, and then they fell down.</hi> Aldin <hi>asked Mr.</hi> Gidney, <hi>whát Reason there could be given, why</hi> Aldin's <hi>looking upon</hi> him <hi>did not strike</hi> him <hi>down as well; but no reason was given that I heard. But the Accusers were brought to</hi> Aldin <hi>to touch them, and this touch they said made them well.</hi> Aldin <hi>began to speak of the Providence of God, in suffering these Creatures to accuse Innocent persons, Mr.</hi> Noyes <hi>asked</hi> Aldin <hi>why he would offer to speak of the Providence of God, God by his Providence (said Mr.</hi> Noyes) <hi>governs the World, and keeps it in peace; and so went on with Discourse, and stopt</hi> Aldin's <hi>mouth, as to that.</hi> Aldin <hi>told Mr.</hi> Gidney, <hi>that he could assure him that there was a lying Spirit in them, for I can assure you that there is not a word of truth in all these say of me.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49354:58"/>
received her Sentence of Death, and was Executed, <hi>Iune</hi> 10. but made not the least Confession of any thing relating to Witchcraft.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That they were affected with the deplorable state of the afflicted; That they were thankful for the diligent care of the Rulers, to detect the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Witchcrafts, which have been committed in the Country, praying for a perfect discovery thereof. But advised to a cautious proceeding, least many Evils insue, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And that tenderness be used towards those accused, relating to matters presumptive and convictive, and also to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy in Examinations, and to consult Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> what tests to make use of in the Scrutiny: That Presumptions and Convictions ought to have better grounds, than the Accusers affirming that they see such persons Spectres afflicting of them: And that the Devil may afflict in the shape of good Men; and that falling at the sight, and ris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng at the touch of the Accused, is no infallible proof of guilt; That seeing the Devils strength consists in such Accusations, our disbelieving them may be a means to put a period to the dreadful Calamities; Nevertheless they humbly recommend to the Government, the speedy and vigorous prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such as have rendered themselves obnoxious, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection given in the Laws of God, and the wholesome Statutes of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, for the Detection of Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>This is briefly the substance of what may be seen more at large in <hi>Cases of Conscience. (ult.)</hi> And one of them since taking occasion to repeat some part of this advice, <hi>Wonders of the Invisible World,</hi> p. 83. declares, (notwithstanding the Dissatisfaction of others) that if his said Book may conduce to promote thankfulness to God for such Executions, he shall rejoyce, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Court according to Adjournment again fat; five more were tried, <hi>viz. Sarah Good,</hi> and <hi>Rebecca Nurse,</hi> of <hi>Salem</hi>-Village; <hi>Susanna Martin</hi> of <hi>Amsbury; Elizabeth How</hi> of <hi>Ipswich</hi>; and <hi>Sarah Wildes</hi> of <hi>Topsfield</hi>; these were all condemned that Sessions, and were all Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on the 19th. of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Tryal of <hi>Sarah Good,</hi> one of the afflicted fell in a Fit, and after coming out of it, she cried out of the Prisoner, for stabing her in the breast with a Knife, and that she had broken the Knife in stabbing of her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly a piece of the blade of a Knife was found about her. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately information being given to the Court, a young Man was called, who produced a Haft and part of the Blade, which the Court having viewed and compared, saw it to be the same. And upon inquiry the young Man affirmed, that yesterday he happened to break that Knife, and that he cast away the upper part, this afflicted person being then
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49354:59"/>
present, the young Man was dismist, and she was bidden by the Court not to tell lyes; and was improved after (as she had been before) to give Evidence against the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>At Execution, Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> urged <hi>Sarah Good</hi> to Confess, and told her she was a Witch, and she knew she was a Witch, to which she replied, you are a lyer; I am no more a Witch than you are a Wizard, and if you take away my Life, God will give you Blood to drink.</p>
               <p>At the Tryal of <hi>Rebecka Nurse,</hi> this was remarkable that the Jury brought in their Verdict not Guilty, immediately all the accusers in the Court, and suddenly after all the afflicted out of Court, made an hideous out-cry, to the amazement, not only of the Spectators, but the Court also seemed strangely surprized; one of the Judges exprest himself not satisfied, another of them as he was going off the Bench, said they would have her Indicted anew. The chief Judge said he would not Impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Jury; but intimated, as if they had not well considered one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Prisoners, when she was upon Tryal, <hi>viz.</hi> That when one <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who had confessed her self to be a Witch, was brought into the Court to witness against her, the Prisoner turning her head to her, said [<hi>What do you bring her? she is one of us</hi>] or to that effect, this together with the Clamours of the Accusers, induced the Jury to go out again, after their Verdict, not Guilty. But not agreeing, they came into the Court, and she being then at the Bar, her words were repeated to her, in order to have had her explanation of them, and she making no Reply to them, they found the Bill, and brought her in Guilty; these words being the Inducement to it, as the Foreman has signified in writing, as follows.</p>

               <p>After her Condemnation she was by one of the Ministers of <hi>Salem</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated; yet the Governour saw cause to grant a Reprieve, which when known (and some say immediately upon granting) the Accusers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their dismal outcries against her, insomuch that the Governour was by some <hi>Salem</hi> Gentleman prevailed with to recall the Reprieve, and she was Executed with the rest.</p>

               <p>When she came where the Afflicted were, being asked, they said they did not know her, at length one said, don't you know <hi>Iacobs</hi> the old Witch, and then they cry'd out of her, and fell down in their Fits; she was sent to Prison, and lay there Ten Months, the Neighbours of pitty took care of the Children to preserve them from perishing.</p>
               <p>About this time a New Scene was begun, one <hi>Ioseph Ballard</hi> of <hi>Andover,</hi> whose Wife was ill (and after died of a Fever) sent to <hi>Salem</hi> for some of those Accusers, to tell him who afflicted his Wife; others did the like: Horse and Man were sent from several places to fetch those Accusers who had the Spectral sight, that they might thereby tell who afflicted those that were any ways ill.</p>
               <p>When these came into any place where such were, usually they fell into a Fit; after which being asked who it was that afflicted the person, they would, for the most part, name one whom they said sat on the head, and another that sat on the lower parts of the afflicted. Soon after <hi>Ballard</hi>'s sending (as above) more than Fifty of the People of <hi>Andover</hi> were complained of, for afflicting their Neighbours. Here it was that many accused themselves, of Riding upon Poles through the Air; Many Parents believing their Children to be Witches, and many Husbands their Wives, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> When these Accusers came to the House of any upon such account, it was ordinary for other young People to be taken in Fits, and to have the same Spectral sight.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dudley Bradstreet,</hi> a Justice of Peace in <hi>Andover,</hi> having granted out Warrants against, and Committed Thirty or Forty to Prisons, for the supposed Witchcrafts, at length saw cause to forbear granting out any more Warrants. Soon after which he and his Wife were cried out of, himself was (by them) said to have killed Nine persons by Witchcraft, and found it his safest course to make his Escape.</p>
               <p>A Dog being afflicted at <hi>Salem</hi>-Village, those that had the Spectral sight being sent for, they accused Mr. <hi>Iohn Bradstreet</hi> (Brother to the Justice) that he afflicted the said Dog, and now rid upon him: He made his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape into <hi>Pescattequa</hi>-Government, and the Dog was put to death, and was all of the Afflicted that suffered death.</p>

               <p>A worthy Gentleman of <hi>Boston,</hi> being about this time accused by those at <hi>Andover,</hi> he sent by some particular Friends a Writ to Arrest those Accusers in a Thousand Pound Action for Defamation, with instructions to them, to inform themselves of the certainty of the proof, in doing which their business was perceived, and from thence forward the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations at <hi>Andover</hi> generally ceased.</p>

               <p>These Accusers swore that they saw three persons sitting upon Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Sister till she died; yet Bond was accepted for those Three.</p>

After Mr.</hi> Bernard <hi>had been at Prayer, we were blindfolded, and our hands were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their Fits, and falling into their Fits at our coming into their presence (as they said) and some led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they said they were well, and that we were guilty of afflicting of them; whereupon we were all seized as Prisoners, by a Warrant from the Iustice of the Peace, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with carried to</hi> Salem. <hi>And by reason of that suddain surprizal, we knowing our selves altogether Innocent of that Crime, we were all exceedingly astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and amazed, and consternated and affrighted even out of our Reason; and our nearest and dearest Relations, seeing us in that dreadful condition, and knowing our great danger, apprehending that there was no other way to save our lives, as the case was then circumstantiated but by our confessing our selves to be such and such persons, as the afflicted represented us to be, they out of tender love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pitty perswaded us to confess what we did confess. And indeed that Confession, that is said we made, was no other than what was suggested to us by some Gentlemen; they telling us, that we were Witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, and they knew that we knew it, which made us think that it was so; and our understanding, our reason, and our faculties almost gone; we were not capable of judging our condition; as also the hard measures they used with us, rendred us uncapable of making our Defence; but said any thing and every thing which they desired, and most of what we said, was but in effect a consenting to what they said. Sometime after when we were better composed, they telling of us what we had confessed, we did profess that we were Innocent, and Ignorant of such things. And we hearing that</hi> Samuel Wardwell <hi>had renounced his Confession, and quickly after Condemned and Executed, some of us were told that we were going after</hi> Wardwell.</p>

If in the midst of the many Dissatisfactions among us, the publication of these Tryals, may promote such a Pious thankfulness unto God, for Justice being so far executed among us, I shall rejoyce that God is glorified; and pray that no wrong steps of ours may ever sully any of his glorious works.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. This <hi>G. B.</hi> was Indicted for Witchcrafts; and in the Prosecution of the Charge against him, he was Accused by five or six of the Bewitched, as the Author of their Miseries; he was accused by Eight of the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Witches, as being an head Actor at some of their Hellish Randez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouzes, and who had the promise of being a King in Satan's Kingdom, now going to be erected; he was accused by Nine persons, for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary lifting, and such feats of strength as could not be done without a Diabolical Assistance. And for other such things he was accused, until about Thirty Testimonies were brought in against him; nor were these, judg'd the half of what might have been consider'd, for his Conviction: however they were enough to fix the Character of a Witch upon him, according to the Rules of Reasoning, by the Judicious <hi>Gaule,</hi> in that case directed.</p>

                              </gap>s, or Presumptions, brought in against one Indicted for Witchcraft, there were now heard the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of several Persons, who were most notoriously bewitched, and every day tortured by Invisible hands, and these now all charged the Spectres of <hi>G. B.</hi> to have a share in their Torments. At the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>G. B.</hi> the bewitched People were grievously harrassed, with preternatural Mischiefs, which could not possibly be dissembled; and they still ascribed it unto the Endeavours of <hi>G. B.</hi> to kill them. And now upon his Tryal, one of the bewitched persons testified, That in her <hi>Agonies</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Black-haired-Man came to her, saying his name was <hi>B.</hi> and bidding her set her hand unto a Book, which he showed unto her; and bragging that he was a Conjurer above the ordinary Rank of Witches; that he often persecuted her, with the offer of that Book, saying, she should be well, and need fear no body, if she would but sign it: but he inflicted cruel pains and hurts upon her, because of her denying so to do. The Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the other Sufferers concurred with these; and it was remarkable, that whereas Biting, was one of the ways, which the Witches used<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the vexing of the Sufferers, when they cry'd out of <hi>G. B.</hi> biting them, the print of his Teeth would be seen on the Flesh of the Complainers; and just such a sett of Teeth as <hi>G. B</hi>'s. would then appear upon them, which could be distinguished from those of some other Mens.</p>
                           <p>Others of them testified, that in their Torments <hi>G. B.</hi> tempted them to go unto a Sacrament, unto which they perceived him with a sound of Trumpet summoning of other Witches; who quickly after the sound would come from all quarters unto the Randezvouz. One of them fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a kind of Trance, afterwards affirmed, that <hi>G. B.</hi> had carried her into a very high Mountain, where he showed her mighty and glorious Kingdoms, and said he would give them all to her, if she would write in his Book; but she told him, They were none of his to give; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the Motions; enduring of much misery for that refusal.</p>
                           <p>It cost the Court a wonderful deal of trouble to hear the Testimonies of the Sufferers; for when they were going to give in their Depositions, they would for a long while be taken with Fits, that made them unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of saying any thing. The chief Judge asked the Prisoner, Who he thought hindred these Witnesses from giving their Testimonies? and he answered, He supposed it was the Devil. That Honourable person then replied, How comes the Devil so lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>h to have any Testimony born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you? VVhich cast him into very great confusion.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It hath been a frequent thing for the bewitched People, to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with Apparitions of Ghosts of murdered People, at the same time that the Spectres of the Witches trouble them. These Ghosts do always
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49354:66"/>
affright the beholders, more than all the other Spectral Representations; and when they exhibit themselves, they cry out of being murdered by the Witchcrafts or other Violences of the persons who are then in Spectre present. It is further considerable, that once or twice these Apparitions have been seen by others, at the very same time they have shown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the bewitched; and seldom have there been these Apparitions, but when something unusal and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>s appearing. Some that have been accused by these Apparitions, according of the bewitched People, who had never heard a word of any such persons ever being in the World, have upon a fair Examination, freely and fully confessed the Murders of those very persons, although these also did not know how the Apparitions had complained of them. Accordingly several of the bewitched had given in their Testimony, that they had been troubled with the Apparitions of two Women, who said they were <hi>G. B.</hi>'s two Wives; and that he had been the death of them; and that the Magistrates must be told of it, before whom, if <hi>B.</hi> upon his Tryal denied it, they did not know but that they should appear again in the Court. Now <hi>G. B.</hi> had been infamous, for the barbarous usage of his two successive Wives, all the Countrey over. Moreover, it was testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Spectre of <hi>G. B.</hi> threatning of the Sufferers told them he had killed: besides others) Mrs. <hi>Lawson</hi> and her Daughter <hi>Ann.</hi> And it was noted, that these were the Vertuous Wife and Daughter of one, at whom this <hi>G. B.</hi> might have a prejudice, for being serviceable at <hi>Salem</hi>-Village, from whence himself had in ill terms removed some Years before, and that when they dy'd, which was long since, there were some odd circumstances about them, which made some of the Attendants there suspect something of Witchcraft, though none imagined from what quarter it should come.</p>
                           <p>Well <hi>G. B.</hi> being now upon his Tryal, one of the bewitched persons was cast into horror at the Ghosts of <hi>B</hi>'s. two deceased Wives, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing before him, and crying for vengeance against him. Hereupon several of the bewitched persons were successively called in, who all, not knowing what the former had seen and said, concurred in their horror of the Apparition, which they affirmed, that he had before him. But he, though much appalled, utterly denied that he discerned any thing of it, nor was it any part of his Conviction.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Judicious writers have assigned it a great place, in the Conviction of Witches, when persons are Impeached by other notorious Witches to be as ill as themselves, especially if the persons have been much noted for neglecting the Worship of God. Now as there might have been Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies enough of <hi>G. B</hi>'s. Antipathy to Prayer, and the other Ordinances of God, though by his Profession singularly obliged thereunto; so there now came in against the Prisoner, the Testimonies of several persons, who
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49354:66"/>
confessed their own having been horrible Witches, and ever since their Confessions, had been themselves terribly tortured by the Devils and other Witches, even like the other Sufferers; and therein undergone the pains of many deaths for their Confessions.</p>
                           <p>These now testified, that <hi>G. B.</hi> had been at Witch-meetings with them; and that he was the person who had seduced and compelled them into the Snares of Witchcraft: that he promised them fine Cloaths for doing it; that he brought Poppets to them, and thorns to stick into those Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, for the afflicting of other People: And that he exhorted them, with the rest of the Crue, to bewitch all <hi>Salem</hi> Village; but be sure to do it gradually; if they would prevail in what they did.</p>
                           <p>When the <hi>Lancashire</hi> Witches were Condemned, I don't remember that there was any considerable further Evidence, than that of the bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and than that of some that had confessed. We see so much already against <hi>G. B.</hi> But this being indeed not enough, there were other things to render what had already been produced credible.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. A famous Divine, recites this among the Convictions of a Witch; the Testimony of the party bewitched, whether pining or dying; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Joint Oaths of sufficient persons, that have seen certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious pranks or feats, wrought by the party accused. Now God had been pleased so to leave this <hi>G. B.</hi> that he had ensnared himself, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral instances which he had formerly given of a preternatural strength; and which were now produced against him. He was a very puny Man, yet he had often done things beyond the strength of a Giant. A Gun of about 7 Foot barrel, and so heavy that strong Men could not steadily hold it out, with both hands; there were several Testimonies given in by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Credit and Honour, that he made nothing of taking up such a Gun behind the Lock with but one hand, and holding it out like a Pistol, at Arms-end. <hi>G. B.</hi> In his vindication was so foolish, as to say, that an <hi>Indian</hi> was there, and held it out, at the same time: whereas, none of the Spectators ever saw any such <hi>Indian</hi>; but they supposed the black Man (as the Witches call the Devil; and they generally say he resembles an <hi>Indian</hi>) might give him that Assistance. There was Evidence likewise brought in, that he made nothing of taking up whole Barrels fill'd with Mellasses, or Cyder, in very disadvantageous Postures, and carrying of them thro' the difficultest places, out of a Canoa to the Shore.</p>
                           <p>Yea, there were two Testimonies, that <hi>G. B.</hi> with only putting the Fore-finger of his right hand into the Muzzel of an heavy Gun, a fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piece of about six or seven foot Barrel; did lift up the Gun, and hold it out at Arms-end; a Gun which the Deponents, though strong men, could not with both hands lift up, and hold out at the Butt-end, as is usual. Indeed one of these Witnesses, was over-perswaded by some persons to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49354:67"/>
be out of way upon <hi>G. B</hi>'s. Tryal; but he came afterwards, with sorrow for his withdraw, and gave in his Testimony. Nor were either of these Witnesses made use of as Evidence in the Tryal.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. There came in several Testimonies, relating to the Domestick affairs of <hi>G. B.</hi> which had a very hard Aspect upon him; and not only proved him a very ill Man, but also confirmed the belief of the Character, which had been already fastned on him.</p>
                           <p>'Twas Testified, That keeping his two successive Wives in a strange kind of slavery, he would when he came home from abroad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to tell the talk which any had with them. That he has brought them to the point of Death, by his harsh dealings with his Wives, and then made the People about him to promise that in case Death should happen they would say nothing of it. That he used all means to make his VVives Write, Sign, Seal, and Swear a Covenant never to reveal any of his Secrets. That his Wives had privately complained unto the Neighbours about frightly Apparitions of Evil Spirit, with which their House was sometimes insested; and that many such things have been whispered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Neighbourhood. There were also some other Testimonies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the death of People, whereby the Consciences of an impartial Jury were convinced, that <hi>G. B.</hi> had bewitched the persons mention'd in the Complaints. But I am forced to omit several such passages in this as well as in all the succeeding Tryals, because the Scribes who took notice of them, have not supplied me.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. One Mr. <hi>Ruck,</hi> Brother in Law to this <hi>G. B.</hi> testified that <hi>G. B.</hi> and he himself, and his Sister, who was <hi>G. B</hi>'s. Wife, going out for two or three Miles, to gather Strawberries, <hi>Ruck</hi> with his Sister, the Wife of G. B. rode home very softly, with G. B. on foot in their company, G. B. stept aside a little into the Bushes; whereupon they halted and hollow'd for him. He not answering, they went away homewards, with a quickened pace; without any expectation of seeing him in a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able while: and yet when they were got near home, to their astonishment they found him on foot, with them, having a Basket of Strawberries, G. B. immediately then fell to chiding his Wife, on the account of what she had been speaking to her Brother of him on the Road: which when they wondered at, he said, He knew their thoughts. <hi>Ruck</hi> being start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at that, made some reply, intimating that the Devil himself did not know so far; but G. B. answered, my god, makes known your thoughts unto me. The Prisoner now at the Barr had nothing to answer unto what was thus witnessed against him, that was worth considering. Only he said, <hi>Ruck</hi> and his VVife left a man with him, when they left him. VVhich <hi>Ruck</hi> now affirm'd to be false; and when the Court ask'd G. B. VVhat the mans name was? His countenance was much altered; nor
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49354:67"/>
could he say who it was. But the Court began to think that he then stept aside, only that by the Assistance of the black Man, he might put on his invisibility, and in that fascinating Mist, gratifie his own jealous humour, to hear what they said of him. VVhich trick of rendering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves invisible, our VVitches do in their Confessions pretend that they sometimes are masters of; and it is the more credible, because there is demonstration that they often render many other things utterly invisible.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Faultring, Faulty, Unconstant, and contrary Answers, upon Judicial and deliberate Examination, are counted some unlucky symptoms of Guilt in all Crimes, especially in Witchcrafts. Now there never was a Prisoner more Eminent for them, than <hi>G. B.</hi> both at his Examination and on his Tryal. His Tergiversations, Contradictions, and Falsehoods, were very sensible: he had little to say, but that he had heard some things that he could not prove, Reflecting upon the Reputation of some of the Witnesses. Only he gave in a Paper to the Jury; wherein, altho' he had many times before granted, not only that there are Witches, but also that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Sufferings of the Countrey are the Effects of Horrible Witchcrafts, yet he now goes to evince it, that there neither are, nor ever were, Witches, that having made a compact with the Devil, can send a Devil to torment other People at a distance. This Paper was transcribed out of <hi>Ady</hi>; which the Court presently knew, as soon as they heard it. But he said, he had taken none of it out of any Book; for which his evasion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was, that a Gentleman gave him the Discourse in a Manuscript, from whence he transcribed it.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. The Jury brought him in Guilty; but when he came to dye, he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny'd the Fact, whereof he had been thus Convicted.</p>

                           <head>The Tryal of <hi>Bridget Bishop</hi> as Printed, <hi>In Wonders of Invisible World,</hi> June 2. 1692. <hi>P.</hi> 104, to 114.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>SHE was Indicted for bewitching of several persons in the Neighbourhood. The Indictment being drawn up, according to the form in such cases usual, and pleading not guilty, there were brought in several persons, who had long undergone many kinds of miseries, which were preternaturally inflicted, and generally ascribed unto an horrible Witchcraft. There was little occasion to prove the Witchcraft, it being evident and notorious to all beholders. Now to fix the Witchcraft on the Prisoner at the Bar, the first thing used was, the testimony of the bewitched; whereof several testified, that the shape of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49354:68"/>
Prisoner did oftentimes very grievously pinch them, choak them, bite them and afflict them; urging them to write their names in a Book, which the said Spectre call'd, Ours. One of them did further testifie, that it was the shape of this Prisoner, with another, which one day took her from her Wheel, and carrying her to the River side, threatned there to drown her, if she did not sign the Book mention'd, which yet she refused. Others of them did also testifie, that the said shape, did in her threats, brag to them, that she had been the death of sundry persons, then by her named. Another testified, the Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ghosts unto the Spectre of</hi> Bishop, <hi>crying out,</hi> You murdered us. <hi>About the truth whereof, there was in the matter of Fact, but too much suspicion.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>It was testified, that at the Examination of the Prisoner, before the Magistrates, the bewitched were extreamly tortured. If she did but cast her Eyes on them, they were presently struck down; and this in such a manner as there could be no collusion in the business. But upon the touch of her hand upon them, when they lay in their swoons, they would immediately revive; and not upon the touch of any ones else. Moreover upon some special Actions of her Body, as the shaking of her head, or the turning of her Eyes, they presently and painfully fell into the like postures. And many of the like accidents now fell out, while she was at the Bar. One at the same time testifying, that she said,</hi> She could not be troubled to see the Afflicted thus tormented.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>There was Testimony likewise brought in, that a Man striking once at the place, where a bewitched person said, the shape of this</hi> Bishop <hi>stood, the bewitched cryed out, that he had tore her Coat, in the place then particularly specified; and the Womans Coat was found to be torn in the very place.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>One</hi> Deliverance Hobbs, <hi>who had confessed her being a Witch, was now tormented by the Spectres for her Confession. And she now testified that this</hi> Bishop <hi>tempted her to sign the Book again, and to deny what she had confess'd. She affirmed, that it was the shape of this Prisoner, which whipped her with Iron Rods, to compel her thereunto. And she affirmed, that this</hi> Bishop <hi>was at a General-meeting of the Witches in a Field, at</hi> Salem-<hi>Village, and there partook of a Diabolical Sacrament, in Bread and Wine then admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>To render it further unquestionable, that the Prisoner at the Bar, was the Person truly charged in this Witchcraft; there were produced many Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of other Witchcrafts, by her perpetrated. For instance,</hi> John Cook <hi>testified, that about five or six Years ago, one morning about Sun-Rise, he was in his Chamber, assaulted by the shape of this Prisoner: which look'd on him, grinn'd at him, and very much hurt him, with a blow on the side of the head; and that on the same day about Noon, the same shape walked in the Room where he was, and an Apple strangely flew out of his hand, into the lap of his Mother, six or eight foot from him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">
                              <pb n="122" facs="tcp:49354:69"/>6. Samuel Gray <hi>testify'd, that about fourteen Years ago, he wak'd on a Night, and saw the Room where he lay full of light; and that he then saw plainly a Woman between the Cradle, and the Bed-side, which looked upon him. He rose, and it vanished; tho he found the Doors all fast: Looking out at the Entry door, he saw the same Woman in the same garb again; and said,</hi> In God's name, what do you come for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>He went to Bed, and had the same Woman again assaulting him. The Child in the Cradle gave a great S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ch, and the Woman disappeared. It was long before the Child could be quieted; and tho it were a very likely thriving Child, yet from this time it pined away, and after divers Months died in a sad condition. He knew not</hi> Bishop, <hi>nor her name; but when he saw her after this, he knew by her countenance, and apparel, and all circumstances, that it was the Apparition of this</hi> Bishop, <hi>which had thus troubled him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. John Bly <hi>and his Wife, testified, that he bought a Sow of</hi> Edward Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, <hi>the Husband of the Prisoner; and was to pay the price agreed unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person. This Prisoner being angry that she was thus hindred from fingring the Money, quarrel'd with</hi> Bly, <hi>soon after which the Sow was taken with strange Fitts, jumping, leaping, and knocking her head against the Fence, she seemed blind and deaf, and would neither eat nor be sucked. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Neighbour said,</hi> she believed the creature was over-looked; <hi>and sundry other circumstances concurred, which made the Deponents believe that</hi> Bishop <hi>had bewitched it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. Richard Coman <hi>testified, that Eight Years ago, as he lay awake in his Bed, with a light burning in the Room, he was annoyed with the Apparition of this</hi> Bishop, <hi>and of two more that were strangers to him; who came and oppressed him, so that he could neither stir himself, nor wake any one else: and that he was the Night after molested again in the like manner; the said</hi> Bishop <hi>taking him by the Throat, and pulling him almost out of the Bed. His Kinsman offered for this cause to lodge with him; and that night, as they were awake discoursing together, this</hi> Coman <hi>was once more visited by the Guests which had formerly been so troublesome, his Kinsman being at the same time struck speechless, and unable to move hand or foot. He had laid his Sword by him; which those unhappy Spectres, did strive much to wrest from him, only he held too fast for them. He then grew able to call the People of his house; but altho they heard him, yet they had not power to speak or stir, until at last, one of the People crying out,</hi> What's the matter! <hi>the Spectres all vanished.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="9">9. <hi>Samuel Shattock</hi> testified, that in the Year, 1680. This <hi>Bridget Bishop,</hi> often came to his house upon such frivolous and foolish Errands, that they suspected she came indeed with a purpose of Mischief. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently whereupon his Eldest Child, which was of as promising health and sense, as any Child of its Age, began to droop exceedingly; and the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49354:69"/>
oftner that <hi>Bishop</hi> came to the house, the worse grew the Child. As the Child would be standing at the Door, he would be thrown and bruised against the Stones, by an Invisible hand, and in like sort knock his face against the sides of the house, and bruise it after a miserable manner. Afterwards this <hi>Bishop</hi> would bring him things to Dye, whereof he could not Imagine any use; and when she paid him a peice of Money, the Purse and Money were unaccountably conveyed out of a lock'd Box, and never seen more. The Chlid was immediately hereupon taken with terrible Fits, whereof his friends thought he would have died: Indeed he did almost nothing but cry and sleep, for several Months together: and at length his understanding was utterly taken away. Among other Symptoms of an Inchantment upon him one was, that there was a Board in the Garden, whereon he would walk; and all the Invitations in the world could never fetch him off. About seventeen or eighteen Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there came a stranger, to <hi>Shattocks</hi> house, who seeing the Child said, <hi>This poor Child is bewitched; and you have a Neighbour living not far off who is VVitch.</hi> He added, <hi>Your Neighbour has had a falling out with your VVife; and she said in her heart, your VVife is a proud VVoman, and she would bring down her pride in this Child</hi>: He then remembred, that <hi>Bishop</hi> had parted from his Wife in muttering, and menacing terms, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Child was taken ill. The abovesaid stranger would needs carry the bewitched Boy with him, to <hi>Bishops</hi> House, on pretence of buying a Pot of Cyder. The Woman entertained him in furious manner; and flew also upon the Boy, scratching his face till the Blood came, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou Rogue, what? dost thou bring this fellow here to plague me</hi>? Now it seems the Man had said before he went, that he would fetch Blood of her. Ever after the Boy was followed with grievous Fits, which the Doctors themselves generally ascribed unto Witchcraft; and wherein he would be thrown still into the Fire or Water, if he were not constantly looked after; and it was verily believed that <hi>Bishop</hi> was the cause of it.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. <hi>Iohn Louder</hi> testified, that upon some little controversie with <hi>Bishop</hi> about her Fowls, going well to bed, he did awake in the Night by Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and did see clearly the likeness of this Woman grievously oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him. In which miserable condition she held him unable to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, till near day. He told <hi>Bishop</hi> of this; but she utterly denied it, and threatned him very much. Quickly after this, being at home on a Lord's Day, with the doors shut about him, he saw a black Pig approach him; at which he going to kick, it vanished away. Immediately after sitting down he saw a black thing jump in at the Window, and come and stand before him. The body was like that of a Monkey, the feet like a Cocks, but the face much like a Mans. He being so extremely affrighted, that he could not speak; this Monster spoke to him and said, <hi>I am a Messenger
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49354:70"/>
sent unto you, for I understand that you are in some trouble of Mind, and if you will be ruled by me, you shall want for nothing in this VVorld.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he endeavoured to clap his hands upon it; but he could feel no substance, and it jumped out of the Window again; but immediately came in by the Porch, though the doors were shut, and said, <hi>You had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter take my counsel</hi>! He then struck at it with a stick, but struck only the Groundsel, and broke the stick. The Arm with which he struck was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently disenabled, and it vanished away. He presently went out at the back door, and spied this <hi>Bishop,</hi> in her Orchard, going toward her House; but he had not power to set one foot forward unto her. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon returning into the House, he was immediately accosted by the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster he had seen before; which Goblin was now going to fly at him: whereat he cried out, <hi>The whole Armour of God be between me and you</hi>! so it sprang back, and flew over the Apple-tree; shaking many Apples off the Tree in its flying over. At its leap, it flung dirt with its Feet, against the Stomach of the Man; whereon he was then struck dumb, and so continued for three Days together. Upon the producing of this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>Bishop</hi> denied that she knew this Deponent. Yet their two Orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards joined, and they had often had their little quarrels for some Years together.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. <hi>VVilliam Stacy</hi> testified, that receiving Money of this <hi>Bishop,</hi> for work done by him, he was gone but a matter of three Roods from her, and looking for his Money, found it unaccountably gone from him. Some time after, <hi>Bishop</hi> asked him whether his Father would grind her Grist for her? He demanded why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she replied, because folks count me a Witch. He answered, no question, but he will grind it for you; being then gone about six Roods from her, with a small load in his Cart, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly the off Wheel slumpt, and sunk down into an hole, upon plain ground, so that the Deponent, was forced to get help for the recovering of the Wheel. But stepping back to look for the hole which might give him this disaster, there was none at all to be found. Some time after he was waked in the Night; but it seemed as light as day, and he perfectly saw the shape of this <hi>Bishop,</hi> in the Room troubling of him, but upon her going out, all was dark again. He charg'd <hi>Bishop</hi> afterwards with it, and she denied it not; but was very angry. Quickly after, this Deponent having been threatned by <hi>Bishop,</hi> as he was in a dark Night going to the Barn, he was very suddainly taken or lifted from the ground, and thrown against a Stone-wall; after that he was again hoisted up, and thrown down a bank, at the end of his House. After this, again passing by this <hi>Bishop,</hi> his Horse with a small load, striving to draw, all his Gears flew to pieces, and the Cart fell down; and this Deponent going then to lift a bag of Corn, of about two Bushels, could not budge it with all his might.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="125" facs="tcp:49354:70"/>Many other pranks of this <hi>Bishops,</hi> this Deponent was ready to testifie, He also testified, that he verily believed, the said <hi>Bishop</hi> was the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Daughter <hi>Priscilla</hi>'s death; of which suspicion, pregnant reasons were assigned.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. To crown all, <hi>Iohn Bly,</hi> and <hi>William Bly</hi> testified, that being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by <hi>Bridget Bishop,</hi> to help take down the Cellar-wall, of the old House, wherein she formerly lived, they did in holes of the said old Wall, find several Poppets made up of Rags, and Hogs Bristles, with headless Pins in them, the points being outward. Whereof she could now give no Account unto the Court, that was reasonable or tolerable.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. One thing that made against the Prisoner was, her being evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convicted of Gross lying in the Court, several times, while she was making her Plea. But besides this, a Jury of Women, found a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Tet upon her Body; but upon a second search, within three or four hours, there was no such thing to be seen. There was also an Account of other People, whom this Woman had Afflicted. And there might have been many more, if they had been enquired for. But there was no need of them.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. There was one very strange thing more, with which the Court was newly entertained. As this Woman was under a guard, passing by the great and spacious Meeting House of <hi>Salem,</hi> she gave a look towards the House; and immediately a <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>emon</hi> invisibly entring the Meeting House, Tore down a part of it; so that tho there were no person to be seen there, yet the People at the Noise running in, found a board which was strongly fastned with several Nails, transported unto another quarter of the House.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Susanna Martin,</hi> pleading not Guilty, to the Indictment of Witchcrafts brought in against her; there were produced the Evidences of many persons very sensibly and grievously bewitched; who all complained of the Prisoner at the Bar, as the person whom they believed the cause of their Miseries. And now as well as in the other Trials, there was an extraordinary endeavour by Witchcrafts, with cruel and frequent Fits, to hinder the poor Sufferers, from giving in their Complaints; which the Court was forced with much patience to obtain, by much waiting and watching for it.</p>
                           <p>There was now also an Account given, of what had passed at her first Examination before the Magistrates. The cast of her Eye, then striking the Afflicted People to the Ground, whether they saw that cast or no: There were these among other Passages between the Magistrates and the Examinate.</p>

                              <p>How do I know? He that appeared in the shape of <hi>Samuel,</hi> a Glorified Saint may appear in any ones shape.</p>
                           </sp>
                           <p>It was then also noted in her, as in others like her, that if the Afflicted went to approach her, they were flung down to the ground. And, when she was asked the reason of it, she said, I cannot tell, it may be, the Devil bears me more Malice than another—</p>
                           <p>The Court accounted themselves Alarm'd by these things, to inquire further into the Conversation of the Prisoner; and see what there might occur, to render these Accusations further credible. Whereupon <hi>Iohn Allen,</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> testified, that he refusing, because of the weakness of his Oxen, to Cart some Staves at the request of this <hi>Martin,</hi> she was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased at it, and said, <hi>It had been as good that he had; for his Oxen should never do him much more service.</hi> Whereupon this Deponent said, <hi>Dost thou threaten me, thou old Witch; I'll throw thee into the Brook</hi>: which to avoid, she flew over the Bridge and escaped. But as he was going home, one of his Oxen tired, so that he was forced to unyoke him, that he might get him home. He then put his Oxen with many more, upon <hi>Salisbury-Beach,</hi> where Cattle did use to get Flesh. In a few Days, all the Oxen upon the <hi>Beach</hi> were found by their Tracks, to have run unto the mouth of <hi>Merrimack-River</hi> and not returned; but the next day they were found come ashore upon <hi>Plum-Island.</hi> They that sought them, used all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gentleness, but they would still run away with a violence, that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly Diabolical, till they came near the mouth of <hi>Merrimack-River</hi>; when they ran right into the Sea, swimming as far as they could be seen. One of them then swam back again, with a swiftness amazing to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, who stood ready to receive him, and help up his tired Carcass: but the Beast ran furiously up into the Island, and from thence thorough the Marishes, up into <hi>Newbury</hi> Town, and so up into the Woods; and there after a while found near <hi>Amesbury.</hi> So that of Fourteen good Oxen, there was only this saved: the rest were all cast up, some in one place, and some in another, Drowned.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Iohn Atkinson</hi> testified, that he exchanged a Cow, with a Son of <hi>Susanna Martins,</hi> whereat she muttered, and was unwilling he should have it. Going to receive this Cow, tho he Hamstring'd her, and halter'd her, she of a tame Creature grew so mad, that they could scarce get her along. She broke all the Ropes that were fastned unto her, and tho she was tied
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49354:72"/>
fast unto a Tree, yet she made her escape, and gave them such further trouble, as they could ascribe to no cause but Witchcraft.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>Bernard Peache</hi> testified, that being in Bed, on a Lords Day Night, he heard a scrabbling at the Window, whereat he then saw, <hi>Susanna Martin</hi> come in, and jump down upon the floor. She took hold of this Deponents Feet, and drawing his body up into an heap, she lay upon him near two hours; in all which time he could neither speak nor stir. At length when he could begin to move, he laid hold on her hand, and pulling it up to his mouth, he bit three of her Fingers as he judged to the Bone. Whereupon she went from the Chamber, down the Stairs, out at the door. This Deponent thereupon called unto the people of the House to advise them, of what passed; and he himself did follow her. The People saw her not; but there being a Bucket at the Left-hand of the door, there was a drop of Blood on it; and several more drops of Blood upon the Snow, newly fallen abroad. There was likewise the print of her two Feet, just without the Threshold; but no more sign of any scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further off.</p>
                           <p>At another time this Deponent was desired by the Prisoner, to come unto a husking of Corn, at her House; and she said, <hi>If he did not come, it were better that he did</hi>! He went not; but the night following, <hi>Susanna Martin,</hi> as he judged, and another came towards him. One of them said, <hi>here he is</hi>! but he having a Quarterstaff, made a blow at them. The Roof of the Barn, broke his blow; but following them to the Window, he made another blow at them, and struck them down; yet they got up, and got out, and he saw no more of them.</p>
                           <p>About this time, there was a Rumour about the Town, that <hi>Martin</hi> had a broken head; but the Deponent could say nothing to that.</p>
                           <p>The said <hi>Peache</hi> also restified, the bewitching of Cattle to Death, upon <hi>Martins</hi> discontents.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. <hi>Robert Downer</hi> restified, that this Prisoner being some years ago prosecuted at Court for a Witch, he then said unto her, <hi>He believed she was a Witch.</hi> Whereat she being dissatisfied, said, <hi>That some she Devil would shortly fetch him away</hi>; which words were heard by others, as well as himself; the night following, as he lay in his Bed, there came in at the Window, the likeness of a Cat, which flew upon him, and took fast hold of his Throat, lay on him a considerable while, and almost killed him; at length he remembred what <hi>Susanna Martin</hi> had threatned the Day before, and with much striving, he cried out, <hi>Avoid thou she Devil, In the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, avoid:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it left him, leaped on the Floor, and flew out at the Window.</p>
                           <p>And there also came in several Testimonies that before ever <hi>Downer</hi> spoke a word of this Accident, <hi>Susanna Martin</hi> and her Family had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, how this <hi>Downer</hi> had been handled.</p>
                           <p n="7">
                              <pb n="129" facs="tcp:49354:72"/>7. <hi>Iohn Kembal</hi> testified, that <hi>Susanna Martin,</hi> upon a causeless disgust had threatned him about a certain Cow of his, that she should never do him any more good, and it came to pass accordingly; for soon after the Cow was found stark dead on the dry ground, without any Distemper to be discerned upon her. Upon which he was followed with a strange death upon more of his Cattle. Whereof he lost in one Spring, to the value of 30 <hi>l.</hi> But the said <hi>Iohn Kembal,</hi> had a further Testimony to give in against the Prisoner, which was truly admirable. Being desirous to furnish himself with a Dog, he applied himself to buy one of this <hi>Martin,</hi> who had a Bitch with Whelps in her House, but she not letting him have his choice; he said, <hi>He would supply himself then at one</hi> Blezdels Having mark'd a Puppy which he liked at <hi>Blezdels,</hi> he met <hi>George Martin,</hi> the Husband of the Prisoner going by, who asked whether he would not have one of his Wives Puppy's; and he answered, No. The same day one <hi>Edmond Eliot,</hi> being at <hi>Martins</hi> house heard <hi>George Martin,</hi> relate where this <hi>Kembal</hi> had been, and what he had said; whereupon <hi>Susanna Martin</hi> reply'd, <hi>If I live I'll give him Puppies enough.</hi> Within a few Days after this, <hi>Kembal</hi> coming out of the Woods, there arose a little black Cloud in the <hi>N. W.</hi> and <hi>Kembal</hi> immediately felt a force upon him, which made him not able to avoid running upon the stumps of Trees that were before him, albeit he had a broad plain cart way before him; but tho he had his Axe also on his Shoulder to endanger him in his falls, he could not forbear going out of his way to tumble over them. When he came below the Meeting house, there appeared unto him a little thing like a Puppy of a darkish Colour, and it shot backwards and forwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Legs. He had the Courage to use all possible endeavours of cutting it with his Axe, but he could not hit it; the Puppy gave a jump from him and went, as to him, it seem'd into the Ground. Going a little further there appeared unto him a black Puppy, somewhat bigger than the First, but as black as a Coal. It's motions were quicker than those of his Axe. It flew at his Belly, and away at his Throat, so over his Shoulders one way, and then over his Shoulders another way, his heart now began to fail him, and he thought the Dog would have tore his Throa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Deponent spoke not one word of these Accidents, for fear of affrighting his Wife, But the next morning, <hi>Edmond Eliot</hi> going into <hi>Martins</hi> house, this Woman asked him, where <hi>Kembal</hi> was? He replied, at home a Bed, for ought he knew. She returned; they say he was frighted last night. <hi>Eliot</hi> asked with what? She answered with Puppies. <hi>Eliot</hi> asked, where she heard of it, for he had heard nothing of it! She rejoined, about the Town. Altho' <hi>Kembal</hi> had mentioned the matter to no creature living.</p>

                           <p n="8">8. <hi>William Brown</hi> testified, that Heaven having bless'd him with a most Pious and Prudent Wife, this Wife of his, one day met with <hi>Susanna Martin</hi>; but when she approached just unto her, <hi>Martin</hi> vanished out of fight, and left her extreamly affrighted. After which time the sad <hi>Martin</hi> often appeared unto her, giving her no little trouble; and when she did come, she was visited with Birds that sorely peck'd and prick'd her; and sometimes a bunch like a Pullers Egg would rise on her Throat, ready to choak her, till she cry'd out, <hi>Witch, you shan't choak me</hi>! While this good Woman was in this Extremity, the Church appointed a Day of Prayer on her behalf; whereupon the trouble ceas'd; she saw not <hi>Martin</hi> as formerly; and the Church instead of their Fast, gave thanks for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. But a considerable while after, she being summoned to give in some Evidence at the Court, against this <hi>Martin,</hi> quickly this <hi>Martin</hi> came behind her, while she was Milking her Cow, and said unto her, <hi>For thy defaming me at Court, I'll make thee the miserablest Creature in the World.</hi> Soon after which she fell into a strange kind of Distemper, and became horribly Frantick, and uncapable of any Reasonable Action; the Physicians declaring, that her Distemper was preternatural, and that some Devil had certainly bewitched her; and in that condition she now remained.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. <hi>Sarah Atkinson</hi> testified, that <hi>Susanna Martin</hi> came from <hi>Amesbury,</hi> to their House at <hi>Newbury,</hi> in an extraordinary Season, when it was not fit for any one to Travel. She came (as she said, unto <hi>Atkinson</hi>) all that long way on foot. She brag'd and show'd, how dry she was; nor could it be perceived that so much as the Soles of her Shoes were we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>. <hi>Atkinson</hi> was amazed at it, and professed, that she should her self have been wet up to the Knees, if she had then came so far; but <hi>Martin</hi> reply'd, <hi>She scorned to be drabbled</hi>! It was noted, that this Testimony upon her Tryal, cast her into a very singular confusion.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. <hi>Iohn Pressy</hi> testified, that being one Evening very unaccountably bewildred near a Field of <hi>Martins,</hi> and several times as one under an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, returning to the place he had left, at length he saw a Marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light, about the bigness of an half Bushel, near two Rood out of the way. He went, and struck at it with a Stick, and laid it on with all his might. He gave it near Forty blows; and felt it a palpable substance. But going from it, his heels were struck up, and he was laid with his back on the ground: sliding as he thought, into a Pit; from whence he recovered, by taking hold on the Bush; altho afterwards he could find no such Pit in the place. Having after his recovery, gone five or six Rood, he saw <hi>Susanna Martin</hi> standing on his Left hand, as the Light had done before; but they changed no words with one another. He could scarce find his House in his return; but at length he got home, extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49354:73"/>
The next Day it was upon enquiry understood, that <hi>Martin</hi> was in a miserable condition, by pains and hurts that were upon her.</p>
                           <p>It was further testified by this Deponent, that after he had given in some Evidence against <hi>Susanna Martin</hi> many Years ago, she gave him foul words about it, and said, <hi>He should never prosper, more particularly, that he should never have more than two Cows; that tho he were never so likely to have more, yet he should never have them.</hi> And that from that very day to this; namely for Twenty Years together, he could never exceed that number; but some strange thing or other still prevented his having of any more.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. <hi>Iarvis Ring</hi> testified, that about Seven Years ago, he was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grievously oppressed in the Night; but saw not who troubled him, until at last he lying perfectly awake, plainly saw <hi>Susanna Martin</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him. She came to him and forcibly bit him by the Finger; so that the print of the bite is now so long after to be seen upon him.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. But besides all these Evidences, there was a most wonderful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of one <hi>Ioseph Ring</hi> produced on this occasion. This Man has been strangely carried about by <hi>Daemons.</hi> From one Witch-meeting to another, for near two Years together; and for one quarter of this time they made him and kept him Dumb, tho he is now again able to speak. There was one <hi>T. H.</hi> who having as 'tis judged, a design of Engaging this <hi>Ioseph Rule,</hi> in a snare of Devilism, contrived a while, to bring this <hi>Ring</hi> two Shillings in Debt unto him. Afterwards this poor Man would be visited with unknown shapes, and this <hi>T. H.</hi> sometimes among them; which would force him away with them, unto unknown places, where he saw Meetings, Feastings, Dancings; and after his return wherein they hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him along thro the Air, he gave demonstrations to the Neighbours, that he had indeed been so transported. When he was brought unto these hellish meetings, one of the first things they still did unto him, was to give him a knock on the back, whereupon he was ever as if bound with Chains, uncapable of stirring out of the place, till they should release him. He related, that there often came to him a Man, who presented him a Book, whereto he would have him set his hand; promising to him, that he should then have even what he would; and presenting him with all the delectable things, persons, and places, that he could imagine. But he refusing to subscribe, the business would end with dreadful shapes, noises and screetches, which almost scared him out of his wits. Once with a Book, there was a Pen offer'd him, and an Inkhorn, with liquor in it, that seem'd like Blood: but he never touched it.</p>
                           <p>This Man did now affirm, that he saw the Prisoners, at several of those hellish Randezvouzes.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="132" facs="tcp:49354:74"/>
                              <hi>Note,</hi> This Woman was one of the most Impudent, Scurrilous, wicked Creature in the World; and she did now throughout her whole Tryal, discover her self to be such an one. Yet when she was asked what she had to say for her self, her chief plea was, that she had led a most vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy life.</p>

                              </gap>woons, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished her touch from other Peoples, being thereby raised out of them.</p>
                           <p>And there was other Testimony of People to whom the shape of this <hi>How,</hi> gave trouble Nine or Ten Years ago.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It has been a most usual thing for the bewitched persons at the same time that the Spectres representing the Witches, Troubled them to be visited with Apparitions of Ghosts, pretending to have been murdered by the Witches then represented. And sometimes the confessions of the Witches afterwards acknowledged those very Murders, which these Apparitions charged upon them; altho they had never heard what Information had been given by the Sufferers.</p>
                           <p>There were such Apparitions of Ghosts testified by some of the present Sufferers, and the Ghosts affirmed, that this <hi>How</hi> had murdered them: which things were fear'd, but not proved.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. This <hi>How</hi> had made some attempts of Joining to the Church, at <hi>Ips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> several Years ago; but she was denied an Admission into that holy Society, partly thro a suspicion of Witchcraft, then urged against her. And there now came in Testimony, of preternatural Mischiefs, presently befalling some that had been Instrumental to debar her from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion whereupon she was intruding.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. There was a particular Deposition of <hi>Ioseph Safford,</hi> that his Wife had conceived an extream Aversion, to this <hi>How,</hi> on the reports of her Witchcrafts; but <hi>How,</hi> one day taking her by the hand, and saying, <hi>I believe you are not Ignorant of the great scandal, that I lye under, by an Evil report raised upon me.</hi> She immediately, unreasonably, and unperswade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, even like one Inchanted, began to take this Womans part. <hi>How</hi> being soon after propounded, as desiring an Admission to the Table of the Lord, some of the Pious Brethren were unsatisfied about her. The Elders appointed a meeting, to hear matters objected against her; and no arguments in the World could hinder this Goodwife <hi>Safford,</hi> from going to the Lecture. She did indeed promise with much ado, that she would not go to the Church-meeting; yet she could not refrain going thither also.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49354:75"/>
                              <hi>How</hi>'s affairs there were so canvased, that she came off rather Guilty, than cleared; nevertheless Goodwife <hi>Safford</hi> could not forbear taking her by the Hand, and saying, <hi>Tho you are condemned before Men, you are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God.</hi> She was quickly taken in a very strange manner; Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Raving, Raging, and crying out, <hi>Goody</hi> How <hi>must come into the Church; she is a precious Saint, and tho she be condemned before Men, she is justified before God.</hi> So she continued for the space of two or three hours; and then fell into a Trance. But coming to her self, she cried out, <hi>Ha! I was mistaken</hi>! and afterwards again repeated, <hi>Ha! I was mistaken</hi>! being asked by a slander by, Wherein? she replied, <hi>I thought Goody</hi> How, <hi>had been a precious Saint of God, but now I see is a Witch; she has bewitched me and my Child, and we shall never be well, till there be Testimony for her, that she may be taken into the Church.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And <hi>How</hi> said afterwards, <hi>That she was very sorry to see</hi> Safford <hi>at the Church-meeting mentioned. Safford</hi> after this, <hi>declared her self to be Afflicted by the shape of</hi> How, <hi>and from that shape she endured many miseries.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>Iohn How,</hi> Brother to the Husband of the Prisoner testified, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to accompany the Prisoner unto her Examination, as was by her desired, immediately some of his Cattle, were bewitched to Death, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Three or four Foot high, turning about, squeaking, falling, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at once; and going to cut off an Ear, for an use, that might as well perhaps have been omitted, the Hand wherein he held his Knife, was taken very Numb; and so it remained, and full of pain for several Days; being not well at this very time. And he suspected this Prisoner, for the Author of it.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. <hi>Nehemiah Abbot</hi> testified, that unusual and mischievous accidents would befall his Cattle, whenever he had any difference with this Prisoner. Once particularly, she wished his Ox choaked, and within a little while, that Ox was choaked with a Turnip in his Throat. At another time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to lend his Horse, at the request of her Daughter, the Horse was in a preternatural manner abused. And several other odd things of that kind were testified.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. There came in Testimony, that one Goodwife <hi>Sherwin,</hi> upon some difference with <hi>How</hi> was bewitched, and, that she died, charging this <hi>How</hi> of having an hand in her Death. And that other People had their Barrels of Drink unaccountably mischiev'd, spoiled, and spilt upon their displeasing of her.</p>
                           <p>The things in themselves were trivial; but there being such a course of them, it made them the more to be considered. Among others, <hi>Martha Wood</hi> gave her testimony, that a little after, her Father had been employed in gathering an account of this <hi>How</hi>'s Conversation, they once and again lost great quantities of Drink, out of their Vessels, in such a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49354:75"/>
manner, as they could ascribe to nothing but Witchcraft. As also that <hi>How</hi> giving her some Apples, when she had eaten of them, she was taken with a very strange kind of a maze, in so much that she knew not what she said or did.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. There was likewise a Cluster of Depositions, that one <hi>Isaac Cummings,</hi> refusing to lend his Mare, unto the Husband of this <hi>How</hi>; the Mare was within a Day or two, taken in a strange condition. The beast seemed much abused; being bruised, as if she had been running over the Rocks, and marked where the Bridle went, as if burnt with a red hot Bridle. Moreover one using a Pipe of Tobacco for the cure of the Beast, a blew flame issued out of her, took hold of he hair, and not only spread and burnt on her, but it also flew upwards towards the Roof of the Barn, and had like to have set the Barn on fire. And the Mare dy'd very suddenly.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. <hi>Timothy Perly</hi> and his Wife, testified, not only that unaccountable Mischiefs befel their Cattle, upon their having of differences with this Prisoner; but also that they had a Daughter destroyed by Witchcrafts; which Daughter still charged <hi>How,</hi> as the cause of her Affliction: and it was noted, that she would be struck down, whenever <hi>How</hi> were spoken of. She was often endeavoured to be thrown into the Fire, and into the Water, in her strange Fitts; tho her Father had corrected, for charging <hi>How</hi> with bewitching her, yet (as was testified by others also) she said she was sure of it, and must dye standing to it. Accordingly she charged <hi>How</hi> to the very death; and said, <hi>Tho</hi> How <hi>could Afflict and Torment her Body, yet she could not hurt her Soul, and that the truth of this matter would appear, when she should be dead and gone.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="10">10. <hi>Francis Lane</hi> testified, that being hired by the Husband of this <hi>How,</hi> to get him a parcel of Posts and Rails, this <hi>Lane</hi> hired <hi>Iohn Pearly</hi> to assist him. This Prisoner then told <hi>Lane,</hi> that she believed the Posts and Rails would not do, because <hi>Iohn Pearly</hi> helped him; but that if he had got them alone, without <hi>Iohn Pearly</hi>'s help, they might have done well enough. When <hi>Iames How</hi> came to receive his Posts and Rails of <hi>Lane, How</hi> taking them up by the Ends, they, tho good and sound yet unaccountably broke off, so that <hi>Lane</hi> was forced to get Thirty or Forty more. And this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner being informed of it, she said, <hi>She told him so before; because</hi> Pearly <hi>helpt about them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="11">11. Afterwards there came in the Confessions, of several other (peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) Witches, which affirmed this <hi>How</hi> to be one of those, who with them had been baptized by the Devil in the River, at <hi>Newberry-Falls</hi>: before which he made them there kneel down by the Brink of the River, and Worship him.</p>

                              <hi>The Tryal of</hi> Martha Carryer, August 2. 1692. <hi>As may be seen in</hi> Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Invisible World, <hi>from</hi> P. 132, <hi>to</hi> 138.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>MArtha Carryer,</hi> was Indicted for the bewitching of certain persons, according to the form usual in such Cases: Pleading not Guilty to her Indictment; there were first brought in a considerable number of the Bewitched persons; who not only made the Court sensible of an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Witchcraft committed upon them, but also deposed, That it was <hi>Martha Carryer,</hi> or her shape, that grievously tormented them, by biting, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>cking, pinching and choaking them. It was further-deposed, that while this <hi>Carryer</hi> was on her Examination before the Magistrates, the poor People were so tortured, that every one expected their Death upon the very spot; but that upon the binding of <hi>Carryer</hi> they were eased.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49354:76"/>
Moreover the looks of <hi>Carryer</hi> then laid the Afflicted People for dead, and her Touch, if her Eyes at the same time were off them, raised them again. Which things were also now seen upon her Tryal. And it was testified, that upon the mention of some having their Necks twisted almost round by the shape of this <hi>Carryer,</hi> she replied, <hi>Its no matter, tho their Necks had been twisted quite off.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. Before the Tryal of this Prisoner, several of her own Children, had frankly and fully confessed not only that they were Witches themselves, but that this their Mother had made them so. This Confession they made with great shows of Repentance, and with much Demonstration of Truth. They related Place, Time, Occasion; they gave an Account of Journeys, Meetings, and Mischiefs by them performed; and were very credible in what they said. Nevertheless, this Evidence was not produced against the Prisoner at the Bar, in as much as there was other Evidence enough to proceed upon.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Benj. Abbot</hi> gave in his Testimony, That last <hi>March</hi> was a Twelve Month, this <hi>Carryer</hi> was very angry with him, upon laying out some Land near her Husbands. Her expressions in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s Anger were, <hi>That she would stick as close to</hi> Abbot, <hi>as the Bark stuck to the Tree; and that he should repent of it afore seven Years came to an end, so as Doctor</hi> Prescot <hi>should never cure him.</hi> These words were heard by others, besides <hi>Abbot</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who also heard her say, <hi>She would hold his Nose as close to the Grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, as ever it was held since his name was</hi> Abbot. Presently after this, he was taken with a swelling in his Foot, and then with a Pain in his Side, and exceedingly tormented. It bred unto a Sore, which was lanced by Dr. <hi>Prescot,</hi> and several Gallons of Corruption ran out of it. For six Weeks it continued very bad; and then another Sore bred in his Groin, which was also lanced by Dr. <hi>Prescot.</hi> Another Sore bred in his Groin which was likewise Cut, and put him to very great misery. He was brought unto Death's door, and so remained until <hi>Carryer</hi> was taken, and carried away by the Constable. From which very day he began to mend, and so grew better every day, and is well ever since.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sarah Abbot</hi> also his Wife testified, that her Husband was not only all this while Afflicted in his Body; but also that strange, extraordinary and unaccountable calamities befel his Cattle; their Death being such as they could guess at no Natural Reason for.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Allin Toothaker</hi> testified, that <hi>Richard</hi> the Son of <hi>Martha Carryer,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some difference with him, pull'd him down by the Hair of the Head, when he rose again, he was going to strike at <hi>Richard Carryer,</hi> but fell down flat on his back to the ground, and had not power to stir Hand or foot, until he told <hi>Carryer</hi> he yielded; and then he saw the shape of <hi>Martha Carryer,</hi> go off his Breast.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="138" facs="tcp:49354:77"/>This <hi>Toothaker</hi> had received a wound in the Wars, and he now testified, that <hi>Martha Carryer</hi> told him. <hi>He shall never be cured.</hi> Just afore the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of <hi>Carryer,</hi> he could thrust a Knitting-Needle into his wound four Inches deep; but presently after her being seized, he was thoroughly healed.</p>
                           <p>He further testified, that when <hi>Carryer</hi> and he sometimes were at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, she would clap her Hands at him and say, <hi>He should get nothing by it.</hi> Whereupon he several times lost his Cattle, by strange Deaths, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no natural causes could be given.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>Iohn Roger</hi> also testified, that upon the threatning words of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <hi>Carryer,</hi> his Cattle would be strangely bewitched; as was more particularly then described.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. <hi>Samuel Preston</hi> testified, that about two Years ago, having some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Martha Carryer,</hi> he lost a Cow in a strange, preternatural, unusual manner; and about a Month after this, the said <hi>Carryer,</hi> having again some difference with him, she told him, <hi>He had lately lost a Cow, and it should not be long before he lost another</hi>! which accordingly came to pass; for he had a thriving and well kept Cow, which without any known cause quickly fell down and died.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. <hi>Phebe Chandler</hi> testified, that about a Fortnight before the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of <hi>Martha Carryer,</hi> on a Lords Day, while the Psalm was singing, in the Church, this <hi>Carryer</hi> then took her by the Sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>lder, and shaking her, asked her, <hi>Where she lived?</hi> she made her no Answer, altho as <hi>Carryer,</hi> who lived next door to her Father's House, could not in Reason but know who she was. Quickly after this, as she was at several times crossing the Fields she heard a Voice, that she took to be <hi>Martha Carryers,</hi> and it seem'd as if it were over her head. The Voice told her, <hi>She should within two or three Days be Poison'd</hi>: Accordingly within such a little time, one half of her Right Hand became greatly swollen and very painful; as also part of her Face; whereof she can give no Account how it came. It continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very bad for some days; and several times since she has had a great pain in her Breast; and been so seized on her Legs, that she has hardly been able to go. She added that lately, going well to the House of God, <hi>Richard</hi> the Son of <hi>Martha Carryer,</hi> look'd very earnestly upon her, and immediately her Hand which had formerly been Poisoned, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid, began to pain her greatly, and she had a strange burning at her Stomach; but was then struck deaf, so that she could not hear any of the Prayer, or Singing, till the two or three last words of the Psalm.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. One <hi>Foster,</hi> who confessed her own share in the Witchcraft, for which the Prisoner stood Indicted, affirmed, that she had seen the Prisoner at some of their Witch-meetings, and that it was this <hi>Carryer,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded her to be a Witch. She confessed that the Devil carried them on
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49354:77"/>
a Pole, to a Witch-meeting, but the Pole broke, and she hanging about <hi>Carryers</hi> Neck, they both fell down, and she then received an hurt by the fall, whereof she was not at this very time recovered.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. One <hi>Lacy,</hi> who likewise confessed her share in this Witchcraft, now testified that she and the Prisoner, were once bodily present, at a Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeting in <hi>Salem</hi>-Village, and that she knew the Prisoner to be a Witch, and to have been at a Diabol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>cal Sacrament, and that the Prisoner was the undoing of her and her Children, by enticing them into the Snare of the Devil.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Another <hi>Lacy,</hi> who also confessed her share in this Witchcraft, now testified, that the Prisoner was at the Witch-meeting, in <hi>Salem</hi>-Village, where they had Bread and Wine administred unto them.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. In the time of this Prisoners Tryal, one <hi>Susana Shelden,</hi> in open Court, had her Hands unaccountably tied together, with a Wheel-band, so fast, that without cutting, it could not be loosed. It was done by a Spectre; and the Sufferer affirm'd, it was the Prisoners.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Memorandum.</hi> This <hi>Rampant Hag, Martha Carryer,</hi> was the person of whom the Confessions of the Witches, and of her own Children, among the rest, agreed, that the Devil had promised her, she should be Queen of Hell.</p>

               <p>Thus far the Account given in <hi>Wonders of the Invisible World</hi>; in which setting aside such words as these, in the Tryal of <hi>G. B.</hi> viz. [<hi>They,</hi> (i.e.) <hi>the Witnesses were enough to fix the character of a Witch upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Tryal of <hi>Bishop,</hi> these words, [<hi>but there was no need of them</hi>] i.e. of further <hi>Testimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Tryal of <hi>How,</hi> where it is said, [and there came in Testimony of preternatural Mischiefs, presently befalling some that had been instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to debar her from the Communion, whereupon she was <hi>intruding.</hi>] <hi>Martin</hi> is call'd [one of the most impudent, scurrilous, wicked Creatures in the World.] In his Account of <hi>Martha Carryer,</hi> he is pleased to call her [<hi>a Rampant Hag,</hi>] &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These Expressions as they manifest, that he wrote more like an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate than an Historian; so also that those that were his Imployers, were not mistaken in their choice of him for that work, however he may have mist it in other things.</p>
               <p>As in his owning (in the Tryal of <hi>G. B.</hi>) That the <hi>Testimony of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, and confessors was not enough against the Accused,</hi> for it is known, that not only in <hi>New-England,</hi> such Evidence has been taken for sufficient, but also in <hi>England,</hi> as himself there owns, and will also hold true of <hi>Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> they having proceeded upon such Evidence, to the taking away of the Lives of many, to assert that this is not enough, is to tell the World, that such Executions were but so many Bloody Murders; which surely was not his intent to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:49354:78"/>His telling that the Court began to think that <hi>Burroughs</hi> stept aside to put on Invisibility. is a rendring them so mean Philosophers, and such weak Christians, as to be fit to be imposed upon by any silly pretender.</p>
               <p>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s calling the Evidence against <hi>How</hi> trivial, and others against <hi>Burroughs,</hi> he accounts no part of his Conviction; and that of lifting a Gun with one Finger, its being not made use of as Evidence, renders the whole but the more perplext. (Not to mention the many mistakes therein contain'd).</p>
               <p>Yet all this (and more that might have been hinted at) does not hinder, but that his Account of the manner of Tryals of those for Witchcraft, is as faithfully related as any Tryals of that kind, that was ever yet made publick; and it may also be reasonably thought, that there was as careful a Scrutiny, and as unquestion'd Evidences improved, as had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly used in the Tryals of others, for such crimes in other places. Tho indeed a second part might be very useful, to set forth which was the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Convictive in these Tryals, for it is not supposed, that Romantick or Ridiculous stories should have any influence, such as biting a Spectres Finger, so that the Blood flowed out, or such as <hi>Shattock's</hi> Story of 12 Years standing, which yet was presently 18 Years or more, and yet a Man of that excellent Memory, as to be able to recall a small difference his Wife had with another Woman, when Eighteen Years were past.</p>
               <p>As it is not to be supposed, that such as these could Influence any Judge or Jury, so not unkindness to relations, or God's having given to one Man more strength than to some others, the over-setting of Carts, or the death of Cattle, nor yet Excrescencies (call'd Tets) nor little bits of Rags tied together (call'd Poppets.) Much less any persons illness, or having their Cloaths rent, when a Spectre has been well banged, much less the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mares Fart, mentioned in the Tryal of <hi>How.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None of these being in the least capable of proving the Indictment; The supposed Criminals were Indicted for Afflicting, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> such and such particular persons by Witchcraft, to which none of these Evidences have one word to say, and the Afflicted and Confessors being declared not enough, the matter needs yet further explaining.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, the General Court having sat and enacted Laws, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly one against Witchcraft, assigning the Penalty of Death to any that shall feed, reward, or imploy, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Evil Spirits, tho it has not yet been explained what is intended thereby, or what it is to feed, reward, or imploy Devils, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> yet some of the Legislators have given this instead of an Explanation, that they had therein but Copied the Law of another Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 3. By vertue of an Act of the General Court, the first Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Court was held at <hi>Salem,</hi> for the County of <hi>Essex,</hi> the Judges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed were, Mr. <hi>William Stoughton</hi> (the Lieutenant Governour) <hi>Thomas
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49354:78"/>
Danforth, Iohn Richards, Wait Winthorp,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Sewall,</hi> Esquires. Where Ignoramus was found upon the several Bills of Indictment against Thirty, and <hi>Billa Vera</hi> against Twenty six more; of all these Three only were found Guilty, by the Jewry upon Tryal, two of which were (as appears by their Behaviour) the most Senseless and Ignorant Creatures that could be found; besides which it does not appear, what came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those more than against the rest that were acquitted.</p>
               <p>The Third was the Wife of <hi>Wardwell,</hi> who was one of the Twenty Executed, and it seems they had both confessed themselves Guilty; but he retracting his said Confession, was tried and Executed; it is supposed that this Woman fearing her Husbands fate, was not so stiff in her deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of her former Confession, such as it was. These Three received Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death.</p>
               <p>At these Tryals some of the Jewry made Inquiry of the Court, what Account they ought to make of the Spectre Evidence? and received for Answer [as much as of Chips in Wort.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 31. 1692/3. The Superior Court began at <hi>Charlestown,</hi> for the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danforth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Winthorp,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sewall</hi> Judges, where several had Ignoramus returned upon their Bills of Indictment, and <hi>Billa Vera</hi> upon others.</p>
               <p>In the time the Court sat, word was brought in, that a Reprieve was sent to <hi>Salem,</hi> and had prevented the Execution of Seven of those that were there Condemned, which so moved the chief Judge, that he said to this effect, <hi>We were in a way to have cleared the Land of these,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who it is obstructs the course of Iustice I know not; the Lord be merciful to the Countrey,</hi> and so went off the Bench, and came no more that Court: The most remarkable of the Tryals, was of <hi>Sarah Daston,</hi> she was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of about 70 or 80 Years of Age, To usher in her Tryal, a report went before, that if there were a Witch in the World she was one, as having been so accounted of, for 20 or 30 Years; which drew many People from <hi>Boston, &amp;c.</hi> to hear her Tryal. There were a multitude of Witnesses produced against her; but what Testimony they gave in seemed wholly forreign, as of accidents, illness, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> befalling them, or theirs, after some Quarrel; what these testified, was much of it of Actions said to be done 20 Years before that time. The Spectre Evidence was not made use of in these Tryals, so that the Jewry soon brought her in not Guilty, her Daughter and Grand-daughter, and the rest that were then tried were also acquitted. After she was cleared Judge <hi>Danforth</hi> Admonished her in these words, <hi>Woman, Woman, repent, there are shrewd things come in against you</hi>; she was remanded to Prison for her Fees, and there in a short time expired. One of <hi>Boston</hi> that had been at the Tryal of <hi>Daston,</hi> being the same Evening in company with one of the Judges
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49354:79"/>
in a publick place, acquainted him that some that had been both at the Tryals at <hi>Salem,</hi> and at this at <hi>Charlestown,</hi> had asserted that there was more Evidence against the said <hi>Daston,</hi> than against any at <hi>Salem,</hi> to which the said Judge conceeded, saying, <hi>That it was so.</hi> It was replied by that person, <hi>that he dare give it under his hand that there was not enough come in against her to bear a just reproof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April,</hi> 25. 1693, The first Superiour Court was held at <hi>Boston,</hi> for the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Judges were the Lieutenant Governour, Mr. <hi>Danforth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richards</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sewall,</hi> Esquires.</p>
               <p>Where (besides the acquitting Mr. <hi>Iohn Aldin</hi> by Proclamation) the most remarkable was, what related to <hi>Mary Watkins,</hi> who had been a Servant, and lived about Seven Miles from <hi>Boston,</hi> having formerly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused her Mistress of Witchcraft, and was supposed to be distracted, she was threatned if she persisted in such Accusations to be punished, this with the necessary care to recover her Health, had that good effect, that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e not only had her Health restored, but also wholly acquitted her Mistress of any such Crimes, and continued in Health till the return of the Year, and then again falling into Melancholly humours she was sound strangling her self; her Life being hereby prolonged, she immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately accused her self of being a Witch; was carried before a Magistrate and committed. At this Court a Bill of Indictment was brought to the Grand Jury against her, and her confession upon her Examination given in as Evidence, but these not wholly satisfied herewith, sent for her, who gave such account of her self, that they (after they had returned into the Court to ask some Questions) Twelve of them agreed to find Ignoramus, but the Court was pleased to send them out again, who again at coming in returned it as before.</p>
               <p>She was continued for some time in Prison, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and at length was Sold to <hi>Virginia.</hi> About this time the Prisoners in all the Prisons were released.</p>
               <p>To omit here the mentioning of several Wenches in <hi>Boston, &amp;c.</hi> who pretended to be Afflicted, and accused several, the Ministers often visiting them, and praying with them, concerning whose Affliction Narratives are in being. In Manuscript not only these, but the generality of those Accusers may have since convinc'd the Ministers by their vicious courses, that they might err in extending too much Charity to them.</p>
               <p>The conclusion of the whole in the <hi>Massachusetts</hi> Colony was, Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> Governour being call'd home, before he went he pardon'd such as had been condemned, for which they gave about 30 Shillings each to the Kings Attorney.</p>
               <p>In <hi>August</hi> 1697. The Superiour Court sat at <hi>Hartford,</hi> in the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> where one Mistress <hi>Benom</hi> was tried for Witchcraft, she

had been accused by some Children that pretended to the Spectral sight; they searched her several times for Tets; they tried the Experiment of casting her into the Water, and after this she was Excommunicated by the Minister of <hi>Wallinsford.</hi> Upon her Tryal nothing material appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against her, save Spectre Evidence, she was acquitted, as also her Daughter, a Girl of Twelve or Thirteen Years old, who had been like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Accused; but upon renewed Complaints against them, they both flew into <hi>New-York</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>Before this the Government Issued forth the following Proclamation.</p>

                           <p>WHereas the Anger of God is not yet turned away, but his Hand is still stretched out against his People in manifold Judgments, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in drawing out to such a length the troubles of <hi>Europe,</hi> by a perplexing War; and more especially, respecting our selves in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that God is pleased still to go on in diminishing our Substance, cutting short our Harvest, blasting our most promising undertakings more ways than one, unseding of us, and by his more Immediate hand, snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away many out of our Embraces, by sudden and violent Deaths, even at this time when the Sword is devouring so many both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and that after many days of publick and Solemn addressing of him. And altho considering the many Sins prevailing in the midst of us, we cannot but wonder at the Patience and Mercy moderating these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes; yet we cannot but also fear that there is something still wanting to accompany our Supplications. And doubtless there are some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sins, which God is Angry with our <hi>Israel</hi> for, that have not been duly seen and resented by us, about which God expects to be sought, if ever he turn again our Captivity.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore it is Commanded and Appointed, that <hi>Thursday</hi> the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next, be observed as a Day of Prayer, with Fasting throughout this Province, strictly forbidding all Servile labour thereon; that so all Gods People may offer up fervent Supplications unto him, for the Preservation, and Prosperity of his Majesty's Royal Person and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Success to attend his Affairs both at home and abroad; that all iniquity may be put away which hath stirred Gods Holy jealousie against this Land; that he would shew us what we know not, and help us wherein we have done amiss to do so no more; and especially that whatever mistakes on either hand have been fallen into, either by the body of this People, or any orders of men, referring to the late Tragedy, raised among us by Satan and his Instruments, thro the awful Judgment of God,

               <p>Since the making the foregoing Collections of Letters, to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which as yet remain unanswered) a Book is come to hand Intituled,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE Life of Sir</hi> William Phips, <hi>Printed in</hi> London, 1697, Which Book, tho it bears not the Authors name, yet the Stile, manner and matter is such, that were there no other demonstration or token to know him by, it were no Witchcraft to determine that the said Mr. <hi>C. M.</hi> is the Author of it. But that he that has <hi>encountred Enchantments,</hi> and gone thro the <hi>Wonders of the Invisible World,</hi> and <hi>discovered the Devil,</hi> that he should step aside into a Remote Country to put on Invisibility! Tho the reason of this be not so manifest, yet it may be thought to be to gratifie some peculiar fancies; and why may not this be one, that he might with the better grace extol the Actions of Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> as Agent in <hi>England,</hi> or as President of <hi>Harvard</hi> College, not forgetting his own.</p>
               <p>As to Sir <hi>William,</hi> it will be generally <hi>acknowledged,</hi> that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meanness of his Parentage and Education, he attain'd to be Master of a Ship, and that he had the good hap to find a <hi>Spanish</hi> Wreck, not only sufficient to repair his Fortunes, but to raise him to a considerable Figure; which King <hi>Iames</hi> did so far accommodate, as to make <hi>him a Knight.</hi>

               <p>It is not doubted, but that he aimed at the good of the People, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> great Pitty it is that his Government was so fullied (for want of better Information and Advice, from those whose duty it was to have given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bgeblin Monster Witchcraft,</hi> whereby this Countrey was Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mar'd, and harrast at such a rate, as is not easily imagined.</p>
               <p>After which some complaints going to <hi>England,</hi> about Male Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, in the least matters comparatively; yet were such, that he was call'd home to give account thereof, where he soon after expired, so finishing his Life and Government together.</p>
               <p>Death having thus drawn the Curtain, forbidding any further Scene, it might have been prudence, to let his dust remain without disturbance.</p>
               <p>But the said Book endeavouring to raise a Statue to him <hi>(i.e.)</hi> to ascribe to him such Achievements, as either were never performed by him, or else unduly aggravated, this has opened the Mouth, both of Friends and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to recount the mistakes in the said Book; as also those miscarriages, wherewith Sir <hi>William</hi> was charge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble; such as had it not been for this Book, had been buried with him.</p>
               <p>In <hi>P.</hi> 3. search is made over the World, to whom to compare him in his Advancement; and most unhappily <hi>Pizarro</hi> is pitched upon, as a match for him, who was a <hi>Bastard,</hi> dropt in a <hi>Church-Porch,</hi> put to <hi>Suck of a Sow,</hi> and being grown, ran away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Shipt himself for <hi>America</hi>; there so prospered, as to Command an Army; and therewith did mighty things, particularly took <hi>Attaballipa,</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Peru</hi> Prisoner, and having received for his Ransom, in Gold and Silver to the value of Ten Millions, perfidiously put him to Death; and was the Death of no Man knows how many Thousands of Innocents, and is certainly one of the worst that could have been pitch'd upon for such comparison.</p>
               <p>Tho this together with the Rhetorical flourishes, and affected strains therein, are instances of the Authors variety of Learning; for which he is recommended by these Three <hi>Venerable</hi> Person, in the entrance to the said Book. Yet the <hi>Integrity, Prudonce,</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> thereof, is not so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly to be seen.

[He lay within <hi>Pistol-Shot</hi> of the Enemies Cannon, and beat them from thence, and much batter'd the Town, having his Ship sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thro in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places, with <hi>Four and twenty Pounders,</hi>] When in the Judgment of those present, they were not nearer to the Enemy, than about <hi>half or three quarters of a Mile</hi>; that there might be in all about <hi>Seven Shot</hi> that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49354:81"/>
struck the Hull of the Vessel, none of them known to be bigger than 18 Pounders, the Enemy having but one Gun that could carry so big as an 18 pound Ball.</p>
               <p>It were a fondness, after such assertions, to take any notice of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck'd Statue, when there was so much the less need of erecting one (as is asserted <hi>P.</hi> 108.) having already been done so well, that even this Author himself despairs of doing it better; and that by one, a Man of such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused and Embalm'd a Reputation, as <hi>that his Commendations</hi> are asserted to be enough to <hi>Immortalize</hi> the Reputation of Sir <hi>William,</hi> or whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else <hi>he should</hi> please to bestow them upon, <hi>viz.</hi> That Reverend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>who was</hi> the President of the only University, then in the <hi>English America, P.</hi> 109. Which by the way, is a much fairer Statue, in honour of the President of the University, than that erected for Sir <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For notwithstanding all this noise of Erecting Statues, and the great danger in plucking them down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in <hi>P.</hi> 89. 'tis said, that even Sir <hi>William</hi> shewed Choler enough, leaving it open for others, thereby to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that he was wholly given over to Passion and Choler. And in <hi>P.</hi> 92. 'tis said he did not affect any mighty shew of Devotion; these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions with others may prevail with the unbiast Reader, to think that these builders of Statues, had some further design in it, than to blazen the Achievements of Sir <hi>William Phips, viz.</hi> To set forth Mr. <hi>I. Mathers</hi> Negotiation in <hi>England,</hi> his procuring the New-Charter for Sir <hi>William</hi> to be Governour, and himself Establish'd President of the College, are the things principally driven at in the Book.</p>
               <p>Another principal thing is to set forth the supposed Witchcrafts in <hi>New-England,</hi> and how well Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> the Younger therein acquitted himself.</p>
               <p>As to the New Charter, for the right understanding that Affair, it will be needful to say, that the People that afterwards settled in <hi>New England,</hi> being about to leave their Native soil, and to seek (as the Providence of God should direct them) a settlement in remote Regions, wherein they might best secure their Civil and Religious Interests, before they enter'd upon this, considering it might be needful on many accounts for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture well-being, they obtain'd a Charter to be in the nature of a prime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, setting forth the Soveraigns Prerogative, and the Peoples Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; in the enjoyment whereof they long continued, after having purchas'd the Title to their Lands, of the Natives of the Country, and settled themselves therein, without any charge to the Crown.</p>
               <p>That Clause in their Charter for this Country, <hi>viz.</hi> (Provided that no other Christian Prince be prepossest of it) being a tacit acknowledgment, that before settlement no one Christian Prince had any right thereto more than another. During this time of <hi>New-Englands</hi> Prosperity, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here were very sparing of Granting Freedoms, except to such as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49354:82"/>
were so and so qualified. Whereby the number of <hi>Non</hi>-Freemen being much increas'd, they were very uneasie, by their being shut out from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any share in the Government, or having any Votes for their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it rendred many of them ready to join with such as were undermining the Government, not duly considering that it had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>een far more safe to have endeavoured to prevail with the Legislators for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.</p>
               <p>So that it will not be wonder'd at that in the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. and of King <hi>Iames,</hi> (when most of the Charters in <hi>England</hi> were vacated) that this was <hi>quo warranto'd,</hi> and finally Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment entered up against it, and the Country put into such a form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as was most agreeable to those times, <hi>viz.</hi> A Legislative pow'r was lodg'd in the Governour (or President) and some few appointed to be of his Counsel, without any regard therein, either to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> or those formerly of this Colony: Thus rendring the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this Country beyond comparison worse than those of any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration in <hi>England.</hi> The People of those Corporations being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged still to have a right to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> when their particular Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were made void. But here when <hi>Magna Charta</hi> has been pleaded, the People have been answered, that they must not expect that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> would follow them to the end of the World: not only their Estates, but their Lives being thereby rendred wholly precarious. And Judge <hi>Palmer</hi> has set forth in Print, that the King has power to grant such a Commission over this People.</p>
               <p>It is not hard to imagin, that under such a Commission, not only the People were liable to be opprest by Taxes, but also by Confiscations, and Siezing of Lands, unless Patents were purchased at Excessive prizes, with many other Exorbitant Innovations.</p>
               <p>The first that accepted this Commission was Mr. <hi>Dudley,</hi> a Gentleman born in this Country, who did but prepare the way for Sir <hi>Edm. Andres.</hi> In whose time things being grown to such Extremities, not only here, but in <hi>England,</hi> as render'd the succeeding Revolution absolutely necessary, the Revolution here being no other than an acting according to the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent given by <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time of Sir <hi>Edmonds</hi>'s Government, Mr. <hi>Increase Mather,</hi> Teacher of the <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It has been an Observation of long continuance, <hi>that matters of State seldom prosper, when managed by the Clergy.</hi> Among the opposers of the reassuming few so strenuous as some of the Ministers, and among the Ministers none more vehement than Mr. <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> Pastor of the <hi>North</hi>-Church in <hi>Boston,</hi> who has charged them as they would answer it another day not to reassume. Among his Arguments against it, one was that it would be to put a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Any Man that knows <hi>New-England</hi> cannot but be sensible, that such Discourses from such Men, have always been very prevalent. And hence it was that even those that would think themselves wronged, if they were not numbred among the best Friends to <hi>New-England,</hi> and to its Charter, would not so much as stoop to take it up, when there was really nothing to hinder them from the Enjoyment thereof.</p>
               <p>After the Committee of Safety had continued about seven Weeks, or rather after Anarchy had been so long Triumphant, an Assembly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been call'd, came to this resolve, and laid it before those Gentlemen that had been of the Government, that if they would not act upon the Foundation of the Charter, that persuant to it, the Assembly would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point some others in that Station. The Answer to which was, that they would accept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when a Declaration signifying such a reassuming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was prepared with the good liking of the Deputies, in order to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, some that were opposers, so terrified those Gentlemen, that before publishing it was underwritten [that they would not have it understood that they did reassume Charter Government] to the no small amazement of the People, and disappointment of the Deputies, who if these had not promised so to act, had taken other care, and put in those that would.</p>

                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:49354:83"/>The next principal thing done was, they chose two of their Members, <hi>viz.</hi> One of the upper House, the other of the lower, both of them Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of known Integrity, as well as ability, to go to <hi>England,</hi> in order to obtain their Resettlement; And in regard Mr. <hi>I. Mather</hi> was already there, they joined him, as also a certain Gentlemen in <hi>London</hi> with these other two: Those from hence being arrived in <hi>London,</hi> they all united for the common Interest of the Countrey, tho without the desired effect. They were in doubt, whether it were best to Improve their Utmost for a reversal of the Judgment in a Course of Law, or to obtain it in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way, or to Petition his Majesty for a New Grant of former Priviledges; And considering that the two first might prove Dilatory and Expensive, as well as for other reasons, they resolved upon the latter, and Petition'd his Majesty for the Countries Resettlement, with former Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and what further additionals his Majesty in his Princely Wisdom should think fit. Accordingly it pleased his Majesty to declare in Counsel his Determination. <hi>viz.</hi> That there should be a Charter granted to <hi>New-England.</hi> But the Minutes then taken thereof, and a Draught of the New-Charter being seen, it was the Opinion of the two Gentlemen sent from hence, that it were best to tarry his Majesties return from <hi>Flanders</hi>; in hopes then to obtain ease in such things, as might be any ways deemed to be grievous. And this was the result of the Advice of such as were best able to give it, that they could meet with, and accordingly they wholly desisted taking it out of the Offices.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> and that other Gentleman had, as it is said, other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given them, which they strenuously pursued, and his Majesty having left it as is asserted in this of the Life of Sir <hi>William, P.</hi> 57, to them to nominate a Governour, they pitcht upon Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> who was then in <hi>England.</hi> [As the most likely and able to serve the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests among the People there; under the changes in some things unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable now brought upon them, <hi>P.</hi> 62.] and without tarrying for the concurrence of those other Agents, the Charter was taken out, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> perhaps fearing he should have but small thanks here, for his having so far an hand in bringing upon them those unacceptable Changes, wrote, and caused to be Printed, an Account of his Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but surely by some Error in the Conception, it proved only an <hi>Embrio,</hi> and was stifled as soon as born. One indeed, designed to be as it were a <hi>Posthumus</hi> was left with Mr. <hi>Bailey,</hi> formerly of <hi>Boston,</hi> and a Member of the <hi>North</hi>-Church, with a charge not to suffer it to be seen, till he were gone to <hi>New-England</hi>; yet it seems some other person got a sight of it, which was the occasion of Mr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s sending him that Minatory E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, by some call'd a Bull. But besides this, for fear of the worst, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> got several <hi>Non-con</hi> Ministers to give him a Testimonial, or Letters of Commendations for his great Service herein.</p>

               <p>Not but that the present Charter of <hi>New-England,</hi> is indeed truly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as containing in it peculiar Priviledges, which abundantly Engages this People to pay the tribute of thankfulness to his Majesty, and all due subjection to whom it shall please him to substitute as Governour over us; and to pray that the King of Kings would pour out of his richest blessings upon him, giving him a long and prosperous Reign over the Nations, under the benign Influences whereof, Oppression and Tyranny may flee away.</p>
               <p>And if his Majesty hath put this People into the present form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to the end they might be in the better condition of Defence in a time of War; or that they might the better understand the Priviledge of choosing their own Governour by the want of it, and should be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleased (the War being over) to restore to these, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted to the rest of his Majesties Subjects, the full enjoyment of their Ancient Priviledges, it would be such an obligation upon them to thankfulness and Duty, as could never be forgotten, nor sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, and would rather abate than increase charge to the Crown.</p>

But Sir <hi>William,</hi> when the Witchcrafts at <hi>Salem</hi> began (in his Esteem) to look formidable, that he might Act safely in this Affair, he asked the Advice of the Ministers in and near <hi>Boston</hi>; the whole of their Advice and Answer is Printed in <hi>Cases of Conscience</hi> the last Pages. But lest the World should be Ignorant who it was that drew the said Advice, in this Book of the Life of Sir <hi>William Phips, P.</hi> 77. are these words, <hi>the Ministers made unto his Excellency and the Counsel a return, drawn up at their desire, by Mr.</hi> Mather <hi>the Younger, as I have been informed.</hi> Mr. <hi>C.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49354:84"/>
to increase, and Water to quench the Conflagration. Particularly after the Devils testimony, by the supposed Afflicted had so prevailed, as to take away the Life of one, and the Liberty of an Hundred, and the whole Country set into a most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: consternation, then this Advice is given, ushered in with thanks for what was already done, and in conclusion, putting the Government upon a speedy and vigorous prosecution according to the Laws of God, and the wholsome Statutes of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, so adding Oyl rather than Water to the Flame; for who so little acquainted with proceedings of <hi>England,</hi> as not to know that they have taken some methods, with those here used to discover who were Witches. The rest of the Advice consisting of cautions and directions, are inserted in this of the Life of Sir <hi>William.</hi> So that if Sir <hi>William,</hi> looking upon the thanks for what was past, and Exhortation to proceed, went on to take away the Lives of Nineteen more, this is according to the Advice said to be given him by the Ministers, and if the Devil after those Executions be affronted, by disbelieving his testimony, and by clearing and Pardoning all the rest of the Accused; yet this also is according to that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but to cast the Scale; the same that drew this Advice, saith, in <hi>Wonders of the Invisible World, Enchantments Encountred</hi>; [that to have a hand in any thing that may stifle or obstruct a regular direction of that Witchcraft, is what we may well with a Holy fear avoid: Their Majesties good Subjects must not every day be torn to pieces by horrid Witchcraft, and those bloody Felons be wholly left unprosecuted. The Witchcraft is a business that will not be shamm'd]. The Pastor of that Church, of which Sir <hi>William</hi> was a Member, being of this Principle, and thus declaring it, after the former advice; no wonder tho it cast the Scale against those Cautions. It is rather a Wonder that no more Blood was shed, for if that Advice of his Pastors could still have prevail'd with the Governour, Witchcraft had not been so sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med off as it was.

But this is not all, tho this Book pretends to raise a Statue in Honour of Sir <hi>Wiliiam,</hi> yet it apears it was the least part of the design of the Author to Honour him, but it was rather to Honour himself, and the Ministers; It being so unjust to Sir <hi>William,</hi> as to give a full Account of the cautions given him, but designedly hiding from the Reader the Incouragements and Exhortations to proceed, that were laid before him (under the name of the Ministers Advice) in effect, telling the World that those Executions at <hi>Salem,</hi> were without, and against the Advice of the Ministers, exprest in those Cautions, purposely hiding their giving thanks for what was already done, and exhorting to proceed; thereby rendring <hi>Sir William</hi> of so sanguin a Complexion, that the Ministers had such cause to fear his going on with the Tragedy, tho against their Advice; that they desired the President to write his <hi>Cases of Conscience, &amp;c.</hi> To plead msinformation will not salve here, however it may seem to pallitate other things, but is a manifest, designed traversty, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representation of the Ministers Advice to <hi>Sir William,</hi> a hiding the truth, and a wronging the dead, whom the Author so much pretends to honour; for which the Acknowledgments ought to be as Universal as the Offence.

But the Scriptures are full in it, and the Instances numerous, that the Almighty, Divine Being has this prerogative to make use of what Instrument he pleaseth, in Afflicting any, and consequently to commissionate Devils: And tho this word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioning, in the Authors former Books, might be thought to be by inadvertency; yet now after he hath been caution'd of it, still to persist in it seems highly Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal. And therefore in the name of God; I here charge such belief as guilty of Sacriledge in the highest Nature, and so much worse than stealing Church Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As it is a higher Offence to steal any of the glorious Attributes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49354:85"/>
to bestow them upon Mortals, than it is to steal the Utensils appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to his Service. And whether to ascribe such power of commissioning Devils to the worst of Men, be not direct Blasphemy, I leave to others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to determine. When the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were so wicked as to ascribe to <hi>Beelze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the Righteous God is contending with Apostate Sinners, for their departures from him, by his Judgments, as Plagues, Earthquakes, Storms and Tempests, Sicknesses and Diseases, Wars, loss of Cattle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then not only to ascribe this to the Devil, but to charge one another with sending or commissionating those Devils to these things, is so abominable and so wicked, that it requires a better Judgment than mine to give it its just denomination.</p>
               <p>But that Christians so called should not only charge their fellow Christians therewith, but proceed to Tryals and Executions; crediting that Enemy to all Goodness, and Accuser of the Brethren, rather than believe their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in their own Defence; This is so Diabolical a Wickedness as cannot proceed, but from a Doctrine of Devils; how far damnable it is let others discuss. Tho such things were acting in this Country in Sir <hi>William</hi> time, yet <hi>p.</hi> 65.

And if Sir <hi>William</hi> had such an Invisible pattern to imitate, no wonder tho some of his Actions were unaccountable, especially those relating to Witchcraft: For if there was in those Actions an Angel super-intending, there is little reason to think it was <hi>Gabriel</hi> or the Spirit of <hi>Mercury,</hi> nor <hi>Handel</hi> the Angel or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is the Command vain and Unintelligible? <hi>Sol.</hi> For any to say, that a Witch is one that makes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with, and Commissions Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is indeed to render the Law of God vain and Unintelligible, as having provided no way whereby they might be detected, and proved to be such; And how the <hi>Iews</hi> waded thro this difficulty for so many Ages, without the Supplement of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, would be very mysterious. But to him that can read the Scriptures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice from Education, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will manifestly appear that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full and Intelligible, both as to the Crime and means to detect the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. He that shall hereafter see any person, who to confirm People in a false belief, about the power of Witches and Devils, pretending to a sign to confirm it; such as knocking off of invisible Ghains with the hand, driving away Devils by brishing, striking with a Sword or Stick, to wound a person at a great distance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may (according to that head of Mr. <hi>Gauls,</hi> quoted by Mr. <hi>G.
