            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus shortly haue I passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the outrages tempest, wherin the disciples of Christe were te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, after that the great multitude were by Christe fedde in the deserte. Omit tinge many profitable notes, which myght wel haue bene marcked in the terte, because my purpose is at this present not to be tediouse nor yet curiouse, but onlie to note such thinges, as be aggreable to these most dolorouse dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:8575:27"/>And so let vs nowe speake of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of this storme and trouble, in which I finde foure thinges cheflye to be noted.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Firste, that the disciples at the pre sence of Christe were more affrayed then they were before.</item>
               <item>2. Secondlye, that Christe vseth no other instrument but his worde to pacifie their hertes.</item>
               <item>3. Thyrdlye, that Peter in a feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie firste left his bote, and yet after feared.</item>
               <item>4. Last, that Christe permitted ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Peter nor the rest of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to perish in that feare, but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously deliuered al, and pacified the tempeste.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theyr greate fear and the cause therof are expressed in the texte in these wordes: When the disciples sawe him walking vpon the sea, they were afrayed sayinge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was a spirite. And they cryed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe feare.</p>
            <p>It is not my purpose in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to speake of spirites, nor yet to dispute, whether spirites good or bad maye appeare and trouble men: neither yet to inquire, why ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8575:27"/>
natur is affrayed for spirites, and so vehementlie abhorreth their presen ce and company. But my purpose is only to speake of thinges necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for this tyme.<note place="margin">Thre causes why Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew hym.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And firste let vs consyder, that ther was thre causes, why the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples knewe not Christe, but iudged him to be a spirite.</p>
            <p>The first cause was the darknesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the nyght.</p>
            <p>The second was the vnaccusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vision that appeared. And the thirde was the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger and tempest,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in which they so earnestly labored for the sauegard of their selues.</p>
            <p>The darknesse (I saye) of the nyght letted theyr eyes to see hym: And it was aboue nature, that a massye, heuy and weyghtie body of a man (suche as they vnderstode their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Christe to haue) shuld walke, go vpon, or be borne vp of the water of the ragynge sea, and not sincke. And finally the horroure of the tempest and greate daunger that they were in perswaded them to loke for none other but certaynly to be drouned.</p>
            <p>And so al these thre thinges concur rynge together confirmed in them
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8575:28"/>
this imaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Christe Iesus, who came to theyr greate comforte and deliuerau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, was a fearfull and wicked spirite appearyng to their<note place="margin">Vvhat cha unsed to Christe, that also in all ages chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to his holy worde.</note> destruccyon.</p>
            <p>What here chaunsed to Christe Iesus him self, that I myght proue to haue chaunsed and dayly to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to the veritie of his blessed worde in al ages from the begynnynge.</p>
            <p>For as Christe hym self in this their trouble, was iudged and estemed by his disciples at the firste syght a spirite or phantastical body: so is the truth and syncere preachinge of his gloriouse gospel sent by God for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes most comforte, delyueraunce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> synn, and quietnesse of conscience, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is firste offered and truly pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ached, it is (I saye) no lesse but iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be heresye and disceauable doctrine, sent by the deuel to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes destruccion.</p>

            <p>The lyfe is to be seen in the bofe of Kynges, both vnder Eliseus and Esaias the Prophetes.

All these thynges together consydered, decla re, that Peter in this his extreame feare &amp; daunger had yet some sparke of fayth (albeit in that present ieopar die he neither felte consolacion nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forte.) For these premisses are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted tokens that he had faythe. But now to the ende, which is this:</p>
            <p>And immediatly Jesus stretched forth his hande, and caught hym, and sayd vnto hym: O thou of lytle fayth, wherfore dyddest thou dout.
