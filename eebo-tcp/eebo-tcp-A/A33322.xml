         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

held by the space of one and twenty years; At the same
time <hi>Astyages</hi> was made Governour of <hi>Media</hi> by <hi>Cyaxares</hi>
his Father; and the better to strengthen themselves, they
entred into Affinity, by <hi>Astyages</hi> his giving his Daughter
<hi>Amytis</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the Son of <hi>Nabopolaser,</hi> and
thereupon joyning their Forces together,<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95888:4"/>
Shortly after, the Governour of <hi>Coelosyria,</hi> and <hi>Poenicia,</hi>
revolting from <hi>Nabopolaser,</hi> he sent against him his Son
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (having first associated him with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon)</hi> with a great Army,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> made King.</note>
which was in the latter end of the third, and the beginning
of the fourth year of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> King of <hi>Juda;</hi> as appears
<hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 1. compared with <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was no sooner thus associated with his
Father in the Kingdom, but the things which he was to
act,<note place="margin">Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of him.</note> were presently revealed to the Prophet <hi>Jeremy;</hi> the
first whereof was the overthrow of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> First
at the River <hi>Euphrates;</hi> then in their own Country,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 46. The first of these came to pass presently, <hi>Pharao
Neco</hi>'s Forces, which he left at <hi>Carchemish,</hi> being cut off by
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in the fourth year of <hi>Jehoiakim, Jer.</hi> 46. 2.
The second was not till after the taking of <hi>Tyre,</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth
year of the Captivity of <hi>Jechonia.</hi> Ezek. 29.
17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>In the third year of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His first Action. He Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers <hi>Jehoiakim.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
his Father being yet alive, entred <hi>Judaea</hi> with a great
Army, who, besieging, and forcing <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> made <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi>
his Vassal, in despight of <hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> who had
made him King, and took with him to <hi>Babylon,</hi> for Pledges,
<hi>Daniel,</hi> who was yet a child, with <hi>Ananias, Misael,</hi> and
<hi>Azarias.</hi> He took also part of the Treasures belonging to
the Temple; but stayed not to search thorowly for
all. For <hi>Necho</hi> hasted with his Army to the relief of
<hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> hoping to find <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in <hi>Judaea.</hi> But
this great <hi>Babylonian</hi> had no mind to hazard himself and
his Army against the <hi>Egyptian, Judaea</hi> being so ill affected
towards him, and himself far from all succour; or sure
place of retreat. If he had (as may be supposed) any
great strength of <hi>Scythian</hi> Horsemen, it was wisely done of
him to fall back out of that rough Mountanous, and hot
Country, into places that were more even and temperate.
And besides these reasons,<note place="margin">His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death.</note> the Death of his Father hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
at the same time, gave him just occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home, and take possession of his own Kingdom,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95888:4"/>
before he proceeded in the second care, of adding more
unto it.</p>
                  <p>And this he did at reasonable good leasure. For the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> was not provided to follow him so far, and to
bid him Battel, until the new year came in, which was the
fourth of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> the first of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and the
last of <hi>Necho.</hi> In this year the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> lying upon the
Banks of <hi>Euphrates</hi> (his own Territories bounding it on
the North-side) attended the coming of <hi>Necho:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers <hi>Pharaoh Necho.</hi>
                     </note> there, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a cruel Battel fought betwixt them, <hi>Necho</hi> was slain, and
his Army forced to save it self by a violent retreat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it suffered great loss.</p>
                  <p>This Victory was so well pursued by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
that he recovered all <hi>Syria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers <hi>Syria.</hi>
                     </note> and whatsoever the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
held out of their proper Territories towards the North.
The <hi>Egyptians</hi> being thus beaten, and altogether for the
present discouraged, <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> held himself quiet, as being
in heart a Friend to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet having made his
peace with the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> the year before, and <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
was contented with such profit as he could there
readily make: he had forborn to lay any Tribute upon the
<hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this cool reservedness of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> was, on both
sides, taken in ill part. Whereupon the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King
<hi>Psamnis,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Necho,</hi> began to think of restoring
<hi>Jehoahaz</hi> (who had been taken prisoner by his Father,
and carried into <hi>Egypt)</hi> and of setting him up, as a Domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
enemy against his ungrateful Brother. But to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
all such accidents, the <hi>Judean</hi> had put in practice the
usual remedy, which his Fore-fathers used: For he had
made his own Son <hi>Jechonia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 9.</note> King with him long before;
in the second year of his own Raign, when the Boy was
but eight years old. As for this rumor of <hi>Jehoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi>
his return, the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> foretold, that
it should prove a vain attempt, saying, <hi>He shall not
return thither, But he shall die in the place whither they
have led him Captive, and shall see this Land no more.</hi> Jer.
12. 11, 12.</p>

                     </note> having lost all their Mercenary Forces,
and received that heavy blow at <hi>Carchemish,</hi> had more

fought only with brave words, telling such frivolous

their former glorious acts against <hi>Josias,</hi> and <hi>Jehoahaz.</hi>
And truly in such a time and case, it was easie for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim</hi>
to give them satisfaction, by letting them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the sincerity of his affections towards them, which
appeared in time following.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> went more roundly to work:<note place="margin">

                     </note> For
he sent a peremptory message to <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> requiring him
not to stand upon any nice points, but presently to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
himself his Subject, and to pay him Tribute; Adding
thereunto such terrible threatnings, as made the poor
<hi>Judaean</hi> lay aside all thoughts of adhearing unto <hi>Pharaoh;</hi>
and to yield to do, as the more powerful would have
him.</p>
                  <p>Thus he continued in Obedience to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
three years; During which time the Prophet <hi>Jeremia,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out against the impiety of the <hi>Jews,</hi> puting them in
mind that he had now for three and twenty years exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to repentance; But because they had stopped
their ears against him,<note place="margin">The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</note> and the rest of the Prophets, he
now foretold that their Captivity was at hand, and that
they should bear the yoak of Bondage for seventy years.<note place="margin">Jer. 25. 15, &amp;c.</note>
The same calamity he threatned to all the Neighbouring
Nations,<note place="margin">Jer. 27.</note> to the <hi>Egyptians, Moabites, Ammonites, Idumae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and the rest; foretelling that they should all drink out
of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Cup the Wine of his fury, whom they had
forsaken; and that after the seventy years should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
the <hi>Babylonians</hi> themselves should tast of the same
Cup, and be utterly subverted by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95888:5"/>

of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> seems to have been in the
fourth year of this <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> at which time, <hi>Baruch</hi> the
Scribe, wrote all his Prophesies from his mouth, whom
he sent to read them unto the People, and afterwards to the
Princes, who presented them to the King: But fearing
the Kings fury, they had first set <hi>Jeremy</hi> at liberty, and
advised him, and <hi>Baruch,</hi> to hide themselves, <hi>Jeremiah

<hi>that the dead Body of</hi> Jehoiakim, <hi>should be cast

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> thought himself secure
from all danger, as being Tributary to the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and
yet withall, well thought on by the <hi>Egyptian:</hi> About
which time the mighty City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> opposed it self against
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> and upon just confidence of her own
strength, despised all preparations that could be made
against her. Now for as much as the tearm of seventy
years was prescribed for the desolation, as well of <hi>Tyre,</hi>

that they that refer the winning of this City
to the ninteenth year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> have good
ground and warrant for it. For the Siege thereof began
in the seventh year of his Raign, and lasted thirteen
years.</p>
                  <p>Here it will not be amiss to insert a brief note concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the beginning of this great Princes Rule; The third
year of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> was the last of <hi>Nabul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sser,</hi> who being
freed from other cares, and businesses, took notice of such
as had revolted from him to <hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> and sent this
Noble Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Son, with an Army into <hi>Syria</hi> to reclaim
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95888:6"/>
them. In this expedition was <hi>Daniel</hi> carried to <hi>Babylon,</hi>
who therefore makes mention of it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 1. The year
next following, being the fourth of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> was the first
year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> which <hi>Jeremy</hi> affirmeth in express
words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 1. And from this we must reckon all his
time, and actions which follow to be spoken of. In
his three and twentieth year he conquered <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
then began his great Empire, there being none lest that
durst offend, or oppose him. The second from this year it
was wherein <hi>Daniel</hi> saw that vision of the Image consisting
of sundry mettals, which prefigured the succession of great
Kingdoms, that should Rule the World before the coming
of Christ. But to return to the Siege of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which began
in the seventh year of his Raign.</p>
                  <p>The Stately City of <hi>Tyre</hi> covered all the ground of an
Island,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tyre</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</note> that was divided from the Continent, by a deep,
and broad Channel of the Sea. The <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> had no
Fleet of Ships, neither were they Seamen: the <hi>Tyrians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
all other Nations in multitude of goodly Ships,
and skill to use them: and every Wind, from one part or
other, brought in all needfull provisions to the City:
Wherefore neither force, nor Famine could greatly
hurt the place; whereof nevertheless, the Judgements
of God (denounced against it by <hi>Isay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isay 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Ese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel)</hi>
had threatened the destruction;<note place="margin">Jer. 25.</note> and the obstinate
resolution of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had fully determined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
it.<note place="margin">Esek. 26.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This haughty King, impatient of resistance, undertook
a vast piece of Work,<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the work.</note> which was, to fill up that part of
the Sea which divided the Island from the continent. The
City of old <hi>Tyre,</hi> that stood opposite to the New, upon the
firm Land, and the Mountain of <hi>Libanus</hi> near adjoyning,
that was loaden with stately Cedars, and abundance of
other Trees, furnished him with materials to effect it.
Thirteen years were spent in this difficult, and hopeless un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
which need not seem strange, if we consider,
that <hi>Alexander,</hi> working upon that foundation which was
remaining of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Peer, and being withall,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95888:6"/>
assisted with a strong Fleet, was yet seven moneths
ere he could make way into the City. Wherefore, if the
raging of the Sea was able to carry away that wherewith
<hi>Alexander</hi> laboured to cover a Shelve, with much more
violence could it overturn, and as it were, consume the
work of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> who laid his foundation in
the bottom of the deep; Striving, as it were, to fill the
empty Belly of this greedy Cormorant, whereas the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi>
did only stop the throat of it. All may know that
God could easily have accomplished his own threatnings
against this place (though it had not pleased him to use,
either a Miracle, or such of his more immediate Engins,
as are Earthquakes, &amp;c.) by making at least, the Seas
calm, and adding the favourable concurrence of all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
helps. But so it pleaseth him oft times, in chastising
the Pride of man, to use the hand of man, even the hand
of man, striving, as it may seem, against all resistance
of nature, and providence. So that by this excessive la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> that Scripture was fulfilled, that
<hi>every Head should be made bald, and every Shoulder should be
made bare,</hi> Esek. 29. 18. Yet would not <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
give over till he was master of the Town.</p>
                  <p>When he was entred upon this desperate undertaking,
whether it were by some losses received, or some Mutany
in his Army, or some glorious rumour of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
strength, his evil willers took courage to rebell against
him; and amongst them, <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> renounced his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and began to hope for the contrary which soon
after fell out. For <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> gave him no leasure to
do much hurt: But with part of his Army, he marched
strait into <hi>Judea;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> rebels, and is taken, and slain.</note> where the amazed King made so little
resistance (the <hi>Egyptians</hi> having left him, as it were in a
dream) that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> entred <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> laid hands
on <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 22. 18, 19. &amp; 36. 30.</note> whom at first he bound, intending to send
him to <hi>Babylon,</hi> but his mind changing, he caused him to be
slain in that place, and gave him the Burial of an Ass, to be
devoured by Beasts, and ravinous Birds, according to the
former Prophesie; Leaving in his place his Son, <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 10.</note>
following the Counsel of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
made no resistance,<note place="margin">Jer. 24. 1. &amp; 29. 1, 2.</note> but submitted himself to the Kings
will, wherein he both pleased God, and did that which
was most profitable for himself,<note place="margin">Esek. 17. 12.</note> though at the present it
might seem otherwise, to such as considered the evil that
befell him, rather than the greater evill that he thereby
avoided. This only particular act of his is recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which was good: But it seems that he was at least a
partaker in his Fathers sins, if not a provoker, which was
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause, that though he submitted himself to Gods will, yet
did he not preserve his estate: For so it is said, <hi>That he did
evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his Father had
done.</hi> In his stead, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> set up <hi>Mattania,</hi> his
Uncle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zedekiah</hi> is made King.</note> making him King of <hi>Judea,</hi> and called him <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias.</hi>
For like as <hi>Necho,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had formerly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
<hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> after he had slain his Father <hi>Josias,</hi> and set
up <hi>Jehoiachim,</hi>

                  <p>In the first year of <hi>Zedechias,</hi>

or Roul he gave to <hi>Seriah,</hi> when he went with King <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechias</hi>
to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to visit <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> willing him
first to read it to the Captive <hi>Jews,</hi> and then to binde a

words;<note place="margin">Sundry Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of <hi>Jeremy.</hi>

                     <hi>Thus shall</hi> Babel <hi>be drowned, and shall not rise from

to <hi>Babylon</hi> is probably thought to be in way of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,<note place="margin">Jer. 51. 59.</note>
and to carry some presents to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> But
yet its likely he had some suit to make, which his Lordly
Master refused to grant, and sent him away discontented.
For at his return, all the bordering Princes sent Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to him, inciting him (as it seems) to those unquiet
courses from which the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> dehorted both
him,<note place="margin">Jer. 27. 8.</note> and them. About which time the Prophet, by Gods
appointment, made bonds, and yokes, one of which he
wore about his own neck, others he sent unto the five
Kings, of <hi>Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre,</hi> and <hi>Zidon,</hi> by those
Messengers which came to visit <hi>Zedechias,</hi> making them
know, that if they, and the King of <hi>Juda</hi> continued in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
to <hi>Babylon,</hi> they should then possess, and enjoy their
own Countries; If not, they should assuredly perish by the
Sword, by Famine and by Pestilence.</p>
                  <p>He also foretold them that those Vessels which yet
remained in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> should be carried after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet at length should be restored again.</p>
                  <p>The same year <hi>Ananias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ananias</hi> a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> the false Prophet, took off the
Woodden yoke which <hi>Jeremy</hi> did wear, as a sign of the
Captivity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and brake it: Vaunting, that in
like manner after two years,<note place="margin">Jer. 28.</note> God would break the strength
of <hi>Babel,</hi> and the yoke which he laid on all Nations: and
that he would restore <hi>Jeconias</hi> and all the <hi>Jews,</hi> with the
Vessels, and Riches of the Temple, and put an end to all
these troubles. But <hi>Jeremy</hi> instead of his Woodden Yoke,
wore a Coller of Iron; and in sign that <hi>Ananias</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a false, and deceitfull hope to the People, he foretold
the Death of this false Prophet,<note place="margin">Jer. 28. 15.</note> which accordingly came to
pass in the seventh Moneth.</p>

After this,<note place="margin">

should be taken and burnt; that the King should not
escape, but be taken Prisoner, and brought to the
presence of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> That he should not perish
by the Sword, but being carried to <hi>Babel,</hi> should there die a
naturall Death.</p>
                  <p>The following year,<note place="margin">Jer. 44.</note> 
                     <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was surrounded, and

in the succours of <hi>Egypt:</hi> for he assured them that they
should return back again, and in no sort relieve them.
And it fell out accordingly. For when the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

made them free, thereby to encourage them to fight, did
now upon the breaking up of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Army, repent
of what they had done, and thinking that all danger had
been past, they held them by force to their former slavery.
But the <hi>Caldeans</hi> being returned to the Siege, the Prophet
<hi>Jeremy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 34.</note> when the State of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> began now to grow to

any supplies of men or Victuals.<note place="margin">Jer. 39. 1. &amp; 52. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Josephus</hi> saith, that they
overtopped the Walls with their high Towers which they
erected upon Mounts, from which, with their Engines
they did so beat upon the Walls, that the desendants were
forced to forsake their stations. And though the Besieged
also raised Counter-Buildings, like unto these, yet the
Great <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who Commanded all the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereabouts, &amp; had the Woods, and Rivers at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
found out means to disappoint &amp; overthrow all the
Citizens endeavours, and to beat down their Towers as
fast as they raised them. For his own works were guarded
by the Walls of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whereas theirs within lay open
to his Batteries. Besides, both Famine, and Pestilence
(which commonly accompany men straitly besieged)
grew fast upon them, whereby, when the number, strength

                  <p>
                     <hi>Zedechias,</hi>

                        <hi>Zedechias</hi> flyes and is taken.</note> beholding this uncomfortable sight, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other means to escape the present danger, lost both
his Courage, and his Hope at once, and shifted himself, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95888:9"/>
with his Wives, Children, Princes, and principall
Servants, out of the City, by a way under-ground, leaving
his amazed, and now headless Subjects to the merciless
Swords of their enraged enemies. Thus he, who when
the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> perswaded him to render himself, dispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
both the Counsel of God, and the Army and force of
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> used now the remedy which one calls,
<hi>A wofull, shamefull, and unfortunate shift.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this secret subterranean Vault, <hi>Zedechias</hi> stole away,
&amp; by the help of the dark night, recovered the plains, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts
of <hi>Jericho.</hi> But by reason of the train that followed
him and his (every one leading with him those whom he
loved best) he was easily traced and pursued. How great
soever the company was that attended him, yet certain it
is, that they, on whose fidelity he most relied, no sooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the <hi>Caldeans</hi> to draw neer, but they all abandoned his
defence, and shifted for themselves in the Desarts, as they
could. For <hi>whom God had forsaken, no man regarded.</hi> And
thus <hi>Zedechias</hi> was taken by the Ministers of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
and being made a Prisoner, together with his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and Princes, he was carried to <hi>Riblah,</hi> in the Tribe of
<hi>Nephthalim,</hi> where <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> then lay, as a place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
between <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> with both which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he had at one time to do.</p>
                  <p>Now when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had laid before <hi>Zedechias</hi>
the many Graces and Favours which he had conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him,<note place="margin">And car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </note> together with the notable falshood and perjury
wherewith he had requited him,<note place="margin">Jer. 34. 3, &amp;c.</note> he commanded his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">2 King. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 7.</note>
Princes, and Friends to be slain before his face. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his eyes to be put out, and so carried him like a Slave to
<hi>Babylon,</hi> where he consumed the rest of his life in perpetual
imprisonment. Herein was that marvellous Prophesie of
<hi>Esekiel</hi> fulfilled: <hi>I will bring him to</hi> Babylon, <hi>and he shall not
see it,</hi> Esek. 12. 13.</p>
                  <p>Thus in the eleventh, and last year of <hi>Zedechias,</hi> which
was the eighteenth of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> entred

                     <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by force, where sparing neither Sex nor Age, they
put all to the Sword that they found therein.</p>
                  <p>In the year next following,<note place="margin">2 King. 25. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Nebuzaradan,</hi> the Generall

to submit himself to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King, who being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of God for them, as an instrument of his Justice, was,
therefore irresistable.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> being left to his own choise to live
where he pleaced,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jeremy</hi> goes to them.</note> made choise to go to <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> to whom

him kindly,<note place="margin">Jer. 40. 6.</note> but comforted him, and all the other
<hi>Jews</hi> that were left under his charge, promising them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and liberty, so long as they remained obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> by whom he was established Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall

                  <p>But ere the year was exspired, a Prince of the late Kings

they escaped,<note place="margin">2 King. 25. 25.</note> and in their way, encountring with eighty
persons, repairing toward <hi>Gedaliah</hi> with persents, they slew
most of them, and onely spared some, who promised to
discover to them some Treasures that were hidden in the
Fields during the War. They took with them also a
Daughter of <hi>Zedechias</hi> committed to the care of <hi>Gedaliah</hi>
by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> This treachery of <hi>Ismael</hi> had been
formerly discovered to <hi>Gedaliah</hi> by <hi>Johanan,</hi> one of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Judea</hi> being now without a Governour (for <hi>Ismael</hi> durst
not take it upon him, but fled as fast as he could to the
<hi>Ammonites)</hi> the residue of the <hi>Jews,</hi> fearing the revenge
of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> resolved to fly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and besought
<hi>Jeremy</hi> to ask counsell of God for them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jeremy's</hi> counsel rejected.</note> who returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that if they remained in <hi>Judea,</hi> God would provide
for them, and shew them mercy; but if they sought to
save themselves in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 43.</note> they should then undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
perish. Notwithstanding which advice, the <hi>Jews</hi> held
their determination, and despised the Oracle of God; and
constraining <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> to accompany them, they
went into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and stoned.</note> and by the permission of <hi>Pharao,</hi> they

them for their Idolatry, foretelling the destruction of

Death, and by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who greatly reverenced
him, buried neer the Sepulchre of their Kings, <hi>Jer.
42.</hi> &amp; 43.</p>
                  <p>The nineteenth year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Raign it was,
when destroying utterly the great and mighty City of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he exceedingly enriched himself with the spoils
of it, and the Temple, and by that dreadfull Example
terrified all those that should dare to resist him. From that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95888:10"/>
time forward, he, to his three and twentieth year, laboured
in the Conquest of those adjoyning Countries,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> Conquers divers Nations.</note> which God
had exposed unto his Sword, and commanded to wear his
Yoke, namely, the <hi>Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, Tyrians,
Sidonians,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> though some of these were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
become his followers, and served under him when
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> was taken, and burnt. But the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> whose
City was built upon an Island, and therefore secure from
the invasion of any Land-Army, and whose Fleet was so
strong, that they needed not to fear any enemy at Sea, were
neither daunred with the fall of their neighbour City, nor
with the obstinate resolution of this mighty King imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his wit, and power to work their subversion.</p>
                  <p>That the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> was rather well pleased then any
way discouraged with the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the Words which <hi>Esekiel</hi> condemneth, as the
common voyce of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> Esek. 26. 2. <hi>Aha! the Gate of the
People is broken, it is turned unto me; For seeing she is desolate,
I shall be replenished.</hi> Yet at length, that great work before
mentioned, began to appear above Water, and so to threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
them with inevitable mischief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> still follows his work hard, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all discouragments, and in the thirteenth year of
the Siege, and the nineteenth of his Raign, he had brought
it to such perfection, that now the Citizens despaired of
holding out against him; whereupon all the chiefest of
them imbarked themselves, their Families, and Treasures
in their Fleet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tyre</hi> is taken.</note> and escaped to the Isle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> but the
poorer sort were left to the fury of the enemy; who being
enraged for being put to so much pains, slew with the
Sword, not only such people of <hi>Tyre</hi> as dwelt on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
(who are called her <hi>Daughters in the Field)</hi> but
the like execution was done in the streets, into which with
excessive labour, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> made way for his Horses,
and Chariots. Thus <hi>Nebuchadnezzar made his Army serve a
great service, against</hi> Tyrus, <hi>wherein every head was made bald,
and every shoulder was made bare, yet had he no wages, nor his
Army,</hi> Esek. 29. 18. but was fain to rest contented with the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95888:11"/>
Honour of having destroyed that City, which in all mens
Judgements had been held invincible.</p>
                  <p>The destruction of these two Great, and powerfull Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
having made the name of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> dreadfull in
the ears of all the Nations round about, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
used this advantage of that reputation which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by his victories already gotten, to the getting of
more, and more profitable, with less pains. The Kingdom
of <hi>Egypt</hi> was the mark which he chiefly aimed at. A
Country so abounding in Riches and pleasures, that it
might well have tempted any Pri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce, finding himself
strong enough, to pick occasion of quarrell against it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it was so far an enemy to the Crown of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that,
had it been far poorer, yet it must have been subdued, or
the Conquest of <hi>Syria</hi> could not have been secured.</p>
                  <p>Yet was it needfull, that before he entred upon this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Countries adjacent should be reduced into such
tearms, that either they should wholly stand at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or at least, be able not to work him any displeasure.
And herein the Decree of God concurred (as in all
prosperous enterprises) with reason of State. For the
people of <hi>Moab, Ammon, Edom, Damascus, Kedar, Hazor,</hi>
and other adjoyning Regions, whom God for their sins
had condemned to fall under the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Yoke, were
such, as regarding onely their own gain, had, some of
them, like Ravens, followed the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Army, to feed
upon the carcasses that fell by the cruelty thereof. Others
taking advantage of their neighbours miseries, occupied
the Countries, which, by his Victories, belonged to <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi>
all of them thinking, that when the <hi>Babylonian</hi>
had satisfied his fury, he would be forced to forsake those
desolated Countries, and leave the possession of them to
those who could first seize upon them. Particularly, the
<hi>Edomites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Jews</hi> enemies threatned.</note> and <hi>Philistines,</hi> had shewed much malice against
the <hi>Jews</hi> when their City was taken, <hi>Esek.</hi> 25. 12, 15. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had done any good service to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> it
appears not; if they did any, its like to have been in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their own advantage, wherein yet they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95888:11"/>
The <hi>Ammonites</hi> were not contented to rejoyce
onely at the fall of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but presently they entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Country of <hi>God,</hi> and took possession of it, as if, not
the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> but they had subdued <hi>Israel, Esek. 25. 3. Jer.</hi>
49. 1. Neither can it be imagined what other design
<hi>Baalis,</hi> King of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> had, when he sent <hi>Ismael,</hi> a
Prince of the Blood of <hi>Judah,</hi> to murther <hi>Gedalia,</hi> whom
the King of <hi>Babel</hi> had made Governour over those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in <hi>Israel,</hi> and to carry Captive into the <hi>Ammonites</hi>
Country, the People that abode in <hi>Mizpah,</hi> than a desire of
entanglng <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> with so many labours at once,
as should force him to retire into his own Country, and
abandon those wasted Lands, to himself, and others, for
whom they lay conveniently. Such, or the like Policy, the
<hi>Moabjtes</hi> also did exercise, whose Pride, and Wrath were
made frustrate by God, and their dissimulation condemned,
as not doing aright, <hi>Jer.</hi> 40. 14. &amp; 41. 2. &amp; 10. &amp; 28,
27, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>All these Nations had the Art of ravening,<note place="margin">They are destroyed by <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.</hi>
                     </note> which is
familiar to such as either live in, or that border upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts;
and now the time ministred occasion to them to
shew the uttermost cunning of their Thievish wits. But
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> made void all their devices by sharp, and
sudden War upon them, overwhelming them with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
ruine, as it were in one night, according to the
Prophesies of <hi>Isay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 16. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Esekiel,</hi> who all foretold,
with little difference of Words, the greatness, and swiftness
of the misery that should come upon them. It appears not
with which of them he first began; but it seems that
<hi>Moab</hi> was the last that felt his heavy hand: For so, many
interpret that Prophesie of <hi>Isay,</hi> threatning <hi>Moab</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
after three years, as having reference to the third
year following the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> the next year
after it, being spent in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> expedition. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that all the principal Towns in these Countries were
burnt, and the people either slain, or made captives, few
excepted, who saved themselves by flight, and had not the
courage to return to their habitations too hastily, much
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95888:12"/>
less to attempt any thing against <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> but lived
as miserable out laws, untill the end of the seventy years
which God had appointed for the desolation of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
as well as of the Land of <hi>Judaea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When by a long course of Victory <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had
brought into Subjection all the Nations of <hi>Syria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Egypt</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.</hi>
                     </note> and the
bordering <hi>Arabians</hi> in such wise, as that no enemy to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or Friend to the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> was left at his back, that
might either impede his proceedings, or take advantage
of any misfortune that might befall him; then did he
forthwith apply himself to the Conquest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon
which those other Nations had formerly been dependants.
Of this expedition, and the Victorious issue thereof, the
three great Prophets, <hi>Isay, Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Esekiel</hi> have written
so plainly, that its altogether needless to seek after any
other authority to confirm the same. Long before it was
prophesied by <hi>Isay,</hi> that the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi>
should lead away the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Prisoners, and the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians</hi>
Captives, young, and old, naked and barefoot, even
with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of <hi>Egypt,
Isa.</hi> 20. 4.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Esekiel,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> as their prophesies were neerer
to the time of execution, so they handled this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more plainly, and precisely. For <hi>Esekiel</hi> tells us
cleerly, that <hi>Egypt</hi> should be given to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> as
wages for his great service which he had done against
<hi>Tyre,</hi> Esek. 29. 18, 19, 20. He recounteth also in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
all the chief Citys in <hi>Egypt,</hi> saying, that these by name
should be destroyed, and go into Captivity: yea, and that
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Army should be slain by the Sword,
<hi>Esek. 30. 4, 10, &amp;c. Chap. 32, 2, &amp;c.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi>
saith thus, <hi>Behold I will visit the common people of</hi> Noe,
<hi>and</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>with their Gods and their Kings, even</hi>
Pharaoh <hi>and all that trust in him; and I will deliver them into
the hands of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of</hi>
Nebuchadnezar <hi>King of</hi> Babel, <hi>and into the hands of his
Servants,</hi> Jer. 46. 25, 26. <hi>Josephus</hi> accordingly saith, that
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in the three and twentieth year of his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95888:12"/>
Raign, and in the fifteenth year after the destruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Egypt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</note>
did Conquer <hi>Egypt,</hi> and kill the King thereof, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
a Vice-Roy to Govern it. And it is evident that
his Victories which followed his Conquest of <hi>Syria,</hi> were
such as did more enlarge his Dominions, than all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Wars had done. For <hi>Esekiel</hi> in his 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth
up (besides the whole Country of <hi>Egypt) Phut,</hi> and
<hi>Lud,</hi> with other Nations that may seem to have reached as
far as into <hi>Mauritania,</hi> which were conquered by him, and
added to his Empire. And truly it is worth observation
how <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> was infatuated by God, who
thought himself most safe in his own Country by reason of
the well-defenced situation thereof, and therefore very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisely
suffered his enemies to make a cleer way to his own
doors by the Conquest of all his Friends, and Allyes in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
For as the labour of this business did more harden then
weary the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Army,<note place="margin">Carnall confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> so the confidence, and vain se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> relying upon the difficulty of the
passages which the enemy was to make through the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi>
Desarts, and the great advantage which the River <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
afforded, did little avail them, when the War came on;
Yea, it did much astonish them (as may justly be thought)
in the time of execution. It <hi>being usually seen, that the hearts
of men fail, when those helps deceive them, in which they bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
more confidence than in their own Virtue, and Valour.</hi>

<hi>and</hi> Zedechias, <hi>Tributary Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>had
done, was made partaker also of the same ruine. That
the destruction of</hi> Ninive <hi>followed the Conquest of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
<hi>is clear by the comparison which</hi> Nahum <hi>the Prophet
made between this City that was to fall, and the City of</hi>
Noe <hi>in</hi> Egypt <hi>which was fallen already;</hi> Nahum 3. 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Art thou better than populous <hi>Noe,</hi> that was situate amongst the
Rivers, that had the waters round about it; whose Rampire was
the Sea, and her wall was from the Sea. <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi>
were her strength, and it was infinite: <hi>Put,</hi> and <hi>Lubin</hi> were her
helpers. Yet was she carried away, she went into Captivity; Her
young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the
streets, and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her
great men were bound in chains. Thou also shalt be drunken;
thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek strength because of the

                  </p>
                  <p>This Great Monarch, having thus spent his younger
days in inlarging his Dominions, he betook himself to
rest, that he might reap the fruit of his former labours;
and the first thing that he applyed himself to, was to
beautifie his Imperiall City of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Babylon</hi> beautified</note> adding a new
City to the Old, which he compassed about with three
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95888:13"/>
Walls, and made in them stately Gates. And neer the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Pallace he built a New one, more stately than it,
wherein he raised stone-works, like unto Mountains,
which he planted with all manner of Trees. He made
also <hi>Pensile</hi> Gardens (one of the Worlds wonders)
born upon Arches,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pensile</hi> Gardens.</note> foursquare, each square being four
hundred Foot long, filled above with Earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grew all sorts of Trees, and Plants. The Arches were
built one above another in a convenient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heigth, still
increasing as they ascended. The highest, which did bear
the Walls on the top, were fifty Cubits high, so that they
equalized the highest Mountains. He made also <hi>Aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts</hi>
for the watering of this Garden, which seemed to
hang in the air. This most sumptuous frame, which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasted
all the remainder of the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> and all the <hi>Persian</hi>
Empire, is said to have been reared and finished in fifteen
Days.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars</hi> Golden Image.</note> He erected also an Image of Gold in the Plain of
<hi>Dura,</hi> sixty Cubits high, and six broad, commanding all
his Servants, and Subjects to fall down and Worship it,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 1, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But of all this, and other his Magnficence, we find little
else recorded, save that which indeed is most profitable
for us to consider, to wit, his overvalewing of his own
greatness, which abased him to a condition inferior to the
poorest of men. For whereas God had honoured him, not
only with many great, and glorious Victories, and much
happiness in his own life; but with a rare discovery of
things that were to come after him; yea, and had manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the certainty of his Dreams, by the miraculous reducing
of it into his Memory, and given him the interpretation
thereof by the Prophet <hi>Daniel:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

so forgetfull of God whose wonderfull power he had
seen,<note place="margin">His Pride.</note> and acknowledged, that he caused that Golden Image
to be set u<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and Worshipped, appointing a cruell Death for
them that should dare to disobey him, which was utterly
unlawfull, and repugnant to the Law of him that is King of
Kings; And thus he who so lately had Worshipped <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
the servant of God, as if he had been God himself: now
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95888:14"/>
commanded a Statue to be erected unto himself, wherein
himself might be worshipped as God: From this impiety
it pleased God to recall, and reclaim him, by the wonderful
and miraculous delivery of those three blessed Saints,<note place="margin">A Miracle.</note> out
of the fiery Furnace,<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 26, &amp;c.</note> who being thrown bound into the
midst of it, for refusing to commit that abominable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
were preserved from all hurt of the fire, loosned
from their Bonds, accompanied by an Angel, and at last
called out by the King, and restored to their former ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> being amazed at the Miracle,<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 29.</note> mad a
Decre tending to the honour of God,<note place="margin">He makes a Decree to Gods Honour.</note> whom by the erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Image, he had dishonoured. Yet was not this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
so rooted in him, that it could bring forth fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to his hasty zeal: Therefore was he forewarned of
God in a Dream,<note place="margin">His dream interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> of a terrible Judgement which hung over
his Head, which <hi>Daniel</hi> expounding, withall counselled
him <hi>to break off his sin by righteousness, and his iniquities by
shewing mercy to the poor, that there might be a lengthening of his
tranquillity,</hi> Dan. 4. 27. whence it seems, that injustice, and
cruelty were his faults, for which he was thus threatened:
But neither did the Dream, nor advice of <hi>Daniel</hi> so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
For probably he believed it not, but looked upon it
as an idle Dream; for that it seemed altogether unlikely
that so great a Monarch should be driven from amongst
men,<note place="margin">He dwels with the Beasts.</note> yea, compelled to dwell with the Beasts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Field, and
made to eat Grass as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Oxen, this was altogether incredible
in mans Judgement, and therefore giving so little heed to
it, its no marvell that he had forgotten it by the years end.</p>
                  <p>One whole year was given to this haughty Prince
wherein to repent, which respiting of the execution may
seem to have bred in him forgetfulness of Gods sentence.
For at the end of twelve Moneths as he was walking in
his Royall Pallace in <hi>Babel,</hi> he was so overjoyed, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
with a vain contemplation of his own seeming
happiness, that without all fear of Gods heavy Judgement
pronounced against him, he uttered these proud words:
<hi>Is not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>that I have built for the house of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95888:14"/>
Kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the Honour of my
Majesty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But his proud speeches were not fully ended, when a
voice from Heaven told him, that his</hi> Kingdom was departed
from him, &amp;c. <hi>And the same hour the thing was fulfilled
upon</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>and</hi> he was driven from men, and did
eat grass as Oxen, and his Body was wet with the dew of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
till his hair was grown like Eagles Feathers, and his hails
like Birds Claws, <hi>Dan. 4. 33, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This his punishment was singular,<note place="margin">His Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shape not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> and unexpected. For
he ran amongst beasts in the fields, and woods, where for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years he lived, not only as a salvage man, but as a sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Beast: for a Beast he thought himself to be, &amp; therefore
fed himself in the same manner, and with the same food
that Beasts do. Not that he was changed in his externall
shape from a man to a Beast. For as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Jerome</hi> well expounds
it, when he saith, <hi>vers.</hi> 34. that his <hi>understanding was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
unto him,</hi> he shewed that he had not lost his Humane
shape, but his understanding, being stricken with a Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy,
or deep Melancholly, which made him think himself a
Beast.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seven years being expired,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>was restored
both to his understanding, &amp; to his Kingdom: and (saith he)</hi>

to his Will in the Army of Heaven, and amongst the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants

him, What dost thou? At the same time my reason returned unto
me; and for the Glory of my Kingdom, mine honour, and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
returned unto me, and my Counsellers, and my Lords sought
unto me, and I was established in my Kingdom, and excellent
Majesty was added unto me. Now therefore I <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
praise, and extoll, and honour the King of Heaven, all
whose works are truth, and his way is Judgement, and those
that walk in Pride he is able to abase, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 34, 35, 36, 37.</p>
                  <p>How long helived after this is uncertain, but all agree
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95888:15"/>
that he raigned about twenty moneths copartner with
his Father in the Kingdom, and about three and forty
years by himself alone.</p>
                  <p>Whilst <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> raged in <hi>Judea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stice</note>
God prepared a worm, which in due time, should eat out
this spreading Tree; by reason of the cry of his poor
People which entred into his ears: According to that of
the Psalmist, <hi>Psal. 137. 8, 9. O Daughter of</hi> Babylon, <hi>who
art to be destroyed: Happy shall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou
hast served us. Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little
ones against the stones.</hi> For in this very year was <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the
<hi>Perso-Median</hi> born; whose Father was a <hi>Persian,</hi> and his
Mother a <hi>Mede;</hi> of whom this very <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> at
the hour of his Death,<note place="margin">A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</note> uttered this Prophesie. <hi>There shall
come a</hi> Persian <hi>Mule, who shall make use of your Devils, as
his fellow-Souldiers, to bring you into Bondage.</hi> He calls <hi>Cyrus</hi>
a <hi>Mule,</hi> because he was to be born of a Father and Mother
of two divers Nations.</p>

against whom, <hi>Astyages,</hi> and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his Son, and <hi>Cyrus</hi>

                     <hi>Xenophon</hi> relates the matter thus, When the <hi>Babylonian</hi> had
enlarged his Empire with many Victories, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Lord of all <hi>Syria,</hi> and many other Countries, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to hope that if the <hi>Medes</hi> could be brought under his
Subjection,<note place="margin">The strength of <hi>Media.</hi>
                     </note> there would not then be left any Nation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning,
able to make head against him. For the King of
the <hi>Medes</hi> was able to bring into the Field sixty thousand
Foot, and ten thousand Horse, to which the Forces of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
being joyned, made an exceeding great Army.</p>
                  <p>Considering therefore the strength of such a neighbour,
he invited <hi>Craesus,</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> a Prince very mighty
both in men and Treasure, and with him other Lords of
<hi>Asia</hi> the less to his assistance, alleadging that those Eastern
Nations, were very powerfull, and so firmly conjoyned by
League, and many Alliances, that it would not be easie,
no nor possible for any one Nation to resist them.</p>
                  <p>With these suggestions, backed with rich Presents, he
drew to himself so many adherents, as he compounded an
Army of two hundred Thousand Foot, and sixty thousand
Horse: Of which ten thousand Horse, and forty thousand
Foot were brought by <hi>Craesus,</hi> who had great cause of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
against the <hi>Medes,</hi> for that they had made great Wars
against his Father <hi>Allyattes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Army.</note> Whereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> was by his
Father <hi>Cambyses,</hi> and the Council of the Kingdom, made
Generall of the <hi>Persian</hi> Army, and sent away into <hi>Media</hi>
with thirty Thousand Souldiers, and one Thousand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
all of equall Authority under him; and when
he came thither, he was also made by his Uncle <hi>Cyaxares,</hi>
who had sent for him, Generall of the <hi>Median</hi> Forces, and
the management of the War against the <hi>Babylonian</hi> was
wholly comitted to him; With this Army he marched
against <hi>Evilmerodach,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians.</hi>
                     </note> and his associates, and in a very
bloody Bartell, overthrew them. In which defeat, <hi>Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merodach,</hi>
King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> being slain, so many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
revolted, that <hi>Babylon</hi> it self could no longer be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95888:18"/>
but by the help of Mercenaties, waged with great sums
of money out of <hi>Asia</hi> the less, <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other Countries,
which new leavied Forces, were also defeated, and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by <hi>Cyrus,</hi>

                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> his great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.</note> who following his advantage, possessed
himself of a great part of the lesser <hi>Asia.</hi> Those <hi>Persians</hi>
which followed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and were by him levied, are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
to be thirty thousand Foot, of which one thousand
were Armed Gentlemen; the rest of the common sort
were Archers, and such as used the Dart, or Sling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Craesus,</hi> notwithstanding the men lost, and the Treasure
spent in the quarrell of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Craesus</hi> his Victories.</note> yet did he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
<hi>Aeolis, Doris,</hi> and <hi>Jonia,</hi> Provinces possessed by the
<hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> the less, adjoyning to his Kingdom of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
He gave Laws also to the <hi>Phrygians, Bithynians, Carians,
Mysians, Paephlagonians,</hi> and other Nations. He also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
the <hi>Ephesians</hi> to acknowledge him for their Lord;
He also obtained a signall Victory against the <hi>Sacaeans,</hi> a
Nation of the <hi>Scythians;</hi> All which he performed in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years.</p>
                  <p>And being now confident by reason of his good successes,
and withall, envious at <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Fame, and prosperity;
doubting also that his great Victories might in the end
grow perilous to himself, he consulted with the Oracle of
<hi>Apollo,</hi> whom he presented with marvellous rich Gifts,
what success he might hope for in his undertakings against
<hi>Cyrus;</hi> from whom he received this ambiguous answer,
Craesus Halym <hi>penetrans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> 
                     <hi>magnam pervertes opum vim: Craesus</hi>

For the Devil being doubtfull of his success, gave
him this Riddle, which might be construed either way, to
the ruine of <hi>Persia,</hi> or of his own <hi>Lydia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Craesus</hi> (interpreting it as he most desired)
resolved to stop the course of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his progress, and
therefore despised all the Arguments used by <hi>Sandanes</hi> to
the contrary,<note place="margin">Good Counsel neglected.</note> who desired him to consider afore-hand, that
he provoked a Nation inhabiting a barren, &amp; Mountanous
Region; a People not covered with the soft silk of
Worms, but with the hard skins of Beasts; not fed with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95888:18"/>
meat to their Fansies, but content with what they found;
Drinkers of Water, and not of Wine; and in a word, a
Nation Warlike, Patient, Valiant, and Porsperous, over
whom if he became Victorious, he could thereby enrich
himself in nothing but Fame, in which he already excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
and if by them he should be beaten, and subdued, so
great would his loss appear of all things, which the world
makes account of, that the same could neither be hastily
recounted, nor easily conceived.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding this solid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Craesus</hi> marches against <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                     </note> and seasonable Counsel,
<hi>Craesus</hi> having prepared a powerfull Army, advanced with
the same toward <hi>Media:</hi> but in his passage he was retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Pterium,</hi> a City in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> of great strength;
which whilst he attempted both by power and policy to
take, and Conquer, <hi>Cyrus</hi> came on, and found the <hi>Lydians</hi>
encamped before it. Neither of these Champions were
inferior to other, either in strength, or opinion. For out
of doubt, <hi>Craesus,</hi> as he excelled any Prince of that age in
Riches, and ability, so was he not inferior unto any in
Territories and Fame, that then lived. <hi>But Kingdoms
and Commonwealths have their increase, and Periods from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ordinance.</hi> This time was the Winter of <hi>Craesus</hi> his
prosperity, the leaves of his flourishing estate being ready
to fall; and that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> but in the first Spring and
Flower; <hi>the God of all Power, had given a date to the one, and
a beginning of Glory to the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When these two Armies were in view each of other,
after divers skirmishes had passed between them, the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A great Battel.</note>
and <hi>Lydians</hi> began to joyn together, and to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
each other in grose Bodies; and as either of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to retreat, fresh supplies were sent in from both their
Kings. And as the <hi>Persians</hi> had somewhat the better of
the Day, so when the dark vail of night had hidden each
Army from the others view, <hi>Craesus</hi> doubting what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
the rising Sun might bring with it, quitted the Field
to <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Craesus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats.</note> and withall speed possible, retreated towards his
own Country, and taking the next way thither, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<hi>Sardis,</hi> the first City of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and his Regal Seat,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95888:19"/>
without any pursuit made by <hi>Cyrus</hi> to retard him;
where, being arrived, and nothing suspecting <hi>Cyrus</hi> his
approach, or any other War for that Winter, he dismised
his Army, and sent the Troops of his sundry Nations to
their own Provinces, appointing them to re-assemble at
the end of five Moneths, acquainting his Commanders
with his intent of renewing the War at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p>The morning being come, <hi>Cyrus</hi> finding that the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
were departed, put his Army in order to pursue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues him.</note> yet not so hastily, and at their heels, as to be
discovered. But getting good intelligence of <hi>Craesus</hi> his
proceedings, he so ordered the matter, that he presented
not himself before <hi>Sardis,</hi> till such time as <hi>Craesus</hi> had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of his Army, and sent them to their Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
His coming being altogether unlooked for, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feared,<note place="margin">And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiges him in <hi>Sardis.</hi>
                     </note>
he had opportunity enough to surround <hi>Sardis</hi>
with his Army, wherein <hi>Craesus</hi> had no other Companies
than the Citizens, and his ordinary Guards, insomuch as
after fourteen days Seige,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sardis</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken.</note> 
                     <hi>Cyrus</hi> took the City by Storm,
and put all to the Sword that made resistance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Craesus</hi> now having neither Arms to Fight, nor Wings
to fly, in this common calamity, he throst himself into
the heap, and multitude of his miserable Subjects, and had
undergone the same lot with the rest of the vanquished
persons, had not a Son of his, who had been dumb all his
Life before (by the extremity of Passion and Fear) cryed
out to a common Souldier,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Craesus</hi> preserved</note> who was with a drawn Sword
pursuing his Father, that he should not kill <hi>Craesus.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was taken and imprisoned, and despoiled of all
things, but onely the expectation of Death.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after he was bound with Fetters, and Placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a large and high pile of Wood, to be burnt to ashes
thereon.<note place="margin">He should have been Burnt, but is saved.</note> To which, when Fire was set, and kindled,
<hi>Craesus</hi> remembring the discourse which long before he
had with <hi>Solon,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Lawgiver, he thrice cryed
out, <hi>O Solon, Solon, Solon,</hi> and being demanded what he
meant by the invocation of <hi>Solon,</hi> he at first used silence:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95888:19"/>
But being urged again, he told them that now he found
that true, which wise <hi>Solon</hi> had long since told him; <hi>That
many men in the race and course of their lives might well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Fortunate, but no man could discern himself to be happy
indeed till his end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this his answer, <hi>Cyrus</hi> being speedily informed, and
thereby being put in mind of the mutability of Fortune,
and of his own mortality, he commanded his Ministers of
Justice, speedily to withdraw the Fire, and to save <hi>Crae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
and bring him to his presence; which being done,
<hi>Cyrus</hi> demanded of him, who it was that had perswaded
him? or what reason had instigated him to invade his
Territories, and to make him, of a Friend, an Enemy. To
which <hi>Craesus</hi> thus answered: <hi>It was thy prosperous, and my
unprosperous destiny (the</hi> Grecian <hi>Gods with all, flattering my
Ambition) that were the inventers, and conducters of</hi> Craesus
<hi>War against</hi> Cyrus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyrus</hi> being much affected w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> this answer of <hi>Craesus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> makes him his friend.</note> and
bewailing his estate, though he was victorious over him,
did not only spare his life, but intertained him ever after
as a King, and his companion; Thus <hi>Heroditus</hi> relates it.
But <hi>Xenophon</hi> saith, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> did entertain <hi>Craesus</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the first sight, and makes no mention of any such
cruell intent of burning him alive; and this may seem
the more probable, because <hi>Craesus</hi> was his Grandmothers
Brother, and its very likely that neerness of Alliance
might withhold <hi>Cyrus</hi> (if he had been vicious, which he
was not) from so cruell a purpose as to have burnt him
alive.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Cyrus</hi> afterwards passed with his Army over
<hi>Araves</hi> into <hi>Seythia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cyrus <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades</hi> Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia.</note> he left <hi>Craesus</hi> to be a companion, and
counseller to his Son <hi>Cambyses,</hi> whom he made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
over his Empire in his absence, with whom he lived
all-the Reign of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and did afterwards accompany
<hi>Cambyses</hi> in his Expedition into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he hardly
escaped his Tyrannous hands. At this time the Races of
three of the greatest Kings in that part of the World
came to an end; to wit, of the <hi>Babylonians, Medians,</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:95888:20"/>
and <hi>Lydians,</hi> in <hi>Balthasar, Xiaxares,</hi> or <hi>Darius Medus,</hi>
and <hi>Craesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Lydian</hi> War ensued the great Conquest of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> which gave unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> an Empire so large, and
mighty, that he was justly reputed the greatest Monarch
then living upon the Earth. How long time the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for this great action took up, is uncertain, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it seems that ten whole years did pass between his
taking of those two Cities of <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi> which
time was not wholly spent in providing for the <hi>Assyrian</hi>
War, but much of it in setling the Estates which he had
already purchased; <hi>Ctesias</hi> also tells us, that during this
time <hi>Cyrus</hi> invaded <hi>Scythia,</hi> and being victorious over that
Nation, he took <hi>Amorges</hi> their King Prisoner; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a second Battel overthrown by <hi>Sparetha,</hi> the Wife
of <hi>Amorges,</hi> himself was taken Prisoner, and so one King
was released for the other.<note place="margin">His dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> 
                     <hi>Gobrias</hi> about this time (a
Nobleman, whose onely Son, the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
in his Fathers life time, had in a hunting match,
villainously slain) together with his Friends, revolted to
<hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its very probable also, that no small part of those
troubles which sprang up in the lower <hi>Asia,</hi> grew soon
after <hi>Cyrus</hi> his departure with his Victorious Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conquest was fully established. For after <hi>Cyrus</hi>
was returned out of <hi>Asia</hi> the less, many Nations which
were formerly Conquered by <hi>Craesus,</hi> and now by <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
revolted from him; Against whom he imployed <hi>Pactias,</hi>
and then <hi>Harpagus,</hi> who first reduced the <hi>Phocians</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their former Obedience; and then the rest of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> that inhabited <hi>Asia</hi> the less, as the <hi>Jonians,
Carians, Aeolians,</hi> and <hi>Lycians,</hi> who, very resolutely
(according to the strength they had) defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyes;
But in the attempt upon <hi>Babylon</hi> it self, its not to
be questioned but <hi>Cyrus</hi> imployed all his Forces, having
taken order beforehand, that nothing should be able to
divert him, or to raise that Seige, or to frustrate that work
upon which he did set all his rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95888:20"/>
And great reason there was,<note place="margin">The strength of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </note> that he should improve
all his Policy and strength unto the taking of that
City, which, besides the Fame and reputation that it
held, as being the Head of an Empire, which depended
thereupon, was so strongly fortified with a trebble Wall of
great heigth, and surrounded with the waters of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi>
that were unfordable, and so plentifully Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualled
for many years, that the Inhabitants were not
only free from fear, and doubt of their estate, but through
their Confidence, they derided, and despised all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and power of their Besiegers.</p>
                  <p>For not long before,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Babylon</hi> fortified by <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Nicotris,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
a witty, and active Woman, foreseeing the storm
that was ready to fall upon <hi>Babylon</hi> from the <hi>Medes,</hi> to
hinder their passing the River by Boats into <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
She turned the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which before ran
with a strait, and swift course, drawing it through many
winding Channels, which she had cut for that purpose,
whereby she made it to run more slowly than formerly
it did: and then she raised a huge Dam upon each
side of the River; and up the River from the City-ward,
she digged a vast Pond, which was every way three or
four hundred Furlongs wide, into which she turned the
River, thereby leaving the old Channel of the River dry;
which done, she fell to work, and fenced the Banks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the City with Brick-walls, and raised the Water-Gates,
answerable in every point to the rest of the Walls,
which were made on the farther side of the Channel,
round about the City. She built also a stately, and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
Bridge of Stone in the midst of the City, which joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Kings Houses, that stood on each side the River:
and having finished all her Works, and Fortifications, she
turned the River out of the Pond into its right Channell
again.</p>
                  <p>And now came <hi>Cyrus</hi> to invade the Country of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cyrus <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</note>
and appeared before the Walls of the City, and there
challenged the King to a Duell, or single Combat, but he
refused it. At this time <hi>Gadatas,</hi> a Noble man of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:95888:21"/>
whom <hi>Belshazzar</hi> had gelt, upon a jealousie that he had of
him with his Wife, fell over to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in revenge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>Babylonians</hi> sallied out, and fell upon his Lands; but
<hi>Cyrus</hi> set upon them, and routed them; At which time
the <hi>Cadusii</hi> whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> had appointed to bring up the
rear of his Army, unknown to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> set upon a Country
lying neer to the City; but the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> falling
out upon them, cut them all off. Yet <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
the Death of his men; and then came to an
agreement with <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> to hold truce with the Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
on both sides, and the War to go on between the
Souldiers onely. After which, passing beyond the City,
he took in three of their Forts, and so returned into the
confines of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and <hi>Media;</hi> and thither, upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
came his uncle <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and was by him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
received; and intertained in a Pavilion, that
had been the King of <hi>Assyrias:</hi> and Winter now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
they entred into consulatation to provide
things necessary to maintain the Siege.</p>
                  <p>The only hope of <hi>Cyrus</hi> with his <hi>Medes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieges it.</note> and <hi>Persians</hi>
(who despaired of carrying by assault a City so well, and
strongly fortified, and manned) was in cuting off all
supplies of victuals, and others necessaries; Whereof,
though the Town was said to be stored sufficiently for
more than twenty years, yet might it well be imagined,
that amongst such a World of People as dwelt within
those Walls, one great want or other would soon appear
amongst them, and vanquish the resolution of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warlike
multitude. Yet in expecting that success of this
course, the Besiegers were likely to endure much hardship,
and travel, and that all in vain, if they did not keep strict
watch, and sure guards upon all the Avenues, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of it.</p>
                  <p>Which that he might the better do, he caused present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a vast trench, both for breadth and depth to be cast
round about the Walls of the City, casting the earth ever
towards his own Army, and made store of Bulworks all
along upon it, for his Guards to be upon: and then, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95888:21"/>
his whole Army into twelve parts, he ordered that
each of them should Watch his Moneth, by turn.</p>
                  <p>And yet this was a very hard work,<note place="margin">The <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonlans</hi> vain Hopes.</note> considering the vast
circuit of those Walls which they were to gird in, having
neither men enough, nor yet sufficiently assured to their

them, if occasion were offered, than to use much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
on the behalf of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who had, as it were but ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday,

                  <p>Whilst the Besieged were thus pleasing themselves

Waters of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and so to draw the same from the

For he had left in each of the Trenches towards

to approach the Walls by reason of the great River
that surrounded them, he prepared an exceeding sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Feast, Publick Plays, and other Pastimes, and
thereto invited a Thousand of his Princes, or Nobles,
besides his Wives, Courtezans, and others of that
Trade. This he did, either to let the Besiegers know
that his Provisions were sufficient, not onely for all
needfull uses, but even for superfluity, and excess; Or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95888:22"/>
because he hoped that his enemies by this time were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and even broken under their manifold disasters:
Or else he made this Feast in Honour of <hi>Bell,</hi> his most
adored Idol: or lastly, because it was his Birth, or
Coronation Day: Or for many, or most of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
                  <p>Yea, he was not contented to use, and shew such
Magnificence as no Prince else could Equall, but he
listed up himself against the God of Heaven, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 23.
For he, his Princes, his Wives, and his Concubines,
made Carousing Cups of the Golden, and Silver Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
which his Grandfather <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had taken
out of the Temple which was at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</note> and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Lord of Heaven, he praised his own
Puppets made of Gold, and Silver, and Brass, and
Iron, and Wood, and Stone; Whilst <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was
thus tryumphing, and had his brains well filled with
vapours, he beheld a hand, which by Divine power
wrote upon the Wall that was opposite to him,<note place="margin">The Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Wall.</note> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Words which he understood not, wherewith, so
great a fear, and amazement seized upon him, that the

one against another; Which Passion when he had in
some measure recovered, he cryed aloud to bring in the
Astrologers, the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and the Southsayers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
them great rewards, and the third place of Honour
in his Kingdom, to him that could read, and expound the
writing: But it exceeded their Art, and Skill.</p>

                     <hi>and astonishment, the Queen,
hearing what had passed, came in, and observing what
distraction the King was in, after Reverence done, She
used this Speech;</hi> O King live for ever; Let not thy
thoughts trouble thee, non let thy countenance be changed;
there is a man in thy Kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the
holy Gods, and in the Days of thy Father light, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and Wisdom like the Wisdom of the Gods was
found in him, whom the King <hi>Nobuchadnezzar</hi> thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

For as much as an Excellent Spirit, and knowledge,
and understanding, in interpreting Dreams, and shewing of
hard Sentences, and dissolving of doubts were found in
the same <hi>Daniel,</hi> whom the King named <hi>Belteshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.</hi>
Now let <hi>Daniel</hi> be called, and he will shew the
Interpretation.</p>
                  <p>This Queen was either the Grandmother, or the
Mother of <hi>Belshazzar;</hi> For it appears that She was not
any of the Kings Wives, because She was absent from
the Feast, and in regard of her age, past-banquetting,
and dancing; Yet upon the report of the Miracle, She
came in to comfort, and cheer up the King; and
whereas <hi>Daniel</hi> was forgotten, and neglected by others, of
younger years, and latter times, this old Queen remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
well, what <hi>Daniel</hi> had done in the days of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar;</hi>
Grandfather to this <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> and kept in mind,
both his Religion, and Divine gifts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When</hi> Daniel <hi>was brought into the Kings presence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> brought in.</note>
                     <hi>he said unto him:</hi> Art thou that <hi>Daniel,</hi> which art of
the Children of the Captivity of <hi>Judah;</hi> whom the King my
Father brought out of <hi>Jewry?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Kings Speech to him.</note> I have heard of thee that

they should read, this writing, and make known to me the
Interpretation thereof, but they could not do it: And I have
heard of thee that thou canst make Interpretations, and dissolve
doubts: Now if thou canst read the Writing, and make
known to me the Interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed
with Scarlet, and have a chain of Godl aboue thy neck, and
shalt be the third Ruler in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Daniel <hi>made answer in a far differing stile from

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95888:23"/>
to another: Yet I will read the writing to the King, and make
known to him the Interpretation: <hi>which yet before he did,
he shewed him the cause of Gods judgements against
him, and the reason of this terrible sentence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the King and all his Wise men were utterly Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
the substance whereof is this, That</hi> Belshazzar
<hi>forgetting Gods goodness to his Father, whom all Nations
feared, and obeyed, and yet for his Pride, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of those benefits, as he had deprived him of his
Estate, and understanding; so upon the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods infinite power, he restored him to both

not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this, But
hast lifted up thy self against the Lord of Heaven, and they
have brought the Vessels of his House before thee, and thou

Wine in them, and thou hast praised the gods of Silver, and
Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and

that his City is taken at one end. And that the
passages are stopped (viz. <hi>of the River</hi> Euphrates) and the

affrighted; <hi>The Prophet</hi> Isay <hi>also, two hundred years
before this subversion of</hi> Babylon, <hi>in his forty seventh
Chapter, and elsewhere, describeth this destruction
so feelingly, and lively, as if he had been present,

had seen the great and unseared change, and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this great Empire; Yea, and had also heard the
sorrows and bewallings of every surviving Soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
subject; which Prophesie he begins with these
words;</hi> Come down and sit in the dust, O Virgin daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> sit on the Ground; there is no Throne, O
daughter of the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> For thou shalt no more be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

doubted that God used</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>and the</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans
<hi>as his Instruments to punish the Idolatry, and
wickedness of the</hi> Jews, <hi>yet did he not forget that in
the Execution of Gods Judgements, they had used
much rigour, and extremity; as we see</hi> Isay 47. 6.
I was wroth with my People; I have polluted mine Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and given them into thine hand; Thou didst shew them
no mercy; Vpon the Ancient hast thou very heavily laid

Lord of Hosts, and will cut off from <hi>Babel</hi> the Name, and
the remnant, and the Son, and the Nephew: <hi>Meaning
Evilmerodach,</hi> and <hi>Belshazzar. And again,</hi> Isay 13.

every one that is joyned to them shall be slain with the
Sword; their Children also shall be dashed to pieces before
their eyes, their Houses shall be spoiled, and their Wives

that received the report from others truly as it was, could
better describe, and leave the same to posterity after it was
acted, than</hi> Isay <hi>hath done in many parts of his Prophesie,
which were written two hundred years before any of
these things were attempted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Greatness,<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </note> and Magnificence of <hi>Babylon,</hi> were
it not by divers grave Authours recorded, might seem
altogether Fabulous; For it is reported for truth, that one
part of the City knew not that the other was taken three
days after; which is not impossible if we consider the vast
Circumference of it. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> saith, that it was
in compass three hundred, and sixty Furlongs, which
make forty five Miles. The Walls were so thick that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95888:24"/>
six Chariots might pass in front thereon, and they were
three hundred sixty and five Foot high, and were adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and beautified with one hundred and fifty Towers.
<hi>Strabo</hi> gives a greater circuit, adding twenty five For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
more to the former compass, reckoning it at
three hundred eighty five Furlongs, which makes forty
eight Miles and one Furlong. <hi>Herodotus</hi> finds the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
yet to be greater, namely four hundred and eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Furlongs in circuit; the thickness of the Wall he
measures at fifty Cubits, and the height at two
hundred of the same Regall Cubits. For entrance, it
had a hundred Gates of Brass, with Posts, and
Hooks to hang them on of the same Mettall; and
therefore did the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> rightly intitle <hi>Babylon,
The Princess, and Glory of Kingdoms,</hi> Isay 47. 5. &amp;

                  <p>But when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had won her, he stript her out of her
Princely Robes,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The time that <hi>Cyrus</hi> enjoyed in rest and pleasure after
these great Victories,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> and the attainment of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
is generally agreed upon by all Chronologers to
have lasted only seven years; In which time he made
such Laws and Constitutions as differ little from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of all wife Kings that are desirous to establish a
Royal power to themselves and their Posterity, which
are recorded by <hi>Xenophon.</hi>

                  <p>The last War,<note place="margin">His last Wars.</note> and the end of this Great King
<hi>Cyrus</hi> is diversly written by Historians: <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and
<hi>Justine</hi> say: That after these Conquests, <hi>Cyrus</hi> invaded
the <hi>Massagets,</hi> a very Warlike Nation of the <hi>Scythians,</hi>
Governed by <hi>Tomyris,</hi> their Queen: and that in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
between the <hi>Persians,</hi> and these Northern <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mades,
Tomyris</hi> lost her Army, together with her Son
<hi>Spa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gapises</hi> that was the Generall of it. In revenge
whereof this Queen making new levies of men of
War, and prosecuting the War against <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in a
second sore Battel, the <hi>Persians</hi> were beaten, and
<hi>Cyrus</hi> was taken Prisoner, and that <hi>Tomyris</hi> cut off his
Head from his Body, and threw it into a Bowle of
blood, using these words, <hi>Thou that hast all thy time thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for blood, now drink thy fill, and satiate thy self with it.</hi>
This War which <hi>Metasthenes</hi> calls <hi>Tomyrique,</hi> lasted about
six years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:95888:26"/>
But more probably this <hi>Scythian</hi> War was that
which is mentioned before, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Scythians</hi> after the Conquest of <hi>Lydia,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Ctesias,</hi> who calleth <hi>Tomyris, Sparetha,</hi>
and makes the end of it otherwise, as you may see be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>The same <hi>Ctesias</hi> also recordeth, that the last War
which <hi>Cyrus</hi> made was against <hi>Amarhaus,</hi> King of the
<hi>Derbitians,</hi> another Nation of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> whom, though
he overcame in Battel, yet there he received a wound
whereof he died three days after.<note place="margin">His Death.</note>

                  <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great returned from his <hi>Indian</hi>
Conquests, he visited <hi>Pasagardes,</hi> and caused this Tomb
of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be opened,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> opens his Sepulchre And ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours his Tomb.</note> either upon hope of great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
supposed to have been buried with him, or upon
a desire to honour his dead Body with certain Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
when the Sepulchre was opened, there was found
nothing in it, save an old rotten Target, two <hi>Scythian</hi>
Bows, and a Sword. The Coffin wherein his Body lay,
<hi>Alexander</hi> caused to be covered with his own Garment,
and a Crown of Gold to be set upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyrus</hi> finding in himself that he could not long enjoy
the World, he called unto him his Nobility, with his
two Sons,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> his last words.</note> 
                     <hi>Cambyses,</hi> and <hi>Smerdis,</hi> and after a long
Oration, wherein he assured himself, and taught o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
about the immortality of the Soul, and of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95888:26"/>
punishments and rewards following the ill, and good
deservings of every man in this life; He exhorted his
Sons, by the strongest Arguments he had, to a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Concord and agreement. Many other things he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
which makes it probable, that he received the
knowledge of the true God from <hi>Daniel,</hi> whilst he Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<hi>Susa</hi> in <hi>Persia;</hi> and that <hi>Cyrus</hi> himself had read
the Prophesie of <hi>Isay,</hi> wherein he was expresly named,
and by God preordained for the delivery of his People
out of Captivity; which act of delivering the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
of restoring of the holy Temple, and the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
was in true consideration the Noblest-work that ever <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
performed. For in other actions he was an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods Power, used for the chastising of many
Nations, and the establishing of a Government in those
parts of the world, which yet was not to continue long:
But herein he had the favour to be an Instrument of Gods
goodness, and a willing advancer of his Kingdom upon
earth, which must last for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyrus</hi> had Issue two Sons,<note place="margin">His Issue.</note> 
                     <hi>Cambyses,</hi> and <hi>Smerdis,</hi> and
three Daughters, <hi>Atossa, Meroe,</hi> and <hi>Artistoua.</hi> At his
Death he bequeathed his Empire to his Eldest Son <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses,</hi>
appointing <hi>Smerdis,</hi> his younger Son, to be
<hi>Satrapa,</hi> or Leiutenant of <hi>Media, Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusia.</hi>
He reigned about one and thirty years, and died
aged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Greek <hi>Historians wholly ascribe the Conquest
of</hi> Babylon <hi>to</hi> Cyrus, <hi>because that he commanded the
Army in Chief; yet the Scriptures attribute it to</hi> Darius,
<hi>King of the</hi> Medes, <hi>whose General</hi> Cyrus <hi>was: For
when</hi> Babylon <hi>was taken, and</hi> Belshazzar <hi>slain; Its said,</hi>
Dan. 5. 31. <hi>that</hi> Darius <hi>the</hi> Median <hi>took the Kingdom,
being about sixty two years old. It was</hi> Darius <hi>also
that placed Officers over the severall Provinces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as we read,</hi> Dan. 6. 1, 2. It pleased <hi>Darius</hi> to set
over the Kingdom a hundred and twenty Princes, which
should be over the whole Kingdom, and over these, three
Presidents, of whom <hi>Daniel</hi> was the first, <hi>&amp;c. And thus
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95888:27"/>
was it Prophesied by</hi> Isay <hi>long before;</hi> Behold! I will
stir up the <hi>Medes</hi> against them, <hi>&amp;c. and by the Prophet
Jeremy;</hi> The Lord hath raised up the Spirit of the King of
the <hi>Medes:</hi> for his device is against <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. Jer.
55. 11. <hi>And again,</hi> verse 28. Prepare against her
the Nations, with the Kings of the <hi>Medes,</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
thereof, and all the Rulers thereof, and all the Land of his
Dominion.</p>
                  <p>But certain it is that the Honour of that great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over <hi>Babylon</hi> was wholly given to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who
was the Instrument preordained, and forenamed by
God himself: not onely for this Action; but also for
the delivery of his Church: Yet <hi>Daniel</hi> makes it plain,
that himself: not onely lived a great Officer under King
<hi>Darius,</hi> but that he continued in that estate to the first year
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which was not long after, which also was the
year of <hi>Daniels</hi> Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for the age of</hi> Cyrus <hi>we are beholding to</hi> Tully
<hi>for it; who in his first Book</hi> de Divinatione, <hi>Cites it
out of one</hi> Dionysius, a Persian <hi>Writer, in this manner.</hi>
The Sun <hi>(saith</hi> Dionysius) appeared unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his sleep,
standing at his feet, which, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> thrice endeavoured
to take in his hands, the Sun still turned aside, and went
away: and the <hi>Magi,</hi> who were the most learned men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Persians,</hi> said that by his thrice offering to
take hold of the Sun, was portended to him that he should
raign thirty years;<note place="margin">His Age.</note> which came to pass accordingly: For he
lived to the Age of seventy years, and began not to raign till he
was forty.</p>
                  <p>In the first year of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Some use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</note> 
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> had the Vision
shewed him of the four Beasts, signifying the four Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies;
and of God delivering over all power, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
to the Son of man, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>In the third year of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> the Vision of the
Ram, and Goat, foreshewing the destruction of the
<hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and the
great misery which <hi>Antiochus</hi> should bring upon the
People of God was shewed to <hi>Daniel,</hi> living then at
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95888:27"/>
                     <hi>Susa,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Elam,</hi> upon the bank of the
River <hi>Vlai,</hi> which environed the Castle of <hi>Susa,</hi> and
parted the Provinces of <hi>Susa,</hi> and <hi>Elemais, Dan.</hi> 8.
whence we may collect, that at that time the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Susa</hi> was not in the hands of the <hi>Medes</hi>
and <hi>Persians,</hi> but of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> under whom <hi>Daniel</hi>
then lived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> son of <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> or <hi>Ahasuerus</hi>
the Son of <hi>Adyages,</hi> took upon him the Kingdom, which
was delivered over to him by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 31. &amp; 9. 1. The Angel, in this first
year of his Raign, is said to have confirmed, and
strengthened him in his Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 1. After which
he raigned two years.</p>
                  <p>Towards the end of the first year of <hi>Darius</hi> the
<hi>Mede,</hi> the seventy years of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity
expired, which began under <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> in the first
year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> at which time God promised
that they should return into their own Country, <hi>Jer.
29. 10. Thus saith the Lord, that after seventy years be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
at</hi> Babylon, <hi>I will visit you, and perform my
good Word towards you, in causing you to return to this
place.</hi> Upon consideration of which very time, now
so neer approaching, it was, that <hi>Daniel</hi> powred out
that most fervent Prayer for the Remission of his
own sins, and of his Peoples; and for that promised
deliverance out of their Captivity: Whereupon the
Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> brought him an answer, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this, but also for the spiritual deliverance of the
Church to be wrought at last by the Death of the <hi>Messias,</hi>
uttering that most famous, and memorable Prophesie of
the seventy Weeks, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 12, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Samaritans,</hi> by the means of some Courtiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom they had bribed for that purpose,
distributed the <hi>Jews</hi> in their building of the Temple, <hi>Ezra
4. 5.</hi> Whence proceeded that three weeks mourning of the
Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> which Fast he begun about the third
Day of the first Moneth, in the third year of <hi>Cyrus,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95888:28"/>
Dan. 10. 1. 4.</hi> After which, upon the four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Day of the first Moneth, that vision of the Kings of
<hi>Persia;</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and his Successours, and
their Kingdoms, was shewed and revealed unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
as he stood upon the bank of <hi>Hiddikel,</hi> or <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris;</hi>
All which is contained in the three last Chapters of
<hi>Daniel;</hi> which (as may be collected out of the close
thereof) was the last Vision that ever he had, and that
but a little before his Death.</p>
