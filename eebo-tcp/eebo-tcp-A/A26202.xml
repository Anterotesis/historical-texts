            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Send you this in return of ſeveral kind Letters which are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us remote from the News of the Town. 'Tis true, it is an Account of a ſmall loſs we have receiv'd; yet when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Bravery of the Reſiſtance and how dear bought the Victory was to the Enemy, you will find it to be a Relation fit for publick view, to ſhew the Gallantry of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Courage.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Robert Audley</hi> Commander of the <hi>King Fiſher</hi> Ketch, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twenty four Men, and four Guns, was ſent by our Admiral from the Fleet here riding, to fetch the preſt Men that lay at <hi>Plymouth.</hi> In his courſe, he was met by a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, of eighteen Guns and ſix Petterero's, off of <hi>Weymouth.</hi> The Privateer put out <hi>Dutch</hi> Colours at firſt, ſo that Captain <hi>Audley</hi> never ſuſpected him to be a <hi>French</hi> Man, till he came up juſt with him, at what time the Privateer put up his <hi>French</hi> Colours; and then Captain <hi>Audley</hi> found his miſtake. However perceiving there was no way to avoid a Veſſel that Sayl'd better then he did, the Captain reſolv'd to defend himſelf as well as he could. The <hi>French</hi> man being as I ſaid before an Excellent Sayler, put off the Ketch from the Shore to make ſure of her; and ſo the Fight began about four of the Clock in the Afternoon, and continu'd till almoſt nine: During which time the <hi>Frenchman</hi> Boarded the Ketch no leſs than four times, but was every time beat off with much loſs, till at length of twenty four Men and the Captain, there were no more then ſeven Men left that were able to Maintain the Fight.</p>
            <p>When the Ketch was thus diſibl'd, the Privateer Boarded the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a fifth time, and leaving twenty Men a Board, put off again. Now began another hot Conteſt between the twenty and the ſeven; which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41332:2"/>
continu'd till two of the ſeven were cut in pieces, and Captain <hi>Aud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> himſelf wounded in four places, after he had kill'd ſeven of the twenty with his own hand, and the reſt of the twenty all but two, were kill'd by the few left in the Ketch, and then it was, and not before, that the <hi>French</hi> Privateer Boarding the <hi>Ketch</hi> the laſt time, and entring all his Men, the wounded Captain and his poor five Men were forc'd to yield to freſh a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ailants and ſuperiour number. What loſs the Privateer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, we cannot underſtand, but conſidering the loſs of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it is not to be queſtion'd, but that he paid dear for the purchaſe of a little Ketch.</p>
            <p>When Captain <hi>Audley</hi> was taken, the <hi>Privateer</hi> impatient of the Miſchief he had received, asked him, how he had the Impudence to fight ſuch a Ship as his was, and in the height of his paſſion, was ſo unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous as to fall upon Captain <hi>Audley</hi> with his Cane, and to beſtow ſo many hard blows upon him, as to ſet his VVounds a bleeding a freſh, and in other parts of his Body to beat him black and blew. A piece of inſulting Tyranny, which none but a <hi>French Privateer</hi> would have been guilty of. Nevertheleſs we muſt ſay this for the <hi>Privateer,</hi> that when the heat of his Fury was over, he came ſo far to himſelf, that before he ſent Captain <hi>Audley</hi> on ſhore at St. <hi>Malo</hi>'s, he gave him his blew Suit back again to keep him warm in the <hi>Goal,</hi> becauſe he had fought ſo bravely; and was ſo kind to his own Reputation, that to excuſe the loſs he had receiv'd, he reported to the Honour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that never Men fought better in the VVorld; as by a Letter from St. <hi>Malo</hi>'s, is atteſted by ſeveral Merchants upon the place, who offered ſix <hi>French</hi> Mates for his Ranſom, but they would not be taken; twelve Cowardly <hi>French</hi> Mates not being a true value for one Valiant <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain.</p>
            <p>He is at this preſent in the Caſtle of St. <hi>Malo</hi>'s, and the four <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
