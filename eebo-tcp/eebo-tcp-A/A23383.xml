         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I conſerue (at his pleaſure) both your life and mine,
and little is it that I kéepe for my ſelfe, hauing miniſtred to
you that which is néedful, if you giue me ought, I take it, and
whatſoeuer it is I am therewith contented, I digeſt it, and
diuide to euerie one of you his portion, what is néedfull, that

<pb facs="tcp:4682:15"/>
giue me, my purſe is alwayes emptie, it is not much that I
demaund, neither doe I by nature deſire that is daintie, for
as I am placed in the middeſt, ſo doe I naturally loue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
if you giue me too much, your ſelues are cauſe of my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperance,
and of your owne ſorow, if you ouercharge me
you driue me to belching, to dronkenneſſe, to lecherie, to ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and many diſeaſes, if you giue me too little, you make
me an image of death, my lookes heauie, my face pale, my

countenance, a merrie and ſober minde, a happy life, a quiet

               <p>I knowe the tongue will perſwade you that I am neuer

for héereby you liue &amp; haue your health, if you keepe me long
faſting, then I deſire no meate, but as the Phiſitions ſay, I
drawe from the entrailes and bowelles certaine filthie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
of which matter are ingendered wormes, yea the gall

others by ſtrength of the bodie: ſo in a naturall bodie,
each member hath his ſeuerall dutie, and one may ſerue to
diuerſe and ſundrie ends, the head as it is the higheſt, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
in matters of wit, and is therefore a guide to the reſt
of the members, hauing the moſt of the ſenſes placed about
it, to the end it ſhould warilie prouide for the profite &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
of the others. The handes are buſied in labouring,
and ordayned to worke for ſuch things as may ſerue to the

deare brethren, you ſhould knowe that it is not in me, but in

that which is neceſſarie, <hi>Crimen non eſt in rebus ſed in vſu a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentis,</hi>
I take no pride in ſilkes, no more than in cloth, if any

            <p>But as there is no body wherin are not ſome infirmities,

there is none more pernitious than the enuious tongue of

            <p>Then deare Countrimen, being thus minded, friendly and

Conſider the auncient fame you haue often won in the field,

hard folowed by the hounds, he hides not his head in holes,
nor ſhroudes himſelfe among buſhes, but gets him into the

the Lion will not ſhrinke in daungers, nor Engliſh hartes
faint in troubles.</p>
            <p>Againe, there is this <hi>Antipathia,</hi> betwéene the Lion and

wherefore like Lions encounter them, and as like wolues

Doubt not of victorie, it is Gods quarrell, the Lion of <hi>Iuda</hi>

            <p>They play with vs as <hi>Iulianus</hi> the Apoſtate did with the

great preparation againſt the Chriſtians, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſcornfully
tearmed <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> threatning he would race them out, and

ſet vp deuilliſh images in their Churches. At that time <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banius</hi>
a ſingular Sophiſt, but an enemie to the truth, and a

in deede (according to his propheſie) within few dayes after,
this Apoſtate died, was put in a coffin, and being laide in the
graue, for all his ſwelling pride, came ſhort of that which he
proudly threatned.</p>
            <p>I might tell of <hi>Sancherib,</hi> of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> againſt <hi>Saul,</hi>
and diuerſe others that haue threatned the Saints of God,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 32.</note>
which becauſe they boaſted agaynſt the Lorde,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.</note> were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen.
But becauſe I haue fallen in hand with <hi>Iulian,</hi> I
will not let paſſe the apt <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> that is betwéene the
Spaniards and <hi>Iulian</hi> with his followers. They bragged to
ouerthrowe the <hi>Galilaeans</hi> (as they tearmed them) ſo doe the
Spaniards the Proteſtants, or the Lutherans as they name
them, they threatned to ſet vp Idols, ſo doe the Spaniardes
images, they proteſted to root &amp; race out Chriſtians, ſo do the
Spaniards the true profeſſors, they threatned to ſhed their
bloud moſt ſpitefully, ſo do the Spaniards beaſt to ſpil ours
moſt cruelly, but doubt not louing Countriemen, but that
Chriſt Ieſus whom you ſerue, is making their coffins, and
that eyther the ſea or a ſtraunge lande ſhal be their graues,
that cannot be contented with their owne, but proudly ſéeke
to oppreſſe the Saints of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore I exhort you, as <hi>Hezechia</hi> did thoſe of <hi>Iuda,</hi>
Be ſtrong and couragious: feare not, neither bee afraide for
the force of Spaniards, nor for al the multitude that is with
them, for there be more with vs than with them, with them
<pb facs="tcp:4682:25"/>
