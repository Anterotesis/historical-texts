            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For the kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers thereof neuer forbid any man the ſight thereof, I ſay as I haue ſayde before, that this King euerie yeere in his feaſtes triumpheth, and becauſe it is worthy of the noting, I<note place="margin">The great pompe of this King.</note> think it méet to writ therof, which is as followeth. The king rideth on a triumphing Cart or Wagon, all guilded, which is drawn by ſixteen goodly horſes: &amp; this Cart is very high with a goodly canapie ouer it, behind the Cart goeth twenty of his Lordes &amp; Nobles, with euerie one a rope in his hand made faſt to the Cart, for to holde it vpright, that it fal not. The King ſitteth in the middle of the cart, and vpon the ſame Carte, about the King ſtandeth fowre of his Nobles moſt<note place="margin">The order of their going.</note> fauoured of him, and before this Carte wherein the King is, goeth all his armie as aforeſaide, and in the middle of his armie goeth all his Nobilitie rounde about the Cart, that are in his dominions, a meruellous thing to ſée ſo many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuch riches and ſuch good order in a people ſo barberous, as they bee.</p>
               <p>This King of <hi>Pegu</hi> hath one principall wife, which is kept in<note place="margin">This King hath one wiſe and 300. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines.</note> a <hi>Seralyo,</hi> he hath thrée hundreth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubines, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that hee hath ninetie Children.

made in this order. The King ſitteth vp aloſt in a great hall, on a tribunall ſeate, and lower vnder him ſitteth all his Barons rounde about, then thoſe that demaunde audience, enter into a great Court before the King, and there ſet them downe on the grounde fortie paces diſtant from the Kinges<note place="margin">No difference of perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the king in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies or in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> perſon, and amongſt thoſe people there is no difference in matters of audience before the King, but all alike, and there they ſitte with their ſupplications in their handes, which are made of long leaues of a Trée, theſe leaues are thrée quarters of a yarde longe, and two fingers broade, which are written with a ſharpe yron made for that purpoſe, and in thoſe leaues are their ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons written, and with theire ſupplications: they haue in their handes a preſent or gift, according to the waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe<note place="margin">If we had ſuch paper in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſutes in law would not hang ſo long.</note> of their matter. Then come the ſecretaries downe and read theſe ſupplications, and then take them after and reade them before the King, and if the King thinke it good to doe to them that fauour or iuſtice that they demaund: then hee commaundeth to take the preſent out of his hand, but and if he thinke their demaunde bee not iuſtly, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to right: hee commaundeth them away without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their giftes or preſents. In the Indies there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merchandiſe that is good to bring to <hi>Pegu,</hi> vnleſſe it bee at ſome times by chance to bring at ſometimes Opium of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> and if he bring monie he ſhall loſe by it. Nowe the commodities that come from <hi>S.

Alſo from <hi>S. Tome,</hi> they layde great ſtore of red yarne, of Bombaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a roote which they call Saia, as aforeſaide, which colour will neuer out. With which merchandiſe euerie yere there goeth a great Ship from <hi>S. Tome</hi> to <hi>Pegu</hi> of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12754:34"/>
and they vſually depart from <hi>S. Tome</hi> to <hi>Pegu</hi> the 10. or 11. of September, and if ſhee ſtay vntill the twelfth, it<note place="margin">Note the de parture of the Ships from S.

Their vſe was to depart the ſixt of September, and then they made ſure voiages, and now becauſe ther is great labour about that kinde of cloth, to bring it to perfection and that it be well dried, as alſo the gréedineſſe of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that would make an extraordinarie gain of his fraight, thinking to haue the winde alwayes to ſerue their turn, they ſtay ſo long that at ſometimes, the Winde turneth. For in thoſe parts the windes blowe firmely, For certaine times with the which they goe to <hi>Pegu,</hi> with the winde in powpe and if they ariue not there before the Winde chaunge, and get ground to anker: perforce they muſt return back again, for that the gales of the winde blow there for thrée or fowre moneths together alwayes in one place with great force. But if they get the coaſt and anker there: then with greate labor he may ſaue his voyage.

               <p>In <hi>Pegu</hi> their order is to hier their houſes for ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths.

               <p>There is in <hi>Pegu</hi> eight Brokers of the Kings, which are<note place="margin">Tareghe are names of the brookes.</note> called Tareghe, who are bounde to ſell all the merchandize to come to Pegu, at the common or the corent price, then

if the merchants will ſell their goodes at that price: they ſell it away, and the Brokers haue two in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hundreth of euerie ſort of Merchandiſe, and they are bounde to make good the debtes of that goodes, becauſe it is ſolde by their handes or meanes, and on their wordes, and oftentimes the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant<note place="margin">The brokers are lowed to make good al the debts to the merchant.</note> knoweth not to whome he giueth his goodes, yet hee cannot loſe any thing thereby, for that the broker is bounde in any wiſe to pay him, and if the merchant ſell his goodes without the conſent of the broker: yet neuertheleſſe he muſt pay him two <hi>percento,</hi> and be in daunger of his mony, but this is verie ſeldome ſeene, becauſe the Wife, Children, and<note place="margin">A law for banckroutes.</note> ſlaues of the debttor are bounde to the creditor, and when his time is expired and paiment not made, the creditor may take the debter and carie him home to his houſe, and ſhut him vp in a <hi>Magazen,</hi> whereby preſently he hath his monie, and not beeing able to pay the creditor, hee may take the wife, children, and ſlaues of the debtor, and ſell them, for ſo is the law of that kingdome.

For if ſo bée that hee would returne with the Ship he came in, he cannot<note place="margin">How a man may deſpoſe him ſelfe for the trade in Pegu.</note> doe anie thing well, for the breuity of the time, becauſe that when they cuſtome their goodes in <hi>Pegu:</hi> that come from S. <hi>Tome</hi> in their Shippes: it is as it were about the natiuitie, and when they haue cuſtomed their goods, then they muſt ſell it for credite, for a moneth or two: and then at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of March the Shippes depart.

And 8. or 10. daies<note place="margin">Good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions.</note> before their departure, they are all ſatiſfied: alſo they may haue Rubies in paiment, but they make no account of them &amp; they that will winter there for another yéere, it is needefull that they be aduertized, that in the ſale of their goodes, that they ſperify in their bargain, the term of two or thrée mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ths paiment, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> their paiment ſhal be in ſo many <hi>Ganza,</hi> and neither golde nor ſiluer, becauſe that with the <hi>Ganza</hi> they may buy and ſell euerie thing with great aduantage. And howe néedefull it is to be aduertized, that when they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their payments: in what order they ſhall receiue their <hi>Ganza,</hi> becauſe hee that is not practicke may doe him ſelfe great wrong in the waight of the <hi>Ganſa,</hi> as alſo in the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, in the waight hee may bee greatly deceiued, becauſe that from place to place, it doth riſe and fall great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and therefore when any man will receiue money or make paiment, hee muſt take a publique wayer of money: a day or two before hee goe about his buſineſſe, and giue him in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his labour, two <hi>Byza</hi> a moneth, and for this hee is bounde to make good all your mony heerby: and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it for good, for that hee receiueth it and ſeales the bagges with his Seale: and when hee hath receiued any ſtore, there hee cauſeth it to bee brought into the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea of the Merchant, that is the owner of it.</p>
               <p>That mony is verie waightie, for forty <hi>Byza</hi> is a great Porters burden, and alſo where the Merchant hath any paymente to bee made for thoſe goodes, whiche hee buyeth: the Comon wayer of mony that receiueth his

So that by this means, the Merchant with the charges of two Byzes a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, receiueth and payeth out his monie without loſſe or<note place="margin">The merchan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diſe that goe out of Pegu.</note> trouble. Thoſe merchandiſe that goe out of the <hi>Pegu</hi> are theſe, as Gold, Siluer, Rubies, Saphyres, Spynelles, great ſtore of Beniamen, long Peper, Leade, Lacca, Ryce, Wine, ſome Sugar, yet there might be great ſtore of Sugar made in the Cuntry, for that they haue abundance of Canes, but they giue them to Eliphants to eat, and the people conſume great ſtore of them for foode, and many more doe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in vaine things as theſe. In that Kingdome they ſpend many of theſe Sugar canes in making of houſes and tents which they call <hi>Varely</hi> for their Idoles, which they call <hi>Pagody,</hi> whereof there is great abundance, great &amp; ſmall, and theſe houſes are made in forme to little hilles, like to Sugar loaues or to Belles, and ſome of theſe houſes are as high as a reaſonable ſtéeple, at the foote they are verie large, that ſome of them bee in circuit a quarter of a mile, the ſaid<note place="margin">Idoll houſes what faſhion they are of.</note> houſes within are full of earth, and walled round about with brickes and dirt in ſtead of lyme, and without forme, from the top to the foot they make a couering for them with Sugar Canes, and plaiſtered with lyme all ouer, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they woulde be ſpoyled, by the great abundance of rain that falleth in thoſe Countreyes, alſo they conſume about theſe verely or Idoll houſes great ſtore of leaſe Golde, for that they ouerlay al the toppes of the houſes with gold, and ſome of them is couered with Golde from the toppe to the<note place="margin">Idoll houſes couered with Golde.</note> foote. In couering whereof there is great ſtore of Gold ſpent, for that euerie ten yeeres they new ouerlay them with gold, from the top to foote, ſo that with this vanitie they ſpende great aboundaunce of gold. For euerie ten yeeres the raine doth conſume the Golde from theſe houſes. And by this meanes they make Gold dearer in <hi>Pegu</hi> then it would bee, if they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed not ſo much in this vanitie. Alſo it is a thing to be noted in the buying of Jewels in <hi>Pegu,</hi> for he that hath no knowledge ſhall haue as good Jewels, and as good cheap as he that hath beene practized there a long time, which is a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12754:37"/>
good order, which is this. There is in <hi>Pegu</hi> fowre men of good reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are called Tareghe, or brokers of Jewels. Theſe fowre men haue all the Jewels, or Rubies in their handes, and the Merchant that will buy, commeth to one of theſe Tareghe and telleth him, that he hath ſo much money to imploy in Rubies. For through the handes of theſe fowre men paſſeth all the Rubies: for they haue ſuch quantity, that they knowe not what to doe with them, but ſell them at a moſte vile and baſe price. When the Merchant hath broke his minde to on of theſe Brokers or Tareghe, they carie him ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to one of their Shops, although he haue no knowledge in Jewels: and when the Jewellers perceiue that hee will employ a good rounde ſumme, they will make bargaine, and if not, they let him alone. The vſe generally of this Citie, is this: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> when any Merchant hath brought any great quantity of Rubies, and haue agréed for them, the Merchant carieth them home to his houſe, let them bee of what valure they wil, he ſhall haue ſpace to looke on them and relooke them two or thrée dayes: and if hee haue no knowledge in them, he ſhal alwayes haue many Merchants in that City that hath very good knowledge in Jewels: with whome hee may alwayes conferre and take counſell with them, and ſhewe them vnto whome he will, and if he finde that hee hath not employed his money well, he may returne his Jewelles backe to them whome hee had them of, without any loſſe at all. Which thing is ſuch a ſhame to the Tereghe to haue his Jewels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, that he had rather to beare a blowe on the face then that it ſhoulde be thought that he ſhoulde ſell them ſo deere to haue them returned. For theſe men haue alwayes great care that they make good employmentes, eſpecially to thoſe that haue no knowledge. This they doe, becauſe they woulde not looſe their credite: and when thoſe Merchantes that haue knowledge in Jewelles buy any, if they buy them déere it is there owne faults and not the Brokers: yet it is good to haue knowledge in Jewelles, by reaſon that he may<note place="margin">An honeſt care of hea then people.</note> ſomewhat eaſe the price. There is alſo a verie good order for which they haue in buying of Jewelles: which is this, there
<pb facs="tcp:12754:38"/>
is many merchants that ſtandeth by at the making of the bargaine, and becauſe they ſhall not vnderſtande howe the<note place="margin">Bargaines made with the nipping of Fingers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cloth.</note> Jewels be ſolde: The Broker and the Merchants haue their handes vnder a cloth, and by touching of fingers and nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the ioynts they knowe what is done, what is bidden, and what is aſked. So that the ſtanders by know not what is demanded for them, although it be for a thouſand or ten thouſand Duckets. For euerie ioynt and euerie finger hath his ſignification. For if the Merchants that ſtand by, ſhould vnderſtand the bargain: it woulde breede great controuerſie amongeſt them, and at my beeinge in <hi>Pegu</hi> in the moneth of Auguſt, in Anno 69. and hauing gotten well by my endeuor, I was deſirous to ſée mine owne Countrie, and I thought<note place="margin">The Authors deſire to ſee his Cuntry.</note> it good to goe by the way of <hi>Saint Tome,</hi> but then I ſhould tarrie vntill March.</p>
               <p>In which iourney I was councelled, yea, and fullie reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to goe by the way of <hi>Bangala,</hi> with a Shippe there rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to depart for that voyage.
