         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Highly eÅ¿teemed in the Lord JeÅ¿us,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHen the Lord firÅ¿t brought me to theÅ¿e poor Indians
on the <hi>Vinyard,</hi> they were mighty zealous and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t
in the WorÅ¿hip of FalÅ¿e gods, and Devils; their FalÅ¿e
gods were many, both of things in Heaven, Earth, and
Sea: And there they had their Men-gods, Women-gods,
and Children-gods, their Companies, and FellowÅ¿hips of
gods, or Divine Powers, guiding things amongÅ¿t men,
beÅ¿ides innumerable more feigned gods belonging to
many Creatures, to their Corn, and every Colour of it:
The Devil alÅ¿o with his Angels had his Kingdom among
them, in them; account him they did, the terror of the
Living, the god of the Dead, under whoÅ¿e cruel power
and into whoÅ¿e deformed likeneÅ¿s they conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves
to be tranÅ¿lated when they died; for the Å¿ame
word they have for <hi>Devil,</hi> they uÅ¿e alÅ¿o for a <hi>Dead Man,</hi> in
their Language: by him they were often hurt in their
Bodies, diÅ¿tracted in their Minds, wherefore they had
many meetings with their <hi>Pawwaws</hi> (who uÅ¿ually had a
hand in their hurt) to pacifie the Devil by their Sacrifice,
and get deliverance from their evil; I have Å¿ometimes
marvelled to Å¿ee the vehemency of their Spirits, which
they acted with no leÅ¿s bodily violence therein. The
<hi>Pawwaws</hi> counted their Imps their PreÅ¿ervers, had them
treaÅ¿ured up in their bodies, which they brought forth
to hurt their enemies, and heal their friends; who when
they had done Å¿ome notable Cure, would Å¿hew the Imp
in the palm of his Hand to the Indians, who with much
amazement looking on it, Deified them, then at all times
Å¿eeking to them for cure in all Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿es, and counÅ¿el in
all caÅ¿es: This Diabolical way they were in, giving heed
to a multitude of Heathen Traditions of their gods, and
many other things, under the obÅ¿ervation whereof, they
<pb facs="tcp:118441:4"/>
with much Å¿lavery were held, and abounding with Å¿ins,
having only an obÅ¿cure Notion of a good greater than all,
which they call <hi>Mannit,</hi> but they knew not what he was,
and therefore had no way to worÅ¿hip him.</p>
            <p>What an entrance I had at firÅ¿t amongÅ¿t theÅ¿e miÅ¿era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Heathen, how called thereunto, and what Å¿ucceÅ¿s
God bleÅ¿Å¿ed us with, hath been in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure already
publiÅ¿hed, which will I hope through the dew of Gods
bleÅ¿Å¿ing from Heaven, have Å¿uch a gracious increaÅ¿e, that
the bloÅ¿Å¿oming and budding time Å¿hal at leaÅ¿t be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
and by many more God bleÅ¿Å¿ed for it, in the
growth of the fruit to more maturity; Since it hath
pleaÅ¿ed God to Å¿end his Word to theÅ¿e poor captivated
men (bondÅ¿laves to Å¿in and Satan) he hath through mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
brought two hundred eighty three Indians (not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
yong children in the number) to renounce their
falÅ¿e gods, Devils, and Pawwaws, and publickly in Å¿et
meetings, before many witneÅ¿Å¿es, have they diÅ¿claimed
the Divinity of their formerly adored multitude, defied
their tyrannical DeÅ¿troyer the Devil, and utterly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed
the help of the Pawwaws in any caÅ¿e; neither have
they at any time, either by threatnings or flatteries been
drawn thereto, although their lives have been in hazard;
yea, eight of their Pawwaws have forÅ¿aken their Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h
craft, and profitable trade as they accounted it, for to
embrace the Word and Way of God. The Indians
which do pray to God, were not compelled thereto by
power, neither alÅ¿o could they be allured by gifts, who
received nothing for about Å¿even years time, much leÅ¿s
that which counterpoyÅ¿e their troubles, and exceed to
the drawing of them from the beloved waies of their
own WorÅ¿hips: Surely it were great uncharitableneÅ¿s,
and derogatory from the glory of God, to think that
none of theÅ¿e are truly changed, and that God himÅ¿elf
<pb facs="tcp:118441:5"/>
by his Word and Spirit, hath not in mercy prevailed in
their hearts againÅ¿t theÅ¿e evils; nay, may we not hope
and be perÅ¿waded by this, and Å¿ome other appearances
of God amongÅ¿t them, that Å¿ome of them are truly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to God from Idols, to Å¿erve the Living and true
God? Serve him, through mercy they do in Å¿ome hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Reformations, walking inoffenÅ¿ively and diligently
in their way, which I hope will more plainly appear
when they are in a way more hopeful (by the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of
God to their further well-being) which I hope will be in
the beÅ¿t time.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice of this good providence of
God by the way, That he hath mercifully preÅ¿erved all
the Indians which call upon his Name (from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Work unto this day) from all extraordinary
evil, whereby the Devil and Witches uÅ¿e to torment the
Bodies and Minds of Men, not one of them or their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(as I know) or have heard have been touched by
them in this kind (only a Pawwaw or two, have not been
delivered from his Imps preÅ¿ently after his renouncing
of them, but for Å¿ome time have had the Å¿ence of them
in his Body with much pain:) The miÅ¿chief that the
Pawwaws and Devils uÅ¿ually do to the common Indian
this way, is both by outward and bodily hurt, or inward
pain, torture, and diÅ¿traction of mind, both which I have
Å¿een my Å¿elf: To accompliÅ¿h the firÅ¿t, the Devil doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buÅ¿e
the real body of a Serpent, which comes directly
towards the man in the houÅ¿e or in the field, looming or
having a Å¿hadow about him like a man, and do Å¿hoot a
bone (as they Å¿ay) into the Indians Body, which Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
killeth him. An inÅ¿tance whereof I can give,
whereby it may the more plainly appear, that it is a great
mercy to be delivered therefrom; and it is of a youth,
who living with his Parents upon a neck of Land, They
<pb facs="tcp:118441:5"/>
did not pray unto <hi>Jehovah,</hi> yet their Neighbors who lived
there with them, did; This Youth was hurt after the
Å¿ame manner, and then preÅ¿ently his Parents pulled
down the houÅ¿e they lived in, and fled to an IÅ¿land near
by, where I Å¿aw the Indian thus hurt in his Thigh, he
was grievouÅ¿ly tormented, and his Kindred about him
mourning, not knowing where to find any comfort, or
help, for cure could not be had from their gods or
Pawwaws: I then took the opportunity to reaÅ¿on with
them about their way, with the beÅ¿t wiÅ¿dom God gave
me, but all in vain, for they would not hear to Å¿eek the
true God, notwithÅ¿tanding he had Å¿hewn his diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure
Å¿o apparantly againÅ¿t them for their former refuÅ¿ing of
Him, but they Å¿till followed on their wonted Serpentine
Machinations: The Pawwaws, and their devilliÅ¿h train,
with their horrible outcries, hollow bleatings, painful
wreÅ¿tlings, and Å¿miting their own bodies, Å¿ought delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but all in vain, for he died miÅ¿erably. Hereby,
and by Å¿everal other things, I perceive that they are not
(in a manner) indifferent, whether they Å¿erve their own
gods or not, or change them (as Å¿ome think) for they
are naturally like the Heathens of <hi>Chittim</hi> and <hi>Kedar,</hi>
which would not change their gods, which yet are no
gods; when God blames his people for changing their
glory for that which doth not profit; I hope therefore
that it is Å¿omething of Grace, that many chuÅ¿e to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip
the true God. But touching the former vexing
miÅ¿chiefs, A <hi>Sachem,</hi> and no good friend to the work,
could not but acknowledg the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God among
the Praying Indians; When I came over (Å¿aid he) at the
further end of the IÅ¿land, there was a Å¿torm (mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the aforeÅ¿aid evils, with Å¿ome more) but when I
came to this end I found a calm, the Praying Indians
were all well, they aroÅ¿e in the morning, Prayed to God,
<pb facs="tcp:118441:6"/>
and went about their buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and they are not hurt nor
troubled like the other Indians: And the Pawwaws
themÅ¿elves, Å¿ome of them do Å¿ay, That they cannot
make their Power Å¿eize on any of them: QueÅ¿tionleÅ¿s
they have tried their Skill, and Satan hath not been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them, who is Å¿o unwilling to fall down from
his Rule, and to be driven from his old PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions. A
Pawwaw told me, who was of no Å¿mall note among the
Heathen formerly, and alÅ¿o with the beÅ¿t, now he hath
forÅ¿aken his Pawwawing, That after he had been
brought by the Word of God to hate the Devil, and to
renounce his Imps (which he did publickly) that yet his
Imps remained Å¿till in him for Å¿ome months tormenting
of his fleÅ¿h, and troubling of his mind, that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be at reÅ¿t, either Å¿leeping or waking: At length one
time when I went down to keep the fartheÅ¿t Lecture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Å¿even miles off, he asked me Å¿ome QueÅ¿tions,
whereof this was one, <hi>viz.</hi> That if a Pawwaw had his
Imps gone from him, what he Å¿hould have inÅ¿tead of
them to preÅ¿erve him? Whereunto it was AnÅ¿wered,
That if he did beleeve in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, he Å¿hould have
the Spirit of ChriÅ¿t dwelling in him, which is a good and
a Å¿trong Spirit, and will keep him Å¿o Å¿afe, that all the
Devils in Hell, and Pawwaws on Earth, Å¿hould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do him any hurt; and that if he did Å¿et himÅ¿elf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
his Imps, by the Å¿trength of God they Å¿hould all
flee away like Muskeetoes: He told me, That he did
much deÅ¿ire the Lord, it might be Å¿o with him. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Å¿aid, That ever Å¿ince that very time God hath in
mercy delivered him from them, he is not troubled with
any pain (as formerly) in his Bed, nor dreadful viÅ¿ions of
the night, but through the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God, he doth lie
down in eaÅ¿e, Å¿leeps quietly, wakes in Peace, and walks
in Å¿afety, for which he is very glad, and praiÅ¿es God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118441:6"/>
This laÅ¿t Å¿pring, the Indians of their own accord made
a motion to me they might have Å¿ome way ordered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t
them, as a means whereby they might Walk in
good Subjection to the Law of God, wherunto they deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to enter into Covenant; they told me that they were
very deÅ¿irous to have their Å¿ins Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed which God
did forbid, and the duties performed, which he hath
Commanded in his Word; and thereunto they deÅ¿ired
me to inform them, what puniÅ¿hment the Lord did
appoint to be inflicted on thoÅ¿e which did break any
part of His Law, for they were very willing to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themÅ¿elves to what the will of the Lord is in
this kind. I was not willing on the Å¿udden to draw forth
in writing an AnÅ¿wer to their deÅ¿ire, but rather choÅ¿e to
take a longer time of ConÅ¿ideration in a Work of Å¿o great
Concernment, and refer them to the Word of God,
Å¿hewing them many places for their information, moÅ¿t
whereof they had heard of formerly: They alÅ¿o fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deÅ¿ired, That they might have Å¿ome men ChoÅ¿en
amongÅ¿t them with my father and my Å¿elf, to Å¿ee that
the Indians did walk orderly, and that Å¿uch might be
incouraged, but that thoÅ¿e which did not, might be dealt
with acording to the word of the Lord; I could not but
approve and incourage the motion, Å¿eeing they Å¿pake
not as thoÅ¿e in <hi>PÅ¿al. 2. 3. Let us break their bands aÅ¿under and
caÅ¿t away their cords from us,</hi> but Å¿ought totall Å¿ubjection
and Å¿trict obedience to God: yet I told them that it was
a matter of great weight, Å¿hewing them many things
which I thought neceÅ¿Å¿ary for them to know, but need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s
now to relate. A day of faÅ¿ting and prayer to repent
of our Å¿ins, and Å¿eek the gracious help of our God for
ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us Å¿ake, we appointed; and another Å¿hortly
after to finiÅ¿h the work in: Some of the Indians Å¿pake
Å¿omthing for their benefit; and about ten, or twelve
<pb facs="tcp:118441:7"/>
of them prayed, not with any Å¿et Form like Children,
but like Men indued with a good meaÅ¿ure of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God, their own wants, and the wants of others,
with much affection, and many Spiritual Petitions, Å¿avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of a Heavenly mind; and Å¿o are they Å¿treitned in
reÅ¿pect of help from man, that it appears the more
plainly to be the Dictates of Gods Spirit. A Platform
of the Covenant in AnÅ¿wer to their deÅ¿ires, I drew forth
the Å¿ame morning in the Indian Language, which I have
here Å¿ent in EngliÅ¿h.</p>
            <p>Wee the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> (or <hi>Nope, the
Indian name of the IÅ¿land)</hi> That beyond all memory have been
without the True God, without a Teacher, and without a Law,
the very Servants of Sin and Satan, and without Peace, for
God did juÅ¿tly vex us for our Å¿ins; having lately through his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
heard of the Name of the True God, the Name of his Son ChriÅ¿t
JeÅ¿us, with the holy GhoÅ¿t, the Comforter, three PerÅ¿ons, but
one moÅ¿t Glorious <hi>God,</hi> whoÅ¿e Name is <hi>JEHOVAH:</hi> We
do praiÅ¿e His Glorious GreatneÅ¿s, and in the Å¿orrow of our hearts,
and Å¿hame of our faces, we do acknowledg and renounce our great
and many Å¿ins, that we and our Fathers have lived in, do run unto
him for mercy, and pardon for ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us Å¿ake; and we do this day
through the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God upon us, and truÅ¿ting to his gracious
help, give up our Å¿elves in this Covenant, Wee, our Wives, and
Children, to Å¿erve <hi>JEHOVAH:</hi> And we do this day chuÅ¿e
<hi>JEHOVAH</hi> to be our God in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, our Teacher, our
Law-giver in his Word, our King, our Judg, our Ruler by his
MagiÅ¿trates and MiniÅ¿ters; to fear God HimÅ¿elf, and to truÅ¿t in
Him alone for Salvation, both of Soul and Body, in this preÅ¿ent
Life, and the EverlaÅ¿ting Life to come, through his mercy in
ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us our Savior, and Redeemer, and by the might of his
Holy Spirit; to whom with the Father and Son, be all Glory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaÅ¿ting.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118441:7"/>
After I had often read this Covenant and expounded
it unto them, they all with free ConÅ¿ent willingly and
thankfully joyned therein, and deÅ¿ired <hi>Jehovah</hi> his bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing
for JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t his Å¿ake, the Lord be gracious to our
beginnings.</p>
            <p>Within two or three weeks there came an Indian to
me in buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and by the way he told me, that Å¿ome
Indians had lately kept a day of Repentance to humble
themÅ¿elves before God in prayer, and that the word of
God which one of them Å¿pake unto, for their InÅ¿tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was <hi>PÅ¿al. 66. 7. He ruleth by his Power for ever, his eyes
behold the nations, let not the rebellious exalt themÅ¿elves.</hi> I
aÅ¿ked him what their end was in keeping Å¿uch a day?
He told me thoÅ¿e Å¿ix things: FirÅ¿t, they deÅ¿ired, That
God would Å¿lay the rebellion of their hearts. Secondly,
That they might love God, and one another. Thirdly,
That they might withÅ¿tand the evil words and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of wicked men, and not to be drawn back from
God. Fourthly, That they might be obedient to the
good Words and Commands of their Rulers. Fiftly,
That they might have their Å¿ins done away by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. And LaÅ¿tly, That they might
walk in ChriÅ¿ts way.</p>
            <p>Now for the Å¿tate of things with us, we are by the
help of God about to begin a Town that they may
Cohabit and carry on things in a Civil and Religious way
the better; The praying Indians are conÅ¿tant attenders
to the word of the Lord, and Å¿ome of them (I hope) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cionable
Å¿eekers after the knowledg of God, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves,
and not without obtaining (by the grace of God)
Å¿ome Å¿aving benefit to their own Souls, which will by his
own bleÅ¿Å¿ing, in the beÅ¿t time, more plainly appear.
About 30. Indian Children are now at School, which
began the Eleventh day of the Eleventh month. 1651.
<pb facs="tcp:118441:8"/>
they are apt to learn, and more and more are now Å¿end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in unto them. The Barbarous Indians, both men and
women, do often come on the Lecture dayes, and
complaining of their ignorance, diÅ¿liking their Å¿inful
liberty, and refuÅ¿ing the helps, and hopes of their own
power, Å¿eek Subjection to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to be taught, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and Å¿aved by him, for JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ake. The
Name of the Lord alone be praiÅ¿ed for what is begun;
What is further needfull, I earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ire may be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
prayed for, and expected by faith, to be effected,
and finiÅ¿hed by the gracious hand of God, who have laid
the foundation, and will not leave his own works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
which is the comfort of an unworthy Laborer in
the Lords Vinyard, and an earneÅ¿t deÅ¿irer to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
at the Throne of Grace.</p>
            <p>Having a little more liberty, I Å¿hall certifie you of
Å¿omthing more, which I have taken notice of amongÅ¿t
the poor Indians.</p>
            <p>I obÅ¿erved that the Indians when they choÅ¿e their
Rulers, made choyce of Å¿uch as were beÅ¿t approved for
their godlineÅ¿s, and moÅ¿t likely to Å¿uppreÅ¿s Å¿in, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
holineÅ¿s, and Å¿ince they have been forward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaÅ¿ions, to Å¿hew their earneÅ¿t deÅ¿ire thereof.
There was an Indian that was well approved for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that was Å¿uÅ¿pected to have told a plain Lye
for his Gain; the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s was brought to the publick
Meeting, and there it was notably Å¿ifted with zeal and
good affection; but at length the Indian defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf
with great diÅ¿dain, and hatred of Å¿uch an evil, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himÅ¿elf clear, and praiÅ¿ed God for it. The Å¿ame
Indian was a little before, very Å¿ick, and he told me
that when he thought he Å¿hould die, he did Å¿o love God,
that he was not unwilling to die, and leave his wife, and
children, or any thing elÅ¿e, but that he was only deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb facs="tcp:118441:8"/>
to live for this cauÅ¿e, That he might be more
taught by the Word of God, and be helpful to teach the
Indians the Way of God.</p>
            <p>I have alÅ¿o obÅ¿erved how God is pleaÅ¿ed to uphold
Å¿ome of theÅ¿e poor Indians againÅ¿t oppoÅ¿ition. I was
once down towards the further end of the IÅ¿land, and
lodged at an Indians houÅ¿e, who was accounted a great
man among the IÅ¿landers, being the friend of a great
<hi>Sachem</hi> on the <hi>Mayn;</hi> this <hi>Sachem</hi> is a great Enemy to our
Reformation on the IÅ¿land: At this mans houÅ¿e when I
had Å¿ate a while, his Å¿on being about thirty years old,
earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ired me in his Language, to relate unto him
Å¿ome of the ancient Stories of God; I then Å¿pent a great
part of the night (in Å¿uch diÅ¿courÅ¿e as I thought fitteÅ¿t
for them) as I uÅ¿ually do when I lodg in their houÅ¿es,
what he then heard (as he expreÅ¿Å¿ed) did much affect
him: And Å¿hortly after he came and deÅ¿ired to joyn
with the praying Indians to Å¿erve <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but it was to
the great diÅ¿contentment of the <hi>Sachems</hi> on the <hi>Mayn,</hi> and
thoÅ¿e Indians about him: News was often brought to
him that his life was laid in wait for, by thoÅ¿e that
would Å¿urely take it from him, they deÅ¿ired him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with Å¿peed to turn back again; The man came to me
once or twice, and I perceived that he was troubled, he
aÅ¿ked my counÅ¿el about removing his Habitation, yet
told me, That if they Å¿hould Å¿tand with a Å¿harp weapon
againÅ¿t his breaÅ¿t, and tell him that they would kill him
preÅ¿ently, if he did not turn to them, but if he would,
they would love him, yet he had rather loÅ¿e his life
than keep it on Å¿uch terms; for (Å¿aid he) when I look
back on my life as it was before I did pray to God, I Å¿ee it
to be wholly naught, and do wholly diÅ¿like it, and hate
thoÅ¿e naughty waies; but when I look on that way
which God doth teach me in his Word, I Å¿ee it to be
<pb facs="tcp:118441:9"/>
wholly good; and do wholly love it. BleÅ¿Å¿ed be God
that he is not overcome by theÅ¿e temptations.</p>
            <p>The next thing I judg alÅ¿o worthy to be obÅ¿erved,
My Father and I were lately talking with an Indian, who
had not long before almoÅ¿t loÅ¿t his life by a wound his
Enemies gave him in a Å¿ecret hidden way, the mark
whereof, he had upon him, and will carry it to his grave:
This man underÅ¿tanding of a Å¿ecret Plot that was to take
away his Enemies life, told my Father and I, That he
did freely forgive him for the Å¿ake of God, and did tell
this Plot to us that the mans life might be preÅ¿erved:
This is a Å¿ingular thing, and who among the Heathen
will do Å¿o?</p>
            <p>I obÅ¿erve alÅ¿o that the Indians themÅ¿elves do indeavor
to propagate the knowledg of God, to the glory of God
and the good of others: I heard an Indian (after I had
Å¿ome diÅ¿courÅ¿e with the Indians in the night) aÅ¿k the
<hi>Sachem,</hi> and many others together, how they did like that
counÅ¿el they heard from the word of God: They anÅ¿we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
very wel; then Å¿aid he, why do you not take it? why
do you not do according to it? He further added, I can
tell you why it is, BecauÅ¿e you do not Å¿ee your Å¿ins, and
becauÅ¿e you do love your Å¿ins; for as long as it was Å¿o
with me, I did not care for the Way of God; but when
God did Å¿hew me my Å¿ins, and made me hate them, then
I was glad to take Gods CounÅ¿el: this I remember
he Å¿pake, with Å¿ome other things, with Å¿uch Gravity
and truth, that the <hi>Sachem</hi> and all the company was not
able to gain-Å¿ay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Myoxeo</hi> alÅ¿o lately met with an Indian, which came from
the <hi>Mayn</hi> who was of Å¿ome note among them; I heard
that he told them of the great things of God, and of
ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, the Å¿infulneÅ¿s and folly of the Indians, the
Pardon of Å¿in by ChriÅ¿t, and of a good life; and Å¿o were
<pb facs="tcp:118441:9"/>
they both affected, that they continued this diÅ¿courÅ¿e
two half nights, and a day, until their Å¿trength was Å¿pent:
He told him in particular, how a Beleever did live above
the world, that he did keep worldly things alwaies at his
feet (as he Å¿hewed him by a Å¿ign) That when they were
deminiÅ¿hed, or increaÅ¿ed, it was neither the cauÅ¿e of his
Sorrow, or joy, that he Å¿hould Å¿toop to regard them, but
he Å¿tood upright with his heart Heavenward, and his
whol deÅ¿ire was after God, and his joy in him. Now
Much honored in the Lord, and all that love ChriÅ¿t Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
in truth, let me prevail with you that we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented
by you at the Throne of Grace in his worthineÅ¿s

heart, awakened by Å¿uch Scriptures, longeth to hear of the
ConverÅ¿ion of our poor <hi>Indians,</hi> whereby Å¿uch PropheÅ¿ies are
in part begun to be accompliÅ¿hed. Yea, the DeÅ¿ign of ChriÅ¿t
being to erect his own Kingdom, in the room of all thoÅ¿e Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
which he doth, and is about to overturn: You Å¿hall
Å¿ee a Spirit by Å¿uch words of PropheÅ¿ie powred forth upon the
Saints (into whoÅ¿e hands ChriÅ¿t will commit the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Kingdom on Earth) that Å¿hall carry them forth to
advance ChriÅ¿t to rule over men in all affairs, by the word of
his mouth, and make him their only Law-giver, and Å¿upream
Judge, and King.</p>
            <p>It is a day of Å¿mall things with us: and that is Gods Å¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on
to make the Å¿ingle beauty of his humbling Grace, to Å¿hine
in them, that are the verieÅ¿t ruines of mankind that are
known on earth; as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was wont to deÅ¿cribe the
forlorn condition of theÅ¿e poor <hi>Indians.</hi> I Å¿ee evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monÅ¿trations
that Gods Spirit by his word hath taught them,
becauÅ¿e their expreÅ¿Å¿ions, both in Prayer, and in the ConfeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions
which I have now publiÅ¿hed, are far more, and more full,
and Å¿piritual, and various, then ever I was able to expreÅ¿s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; in that poor broken manner of Teaching which I
have uÅ¿ed among them. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ir turning Doctrins into their
own experience, which you may obÅ¿erve in their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions,
doth alÅ¿o demonÅ¿trate the Teachings of Gods Spirit, whoÅ¿e
firÅ¿t Å¿pecial work is Application. Their different Gifts
likewiÅ¿e, is a thing obÅ¿ervable in their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions, wherein
it is not to be expected that they Å¿hould be all Eminent, it is
not Å¿o in any Society of men; but in that there be Å¿ome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them that are more eminent, it is a Å¿ign of Gods favor,
<pb facs="tcp:118441:12"/>
who is raiÅ¿ing up among themÅ¿elves, Å¿uch as Å¿hall be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments
to conveigh a bleÅ¿Å¿ing unto the reÅ¿t. Their frequent
phraÅ¿e of Praying to God, is not to be underÅ¿tood of that
Ordinance and Duty of Prayer only, but of all Religion, and
comprehendeth the Å¿ame meaning, with them, as the word
[Religion] doth with us: And it is obÅ¿ervable, becauÅ¿e it
Å¿eemeth to me, That the Lord will make them a Praying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
and indeed, there is a great Spirit of Prayer powred
out upon them, to my wonderment; and you may eaÅ¿ily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
That they who are aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted to expreÅ¿s Å¿uch ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions
before men, are not without a good meaÅ¿ure of inlargement of
Spirit before the Lord.</p>
            <p>The points of Doctrine that are here and there dropped in
their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions, may Å¿uffice at preÅ¿ent for a little taÅ¿te to the
Godly diÅ¿cerning Saints, That they are in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructed
in the chief points of Salvation, though there be no
Doctrinal ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion on purpoÅ¿e Å¿et down to declare what
they have learned, and do beleeve.</p>
            <p>If any Å¿hould conceive that that word which they Å¿o often
uÅ¿e <hi>[I thought,</hi> or <hi>I think]</hi> Å¿hould need explication, as a
godly Brother did intimate to me on the FaÅ¿t day, let this Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
That it is to be ConÅ¿trued by the preÅ¿ent Matter: For
Å¿ometimes it is a thought of Faith; Å¿ometime of Fear;
Å¿ometime of <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>nbelief; Å¿ometime of Carnal ReaÅ¿on; and
Å¿ometime of Ignorance.</p>
            <p>LaÅ¿tly, It is plainly to be obÅ¿erved, That one end of Gods
Å¿ending Å¿o many Saints to <hi>NEW-ENGLAND,</hi> was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ion
of theÅ¿e <hi>Indians.</hi> For the Godly CounÅ¿els, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
they have had in all our ChriÅ¿tian Families, have been
of great uÅ¿e, both to prepare them for the GoÅ¿pel, and alÅ¿o to
further the Lords work in them, as you may evidently diÅ¿cern
in moÅ¿t of their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions.</p>

two firÅ¿t Petitions in that Rule and Pattern of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer

they come to paÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>Which being Å¿o, the godly ChriÅ¿tian, who Å¿hall
read or hear this enÅ¿uing Relation concerning the
workings of Gods Grace towards theÅ¿e Indians in
<hi>New-England,</hi> and the ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions of Å¿undry amongÅ¿t
them, will, I doubt not, Å¿ee abundant cauÅ¿e of
thankÅ¿giving to the Lord therein. For hereby it
will appear, That the Kingdom of the Lord JeÅ¿us
which every faithful Å¿oul, doth Å¿o much deÅ¿ire to
Å¿ee enlarged, is now beginning to be Å¿et up where it
never was before, even amongÅ¿t a poor people,
<pb facs="tcp:118441:14"/>
forlorn kind of Creatures in times paÅ¿t, who have
been without ChriÅ¿t, and without God in the world,
they and their Fathers, for I know not how many
Generations; yea, Å¿o far from knowing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
God in ChriÅ¿t, that they have been lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than the BeaÅ¿ts that periÅ¿h. But now they
that were far off, the Lord is at work to make them
neer unto himÅ¿elf by the Blood of JeÅ¿us, as <hi>Eph. 2.
13.</hi> that they which in time paÅ¿t were not a People,
might ere long become the People of God; and
they be called Beloved, which were not Beloved;
and in the place where it was Å¿aid unto them, <hi>Ye are
not my People<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </hi> that there ere long, they might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Children of the Living God,</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 10. Rom.</hi>
9. 25, 26. which is the Lords doing, and it ought to
be marvelous in our eyes. And the truth is, there
are many marvels in it; marvelous free-grace, and
riches thereof, to look upon a People Å¿o wretched
and unworthy; yea, it were marvelous Grace Å¿o
much as once to offer the Salvation of God in ChriÅ¿t
to any Å¿uch as they are, being not only the poor and
maimed, halt and blind, but alÅ¿o, as it is in <hi>Luk, 14.
21.</hi> ranging and roving in the High-waies, and Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and yet behold, even theÅ¿e are not only invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but their hearts inclined to come in. Mavelous
WiÅ¿dom and Power is in it alÅ¿o, that of matter Å¿o
rugged, and unlikely the Lord Å¿hould ever frame
and faÅ¿hion any gracious and holy building to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf,
which I hope He is now a doing. And to Å¿ay
no more, His mervelous Soveraignty and Liberty is
therein to be obÅ¿erved alÅ¿o, who till now of late
hath Å¿een meet never to look after this People, but
hath Å¿uffered them all this while to walk in their
own waies, waies of Sin, and waies of Death: yea,
<pb facs="tcp:118441:15"/>
and though there hath been Plantations of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h
in the Country now 20. years and more, yea,
Å¿ome a matter of 30. years, or thereabout, yet of all
this time (except Å¿ome little workings in a few) no
conÅ¿iderable work of Grace hath appeared amongÅ¿t
the Indians till now of late; Å¿o true is that Å¿aying,
<hi>The times and Å¿eaÅ¿ons, the Father hath put them in his own
Power, Act.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>If any Å¿hall Å¿ay, Oh but, we are doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any Å¿ound and Å¿aving work be yet wrought in
them or no: Such an one I would wiÅ¿h Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to
weigh and conÅ¿ider the enÅ¿uing ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions, and
then perhaps he will be better Å¿atisfied touching
this Point; for there he Å¿hall find many expreÅ¿Å¿ions
Å¿avoring of their clear Å¿ight and Å¿ence of Å¿in, and that
not only of groÅ¿s and external Å¿ins, but alÅ¿o of Å¿uch
as are more inward in the Heart and Soul: AlÅ¿o he
Å¿hall find expreÅ¿Å¿ions tending to Å¿hew their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s and Å¿alvation by ChriÅ¿t alone.
Now conÅ¿idering how the Work of the Spirit of
God is Å¿aid by ChriÅ¿t HimÅ¿elf to conÅ¿iÅ¿t in great part
in convincing of Å¿in, and of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s; of Å¿in in
mens Å¿elves, and of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s in ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Joh. 16.
9.</hi> And conÅ¿idering alÅ¿o, how the leaÅ¿t beginnings
of Grace are accepted of him that would not
break the bruiÅ¿ed Reed, nor quench the Å¿moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Flax, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20. And laÅ¿tly, conÅ¿idering
how it were not reaÅ¿onable to expect Å¿uch ripeneÅ¿s
in theÅ¿e people, as might be expected and found in
others, who have had more time and means, and
better help and breeding than theÅ¿e have had: If
theÅ¿e things I Å¿ay be conÅ¿idered, it may be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
to hope the beÅ¿t in charity concerning
the Work of Grace in their Souls, as Charity hopeth
<pb facs="tcp:118441:15"/>
all things, beleeveth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. But thus
much at the leaÅ¿t I conceive is cleer, and cannot be
denied that Å¿ince the Word of God hath been
taught and preached among them, the Spirit of the
Lord hath been working thereby in the hearts of
many of them Å¿uch Illumination, Å¿uch Conviction,
&amp;c. as may juÅ¿tly be looked at (if not as a full and
through ConverÅ¿ion, yet) as an hopeful beginning
and preparation thereto, if the Lord be pleaÅ¿ed to
go on with what he hath begun, as I hope he will.
And if there were no more but only an hopeful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and preparative to ConverÅ¿ion, yet even
this were matter of much comfort to the Saints, and
of thankÅ¿giving to the Lord; as it was in <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> at
the building of the Temple, when no more was yet
done, but only the foundation laid, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3. 10, 11.
yet even then they Å¿ung for joy, giving praiÅ¿e and
thankÅ¿giving to the Lord: How much more Å¿hould
it be Å¿o, if the Work of Regeneration be already
truly wrought in any of them, as I hope it is in Å¿un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry;
In Å¿uch caÅ¿e, how ever it be with men on
Earth, Å¿ure there is joy in Heaven amongÅ¿t the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of God, when there is Å¿o much as one Å¿inner
that is truly brought home to God by Repentance,
<hi>Luke</hi> 15. 7. 10.</p>
            <p>But how Å¿hall we know that the ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions here
related, being Å¿poken in their Tongue, were indeed
uttered by them in Å¿uch words, as have the Å¿ame
Å¿ignification and meaning with theÅ¿e that are here
expreÅ¿Å¿ed, for we have only the teÅ¿timony of one
man to aÅ¿Å¿ure us of it? It is true, we have only the
teÅ¿timony of one man for it; but yet it is Å¿uch an
one, as is unwillingly alone in this matter, having
Å¿eriouÅ¿ly endeavored to have had divers other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
<pb facs="tcp:118441:16"/>
preÅ¿ent at <hi>Natick</hi> that day, but could not
obtain what he did deÅ¿ire and endeavor herein; a
man whoÅ¿e pious and painful labors amongÅ¿t this
People, have rendred him approved and highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
in the eyes of his Brethren about him, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
diligence, and earneÅ¿t love to the Lord
JeÅ¿us, and their poor Å¿ouls; a man whoÅ¿e integrity
and faithfulneÅ¿s is Å¿o well known in theÅ¿e Parts, as
giveth Å¿ufficient Å¿atisfaction to beleev that he would
not wittingly utter a falÅ¿hood in any matter whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and much leÅ¿s Å¿o many falÅ¿hoods, &amp; that in Å¿uch
a publick manner, in the view of God &amp; the World,
as he muÅ¿t needs have done if he have coyned theÅ¿e
ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions of his own head, and have not to his beÅ¿t
underÅ¿tanding truly related them in our Tongue,
according as they were uttered by them in theirs.</p>
            <p>If any Å¿hall then aÅ¿k, If there be Å¿uch a Work of
God amongÅ¿t them, Why were they not combined
and united into Church-EÅ¿tate, when there was that
great AÅ¿Å¿embly at <hi>Natick,</hi> on the thirteenth of <hi>Octob.</hi>
laÅ¿t? Such an one may do well to conÅ¿ider, that the
material Temple was many yeers in building, even
in the daies of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who wanted no helps and
furtherances thereunto, but was abundantly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed
therewith, and longer in Re-edifying after the
Captivity; and therefore no marvel if the building
of a Spiritual Temple, an holy Church to ChriÅ¿t, and
a Church out of Å¿uch rubbiÅ¿h as amongÅ¿t Indians, be
not begun and ended on a Å¿udden; It is rather to be
wondered at, that in Å¿o Å¿hort a time, the thing is in
Å¿o much forwardneÅ¿s as it is. BeÅ¿ides, It is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
matter to have Indians accepted and owned as a
Church amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, and Å¿o to be inveÅ¿ted
with all Church-power as a Church, when yet they
<pb facs="tcp:118441:16"/>
are not furniÅ¿hed with any to be an able PaÅ¿tor and
Elder over them, by whom they might be directed
and guided in all the Affairs of the Church, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿trations
of the HouÅ¿e of God: this I conceive
is a far greater matter than the admitting of them as
Members into any Church or Churches of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h
already Å¿o furniÅ¿hed; which latter (for ought I
know) might Å¿peedily be done, and with much Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
if it were Å¿uitable in regard of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Language, and the remoteneÅ¿s of their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
whereas to the former there Å¿eems to be a
great neceÅ¿Å¿ity, or expediency at the leaÅ¿t, that they
Å¿hould firÅ¿t be provided of Å¿ome to be afterward Å¿et
over them in the Lord. Even amongÅ¿t the EngliÅ¿h,
when any company amongÅ¿t us have united them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves
into Church-EÅ¿tate, it hath been uÅ¿ual that
they have had one or other amongÅ¿t them upon
whom their eyes have been Å¿et, as intending them to
be PaÅ¿tors or Teachers to them; afterward, when
once they Å¿hould be combined as a Church, and
where it hath Å¿o been, they have found the comfort
and benefit of it; whereas thoÅ¿e few that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
otherwiÅ¿e, have found trouble and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
therein. And if it be Å¿o amongÅ¿t the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h,
who uÅ¿ually have better abilities, how much
more amongÅ¿t the Indians, whoÅ¿e knowledg and
parts muÅ¿t needs be far leÅ¿s? Not to inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon the
RehearÅ¿al of thoÅ¿e two ReaÅ¿ons mentioned by the
Reverend Author of this Relation, <hi>viz.</hi> The Å¿hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s
of the time to furniÅ¿h the Work that day, and
the want of Interpreters, of whom there was not
any preÅ¿ent himÅ¿elf. Concerning which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons,
I can freely ad my teÅ¿timony, that thoÅ¿e two
were the principal, if not the only ReaÅ¿ons which
<pb facs="tcp:118441:17"/>
that day were inÅ¿iÅ¿ted on, and publickly rendred for
deferring the Inchurching of them to another
time.</p>
            <p>It may be Å¿ome have thought, and I hear Å¿ome
have Å¿poken little leÅ¿s, That this whol buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of
the Indians, of which there have been Å¿o many
Å¿peeches in Old <hi>England</hi> and New, is but a deviÅ¿e
and deÅ¿ign to get money, and that there is indeed
no Å¿uch matter as any Work of Gods grace amongÅ¿t
that People. But if there were any truth in this
Å¿aying or SurmiÅ¿e, I marvel why the MagiÅ¿trates
and Elders then preÅ¿ent at <hi>Natick,</hi> did upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons
rendred, adviÅ¿e the deferring of the inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Indians that day, and why they did not
rather haÅ¿ten forward the Work without any more
ado, or longer delay. For the report of a Church
of Indians would in all likelihood have more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
for the end alledged, than all that hath been
reported hitherto But our attending in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s
to the Honor of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and the good of this
poor peoples Å¿ouls, and Å¿o to that which Rule and
right ReaÅ¿on required, rather than to what might
Å¿eem conducible for wordly advantage, may be a
Å¿ufficient witneÅ¿s of our Å¿incerity, contrary to the
conceit and Å¿urmiÅ¿e afore mentioned, and a Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
confutation of it. And yet though they be not
combined into Church-EÅ¿tate, there is Å¿o much of
Gods Work amongÅ¿t them, as that I cannot but
count it a great evil, yea, a great injury to God and
his goodneÅ¿s for any to make light or nothing of it.
To Å¿ee and to hear Indians opening their mouths,
and lifting up their hands and their eyes in Å¿olemn
Prayer to the Living God, calling on him by his
Name JEHOVAH, in the Mediation of JeÅ¿us
<pb facs="tcp:118441:17"/>
ChriÅ¿t, and this for a good while together; to Å¿ee
and hear them exhorting one another from the
Word of God; to Å¿ee them and hear them confeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing
the Name of ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, and their own Å¿inful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s,
Å¿ure this is more than uÅ¿ual. And though they
Å¿pake in a language, of which many of us underÅ¿tood
but little, yet we that were preÅ¿ent that day, we
Å¿aw them, and we heard them perform the duties
mentioned, with Å¿uch grave and Å¿ober countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
with Å¿uch comely reverence in geÅ¿ture, and
their whol carriage, and with Å¿uch plenty of tears
trickling down the cheeks of Å¿ome of them, as did
argue to us that they Å¿pake with much good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and holy fear of God, and it much affected
our hearts. Nor is it credible to me, nor for ought
I know to any that was preÅ¿ent that day, that in
theÅ¿e things they were acted and led by that Spirit
which is wont to breath amongÅ¿t Indians, the Spirit
of Satan, or of corrupt Nature, but that herein they
had with them another Spirit.</p>
            <p>But if there be any work of Grace amongÅ¿t them,
it would Å¿urely bring forth, and be accompanied
with the Reformation of their diÅ¿ordered lives, as
in other things, Å¿o in their neglect of Labor, and their
living in idleneÅ¿s and pleaÅ¿ure. I confeÅ¿s the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is weighty, and I deny not but Å¿ome Å¿ober
and godly perÅ¿ons, who do heartily wiÅ¿h well to this
work, have been as much troubled in their minds
touching this particular as any that I know of. But
yet Å¿omthing may be Å¿aid in anÅ¿wer therto, &amp; chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, That Å¿ince the Word of God came amongÅ¿t
them, and that they have attended thereto, they
have more applied themÅ¿elves unto Labor than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly:
For evidence whereof, appeal my be made
<pb facs="tcp:118441:18"/>
to what was Å¿een at <hi>Natick</hi> that day, and is Å¿till to be
Å¿een in that place, I mean the Grounds that they
have fenced in, and clawed and broken up, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pecially
their capacious Meeting-houÅ¿e, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menÅ¿ions
whereof are expreÅ¿Å¿ed in the Relation:
little did I think when I Å¿aw that Fabrick, but that
Å¿ome EngliÅ¿h Carpenter or other had had the chief
hand in the framing and erecting of it; and that
more hands than Indians, yea, and more EngliÅ¿h than
one had been employed about it. But now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding
that the Indians alone were the Builders of
it, it is a good teÅ¿timony to me both of their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿try,
and likewiÅ¿e of their Skill; for where theÅ¿e
are utterly wanting, yea, where there is not Å¿ome
good meaÅ¿ure of them, Å¿uch a Building I conceive
could never be raiÅ¿ed. It is true, that conÅ¿idering
the manner of their bringing up, being little accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tomed
to labor, but the contrary, it is not much to
be marveled if they be not comparable therein to
Å¿ome EngliÅ¿h, who from their Child-hood have
been trained up thereto; yet we Å¿ee they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to it, and I hope will fall to it more and more;
let all that love their Å¿ouls, pray for them that they
may, yea, let all that love the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t
pray for them, that the Work of God may Å¿till proÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
amongÅ¿t them, that many more of them may be
turned from darkneÅ¿s to light, and from the power
of Satan unto God; and that being converted they
may be preÅ¿erved in ChriÅ¿t, and be built up in him
to further growth and perfection, from day to day.
And let unfeigned thankÅ¿giving be rendred to the
Lord by his Saints for all that is already wrought
amongÅ¿t them: And Oh, let the EngliÅ¿h take heed,
both in our dear Native Country, and here, leÅ¿t for
<pb facs="tcp:118441:18"/>
our unthankfulneÅ¿s, and many other Å¿ins, the Lord
Å¿hould take the GoÅ¿pel from us, and beÅ¿tow our
mercy therein upon them, as upon a Nation that
would yeeld the fruits thereof in better Å¿ort than
many of us have done. The Å¿ins of the JewiÅ¿h Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to whom the GoÅ¿pel was firÅ¿t preached, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
God to take his Kingdom from them, and to
call in the Gentils: yet it appeareth by <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11.
14. 31. that this mercy vouchÅ¿afed to the Gentiles,
Å¿hall in time provoke the Jews to an holy JealouÅ¿ie,
and Emulation, to look after that mercy again that
once they refuÅ¿ed, that Å¿o through the mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿towed
on the Gentiles, they (I mean the Jews)
might at laÅ¿t again obtain mercy. Happy were the
EngliÅ¿h if we could yeeld the fruits of Gods GoÅ¿pel,
that it might not be taken from us; and happy alÅ¿o
if the mercy coming to theÅ¿e Indians (though not
yet taken from us) might provoke us Å¿o to do, that
Å¿o the Kingdom of God, the GoÅ¿pel of Salvation,
being not taken from us, and given to them, but
though given to them, yet might Å¿till continue with
us, and with our PoÅ¿terity from Generation to
Generation.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HeÅ¿e <hi>Indians</hi> (the better and wiÅ¿er Å¿ort of
them) have for Å¿ome years inquired after
Church-EÅ¿tate, BaptiÅ¿m, and the reÅ¿t of
the Ordinances of God, in the obÅ¿ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof they Å¿ee the Godly EngliÅ¿h to
walk. I have from time to time, delayed
them upon this point, That until they
were come up unto Civil Cohabitation, Government, and
Labor, which a fixed condition of life will put them upon,
they were not Å¿o capable to be betruÅ¿ted with that TreaÅ¿ure
of ChriÅ¿t, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould Å¿candalize the Å¿ame, and make it of
none effect, becauÅ¿e if any Å¿hould through temptation fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
CenÅ¿ure, he could eaÅ¿ily run away (as Å¿ome have done)
and would be tempted Å¿o to do, unleÅ¿s he were fixed in an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
and had Å¿ome means of livelihood to loÅ¿e, and leave
behind him: Å¿uch ReaÅ¿ons have Å¿atisfied them hitherunto.
But now being come under Civil Order, and fixing themÅ¿elves
in Habitations, and bending themÅ¿elves to labor, as doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by their works of Fencings, Buildings &amp;c. and eÅ¿pecially
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118441:20"/>
in building, without any EngliÅ¿h Workmans help, or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a very Å¿ufficient Meeting-HouÅ¿e, of fifty foot long twenty
five foot broad, neer twelve foot high betwixt the joynts, wel
Å¿awen, and framed (which is a Å¿pecimen, not only of their Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
ingenuity, and dexerity, but alÅ¿o of Å¿ome induÅ¿try) I
Å¿ay this being Å¿o, now my argument of delaying them from
entering into Church-EÅ¿tate, was taken away. Therefore in
way of preparation of them thereunto, I did this Summer call
forth Å¿undry of them in the dayes of our publick AÅ¿Å¿emblies
in Gods WorÅ¿hip; Å¿omtimes on the Sabbath when I could be
with them, and Å¿ometimes on Lecture daies, to make confeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before the Lord of their former Å¿ins, and of their preÅ¿ent
knowledg of ChriÅ¿t, and experience of his Grace; which they
Å¿olemnly doing, I wrote down their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions: which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done, and being in my own heart hopeful that there was
among them fit matter for a Church, I did requeÅ¿t all the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
about us to hear them reade, that Å¿o they might give me
advice what to do in this great, and Å¿olemn buÅ¿ineÅ¿s; which
being done on a day appointed for the purpoÅ¿e, it pleaÅ¿ed
God to give their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions Å¿uch acceptance in their hearts,
as that they Å¿aw nothing to hinder their proceeding, to try
how the Lord would appear therein. Whereupon, after a
day of FaÅ¿ting and Prayer among our Å¿elves, to Å¿eek the Lord
in that behalf, there was another day of FaÅ¿ting and Prayer
appointed, and publick notice thereof, and of the names of
Indians were to confeÅ¿s, and enter into Covenant that day,
was given to all the Churches about us, to Å¿eek the Lord yet
further herein, and to make Å¿olemn ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions of ChriÅ¿t his
Truth and Grace, and further to try whether the Lord
would vouchÅ¿afe Å¿uch grace unto them, as to give them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
among the Saints, into the fellowÅ¿hip of Church-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate,
and enjoyment of thoÅ¿e Ordinances which the Lord
hath betruÅ¿ted his Churches withal. That day was the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of the eighth month.</p>
            <p>When the AÅ¿Å¿embly was met, the firÅ¿t part of the day was
Å¿pent in Prayer unto God, and exerciÅ¿e in the Word of God;
in which, my Å¿elf firÅ¿t; and after that, two of the Indians did
ExerciÅ¿e; and Å¿o the time was Å¿pent till after ten, or near ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118441:20"/>
of the clock. Then addreÅ¿Å¿ing our Å¿elves unto the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
work of the day, I firÅ¿t requeÅ¿ted the reverend Elders
(many being preÅ¿ent) that they would ask them QueÅ¿tions
touching the fundamental Points of Religion, that thereby
they might have Å¿ome tryal of their knowledg, and better
that way, than if themÅ¿elves Å¿hould of themÅ¿elves declare
what they beleeve, or than if I Å¿hould ask them QueÅ¿tions in
theÅ¿e matters: After a little conference hereabout, it was
concluded, That they Å¿hould firÅ¿t make confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their
experience in the Lords Work upon their hearts, becauÅ¿e in
Å¿o doing, it is like Å¿omething will be diÅ¿cerned of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
in the Doctrines of Religion: and if after thoÅ¿e ConfeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions
there Å¿hould yet be cauÅ¿e to inquire further touching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Point of Religion it might be fitly done at laÅ¿t. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we Å¿o proceeded, and called them forth in order to
make confeÅ¿Å¿ion. It was moved in the AÅ¿Å¿embly by Reverend
Mr. <hi>WilÅ¿on,</hi> that their former ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions alÅ¿o, as well as theÅ¿e
which they made at preÅ¿ent, might be read unto the AÅ¿Å¿embly,
becauÅ¿e it was evident that they were daunted much to Å¿peak
before Å¿o great and grave an AÅ¿Å¿embly as that was, but time
did not permit it Å¿o to be then: yet now in my writing of
their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions I will take that courÅ¿e, that Å¿o it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
what encouragement there was to proceed Å¿o far as we
did; and that Å¿uch as may reade theÅ¿e their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions, may
the better diÅ¿cern of the reality of the Grace of ChriÅ¿t in
them.</p>

               <head>The firÅ¿t which was called forth is named <hi>Tother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wamp,</hi>
whoÅ¿e former ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion read before
the Elders, was as followeth:</head>
               <p>BEfore I prayed unto God, the EngliÅ¿h, when I came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their houÅ¿es, often Å¿aid unto me, Pray to God; but I
having many friends who loved me, and I loved them, and
they cared not for praying to God, and therefore I did not:
But I thought in my heart, that if my friends Å¿hould die, and
I live, I then would pray to God; Å¿oon after, God Å¿o
wrought, that they did almoÅ¿t all die, few of them left; and
then my heart feared, and I thought, that now I will pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and yet I was aÅ¿hamed to pray; and if I eat and did
not pray, I was aÅ¿hamed of that alÅ¿o; Å¿o that I had a double
Å¿hame upon me: Then you came unto us, and taught us, and
Å¿aid unto us, <hi>Pray unto God;</hi> and after that, my heart grew
Å¿trong, and I was no more aÅ¿hamed to pray, but I did take
up praying to God; yet at firÅ¿t I did not think of God, and
eternal Life, but only that the EngliÅ¿h Å¿hould love me, and I
loved them: But after I came to learn what Å¿in was, by
the Commandements of God, and then I Å¿aw all my Å¿ins, luÅ¿t,
gaming, &amp;c. (he named more.) You taught, That ChriÅ¿t
knoweth all our hearts, and Å¿eeth what is in them, if humility,
or anger, or evil thoughts, ChriÅ¿t Å¿eeth all that is in the
heart; then my heart feared greatly, becauÅ¿e God was angry
for all my Å¿ins; yea, now my heart is full of evil thoughts,
and my heart runs away from God, therefore my heart fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and mourneth. Every day I Å¿ee Å¿in in my heart; one
man brought Å¿in into the World, and I am full of that Å¿in, and
I break Gods Word every day. I Å¿ee I deÅ¿erve not pardon,
for the firÅ¿t mans Å¿inning; I can do no good, for I am like the
Devil, nothing but evil thoughts, and words, and works. I
have loÅ¿t all likeneÅ¿s to God, and goodneÅ¿s, and therefore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118441:21"/>
every day I Å¿in againÅ¿t God, and I deÅ¿erve death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The firÅ¿t man brought Å¿in firÅ¿t, and I do every day ad
to that Å¿in, more Å¿ins; but ChriÅ¿t hath done for us all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s,
and died for us becauÅ¿e of our Å¿ins, and ChriÅ¿t tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
us, That if we caÅ¿t away our Å¿ins, and truÅ¿t in ChriÅ¿t,
then God will pardon all our Å¿ins; this I beleeve ChriÅ¿t hath
done, I can do no righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, but ChriÅ¿t hath done it for
me; this I beleeve, and therefore I do hope for pardon.
When I firÅ¿t heard the Commandements, I then took up
praying to God, and caÅ¿t off Å¿in. Again, When I heard,
and underÅ¿tood Redemption by ChriÅ¿t, then I beleeved JeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t to take away my Å¿ins: every Commandement taught
me Å¿in, and my duty to God. When you ask me, Why do I
love God? I anÅ¿wer, BecauÅ¿e he giveth me all outward bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ings,
as food, clothing, children, all gifts of Å¿trength, Å¿peech,
hearing; eÅ¿pecially that he giveth us a MiniÅ¿ter to teach us,
and giveth us Government; and my heart feareth leÅ¿t Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
Å¿hould reprove me: but the greateÅ¿t mercy of all is
ChriÅ¿t, to give us pardon and life.</p>

The ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion which he made on the FaÅ¿t
day before the great AÅ¿Å¿embly, was as
followeth:</head>
               <p>I ConfeÅ¿s in the preÅ¿ence of the Lord, before I prayed, many
were my Å¿ins, not one good word did I Å¿peak, not one good
thought did I think, not one good action did I doe: I did act
all Å¿ins, and full was my heart of evil thoughts: when the
EngliÅ¿h did tell me of God, I cared not for it. I thought it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
if they loved me: I had many friends that loved me, and
I thought if they died, I would pray to God: and afterward it
Å¿o came to paÅ¿s; then was my heart aÅ¿hamed, to pray I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hamed,
&amp; if I prayed not, I was aÅ¿hamed; a double Å¿hame was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118441:22"/>
upon me: when God by you taught us, very much aÅ¿hamed
was my heart; then you taught us that ChriÅ¿t knoweth all
our harts: therefore truly he Å¿aw my thoughts, and I had
thought, if my kindred Å¿hould die I would pray to God; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they dying, I muÅ¿t now pray to God: and therefore my
heart feared, for I thought ChriÅ¿t knew my thoughts: then I
heard you teach, <hi>The firÅ¿t man God made was named</hi> Adam, <hi>&amp; God
made a Covenant with him, Do and live, thou and thy Children;
if thou do not thou muÅ¿t die, thou and thy Children;</hi> And we are
Children of <hi>Adam</hi> poor Å¿inners, therefore we all have Å¿inned,
for we have broke Gods Covenant, therefore evil is my heart
therefore God is very angry with me, we Å¿in againÅ¿t him every
day; but this great mercy God hath given us, he hath
given us his only Son, and promiÅ¿eth, That whoÅ¿oever belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall be Å¿aved: for ChriÅ¿t hath dyed for us in
our Å¿tead, for our Å¿ins, and he hath done for us all the words
of God, for I can do no good act, only ChriÅ¿t can, and only
ChriÅ¿t hath done all for us; ChriÅ¿t have deÅ¿erved Pardon for
us, and riÅ¿en again, he hath aÅ¿cended to God, and doth ever
pray for us; therefore all Beleevers Souls Å¿hall goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to ChriÅ¿t. But when I heard that word of ChriÅ¿t, ChriÅ¿t
Å¿aid <hi>Repent and Beleeve,</hi> and ChriÅ¿t Å¿eeth <hi>who Repenteth,</hi> then I
Å¿aid, dark and weak is my Soul, and I am one in darkneÅ¿s, I am
a very Å¿inful man, and now I pray to ChriÅ¿t for life. Hearing
you teach that Word that the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees Å¿aid
<hi>Why do thy DiÅ¿ciples break the Tradition of the Fathers?</hi> ChriÅ¿t
anÅ¿wered, <hi>Why do ye make void the Commandements of God?</hi>
Then my heart feared that I do Å¿o, when I teach the Indians,
becauÅ¿e I cannot teach them right, and thereby make the
word of God vain. Again, ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid <hi>If the blind lead the
blind they will both fall into the ditch;</hi> Therfore I feared that I
am one blind, and when I teach other Indians I Å¿hal cauÅ¿ them
to fall into the ditch. This is the love of God to me, that he
giveth me all mercy in this world, and for them al I am thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
but I confeÅ¿s I deÅ¿erve Hell; I cannot deliver my Å¿elf, but I
give my Soul and my FleÅ¿h to ChriÅ¿t and I truÅ¿t my Å¿oul with
him for he is my Redeemer, and I deÅ¿ire to call upon him
while I live.</p>

This was his ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion which ended, Mr. <hi>Allin</hi> further
demanded of him this QueÅ¿tion, How he found his

               <p>His anÅ¿wer was; I am aÅ¿hamed of all my Å¿ins, my heart is

               <p>BEfore I heard of God, and before the EngliÅ¿h came into
this Country, many evil things my heart did work,
many thoughts I had in my heart; I wiÅ¿hed for riches, I
wiÅ¿hed to be a witch, I wiÅ¿hed to be a Sachem; and many Å¿uch
other evils were in my heart: Then when the EngliÅ¿h came,
Å¿till my heart did the Å¿ame things; when the EngliÅ¿h taught
me of God (I coming to their HouÅ¿es) I would go out of their
doors, and many years I knew nothing; when the EngliÅ¿h
taught me I was angry with them: But a little while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
after the great Å¿ikneÅ¿s, I conÅ¿idered what the EngliÅ¿h
do, and I had Å¿ome deÅ¿ire to do as they do; and after that I
began to work as they work; and then I wondered how the
EngliÅ¿h come to be Å¿o Å¿trong to labor; then I thought I Å¿hall
quickly die, and I feared leÅ¿t I Å¿hould die before I prayed to
God; then I thought, if I prayed to God in our Language,
whether could God underÅ¿tand my prayers in our Language;
therefore I did ask Mr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mahu,</hi> If God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood
prayers in our Language? They anÅ¿wered me, God
doth underÅ¿tand all Languages in the World. But I do not

know how to confeÅ¿s, and little do I know of ChriÅ¿t; I fear
I Å¿hall not beleeve a great while, and very Å¿lowly; I do not
know what grace is in my heart, there is but little good in
me; but this I know, That ChriÅ¿t hath kept all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
for us, and that ChriÅ¿t doth know all our hearts;
and now I deÅ¿ire to repent of all my Å¿ins: I neither have done,
nor can do the Commandements of the Lord, but I am aÅ¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of all I do, and I do repent of all my Å¿ins, even of all that
I do know of: I deÅ¿ire that I may be converted from all my
Å¿ins, and that I might beleeve in ChriÅ¿t, and I deÅ¿ire him; I
diÅ¿like my Å¿ins, yet I do not truly pray to God in my heart:
no matter for good words, all is the true heart; and this day
I do not Å¿o much deÅ¿ire good words, as throughly to open my
heart: I confeÅ¿s I can do nothing, but deÅ¿erve damnation;
only ChriÅ¿t can help me and do for me. But I have nothing
to Å¿ay for my Å¿elf that is good; I judg that I am a Å¿inner, and

ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion read before the Elders, was as
followeth:</head>
               <p>I ConfeÅ¿s that before I prayed, I committed all manner of
Å¿ins, and Å¿erved many gods: when the EngliÅ¿h came firÅ¿t,
I going to their HouÅ¿es, they Å¿pake to me of your God, but
when I heard of God, my heart hated it; but when they Å¿aid
the Devil was my god, I was angry, becauÅ¿e I was proud:
when I came to their houÅ¿es I hated to hear of God, I loved
luÅ¿t in my own houÅ¿e and not God, I loved to pray to many
gods. Five years ago, I going to EngliÅ¿h houÅ¿es, and they
Å¿peaking of God, I did a little like of it, yet when I went again
to my own houÅ¿e, I did all manner of Å¿ins, and in my heart I
did act all Å¿ins, though I would not be Å¿een by man. Then
going to your houÅ¿e, I more desired to hear of God; and my
heart Å¿aid, I will pray to God Å¿o long as I live: then I went to
the MiniÅ¿ter Mr. <hi>Browns</hi> houÅ¿e, and told him I would pray as
long as I lived; but he Å¿aid I did not Å¿ay it from my heart, and
I beleeve it. When <hi>Wahan</hi> Å¿pake to me that I Å¿hould pray to
God, I did Å¿o. But I had greatly Å¿inned againÅ¿t God, and had
not beleeved the Word, but was proud: but then I was angry
with my Å¿elf, and loathed my Å¿elf, and thought God will not
forgive me my sins. For when I had been abroad in the woods
I would be very angry, and would lye unto men, and I could
not find the way how to be a good man: then I beleeved your
teaching, That when good men die, the Angels carry their
Å¿ouls to God; but evil men dying, they go to Hell, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h
for ever. I thought this a true Å¿aying, and I promiÅ¿ed
to God, to pray to God as long as I live. I had a little grief
in my heart five years ago for my sins: but many were my

as mine is: I beleeve that ChriÅ¿t would have me to forÅ¿ake my
anger; I beleeve that ChriÅ¿t hath redeemed us, and I am
glad to hear thoÅ¿e words of God; and I deÅ¿ire that I might
do al the good waies of God, and that I might truly pray
unto God: I do now want Graces, and theÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t only
teacheth us, and only ChriÅ¿t hath wrought our redemption,
and he procureth our pardon for all our sins; and I beleeve
that when beleevers dy, Gods Angels carry them to Heaven:
but I want faith to beleeve the Word of God, and to open my
Eyes, and to help me to caÅ¿t away all sins; and ChriÅ¿t hath
deÅ¿erved for me eternall life: I have deÅ¿erved nothing my
Å¿elf; ChriÅ¿t hath deÅ¿erved all, and giveth me faith to beleeve
it.</p>

                  <hi>Willam</hi> of <hi>Sudbury</hi>:
His Indian Name is
<hi>NATAÃUS.</hi>
The ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion which he made on the faÅ¿t day before
the great AÅ¿Å¿embly was as followeth.</head>
               <p>BEfore I prayed to God, I commited all sins; and Å¿erving
many gods. I much deÅ¿piÅ¿ed praying unto God, for
I beleeved the Devil, and he did dayly teach me to sin, and I
did them: Å¿omtimes hearing of God my heart did hate it, and
went to my own houÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e I did love to commit all sin
there. About Six years ago, a little I liked to hear of God,
and yet I hated that which was good: hearing that <hi>CutÅ¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moquin</hi>
prayed, then I thought I will pray alÅ¿o: a year after,
I heard of praying to God, and I went to Mr. <hi>Browns</hi> houÅ¿e
and told him I will pray to God as long as live; he Å¿aid, I
doubt of it, and bid me cut off my hair, and I did Å¿o preÅ¿ently;
and then I desired to be like God, and JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and to call
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118441:24"/>
on him, but I found it very hard to beleeve; yet I thought, I
wil pray as long as I live. Hearing that Word, That ChriÅ¿t dyed
for us, was buried &amp; roÅ¿e again, and hearing of that Word alÅ¿o,
Seek peace &amp; imbrace the Word: then I began to beleeve that
ChriÅ¿t died for us, for sin; and I Å¿aw my heart very full of sin.
And hearing that word, That ChriÅ¿t went to the Mount <hi>Olives,</hi>
and aÅ¿cended, I beleeved and thought, Oh that God would
pardon me; but I fear he will not, becauÅ¿e I have been Å¿o long
time a sinner. Somtime I am angry with my Å¿elf, for my
many Evil thoughts in my heart; and to this day I want grace,
and cannot confeÅ¿s, becauÅ¿e I have been Å¿o great a sinner: and
this day I confeÅ¿s, a little I pray, and that I can pray but a little
and weakly. When I heard that word of God, That all from
the rising to the Å¿etting Sun Å¿hall pray I firÅ¿t under Å¿tood it
it not, and wondered how it Å¿hould be: after I Å¿aw that
when they beleeve and obey God, then he will teach them
to do right things, and God will teach us to do al things
for God, Å¿leeping and waking to be with God. But
Å¿till do fooliÅ¿hly, and not according to my prayer: I cannot
get pardon of my sins, for my sins are great in thought,
word, and deed: and no man can caÅ¿t off his own sins, but
that is the work of ChriÅ¿t only to work it in us; a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make a right prayer but when ChriÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿teth him; then
we Å¿hall do all things well. I beleeve that ChriÅ¿t is God, and
the Son of God becauÅ¿e when he dyed, he roÅ¿e again, and he
dyed for our Å¿ins; and I beleeve he is in Heaven and ever pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for us, and Å¿endeth his goÅ¿pel unto us: and I am angry with
my Å¿elf, becauÅ¿e I do not beleeve the word of God, and goÅ¿pel
of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</p>

ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, read before the Elders, was as
followeth.</head>
               <p>I ConfeÅ¿s my Å¿orrow for all my Å¿ins againÅ¿t God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men: When I firÅ¿t heard inÅ¿truction, I beleeved not,
but laughed at it, and Å¿corned praying to God; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when we were taught at <hi>Cohannet</hi> (that is the place
where he lived) I Å¿till hated praying, and I did think of
running away, becauÅ¿e I cared not for praying to God; but
afterwards, becauÅ¿e I loved to dwell at that place, I would
not leave the place, and therefore I thought I will pray to
God, becauÅ¿e I would Å¿till Å¿tay at that place, therefore I
prayed not for the love of God, but for love of the place
I lived in; after that I deÅ¿ired a little to learn the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿me
on the Lecture daies, and I did learn the ten
Commandements, and after that, all the points in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿me;
yet afterwards I caÅ¿t them all away again, then
was my heart filled with folly, and my Å¿ins great Å¿ins; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by hearing, I began to fear, becauÅ¿e of my
many Å¿ins, leÅ¿t the wiÅ¿e men Å¿hould come to know them,
and puniÅ¿h me for them; and then again I thought of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away becauÅ¿e of my many Å¿ins: But after that I thought
I would pray rightly to God, and caÅ¿t away my Å¿ins; then
I Å¿aw my hypocricy, becauÅ¿e I did ask Å¿ome queÅ¿tions,
but did not do that which I knew: afterward I conÅ¿idered
of my queÅ¿tion, and thought I would pray to God, and
would consider of Å¿ome other QueÅ¿tion, and I asked this,
QueÅ¿tion, <hi>How Å¿hould I get WiÅ¿dom?</hi> and the AnÅ¿wer to it
did a little turn my heart from sin, to Å¿eek after God; and I
then considered that the Word of God was good; then I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118441:25"/>
to God becauÅ¿e of the Word of God. The next Lecture day
you taught that word of God, <hi>If any man lack WiÅ¿dom, let
him ask it of God, who giveth freely to them that ask him, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth
no man, James,</hi> 1. 5. Then again a little my heart was
turned after God, the Word alÅ¿o Å¿aid, <hi>Repent, mourn, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t:</hi> this alÅ¿o helped me on. Then you
taught, <hi>That he that beleeveth not ChriÅ¿t, and repenteth not of
Å¿in, they are fooliÅ¿h and wicked; and becauÅ¿e they beleeve not, they
Å¿hall periÅ¿h:</hi> then I thought my Å¿elf a fool, becauÅ¿e I beleeved
not ChriÅ¿t, but Å¿inned every day, and after I heard the Word,
I greatly broke the Word. But afterward I heard this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e
of God, <hi>Who ever repenteth and beleeveth in ChriÅ¿t, God
will forgive him all his Å¿ins, he Å¿hall not periÅ¿h;</hi> then I thought,
that as yet, I do not repent, and beleeve in ChriÅ¿t: then I
prayed to God, becauÅ¿e of this his PromiÅ¿e; and then I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to God, for God and for ChriÅ¿t his Å¿ake: after that again
I did a little break the Word of ChriÅ¿t. And then I heard
Å¿ome other words of God, which Å¿hewed me my Å¿ins, and my
breakings of Gods word; and Å¿ometimes I thought God and
ChriÅ¿t would forgive me, becauÅ¿e of the promiÅ¿e to them
that beleeve in ChriÅ¿t, and repent of Å¿in, I thought I did that
which God Å¿pake in the PromiÅ¿e. Then being called to confeÅ¿s,
to prepare to make a Church at <hi>Natick,</hi> I loved <hi>Cohannet;</hi>
but after hearing this inÅ¿truction, <hi>That we Å¿hould not only be
Hearers, but Doers of the Word,</hi> then my heart did fear. And
afterward hearing that in <hi>Matthew,</hi> ChriÅ¿t Å¿aw two brethren
mending their Nets, he Å¿aid, <hi>Follow me and I will make you
FiÅ¿hers of men,</hi> preÅ¿ently they followed ChriÅ¿t; and when I
heard this, I feared, becauÅ¿e I was not willing to follow ChriÅ¿t
to <hi>Natick;</hi> they followed ChriÅ¿t at his Word, but I did not,
for now ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith to us, <hi>follow Me:</hi> then I was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and conÅ¿idered of this Word of God. Afterward I
heard another word, the blind men cryed after ChriÅ¿t and
Å¿aid, <hi>Have mercy on us thou Son of David,</hi> but after they came
to ChriÅ¿t, he called them, and asked them, <hi>What Å¿hall I do for
you?</hi> they Å¿aid, <hi>Lord open our eyes;</hi> then ChriÅ¿t had pity on
them, and opened their eyes, and they followed ChriÅ¿t;
when I heard this, my heart was troubled, then I prayed to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118441:26"/>
God and ChriÅ¿t, to open mine eyes, and if ChriÅ¿t open my
eyes, then I Å¿hall rejoyce to follow ChriÅ¿t: then I conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of both theÅ¿e Scriptures, and I a little Å¿aw that I muÅ¿t fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ChriÅ¿t. And now my heart deÅ¿ireth to make confeÅ¿Å¿ion
of what I know of God, and of my Å¿elf, and of ChriÅ¿t: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that there is only one God, and that he made and ruleth
all the World, and that he the Lord, giveth us al good things:
I know that God giveth every day all good mercies, life, and
health, and all; I have not one good thing, but God it is that
giveth it me, I beleeve that God at firÅ¿t made man like God,
holy, wiÅ¿e, righteous; but the firÅ¿t man Å¿inned, for God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿ed
him, <hi>If thou do my Commandements, thou Å¿halt live, and
thy children; but if thou Å¿in, thou Å¿halt die, thou and thy children;</hi>
this Covenant God made with the firÅ¿t man. But the firÅ¿t
man did not do the Commandements of God, he did break
Gods Word, he beleeved Satan; and now I am full of Å¿in,
becauÅ¿e the firÅ¿t man brought Å¿in; dayly I am full of Å¿in in my
heart: I do not dayly rejoyce in Repentance, becauÅ¿e Satan
worketh dayly in my heart, and oppoÅ¿eth Repentance, and
all good Works; day and night my heart is full of Å¿in. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> God
promiÅ¿ed her Å¿he Å¿hould bear a Son, and his Name Å¿hould be
JESUS, becauÅ¿e he Å¿hall deliver his people from their Å¿ins:
And when ChriÅ¿t came to preach, he Å¿aid, <hi>Repent, becauÅ¿e the
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> again ChriÅ¿t taught, <hi>Except ye
repent and become as a little child, ye Å¿hall not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven;</hi> therefore humble your Å¿elves like one of
theÅ¿e little children, and great Å¿hall be your Kingdom in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Again ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and
heavy laden with Å¿in, and I will give you reÅ¿t: take up my CroÅ¿s,
and Yoak, learn of me, for I am meek, and ye Å¿hall find reÅ¿t to
your Å¿ouls, for my yoak is eaÅ¿ie, and burden light:</hi> theÅ¿e are the
Words of ChriÅ¿t, and I know ChriÅ¿t he is good, but my works
are evil: ChriÅ¿t his words are good, but I am not humble;
but if we be humble and beleeving in ChriÅ¿t, he pardons all
our Å¿ins. I now deÅ¿ire to beleeve in JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e of
the word of ChriÅ¿t, that I may be converted and become as a
little Child. I confeÅ¿s my Å¿ins before God, and before JeÅ¿us
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118441:26"/>
ChriÅ¿t this day; now I deÅ¿ire all my Å¿ins may be pardoned;
I now desire repentance in my heart, and ever to beleeve in
ChriÅ¿t; now I lift up my heart to ChriÅ¿t, and truÅ¿t him with
it, becauÅ¿e I beleeve ChriÅ¿t died for us, for all our Å¿ins, and
deÅ¿erved for us eternal life in Heaven, and deÅ¿erved pardon
for all our Å¿ins. And now I give my Å¿oul to ChriÅ¿t becauÅ¿e he
hath redeemed: I do greatly love, and like repentance in my
heart, and I love to beleeve in JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and my heart is
broken by repentance: al theÅ¿e things I do like wel of, that they
may be in my heart, but becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t hath all theÅ¿e to give,
I ask them of him that he may give me repentance, and faith
in ChriÅ¿t, and therefore I pray and beÅ¿eech ChriÅ¿t dayly for
repentance and faith; and other good waies I beg of ChriÅ¿t
dayly to give me: and I pray to ChriÅ¿t for al theÅ¿e gifts and
graces to put them in my heart: and now I greatly thank
ChriÅ¿t for all theÅ¿e good gifts which he hath given me. I
know not any thing, nor can do any thing that is a good work:
even my heart is dark dayly in what I Å¿hould do, and my Å¿oul
dyeth becauÅ¿e of my Å¿ins, and therefore I give my Å¿oul to
ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e I know my Å¿oul is dead in Å¿in, and dayly doth
commit Å¿in; in my heart I Å¿in, and all the members of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are Å¿inful. I beleeve JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is aÅ¿cended to Heaven
through the clouds, and he will come again from Heaven:
Many Å¿aw ChriÅ¿t go up to Heaven, and the Angels Å¿aid, even
Å¿o he will come again to judg all the world; and therefore I
beleeve Gods promiÅ¿e, That all men Å¿hall riÅ¿e again when
ChriÅ¿t cometh again, then all Å¿hall riÅ¿e, and all their Å¿ouls
comes again becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t is truÅ¿ted with them, and keeps
their Å¿ouls, therefore I desire my Å¿ins may be pardoned; and
I beleeve in ChriÅ¿t; and ever Å¿o long as I live, I will pray to
God, and do all the good waies he commandeth.</p>

The ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion which he made on the FaÅ¿t
day before the great AÅ¿Å¿embly was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth</head>
               <p>I ConfeÅ¿s my sins before the Lord, and before men this day:
a little while Å¿ince I did commit many Å¿ins, both in my
hands and heart; luÅ¿ts thefts, and many other sins, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day: and after I heard of praying to God, and that others
prayed to God, my heart did not like it, but hated it, yea
and mocked at it; and after they prayed at <hi>Cohannet</hi> I Å¿til
hated it, and when I heard the Word I did not like of it, but
thought of running away, becauÅ¿e I loved Å¿in: but I loved the
place of my dwelling, and therfore I thought I wil rather pray
to God, and began to do it; a little I deÅ¿ired to learn the ten
Commandements of God, and other points of CatechiÅ¿me;
and then a little I repented, but I was quickly weary of
repentance, and fell again to sin, and full of evil thoughts was
my heart: and then I played the Hypocrite, and my heart was
full of sin: I learned Å¿ome things, but did not do what
God commanded, but I sinned and playd the Hypocrite;
Å¿ome things I did before man, but not before God. But
afterward I feared becauÅ¿e of my Å¿ins, and feared puniÅ¿hment
for my Å¿ins, therefore I thought again I would run away;
yet again I loving the place, would not run away, but
would pray to God: and I asked a QueÅ¿tion at the Lecture<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
which was this, <hi>How I Å¿hould get wiÅ¿dom?</hi> the AnÅ¿wer made
me a little to underÅ¿tand: but afterward I heard the word
<hi>If any man lack wiÅ¿dom, let him ask it of God, who giveth liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to all that ask, and upbraideth none.</hi> But then I did fear
Gods anger, becauÅ¿e of all my Å¿ins, becauÅ¿e they were great.
Afterward hearing that Word, That ChriÅ¿t is named <hi>JeÅ¿us,</hi>
becauÅ¿e he redeemeth us from all our Å¿ins: I thought ChriÅ¿t
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118441:27"/>
would not Å¿ave me, becauÅ¿e I repent not, for he Å¿aveth only
penitent Beleevers; but I am not Å¿uch an one, but Å¿till a day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Å¿inner. Afterward hearing that Word, <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed are they
that hunger and thirÅ¿t after righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, for they Å¿hall be filled:</hi>
then I thought I am a poor Å¿inner, and poor is my heart: then
I prayed to God to teach me to do that which he requireth,
and to pray aright. Afterward hearing that word, <hi>Who ever
looks upon a Woman to luÅ¿t after her, hath already committed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultry
with her in his heart;</hi> then I thought I had done all
manner of Å¿ins in the sight of God, becauÅ¿e he Å¿eeth luÅ¿t in the
heart, and knoweth all the evil thoughts of my heart; and
then I did pray unto God, <hi>Oh! give me Repentance and Pardon.</hi>
Afterwards when I did teach among the Indians, I was much
humbled becauÅ¿e I could not reade right, and that I
Å¿inned in it; for I Å¿aw that when I thought to do a good
work, I Å¿inned in doing it, for I knew not what was right,
nor how to do it. In the night I was conÅ¿idering of my Å¿ins,
and could not find what to do: three nights I conÅ¿idered what
to do, and at laÅ¿t God Å¿hewed me mercy, and Å¿hewed me
what I Å¿hould do. And then I desired to learn to read Gods
Word, and hearing that if we ask wiÅ¿dom of God, he will
give it, then I did much pray to God, that he would teach me
to reade. After a years time, I thought I did not rightly
Å¿eek, and I thought I sinned, becauÅ¿e I did not rightly desire
to read Gods Word, and I thought my praying was sinful,
and I feared, how Å¿hould I, my wife, and child be cloathed, if
I Å¿pend my time in learning to reade; but then God was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to me, and Å¿hewed me that Word, <hi>Say not, what Å¿hall I
eat, or drink, or wherewith Å¿hall I be cloathed, wicked men Å¿eek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
theÅ¿e; but firÅ¿t Å¿eek the Kingdom of Heaven, and theÅ¿e things
Å¿hall be added to you;</hi> then I pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>yed God to teach me this word,
and that I might do it: and then I desired to read Gods word,
what ever I wanted. Afterward hearing that we muÅ¿t make
a Town, and gather a Church at <hi>Natick,</hi> my heart diÅ¿liked
that place; but hearing that word, <hi>That ChriÅ¿t met two Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hers,
and Å¿aid, follow me, and I will make you fiÅ¿hers of men, and
they preÅ¿ently left all and followed him;</hi> hearing this, I was much
troubled, becauÅ¿e I had not beleeved ChriÅ¿t, for I would not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118441:28"/>
follow him to make a Church, nor had I done what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me, and then I was troubled for all my Å¿ins. Again
hearing that word, <hi>That the blind man called after ChriÅ¿t, Å¿aying,
thou Son of</hi> David <hi>have mercy on me; ChriÅ¿t asked him what he
would have him do, he Å¿aid, Lord open my eyes;</hi> and preÅ¿ently
ChriÅ¿t gave him Å¿ight, and he followed ChriÅ¿t: then again
my heart was troubled, for I thought I Å¿till beleeve not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
I do not follow ChriÅ¿t, nor hath he yet opened mine
eyes: then I prayed to ChriÅ¿t to open mine eyes, that I might
Å¿ee what to do, becauÅ¿e I am blind and cannot Å¿ee how to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ChriÅ¿t, and do what he commandeth, and I prayed to
ChriÅ¿t, Teach me Lord what to do, and to do what thou
Å¿ayeÅ¿t; and I prayed that I might follow ChriÅ¿t: and then
I thought I will follow ChriÅ¿t to make a Church. All this
trouble I had to be brought to be willing to make a Church:
and quickly after, God laid upon me more trouble, by Å¿ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s
and death; and then I much prayed to God for life, for
we were all Å¿ick, and then God would not hear me, to give
us life; but firÅ¿t one of my Children died, and after that my
Wife; then I was in great Å¿orrow, becauÅ¿e I thought God
would no hear me, and I thought it was becauÅ¿e I would
not follow him, therefore he hears not me: then I found
this Å¿in in my heart, That I was angry at the puniÅ¿hment of
God: but afterward I conÅ¿idered, I was a poor Å¿inner, I have
nothing, nor Child, nor Wife, I deÅ¿erve that God Å¿hould
take away all mercies from me; and then I repented of my
Å¿ins, and did much pray, and I remembred the promiÅ¿e to
follow ChriÅ¿t, and my heart Å¿aid, I had in this Å¿inned, that
followed not ChriÅ¿t, and therefore I cryed for pardon of this
Å¿in: and then hearing of this Word, <hi>Who ever beleeveth in
ChriÅ¿t, his Å¿ins are pardoned, he beleeving that ChriÅ¿t died for us;</hi>
and I beleeved. Again hearing that Word, <hi>If ye be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and become as a little Child, you cannot go to Heaven;</hi> then
my heart thought, I do not this, but I deÅ¿erve Hell fire for
ever; and then I prayed ChriÅ¿t, Oh! turn me from my Å¿in,
and teach me to hear thy Word; and I prayed to my Father
in Heaven: and after this, I beleeved in ChriÅ¿t for pardon.
Afterward I heard that Word, That it is a Å¿hame for a man
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118441:28"/>
to wear long hair, and that there was no Å¿uch cuÅ¿tom in the
Churches: at firÅ¿t I thought I loved not long hair, but I
did, and found it very hard to cut it off; and then I prayed
God to pardon that Å¿in alÅ¿o: Afterward I thought my heart
cared not for the Word of God: but then I thought I would
give my Å¿elf up unto the Lord, to do all his Word. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
I heard that word, <hi>If thy right foot offend thee, cut it off,
or thy right hand, or thy right eye; its better to go to Heaven with
one foot, or hand, or eye, than having both to go to Hell;</hi> then I
thought my hair had been a Å¿tumbling to me, therefore I cut
it off, and grieved for this fin, and prayed for pardon. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hearing that word, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and
heavie laden with your Å¿ins, and I will give reÅ¿t to your Å¿ouls;</hi> then
my heart thought that I do dayly hate my Å¿ins, Oh! that I
could go to ChriÅ¿t! and ChriÅ¿t looketh I Å¿hould come unto
him, therfore I will go unto him, and therfore then I prayed,
Oh! ChriÅ¿t help me to come unto thee: and I prayed becauÅ¿e
of all my Å¿ins that they may be pardoned. For the firÅ¿t man
was made like God in holineÅ¿s, and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and God
gave him his Covenant; but <hi>Adam</hi> Å¿inned, beleeving the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
therefore God was angry, and therefore all we Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Adam</hi> are like the Devil, and dayly Å¿in, and break e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Law of God, full of evil thoughts, words, and works,
and only ChriÅ¿t can deliver us from our Å¿ins, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
in ChriÅ¿t is pardoned; but my heart of my Å¿elf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
beleeve: Satan hath power in me, but I cry to God, Oh!
give me faith, and pardon my Å¿in, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t alone can
deliver me from Hell; therefore I pray, Oh! JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t
deliver me. ChriÅ¿t hath provided the new Covenant to Å¿ave
Beleevers in ChriÅ¿t, therefore I deÅ¿ire to give my Å¿oul to
ChriÅ¿t, for pardon of all my Å¿ins: the firÅ¿t Covenant is broke
by Å¿in, and we deÅ¿erve Hell; but ChriÅ¿t keepeth for us the
new Covenant, and therfore I betruÅ¿t my Å¿oul with ChriÅ¿t.
Again, I deÅ¿ire to beleeve in ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t will come
to judgment, and all Å¿hall riÅ¿e again, and all Beleevers in
this life Å¿hall then be Å¿aved; therefore I deÅ¿ire to beleeve

when you alwayes came to us, I only heard the word, I
did not underÅ¿tand it, nor meditate on it, yet I found that
al my doings were sins againÅ¿t God; then I prayed unto God.

His Second ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion was as followeth:</head>
               <p>WHen I prayed not unto God I ever sinned every day:
but when <hi>Noonanetam Indians</hi> firÅ¿t prayed, I heard
of it, and three nights I conÅ¿idered whether I Å¿hould pray
or no, but I found not how to pray unto God, but how not
to pray: but then I heard Gods free mercy in his word,
call all to pray, <hi>from the riÅ¿ing of the Sun to the going down
thereof;</hi> yet preÅ¿ently I loÅ¿t that word, and Å¿inned again,
and committed many Å¿ins. Then Gods free mercy Å¿hewed me
in the CatechiÅ¿m, <hi>That God made all the World,</hi> yet my heart did
not beleeve, becauÅ¿e I knew I Å¿prung from my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
I did alwaies act many Å¿ins, becauÅ¿e I was born in Å¿in, and
in vain I heard Gods word. Then I heard Gods Word, <hi>That
ChriÅ¿t was made man,</hi> yet I did but hear it, though I thought
it might be true: I thought I would caÅ¿t off all sin, but
then I found that I loved them very much. I heard Gods
promiÅ¿e to <hi>Abraham, To increaÅ¿e his Children as the Stars for
number,</hi> but I beleeved not, becauÅ¿e he had but one Son:
and thus I caÅ¿t off the word, and committed sins. I heard
alÅ¿o from the word, That all men are not alike to God, Å¿ome
are firÅ¿t to God, [or preferred before other;] but I did
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118441:30"/>
not beleeve it becauÅ¿e all men die alike; therefore they are
not the Sons of God, and God is not their Father: So Å¿till
I beleeved not the Word, but broke Gods Word dayly, and
in vain I heard Gods Word. Afterward I heard that Word of
God to <hi>MoÅ¿es, I'le be with thy mouth, for who maketh the Å¿eeing
Eye, or hearing Ear, is it not I?</hi> Å¿aith the Lord: then I underÅ¿tood
a little of God, and of his Word; but Å¿till I acted much Å¿in.
Afterward I heard that Word of Free-Grace, <hi>Repent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the GoÅ¿pel, and who ever beleeve Å¿hall be Å¿aved;</hi> then my heart
beleeved, then I Å¿aw I had prayed but afore man, &amp; Å¿o was my
hearing, or any other duty; and I Å¿aw other of my Å¿ins againÅ¿t
God; and then I Å¿aw that my heart did not beleev as it Å¿hould,
&amp; I deÅ¿ired to be open in my doings; I Å¿aw I brake every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God: yet preÅ¿ently I loÅ¿t this, and the Word of ChriÅ¿t
was of little worth unto me; and I Å¿aw I loved Å¿in very much.
Then again I heard that word, That all Å¿hall pray from the
riÅ¿ing to the Å¿itting Sun; then I thought I will pray to God,
and yet only my tongue prayed. Then again I heard the
CatechiÅ¿m, That God made <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and al the world,
and a little I beleeved that word. Afterward I heard ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
word, <hi>That they are BaÅ¿tards, not Sons, whom God afflicts
not:</hi> I did a little think this to be a truth, and then I prayed
more unto God, and yet I Å¿aw I feared man more than God:
but notwithÅ¿tanding, I have prayed unto God from that day
unto this day; yet I Å¿ee <hi>I</hi> Å¿in every day. When I heard that
Word that God Å¿pake to <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> in the Mount by a Trumpet,
and Å¿aid, <hi>Thou Å¿halt not have any other God, thou Å¿halt not luÅ¿t,
nor lye, nor kill, &amp;c.</hi> I Å¿aw all theÅ¿e I had broken; I heard the
Word, but Å¿inned in what I heard: I heard that my heart
muÅ¿t break and melt for Å¿in, and beleeve in ChriÅ¿t, and that
we Å¿hould try our hearts if it be Å¿o; yet I could try but little,
nor find but little, but Å¿till I Å¿inned much. I heard that
Word, That they which caÅ¿t off God, God will caÅ¿t off them;
and I feared leÅ¿t God Å¿hould caÅ¿t me away, becauÅ¿e of my
Å¿ins: I was aÅ¿hamed of my Å¿ins, and my heart melted, and I
thought I wil give my Å¿elf to God, and to ChriÅ¿t, and do
what he will for ever; and becauÅ¿e of this promiÅ¿e of pardon
to al that repent and beleeve, my heart deÅ¿ireth to pray to
God as long as I live.</p>

I Å¿hould pray, but I found not in my heart that all Å¿hould

me, if I did pray; but I thought if I did pray, the <hi>Sacbems</hi>
would be angry, becauÅ¿e They did not Å¿ay, pray to God, and
therefore I did not yet pray; but conÅ¿idering of that word,
that all Å¿hall pray, I was troubled, and I found in my heart
that I would pray unto God; and yet I feared that others
would laugh at me, and therefore I did not yet pray. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
God was yet merciful to me, and I heard that God
made the World, and the firÅ¿t man, and I thought it was
true, and therefore I would pray to God, becauÅ¿e he hath
made all; and yet when I did pray, I thought I prayed not
aright, becauÅ¿e I prayed for the Å¿ake of man, and I thought
this to be a great Å¿in. But then I wondered at Gods free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to me, for I Å¿aw God made me, and giveth me all mercies:
and then was I troubled, and Å¿aw that many were my Å¿ins,
and that I do not yet beleeve; then I prayed, yet my heart Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for I prayed only with my mouth: and then I repented
of my Å¿ins, and then a little I conÅ¿idered and remembred
Gods love unto us: but I was a Å¿inner, and many were my

sins, and a little I repented of them; and yet again I sinned,
and quickly was my heart full of sin: then again was my
heart angry with my Å¿elf, and often I loÅ¿t all this again, and
fell into sin. Then I heard that word, <hi>That God Å¿ent</hi> MoÅ¿es
<hi>to</hi> Egypt, <hi>and promiÅ¿ed I will be with thee;</hi> that promiÅ¿e I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
but I thought that in vain I did Å¿eek, and I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hamed
that I did Å¿o: and I prayed, Oh God teach me truly
to pray, not only before man, but before God, and pardon al
theÅ¿e my sins. Again I heard that word, that ChriÅ¿t taught
through every Town and Village, <hi>Repent and beleeve, and be
Å¿aved,</hi> and a little I beleeved this word, and I loved it, and
then I Å¿aw all my Å¿ins, and prayed for pardon. Again I heard
that word, He that caÅ¿teth off God, him will God caÅ¿t off;
and I found in my heart, that I had done this, and I feared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
of this my sin, leÅ¿t God Å¿hould caÅ¿t me off, and that I
Å¿hould for ever periÅ¿h in Hell, becauÅ¿e God hath caÅ¿t me off, I

Å¿pent, and he was the fift in number, their Å¿peeches being Å¿low,
and they were the more Å¿low at my requeÅ¿t, that I might write
what they Å¿aid; &amp; oft I was forced to inquire of my interpreter
(who Å¿at by me) becauÅ¿e I did not perfectly underÅ¿tand Å¿ome
Å¿entences, eÅ¿pecially of Å¿ome of them: theÅ¿e things did make
the work long-Å¿om, considering the inlargement of Å¿pirit God

all the Interpreters preÅ¿ent that I could, that Å¿o the intetpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
might not depend upon my single teÅ¿temony, yet
Å¿o it was that they all failed, and I was alone (as I have been
wont to be in this work) which providence of God was not to
be neglected in Å¿o Å¿olemn a busineÅ¿s. Wherfore the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trates,
Elders, and Grave Men preÅ¿ent, adviÅ¿ed together what
to do, and the ConcluÅ¿ion was, Not to proceed any further
at preÅ¿ent, yet Å¿o to carry the matter, as that the Indians
might in no wiÅ¿e be diÅ¿couraged, but encouraged; to which
end, one of the Elders was requeÅ¿ted to Å¿peak unto the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h,
the two above Å¿aid ReaÅ¿ons, <hi>viz.</hi> The want of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
And want of Time, to finiÅ¿h at this time Å¿o Å¿olemn a
Work; but to refer it to a more fitting time. And I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to declare it to the Indians, which I did to this purpoÅ¿e,
That the MagiÅ¿trates, Elders, and other ChriÅ¿tian People pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent,
did much rejoyce to hear their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions, and adviÅ¿ed
them to go on in that good way; but as for the gathering a
Church among them this day, it could not be; partly, BecauÅ¿e
neither Mr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Leveridg.</hi> nor any Interpreter
was here (for whom they knew I had Å¿ent, Å¿ome of themÅ¿elves
being the MeÅ¿Å¿engers to carry Letters time enough) and it was
Gods Ordinance, That when any were to judg a CaÅ¿e, though
they could beleeve one WitneÅ¿s, yet they could not judg un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
two or three. AlÅ¿o I told them, That themÅ¿elves might
easily Å¿ee there was not time enough to finiÅ¿h Å¿o Å¿olemn a work
this day; therefore they adviÅ¿ed, and God called to refer it
to a fitter Å¿eaÅ¿on; in which advice they reÅ¿ted: And Å¿o was
the Work of that day, with prayers unto God, finiÅ¿hed; the
accompliÅ¿hment being referred to a fitter Å¿eaÅ¿on.</p>
               <p rend="indent">As for my Å¿elf, the Lord put it into the hearts of the Elders,
to Å¿peak unto me words of Comfort, and acceptance of my

declare, and open my very heart in this Matter. The Lord he
knoweth, that with much fear, and care I went about this
work, even unto the Å¿enÅ¿ible waÅ¿ting, and weakning of my

would have drawn upon me much more labor and care, leÅ¿t
they Å¿hould in any wiÅ¿e Å¿candalize the Å¿ame; unto which I
have now more time aÅ¿Å¿igned me by the Lord to prepare them,

the weight and Å¿olemnity of that great Work, though it is
moÅ¿t true, that they alÅ¿o came on unto it with many fears,
and queÅ¿tions, what they Å¿hould do when they Å¿hould be a

his Servants (which is an holy reverend Ordinance of ChriÅ¿t)
and by his Providence denying me the help of all Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
having many witneÅ¿Å¿es how much care and pains I took
every way I knew, to be Å¿upplied therein; and that the work
it Å¿elf was extended by the Lords gracious inlarging them in
their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions, Å¿o that the day was not Å¿ufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliÅ¿h
it; I Å¿ay, when I Å¿aw the Lord Å¿peaking that dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
word, I cannot expreÅ¿s what a load it took off my heart,
and I did gladly follow the Lord therein, yea, and I bleÅ¿s
the Lord for that day, that it was carried Å¿o far as it was, for
the cauÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿t hath many waies gained by it, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of the precious Saints, being much comforted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in their hopes of this work of ChriÅ¿t among them,
and their faith and prayers much quickned by what they
heard and Å¿aw. And becauÅ¿e all witneÅ¿Å¿es failed me, let me
Å¿ay but this, I began, and have followed this work for the
Lord according to the poor meaÅ¿ure of grace received, &amp; not
for baÅ¿e ends. I have been true &amp; faithful unto their Å¿ouls, and
in writing and reading their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions, I have not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,

God Å¿aith, We muÅ¿t have but one Wife, and at firÅ¿t did

judges the world, our bodies riÅ¿e again, and then we Å¿hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

               <p>I am dead in Å¿in, Oh! that my Å¿ins might die, for they
cannot give life, becauÅ¿e they be dead: before I prayed
to God, I did commit all filthyneÅ¿Å¿e, I prayed to many gods,
I was proud, full of luÅ¿ts, adulteries, and all others Å¿ins,
and therefore this is my firÅ¿t ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and I am a Å¿inner, for God have given unto me inÅ¿truction
and cauÅ¿eth me to pray unto God, but I only pray words;
when I prayed, I Å¿omtimes wondered, and thought true it is
that God made the world, and me: and then I thought I
knew God, becauÅ¿e I Å¿aw theÅ¿e his works, and then I was glad
Å¿omtimes, and gave thanks; yet preÅ¿ently again I did not
rejoyce in it. Again Å¿omtimes I thought, now I do wel
becauÅ¿e I pray, and work not on the Sabbath daies, but come
to the Meetings, and hear the Word of God: But afterward
again, I thought I do not wel, becauÅ¿e true it is, That yet I do
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118441:36"/>
not truly pray; for now I Å¿ee I Å¿in when I pray, becauÅ¿e
there is nothing but Å¿in in my mouth, or hand, or heart, and
all Å¿ins are there, for of theÅ¿e my Å¿ins my heart is full, becauÅ¿e
my heart doth Å¿ometimes luÅ¿t, and Å¿teal, and the like. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I was not only proud before I prayed, but now I am
proud. Again, Å¿ometimes my heart is humbled, and then
I pray, Oh God have mercy on me, and pardon theÅ¿e my
Å¿ins; yet Å¿ometimes I know not whether God did either hear
my prayer, or pardon my Å¿ins. Again, afterwards I thought
I had greatly Å¿inned, becauÅ¿e I heard of the good way of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying
unto God, but I do wickedly becauÅ¿e I pray not truly,
yea, Å¿ometimes I have much ado to pray with my mouth, and
therfore I Å¿in. I heard of that good way, to keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
and not to work on that day, and I did Å¿o: but yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I Å¿inned in it, becauÅ¿e I did not reverence the Word of
God; yea, and Å¿ometimes I thought that working on the
Sabbath was no great matter. Again, I heard it was a good
way to come to the Meetings, and hear the word of God, and
I deÅ¿ired to do it; but in this alÅ¿o I Å¿inned, becauÅ¿e I did not
truly hear: yea, Å¿ometimes I thought it no great matter if I
heard not, and cared not to come to hear, and Å¿till I Å¿o Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Then I thought God was angry, becauÅ¿e I have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Å¿inned; deÅ¿iring to do well, and yet again to Å¿in. When
I deÅ¿ired to do well, then I Å¿inned, and in all things I Å¿inned.
But afterward I was angry with my Å¿elf, and thought I will
not Å¿in again; and what God Å¿aith, is good, but I am Å¿inful
becauÅ¿e I have done all theÅ¿e evils. Again, Å¿ometimes my
heart is humbled, and then I repent, and Å¿ay, Oh God and
JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, have mercy on me, and pardon my Å¿ins. Now I
deÅ¿ire truly to pray; now I deÅ¿ire to reverence the Word every
Sabbath day: now I deÅ¿ire to hear the Word of God truly;
now I deÅ¿ire to bend my heart to pray, and it may be God
will hear me: but quickly after a temptation cometh to my
heart, and I did not deÅ¿ire it. Again, Å¿ometimes I did think,
true it is I can do nothing of my Å¿elf, but JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t
have mercy on me, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t hath done for me all Gods
Commandements and good Works, therfore my heart Å¿aith,
Oh JeÅ¿us give me deÅ¿ires after thee: Å¿ometimes I think it is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118441:36"/>
true, I have greatly Å¿inned againÅ¿t God, but great are his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
Å¿ometimes I hear the Word on the Sabbath day, and
he giveth it me, [that is, maketh it my own] Å¿ometimes I Å¿ay
the great and mighty God is in Heaven, but theÅ¿e are but
words, becauÅ¿e I do not fear this great and mighty God; and
I Å¿ometimes regard not Gods Word, and make it of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
becauÅ¿e I do not that which is good, but commit Å¿in:
Å¿ometimes I Å¿ay I know ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e I know he died for us,
and hath redeemed us, and procured pardon for us: yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I Å¿ay I Å¿in, becauÅ¿e I beleeve not ChriÅ¿t, for that only is
right to beleeve in ChriÅ¿t, and do what he Å¿aith; but I think
I do this in vain, becauÅ¿e I yet do not truly beleeve in JeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t, nor do what he commandeth, and therefore my heart
plays the hypocrite; and now I know what is hypocriÅ¿ie,
namely, when I know what I Å¿hould do, and yet do it not.
Sometimes I think I am like unto Satan, becauÅ¿e I do al theÅ¿e
Å¿ins, and Å¿in in all things I do; if I pray I Å¿in, If I keep
Sabbath I Å¿in, if I hear Gods Word I Å¿in, therefore I am like
the Devil. Now I know I deÅ¿erve to go to Hell, becauÅ¿e all
theÅ¿e Å¿ins I have committed: then my heart is troubled, and I
Å¿ay, Oh God and ChriÅ¿t pardon all my Å¿in, for I cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my Å¿ins my Å¿elf; for the firÅ¿t man brought Å¿in into the
world, and therfore I am Å¿inful, therfore I pray thee O Lord
pardon all the Å¿ins which I have done. Again, Å¿ometimes
my heart is humbled, and I deÅ¿ire to fear God, becauÅ¿e he is
a great God, and I deÅ¿ire to do what he Å¿aith, and now I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire
to do the right way, and now I deÅ¿ire to beleeve JeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t; and Å¿ometimes I think it may be God will hear me,
it may be he will pardon me, yet again I think I cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hamed
of Å¿in; but now I am aÅ¿hamed of all my Å¿ins, and my
heart is broken, and all theÅ¿e my Å¿ins I caÅ¿t off, and take heed
of: yet then again I Å¿ometimes Å¿ay to God, I cannot my Å¿elf
be humbled, or break my heart, or caÅ¿t off Å¿in, but I pray
thee O JeÅ¿us help me to do it. Again, Å¿ometimes I confeÅ¿s
this is true, I cannot redeem my Å¿elf, nor deliver my Å¿elf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
of all theÅ¿e my many Å¿ins; truly, full is my heart of Å¿in

               <p>HEretofore I beleeved not, that God made the world,

grew up in the world of themÅ¿elves. When any bid me pray
to God, I Å¿aid I cannot, and none of our Rulers beleeve
or pray to God; yet I went about to Å¿eek how to pray to
God. I told the wiÅ¿e men, I Å¿eek how to pray to God, and

I had a deÅ¿ire to pray God, leÅ¿t I Å¿hould loÅ¿e my Å¿oul, but my

and therefore I thought of going away; yet I alÅ¿o thought
if I do go away, I Å¿hall loÅ¿e my ground. But after this I
heard of Gods anger againÅ¿t me, and I beleeved it; for God
made the firÅ¿t man good, and told him if he did well he
Å¿hould live, and this day I beleeve all men Å¿hould do Å¿o: and
then I thought I will pray as long as I live, and I will labor,

that that is a true word; for they that do labor do eat [that

Children, and old men, and all men to turn unto God, and
from their Å¿ins; he calleth to Å¿orrow and repentance, and
ever to beleeve in ChriÅ¿t; and who ever doth this, Å¿hall
be ever bleÅ¿Å¿ed in Heaven; but if he do it not, he periÅ¿heth:
if he turn not from Å¿in, dying, he Å¿hall go to Hell for ever.
I think alÅ¿o, that Å¿o long as I live, God doth give me life.
I beleeve that we ought to gather into a Church, to Å¿erve
God as long as we live. But I do not know whether yet

When Å¿ome prayed to God, I went with them, but I did not
know God. Afterward my mind was changed thus far,
That I deÅ¿ired to be wiÅ¿e, as others were, but yet I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of God; yea, after I prayed to God. I Å¿till did
think there was no God. Afterward I found this in my heart,
That we pray to God for our Å¿ouls, then I thought all my

dying, and of my Å¿oul: but then I thought we prayed for
nothing but that our Å¿ouls might go to Heaven; I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

and taught the ten Commandements, I hearkned, and
by them I came to know that there was a God, and that there
was Å¿in againÅ¿t God; and hereby God made me to Å¿ee all my

               <p>BEfore I prayed to God, I greatly Å¿inned every day, I was
proud, and lived in adultery, lying, &amp;c. and my heart
alwaies full of evil thoughts, and when the EngliÅ¿h would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truct
me, I then thought my waies evil, but the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of
praying to God, good; then I did think, if I could firÅ¿t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand,
then I would pray to God, and I was glad to hear
of any that did pray to God. When I heard that word at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannet,
Who ever lacketh wiÅ¿dom, let him ask it of God;</hi> let fools
pray to God, and he will give them wiÅ¿dom: I thought I
was a fool, and I beleeved that Word of God. I heard that
word of the dry bones, God bid them hear, and promiÅ¿ed to
put fleÅ¿h, and Å¿inews, and skin upon them, and make them
live; therefore I deÅ¿ired to hear, becauÅ¿e I beleeved the dry
bones, and that I was one that did not know God: afterward
I was glad of praying to God. Sometimes I beleeved not
God, and God will not look on Å¿uch, alwaies I thought God
will not forgive me. I wondred at all that prayed to God,
becauÅ¿e I thought God had given them wiÅ¿dom: then I
thought I am glad I pray to God. Sometime my heart is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
becauÅ¿e I Å¿hall loÅ¿e all in this world, and loÅ¿e my Å¿oul alÅ¿o,
becauÅ¿e I beleeve not, for all the Words of God are true
which he hath taught me. Now this day I think I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿s
the truth; BecauÅ¿e I have Å¿inned, I want JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t:
and I will truly confeÅ¿s God, becauÅ¿e of that word of ChriÅ¿t,
<hi>He that confeÅ¿Å¿eth me before men, him will I confeÅ¿s before my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>

               <p>BEfore I prayed to God I alwaies committed Å¿in, but I do
not know all my Å¿ins, I know but a little of the Å¿ins I have
committed, therefore I thought I could not pray to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
I knew not al my Å¿ins before I prayed to God, and Å¿ince I
heard of praying to God: formerly when the EngliÅ¿h did bid
me pray unto God I hated it, and would go out of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es,
when they Å¿pake of Å¿uch things to me. I had no delight
to hear any thing of Gods Word, but in every thing I Å¿inned;
in my Å¿peeches I Å¿inned, and every day I broke the Commands
of God. After I heard of praying to God, that <hi>Waban</hi> and
my two brothers prayed to God, yet then I deÅ¿ired it not, but
did think of running away; yet I feared if I did run away Å¿ome
wicked men would kill me, but I did not fear God. After
when you Å¿aid unto me, pray, my heart thought, I will pray;
yet again I thought, I cannot pray with my heart, and no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for praying with words only: but when I did pray, I Å¿aw
more of my Å¿ins; yet I did but only Å¿ee them, I could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of them, but Å¿till I did commit them: and after I prayed
to God, I was Å¿till full of luÅ¿t, and then a little I feared. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I was Å¿ick, and then I thought God was angry, and then
I Å¿aw that I did commit all Å¿ins: then one of my brothers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and then my heart was broken, and after him another
friend, and again my heart was broken: and yet after all this
I broke my praying to God, and put away God, and then I
thought I Å¿hall never pray to God: but after this I was afraid
of the Lord, becauÅ¿e I alwaies broke my praying to God, and
then my heart Å¿aid, God doth nor hear my prayer. When I
was Å¿ick, and recovered again, I thought then that God was
merciful unto me. Hearing that word of God, <hi>If you hear
the Word of God, and be forgetful hearers, you Å¿in againÅ¿t God;</hi>
then I thought God will not pardon Å¿uch a Å¿inner as I, who
dayly did Å¿o, and broke my praying to God. When I heard the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118441:40"/>
Commandements, I deÅ¿ired to learn them, and other points of
CatechiÅ¿m, but my desires were but Å¿mall, and I Å¿oon loÅ¿t it,
becauÅ¿e I did not desire to beleeve: then Å¿ometimes I feared
Gods anger becauÅ¿e of al my sins; I heard the Word and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood
only this word, <hi>All you that hear this day, it may be
you Å¿hall quickly die,</hi> and then I quickly Å¿aw that God was very
angry with me. Then God brake my head, and by that I Å¿aw
Gods anger; and then I thought that the true God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is angry with me for my sin, even for al my sins, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day I live, I do. When I was almoÅ¿t dead, Å¿ome body
bid me now beleeve, becauÅ¿e it may be I Å¿hal quickly die, and
I thought I did beleeve, but I did not know right beleeving in
ChriÅ¿t: then I prayed unto God to reÅ¿tore my health. Then
I beleeved that word, <hi>That we muÅ¿t Å¿hortly appear before JeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t;</hi> then I did greatly fear leÅ¿t if I beleeved not, I Å¿hould
periÅ¿h for ever. When I was neer death, I prayed unto God,
<hi>Oh Lord give me life, and I will pray to God Å¿o long as I live,</hi> and I
Å¿aid, <hi>I will give my Å¿elf, Å¿oul, and body to ChriÅ¿t:</hi> after this, God
gave me health, and then I thought, truly, God in Heaven is
merciful; then I much grieved, that I knew Å¿o little of Gods
Word. And now Å¿ometimes I am angry, and then I fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
I know God Å¿eeth it: and I fear, becauÅ¿e I promiÅ¿ed
God when I was almoÅ¿t dead, that if he giveth me life, I
will pray Å¿o long as I live; I fear leÅ¿t I Å¿hould break this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e
to God. Now I deÅ¿ire the pardon of all my Å¿ins, and I
beg faith in ChriÅ¿t, and I deÅ¿ire to live unto God, Å¿o long as I
live; I cannot my Å¿elf get pardon, but I dayly commit Å¿in,
and break Gods Word, but I look to ChriÅ¿t for pardon.</p>

two years ago, I began to think, I had Å¿inned againÅ¿t God;

my Å¿ins: and again I thought, What will become of me, if
I die in my Å¿ins? and then I thought it was good for me to
pray unto God Å¿o long as I live; and then my heart turned
to praying unto God, and I did pray, and my heart feared
when I heard the word read and taught, and I was glad to
hear the Word of God; and then I purpoÅ¿ed to pray

heard that word, <hi>I thank thee oh Heavenly father, that thou
haÅ¿t revealed theÅ¿e things to babes;</hi> and that word, <hi>that we muÅ¿t

               <p>The Story is this,</p>
               <p>THis Spring, in the beginning of the yeer, 1652. the Lord
was pleaÅ¿ed to afflict Å¿undry of our praying Indians with
that grievous diÅ¿eaÅ¿e of the Bloody-Flux, whereof Å¿ome with
great torments in their bowels died; among which were two
little Children of the age above-Å¿aid, and at that time both in
one houÅ¿e, being together taken with that diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. The firÅ¿t
of theÅ¿e Children in the extremities of its torments, lay crying
to God in theÅ¿e words, <hi>God and JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, God and JeÅ¿us
ChriÅ¿t help me;</hi> and when they gave it any thing to eat, it
would greedily take it (as it is uÅ¿ual at the approach of death)
but firÅ¿t it would cry to God, <hi>Oh God and JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, bleÅ¿s it,</hi>
and then it would take it: and in this manner it lay calling
upon God and JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t untill it died: The mother of this
Child alÅ¿o died of that diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, at that time. The Father of
the Child told me this Å¿tory, with great wonderment at the
grace of God, in teaching his Child Å¿o to call upon God. The
name of the Father is <hi>NiÅ¿hohkou,</hi> whoÅ¿e ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion you have
before.</p>
               <p>Three or four daies after, another Child in the Å¿ame houÅ¿e,
Å¿ick of the Å¿ame diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, was (by a divine hand doubtleÅ¿s) Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible
of the approach of death, (an unuÅ¿ual thing at that age)
and called to its Father, and Å¿aid, <hi>Father, I am going to God,</hi>
Å¿everal times repeating it, <hi>I am going to God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> The mother (as
other mothers uÅ¿e to do) had made for the Child a little BaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
a little Spoon, and a little Tray: theÅ¿e things the child
was wont to be greatly delighted withal (as all children will)
therefore in the extremity of the torments, they Å¿et thoÅ¿e
things before it, a little to divert the mind, and cheer the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
but now, the child takes the Basket, and puts it away, and
Å¿aid, <hi>I will leave my Basket behind me, for I am going to God, I
will leave my Spoon and Tray behind me</hi> (putting them away)
<hi>for I am going to God:</hi> and with theÅ¿e kind of expreÅ¿Å¿ions, the
Å¿ame night, finiÅ¿hed its courÅ¿e, and died.</p>
               <p>The Father of this child is named <hi>Robin Speen,</hi> whoÅ¿e Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ions
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118441:42"/>
you have before, and in one of them he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this child that died in faith. When he related this
Å¿tory to me, he Å¿aid, He could not tell whether the Å¿orrow for
the death of his child, or the joy for its faith were greater,
when it died.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e Examples are a teÅ¿timony, That they teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
the knowledg and fear of God, whom they now call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and alÅ¿o that the Spirit of God co-worketh with their
inÅ¿tructions, who teacheth by man, more than man is able to
do.</p>
               <p>I have now finiÅ¿hed all that I purpoÅ¿e to publiÅ¿h at this
time; the Lord give them Acceptance in the hearts of his
Saints, to engage them the more to pray for them; and Oh!
that their judgings of themÅ¿elves, and breathings after ChriÅ¿t,
might move others (that have more means than they have, but
as yet regard it not) to do the like, and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
