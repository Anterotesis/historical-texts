         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Highly eſteemed in the Lord Jeſus,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHen the Lord firſt brought me to theſe poor Indians
on the <hi>Vinyard,</hi> they were mighty zealous and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
in the Worſhip of Falſe gods, and Devils; their Falſe
gods were many, both of things in Heaven, Earth, and
Sea: And there they had their Men-gods, Women-gods,
and Children-gods, their Companies, and Fellowſhips of
gods, or Divine Powers, guiding things amongſt men,
beſides innumerable more feigned gods belonging to
many Creatures, to their Corn, and every Colour of it:
The Devil alſo with his Angels had his Kingdom among
them, in them; account him they did, the terror of the
Living, the god of the Dead, under whoſe cruel power
and into whoſe deformed likeneſs they conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be tranſlated when they died; for the ſame
word they have for <hi>Devil,</hi> they uſe alſo for a <hi>Dead Man,</hi> in
their Language: by him they were often hurt in their
Bodies, diſtracted in their Minds, wherefore they had
many meetings with their <hi>Pawwaws</hi> (who uſually had a
hand in their hurt) to pacifie the Devil by their Sacrifice,
and get deliverance from their evil; I have ſometimes
marvelled to ſee the vehemency of their Spirits, which
they acted with no leſs bodily violence therein. The
<hi>Pawwaws</hi> counted their Imps their Preſervers, had them
treaſured up in their bodies, which they brought forth
to hurt their enemies, and heal their friends; who when
they had done ſome notable Cure, would ſhew the Imp
in the palm of his Hand to the Indians, who with much
amazement looking on it, Deified them, then at all times
ſeeking to them for cure in all ſickneſſes, and counſel in
all caſes: This Diabolical way they were in, giving heed
to a multitude of Heathen Traditions of their gods, and
many other things, under the obſervation whereof, they
<pb facs="tcp:118441:4"/>
with much ſlavery were held, and abounding with ſins,
having only an obſcure Notion of a good greater than all,
which they call <hi>Mannit,</hi> but they knew not what he was,
and therefore had no way to worſhip him.</p>
            <p>What an entrance I had at firſt amongſt theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Heathen, how called thereunto, and what ſucceſs
God bleſſed us with, hath been in ſome meaſure already
publiſhed, which will I hope through the dew of Gods
bleſſing from Heaven, have ſuch a gracious increaſe, that
the bloſſoming and budding time ſhal at leaſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
and by many more God bleſſed for it, in the
growth of the fruit to more maturity; Since it hath
pleaſed God to ſend his Word to theſe poor captivated
men (bondſlaves to ſin and Satan) he hath through mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
brought two hundred eighty three Indians (not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
yong children in the number) to renounce their
falſe gods, Devils, and Pawwaws, and publickly in ſet
meetings, before many witneſſes, have they diſclaimed
the Divinity of their formerly adored multitude, defied
their tyrannical Deſtroyer the Devil, and utterly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the help of the Pawwaws in any caſe; neither have
they at any time, either by threatnings or flatteries been
drawn thereto, although their lives have been in hazard;
yea, eight of their Pawwaws have forſaken their Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
craft, and profitable trade as they accounted it, for to
embrace the Word and Way of God. The Indians
which do pray to God, were not compelled thereto by
power, neither alſo could they be allured by gifts, who
received nothing for about ſeven years time, much leſs
that which counterpoyſe their troubles, and exceed to
the drawing of them from the beloved waies of their
own Worſhips: Surely it were great uncharitableneſs,
and derogatory from the glory of God, to think that
none of theſe are truly changed, and that God himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:118441:5"/>
by his Word and Spirit, hath not in mercy prevailed in
their hearts againſt theſe evils; nay, may we not hope
and be perſwaded by this, and ſome other appearances
of God amongſt them, that ſome of them are truly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to God from Idols, to ſerve the Living and true
God? Serve him, through mercy they do in ſome hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Reformations, walking inoffenſively and diligently
in their way, which I hope will more plainly appear
when they are in a way more hopeful (by the bleſſing of
God to their further well-being) which I hope will be in
the beſt time.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice of this good providence of
God by the way, That he hath mercifully preſerved all
the Indians which call upon his Name (from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Work unto this day) from all extraordinary
evil, whereby the Devil and Witches uſe to torment the
Bodies and Minds of Men, not one of them or their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(as I know) or have heard have been touched by
them in this kind (only a Pawwaw or two, have not been
delivered from his Imps preſently after his renouncing
of them, but for ſome time have had the ſence of them
in his Body with much pain:) The miſchief that the
Pawwaws and Devils uſually do to the common Indian
this way, is both by outward and bodily hurt, or inward
pain, torture, and diſtraction of mind, both which I have
ſeen my ſelf: To accompliſh the firſt, the Devil doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
the real body of a Serpent, which comes directly
towards the man in the houſe or in the field, looming or
having a ſhadow about him like a man, and do ſhoot a
bone (as they ſay) into the Indians Body, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
killeth him. An inſtance whereof I can give,
whereby it may the more plainly appear, that it is a great
mercy to be delivered therefrom; and it is of a youth,
who living with his Parents upon a neck of Land, They
<pb facs="tcp:118441:5"/>
did not pray unto <hi>Jehovah,</hi> yet their Neighbors who lived
there with them, did; This Youth was hurt after the
ſame manner, and then preſently his Parents pulled
down the houſe they lived in, and fled to an Iſland near
by, where I ſaw the Indian thus hurt in his Thigh, he
was grievouſly tormented, and his Kindred about him
mourning, not knowing where to find any comfort, or
help, for cure could not be had from their gods or
Pawwaws: I then took the opportunity to reaſon with
them about their way, with the beſt wiſdom God gave
me, but all in vain, for they would not hear to ſeek the
true God, notwithſtanding he had ſhewn his diſpleaſure
ſo apparantly againſt them for their former refuſing of
Him, but they ſtill followed on their wonted Serpentine
Machinations: The Pawwaws, and their devilliſh train,
with their horrible outcries, hollow bleatings, painful
wreſtlings, and ſmiting their own bodies, ſought delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but all in vain, for he died miſerably. Hereby,
and by ſeveral other things, I perceive that they are not
(in a manner) indifferent, whether they ſerve their own
gods or not, or change them (as ſome think) for they
are naturally like the Heathens of <hi>Chittim</hi> and <hi>Kedar,</hi>
which would not change their gods, which yet are no
gods; when God blames his people for changing their
glory for that which doth not profit; I hope therefore
that it is ſomething of Grace, that many chuſe to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the true God. But touching the former vexing
miſchiefs, A <hi>Sachem,</hi> and no good friend to the work,
could not but acknowledg the bleſſing of God among
the Praying Indians; When I came over (ſaid he) at the
further end of the Iſland, there was a ſtorm (mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the aforeſaid evils, with ſome more) but when I
came to this end I found a calm, the Praying Indians
were all well, they aroſe in the morning, Prayed to God,

and went about their buſineſs, and they are not hurt nor
troubled like the other Indians: And the Pawwaws
themſelves, ſome of them do ſay, That they cannot
make their Power ſeize on any of them: Queſtionleſs
they have tried their Skill, and Satan hath not been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to aſſiſt them, who is ſo unwilling to fall down from
his Rule, and to be driven from his old Poſſeſſions. A
Pawwaw told me, who was of no ſmall note among the
Heathen formerly, and alſo with the beſt, now he hath
forſaken his Pawwawing, That after he had been
brought by the Word of God to hate the Devil, and to
renounce his Imps (which he did publickly) that yet his
Imps remained ſtill in him for ſome months tormenting
of his fleſh, and troubling of his mind, that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be at reſt, either ſleeping or waking: At length one
time when I went down to keep the fartheſt Lecture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſeven miles off, he asked me ſome Queſtions,
whereof this was one, <hi>viz.</hi> That if a Pawwaw had his
Imps gone from him, what he ſhould have inſtead of
them to preſerve him? Whereunto it was Anſwered,
That if he did beleeve in Chriſt Jeſus, he ſhould have
the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in him, which is a good and
a ſtrong Spirit, and will keep him ſo ſafe, that all the
Devils in Hell, and Pawwaws on Earth, ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do him any hurt; and that if he did ſet himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Imps, by the ſtrength of God they ſhould all
flee away like Muskeetoes: He told me, That he did
much deſire the Lord, it might be ſo with him. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaid, That ever ſince that very time God hath in
mercy delivered him from them, he is not troubled with
any pain (as formerly) in his Bed, nor dreadful viſions of
the night, but through the bleſſing of God, he doth lie
down in eaſe, ſleeps quietly, wakes in Peace, and walks
in ſafety, for which he is very glad, and praiſes God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118441:6"/>
This laſt ſpring, the Indians of their own accord made
a motion to me they might have ſome way ordered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, as a means whereby they might Walk in
good Subjection to the Law of God, wherunto they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to enter into Covenant; they told me that they were
very deſirous to have their ſins ſuppreſſed which God
did forbid, and the duties performed, which he hath
Commanded in his Word; and thereunto they deſired
me to inform them, what puniſhment the Lord did
appoint to be inflicted on thoſe which did break any
part of His Law, for they were very willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves to what the will of the Lord is in
this kind. I was not willing on the ſudden to draw forth
in writing an Anſwer to their deſire, but rather choſe to
take a longer time of Conſideration in a Work of ſo great
Concernment, and refer them to the Word of God,
ſhewing them many places for their information, moſt
whereof they had heard of formerly: They alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſired, That they might have ſome men Choſen
amongſt them with my father and my ſelf, to ſee that
the Indians did walk orderly, and that ſuch might be
incouraged, but that thoſe which did not, might be dealt
with acording to the word of the Lord; I could not but
approve and incourage the motion, ſeeing they ſpake
not as thoſe in <hi>Pſal. 2. 3. Let us break their bands aſunder and
caſt away their cords from us,</hi> but ſought totall ſubjection
and ſtrict obedience to God: yet I told them that it was
a matter of great weight, ſhewing them many things
which I thought neceſſary for them to know, but need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
now to relate. A day of faſting and prayer to repent
of our ſins, and ſeek the gracious help of our God for
Chriſt Jeſus ſake, we appointed; and another ſhortly
after to finiſh the work in: Some of the Indians ſpake
ſomthing for their benefit; and about ten, or twelve
<pb facs="tcp:118441:7"/>
of them prayed, not with any ſet Form like Children,
but like Men indued with a good meaſure of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God, their own wants, and the wants of others,
with much affection, and many Spiritual Petitions, ſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of a Heavenly mind; and ſo are they ſtreitned in
reſpect of help from man, that it appears the more
plainly to be the Dictates of Gods Spirit. A Platform
of the Covenant in Anſwer to their deſires, I drew forth
the ſame morning in the Indian Language, which I have
here ſent in Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Wee the diſtreſſed <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> (or <hi>Nope, the
Indian name of the Iſland)</hi> That beyond all memory have been
without the True God, without a Teacher, and without a Law,
the very Servants of Sin and Satan, and without Peace, for
God did juſtly vex us for our ſins; having lately through his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
heard of the Name of the True God, the Name of his Son Chriſt
Jeſus, with the holy Ghoſt, the Comforter, three Perſons, but
one moſt Glorious <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Name is <hi>JEHOVAH:</hi> We
do praiſe His Glorious Greatneſs, and in the ſorrow of our hearts,
and ſhame of our faces, we do acknowledg and renounce our great
and many ſins, that we and our Fathers have lived in, do run unto
him for mercy, and pardon for Chriſt Jeſus ſake; and we do this day
through the bleſſing of God upon us, and truſting to his gracious
help, give up our ſelves in this Covenant, Wee, our Wives, and
Children, to ſerve <hi>JEHOVAH:</hi> And we do this day chuſe
<hi>JEHOVAH</hi> to be our God in Chriſt Jeſus, our Teacher, our
Law-giver in his Word, our King, our Judg, our Ruler by his
Magiſtrates and Miniſters; to fear God Himſelf, and to truſt in
Him alone for Salvation, both of Soul and Body, in this preſent
Life, and the Everlaſting Life to come, through his mercy in
Chriſt Jeſus our Savior, and Redeemer, and by the might of his
Holy Spirit; to whom with the Father and Son, be all Glory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118441:7"/>
After I had often read this Covenant and expounded
it unto them, they all with free Conſent willingly and
thankfully joyned therein, and deſired <hi>Jehovah</hi> his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, the Lord be gracious to our
beginnings.</p>
            <p>Within two or three weeks there came an Indian to
me in buſineſs, and by the way he told me, that ſome
Indians had lately kept a day of Repentance to humble
themſelves before God in prayer, and that the word of
God which one of them ſpake unto, for their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was <hi>Pſal. 66. 7. He ruleth by his Power for ever, his eyes
behold the nations, let not the rebellious exalt themſelves.</hi> I
aſked him what their end was in keeping ſuch a day?
He told me thoſe ſix things: Firſt, they deſired, That
God would ſlay the rebellion of their hearts. Secondly,
That they might love God, and one another. Thirdly,
That they might withſtand the evil words and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of wicked men, and not to be drawn back from
God. Fourthly, That they might be obedient to the
good Words and Commands of their Rulers. Fiftly,
That they might have their ſins done away by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Jeſus Chriſt. And Laſtly, That they might
walk in Chriſts way.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſtate of things with us, we are by the
help of God about to begin a Town that they may
Cohabit and carry on things in a Civil and Religious way
the better; The praying Indians are conſtant attenders
to the word of the Lord, and ſome of them (I hope) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable
ſeekers after the knowledg of God, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and not without obtaining (by the grace of God)
ſome ſaving benefit to their own Souls, which will by his
own bleſſing, in the beſt time, more plainly appear.
About 30. Indian Children are now at School, which
began the Eleventh day of the Eleventh month. 1651.
<pb facs="tcp:118441:8"/>
they are apt to learn, and more and more are now ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in unto them. The Barbarous Indians, both men and
women, do often come on the Lecture dayes, and
complaining of their ignorance, diſliking their ſinful
liberty, and refuſing the helps, and hopes of their own
power, ſeek Subjection to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to be taught, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſaved by him, for Jeſus Chriſts ſake. The
Name of the Lord alone be praiſed for what is begun;
What is further needfull, I earneſtly deſire may be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
prayed for, and expected by faith, to be effected,
and finiſhed by the gracious hand of God, who have laid
the foundation, and will not leave his own works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
which is the comfort of an unworthy Laborer in
the Lords Vinyard, and an earneſt deſirer to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
at the Throne of Grace.</p>
            <p>Having a little more liberty, I ſhall certifie you of
ſomthing more, which I have taken notice of amongſt
the poor Indians.</p>
            <p>I obſerved that the Indians when they choſe their
Rulers, made choyce of ſuch as were beſt approved for
their godlineſs, and moſt likely to ſuppreſs ſin, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
holineſs, and ſince they have been forward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions, to ſhew their earneſt deſire thereof.
There was an Indian that was well approved for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that was ſuſpected to have told a plain Lye
for his Gain; the buſineſs was brought to the publick
Meeting, and there it was notably ſifted with zeal and
good affection; but at length the Indian defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with great diſdain, and hatred of ſuch an evil, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelf clear, and praiſed God for it. The ſame
Indian was a little before, very ſick, and he told me
that when he thought he ſhould die, he did ſo love God,
that he was not unwilling to die, and leave his wife, and
children, or any thing elſe, but that he was only deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb facs="tcp:118441:8"/>
to live for this cauſe, That he might be more
taught by the Word of God, and be helpful to teach the
Indians the Way of God.</p>
            <p>I have alſo obſerved how God is pleaſed to uphold
ſome of theſe poor Indians againſt oppoſition. I was
once down towards the further end of the Iſland, and
lodged at an Indians houſe, who was accounted a great
man among the Iſlanders, being the friend of a great
<hi>Sachem</hi> on the <hi>Mayn;</hi> this <hi>Sachem</hi> is a great Enemy to our
Reformation on the Iſland: At this mans houſe when I
had ſate a while, his ſon being about thirty years old,
earneſtly deſired me in his Language, to relate unto him
ſome of the ancient Stories of God; I then ſpent a great
part of the night (in ſuch diſcourſe as I thought fitteſt
for them) as I uſually do when I lodg in their houſes,
what he then heard (as he expreſſed) did much affect
him: And ſhortly after he came and deſired to joyn
with the praying Indians to ſerve <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but it was to
the great diſcontentment of the <hi>Sachems</hi> on the <hi>Mayn,</hi> and
thoſe Indians about him: News was often brought to
him that his life was laid in wait for, by thoſe that
would ſurely take it from him, they deſired him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with ſpeed to turn back again; The man came to me
once or twice, and I perceived that he was troubled, he
aſked my counſel about removing his Habitation, yet
told me, That if they ſhould ſtand with a ſharp weapon
againſt his breaſt, and tell him that they would kill him
preſently, if he did not turn to them, but if he would,
they would love him, yet he had rather loſe his life
than keep it on ſuch terms; for (ſaid he) when I look
back on my life as it was before I did pray to God, I ſee it
to be wholly naught, and do wholly diſlike it, and hate
thoſe naughty waies; but when I look on that way
which God doth teach me in his Word, I ſee it to be
<pb facs="tcp:118441:9"/>
wholly good; and do wholly love it. Bleſſed be God
that he is not overcome by theſe temptations.</p>
            <p>The next thing I judg alſo worthy to be obſerved,
My Father and I were lately talking with an Indian, who
had not long before almoſt loſt his life by a wound his
Enemies gave him in a ſecret hidden way, the mark
whereof, he had upon him, and will carry it to his grave:
This man underſtanding of a ſecret Plot that was to take
away his Enemies life, told my Father and I, That he
did freely forgive him for the ſake of God, and did tell
this Plot to us that the mans life might be preſerved:
This is a ſingular thing, and who among the Heathen
will do ſo?</p>
            <p>I obſerve alſo that the Indians themſelves do indeavor
to propagate the knowledg of God, to the glory of God
and the good of others: I heard an Indian (after I had
ſome diſcourſe with the Indians in the night) aſk the
<hi>Sachem,</hi> and many others together, how they did like that
counſel they heard from the word of God: They anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
very wel; then ſaid he, why do you not take it? why
do you not do according to it? He further added, I can
tell you why it is, Becauſe you do not ſee your ſins, and
becauſe you do love your ſins; for as long as it was ſo
with me, I did not care for the Way of God; but when
God did ſhew me my ſins, and made me hate them, then
I was glad to take Gods Counſel: this I remember
he ſpake, with ſome other things, with ſuch Gravity
and truth, that the <hi>Sachem</hi> and all the company was not
able to gain-ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Myoxeo</hi> alſo lately met with an Indian, which came from
the <hi>Mayn</hi> who was of ſome note among them; I heard
that he told them of the great things of God, and of
Chriſt Jeſus, the ſinfulneſs and folly of the Indians, the
Pardon of ſin by Chriſt, and of a good life; and ſo were
<pb facs="tcp:118441:9"/>
they both affected, that they continued this diſcourſe
two half nights, and a day, until their ſtrength was ſpent:
He told him in particular, how a Beleever did live above
the world, that he did keep worldly things alwaies at his
feet (as he ſhewed him by a ſign) That when they were
deminiſhed, or increaſed, it was neither the cauſe of his
Sorrow, or joy, that he ſhould ſtoop to regard them, but
he ſtood upright with his heart Heavenward, and his
whol deſire was after God, and his joy in him. Now
Much honored in the Lord, and all that love Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
in truth, let me prevail with you that we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by you at the Throne of Grace in his worthineſs
to obtain thoſe bleſſings, that concerns his Kingdom and

when the time of their accompliſhment is come. When

being to erect his own Kingdom, in the room of all thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,

of his Kingdom on Earth) that ſhall carry them forth to
advance Chriſt to rule over men in all affairs, by the word of

Judge, and King.</p>
            <p>It is a day of ſmall things with us: and that is Gods ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to make the ſingle beauty of his humbling Grace, to ſhine
in them, that are the verieſt ruines of mankind that are
known on earth; as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was wont to deſcribe the
forlorn condition of theſe poor <hi>Indians.</hi> I ſee evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
that Gods Spirit by his word hath taught them,
becauſe their expreſſions, both in Prayer, and in the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
which I have now publiſhed, are far more, and more full,
and ſpiritual, and various, then ever I was able to expreſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; in that poor broken manner of Teaching which I
have uſed among them. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ir turning Doctrins into their
own experience, which you may obſerve in their Confeſſions,
doth alſo demonſtrate the Teachings of Gods Spirit, whoſe
firſt ſpecial work is Application. Their different Gifts
likewiſe, is a thing obſervable in their Confeſſions, wherein
it is not to be expected that they ſhould be all Eminent, it is
not ſo in any Society of men; but in that there be ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them that are more eminent, it is a ſign of Gods favor,
<pb facs="tcp:118441:12"/>
who is raiſing up among themſelves, ſuch as ſhall be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
to conveigh a bleſſing unto the reſt. Their frequent
phraſe of Praying to God, is not to be underſtood of that
Ordinance and Duty of Prayer only, but of all Religion, and
comprehendeth the ſame meaning, with them, as the word
[Religion] doth with us: And it is obſervable, becauſe it
ſeemeth to me, That the Lord will make them a Praying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
and indeed, there is a great Spirit of Prayer powred
out upon them, to my wonderment; and you may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
That they who are aſſiſted to expreſs ſuch Confeſſions
before men, are not without a good meaſure of inlargement of
Spirit before the Lord.</p>
            <p>The points of Doctrine that are here and there dropped in
their Confeſſions, may ſuffice at preſent for a little taſte to the
Godly diſcerning Saints, That they are in ſome meaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the chief points of Salvation, though there be no
Doctrinal Confeſſion on purpoſe ſet down to declare what
they have learned, and do beleeve.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould conceive that that word which they ſo often
uſe <hi>[I thought,</hi> or <hi>I think]</hi> ſhould need explication, as a
godly Brother did intimate to me on the Faſt day, let this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
That it is to be Conſtrued by the preſent Matter: For
ſometimes it is a thought of Faith; ſometime of Fear;
ſometime of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief; ſometime of Carnal Reaſon; and
ſometime of Ignorance.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is plainly to be obſerved, That one end of Gods

in moſt of their Confeſſions.</p>
            <p>Beloved Reader, I have no more to ſay as neceſſary to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for the following Matter, only to beg, yea earneſtly to beg

the continuance of all your Prayers; by the power whereof

it and wait for it, as for that which in Gods appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

deſire it, and fervently to pray for it, as a thing
wherein the Glory of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt is not
a little concerned and intereſſed; for if the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

Him as to their King; and therfore it ſhould be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
craved of God by all his Saints in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that ſo it may be, according as the Sanctifying of
Gods Name, and the coming of his Kingdom are the
two firſt Petitions in that Rule and Pattern of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
commanded, and taught by our Savior to His
Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 9, 10. And no man needs to
doubt but that thoſe things which are matter for
Faith and Prayer to be exerciſed about their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment,
are matters of Thankſgiving when once
they come to paſs.</p>
            <p>Which being ſo, the godly Chriſtian, who ſhall
read or hear this enſuing Relation concerning the
workings of Gods Grace towards theſe Indians in
<hi>New-England,</hi> and the Confeſſions of ſundry amongſt
them, will, I doubt not, ſee abundant cauſe of
thankſgiving to the Lord therein. For hereby it
will appear, That the Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus
which every faithful ſoul, doth ſo much deſire to
ſee enlarged, is now beginning to be ſet up where it
never was before, even amongſt a poor people,
<pb facs="tcp:118441:14"/>
forlorn kind of Creatures in times paſt, who have
been without Chriſt, and without God in the world,
they and their Fathers, for I know not how many
Generations; yea, ſo far from knowing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
God in Chriſt, that they have been lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than the Beaſts that periſh. But now they
that were far off, the Lord is at work to make them
neer unto himſelf by the Blood of Jeſus, as <hi>Eph. 2.
13.</hi> that they which in time paſt were not a People,
might ere long become the People of God; and
they be called Beloved, which were not Beloved;
and in the place where it was ſaid unto them, <hi>Ye are
not my People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that there ere long, they might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Children of the Living God,</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 10. Rom.</hi>
9. 25, 26. which is the Lords doing, and it ought to
be marvelous in our eyes. And the truth is, there
are many marvels in it; marvelous free-grace, and
riches thereof, to look upon a People ſo wretched
and unworthy; yea, it were marvelous Grace ſo
much as once to offer the Salvation of God in Chriſt
to any ſuch as they are, being not only the poor and
maimed, halt and blind, but alſo, as it is in <hi>Luk, 14.
21.</hi> ranging and roving in the High-waies, and Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and yet behold, even theſe are not only invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but their hearts inclined to come in. Mavelous
Wiſdom and Power is in it alſo, that of matter ſo
rugged, and unlikely the Lord ſhould ever frame
and faſhion any gracious and holy building to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
which I hope He is now a doing. And to ſay
no more, His mervelous Soveraignty and Liberty is
therein to be obſerved alſo, who till now of late
hath ſeen meet never to look after this People, but
hath ſuffered them all this while to walk in their
own waies, waies of Sin, and waies of Death: yea,
<pb facs="tcp:118441:15"/>
and though there hath been Plantations of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
in the Country now 20. years and more, yea,
ſome a matter of 30. years, or thereabout, yet of all
this time (except ſome little workings in a few) no
conſiderable work of Grace hath appeared amongſt
the Indians till now of late; ſo true is that ſaying,
<hi>The times and ſeaſons, the Father hath put them in his own
Power, Act.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay, Oh but, we are doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any ſound and ſaving work be yet wrought in
them or no: Such an one I would wiſh ſeriouſly to
weigh and conſider the enſuing Confeſſions, and
then perhaps he will be better ſatisfied touching
this Point; for there he ſhall find many expreſſions
ſavoring of their clear ſight and ſence of ſin, and that
not only of groſs and external ſins, but alſo of ſuch
as are more inward in the Heart and Soul: Alſo he
ſhall find expreſſions tending to ſhew their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
all righteouſneſs and ſalvation by Chriſt alone.
Now conſidering how the Work of the Spirit of
God is ſaid by Chriſt Himſelf to conſiſt in great part
in convincing of ſin, and of righteouſneſs; of ſin in
mens ſelves, and of righteouſneſs in Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 16.
9.</hi> And conſidering alſo, how the leaſt beginnings
of Grace are accepted of him that would not
break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Flax, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20. And laſtly, conſidering
how it were not reaſonable to expect ſuch ripeneſs
in theſe people, as might be expected and found in
others, who have had more time and means, and
better help and breeding than theſe have had: If
theſe things I ſay be conſidered, it may be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
to hope the beſt in charity concerning
the Work of Grace in their Souls, as Charity hopeth
<pb facs="tcp:118441:15"/>
all things, beleeveth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. But thus
much at the leaſt I conceive is cleer, and cannot be
denied that ſince the Word of God hath been
taught and preached among them, the Spirit of the
Lord hath been working thereby in the hearts of
many of them ſuch Illumination, ſuch Conviction,
&amp;c. as may juſtly be looked at (if not as a full and
through Converſion, yet) as an hopeful beginning
and preparation thereto, if the Lord be pleaſed to
go on with what he hath begun, as I hope he will.
And if there were no more but only an hopeful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and preparative to Converſion, yet even
this were matter of much comfort to the Saints, and
of thankſgiving to the Lord; as it was in <hi>Iſrael</hi> at
the building of the Temple, when no more was yet
done, but only the foundation laid, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3. 10, 11.
yet even then they ſung for joy, giving praiſe and
thankſgiving to the Lord: How much more ſhould
it be ſo, if the Work of Regeneration be already
truly wrought in any of them, as I hope it is in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry;
In ſuch caſe, how ever it be with men on
Earth, ſure there is joy in Heaven amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of God, when there is ſo much as one ſinner
that is truly brought home to God by Repentance,
<hi>Luke</hi> 15. 7. 10.</p>
            <p>But how ſhall we know that the Confeſſions here
related, being ſpoken in their Tongue, were indeed
uttered by them in ſuch words, as have the ſame
ſignification and meaning with theſe that are here
expreſſed, for we have only the teſtimony of one
man to aſſure us of it? It is true, we have only the
teſtimony of one man for it; but yet it is ſuch an
one, as is unwillingly alone in this matter, having
ſeriouſly endeavored to have had divers other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
<pb facs="tcp:118441:16"/>
preſent at <hi>Natick</hi> that day, but could not
obtain what he did deſire and endeavor herein; a
man whoſe pious and painful labors amongſt this
People, have rendred him approved and highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
in the eyes of his Brethren about him, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
diligence, and earneſt love to the Lord
Jeſus, and their poor ſouls; a man whoſe integrity
and faithfulneſs is ſo well known in theſe Parts, as
giveth ſufficient ſatisfaction to beleev that he would
not wittingly utter a falſhood in any matter whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and much leſs ſo many falſhoods, &amp; that in ſuch
a publick manner, in the view of God &amp; the World,
as he muſt needs have done if he have coyned theſe
Confeſſions of his own head, and have not to his beſt
underſtanding truly related them in our Tongue,
according as they were uttered by them in theirs.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall then aſk, If there be ſuch a Work of
God amongſt them, Why were they not combined
and united into Church-Eſtate, when there was that
great Aſſembly at <hi>Natick,</hi> on the thirteenth of <hi>Octob.</hi>
laſt? Such an one may do well to conſider, that the
material Temple was many yeers in building, even
in the daies of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who wanted no helps and
furtherances thereunto, but was abundantly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
therewith, and longer in Re-edifying after the
Captivity; and therefore no marvel if the building
of a Spiritual Temple, an holy Church to Chriſt, and
a Church out of ſuch rubbiſh as amongſt Indians, be
not begun and ended on a ſudden; It is rather to be
wondered at, that in ſo ſhort a time, the thing is in
ſo much forwardneſs as it is. Beſides, It is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
matter to have Indians accepted and owned as a
Church amongſt themſelves, and ſo to be inveſted
with all Church-power as a Church, when yet they
<pb facs="tcp:118441:16"/>
are not furniſhed with any to be an able Paſtor and
Elder over them, by whom they might be directed
and guided in all the Affairs of the Church, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations
of the Houſe of God: this I conceive
is a far greater matter than the admitting of them as
Members into any Church or Churches of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
already ſo furniſhed; which latter (for ought I
know) might ſpeedily be done, and with much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
if it were ſuitable in regard of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Language, and the remoteneſs of their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
whereas to the former there ſeems to be a
great neceſſity, or expediency at the leaſt, that they
ſhould firſt be provided of ſome to be afterward ſet
over them in the Lord. Even amongſt the Engliſh,
when any company amongſt us have united them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into Church-Eſtate, it hath been uſual that
they have had one or other amongſt them upon
whom their eyes have been ſet, as intending them to
be Paſtors or Teachers to them; afterward, when
once they ſhould be combined as a Church, and
where it hath ſo been, they have found the comfort
and benefit of it; whereas thoſe few that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
otherwiſe, have found trouble and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
therein. And if it be ſo amongſt the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
who uſually have better abilities, how much
more amongſt the Indians, whoſe knowledg and
parts muſt needs be far leſs? Not to inſiſt upon the
Rehearſal of thoſe two Reaſons mentioned by the
Reverend Author of this Relation, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the time to furniſh the Work that day, and
the want of Interpreters, of whom there was not
any preſent himſelf. Concerning which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
I can freely ad my teſtimony, that thoſe two
were the principal, if not the only Reaſons which
<pb facs="tcp:118441:17"/>
that day were inſiſted on, and publickly rendred for
deferring the Inchurching of them to another
time.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome have thought, and I hear ſome
have ſpoken little leſs, That this whol buſineſs of
the Indians, of which there have been ſo many
ſpeeches in Old <hi>England</hi> and New, is but a deviſe
and deſign to get money, and that there is indeed
no ſuch matter as any Work of Gods grace amongſt
that People. But if there were any truth in this
ſaying or Surmiſe, I marvel why the Magiſtrates
and Elders then preſent at <hi>Natick,</hi> did upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
rendred, adviſe the deferring of the inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Indians that day, and why they did not
rather haſten forward the Work without any more
ado, or longer delay. For the report of a Church
of Indians would in all likelihood have more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
for the end alledged, than all that hath been
reported hitherto But our attending in this buſineſs
to the Honor of Jeſus Chriſt, and the good of this
poor peoples ſouls, and ſo to that which Rule and
right Reaſon required, rather than to what might
ſeem conducible for wordly advantage, may be a
ſufficient witneſs of our ſincerity, contrary to the
conceit and ſurmiſe afore mentioned, and a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
confutation of it. And yet though they be not
combined into Church-Eſtate, there is ſo much of
Gods Work amongſt them, as that I cannot but
count it a great evil, yea, a great injury to God and
his goodneſs for any to make light or nothing of it.
To ſee and to hear Indians opening their mouths,
and lifting up their hands and their eyes in ſolemn
Prayer to the Living God, calling on him by his
Name JEHOVAH, in the Mediation of Jeſus
<pb facs="tcp:118441:17"/>
Chriſt, and this for a good while together; to ſee
and hear them exhorting one another from the
Word of God; to ſee them and hear them confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Name of Chriſt Jeſus, and their own ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſure this is more than uſual. And though they
ſpake in a language, of which many of us underſtood
but little, yet we that were preſent that day, we
ſaw them, and we heard them perform the duties
mentioned, with ſuch grave and ſober countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
with ſuch comely reverence in geſture, and
their whol carriage, and with ſuch plenty of tears
trickling down the cheeks of ſome of them, as did
argue to us that they ſpake with much good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and holy fear of God, and it much affected
our hearts. Nor is it credible to me, nor for ought
I know to any that was preſent that day, that in
theſe things they were acted and led by that Spirit
which is wont to breath amongſt Indians, the Spirit
of Satan, or of corrupt Nature, but that herein they
had with them another Spirit.</p>
            <p>But if there be any work of Grace amongſt them,
it would ſurely bring forth, and be accompanied
with the Reformation of their diſordered lives, as
in other things, ſo in their neglect of Labor, and their
living in idleneſs and pleaſure. I confeſs the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is weighty, and I deny not but ſome ſober
and godly perſons, who do heartily wiſh well to this
work, have been as much troubled in their minds
touching this particular as any that I know of. But
yet ſomthing may be ſaid in anſwer therto, &amp; chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, That ſince the Word of God came amongſt
them, and that they have attended thereto, they
have more applied themſelves unto Labor than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly:
For evidence whereof, appeal my be made
<pb facs="tcp:118441:18"/>
to what was ſeen at <hi>Natick</hi> that day, and is ſtill to be
ſeen in that place, I mean the Grounds that they
have fenced in, and clawed and broken up, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
their capacious Meeting-houſe, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions
whereof are expreſſed in the Relation:
little did I think when I ſaw that Fabrick, but that
ſome Engliſh Carpenter or other had had the chief
hand in the framing and erecting of it; and that
more hands than Indians, yea, and more Engliſh than
one had been employed about it. But now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the Indians alone were the Builders of
it, it is a good teſtimony to me both of their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
and likewiſe of their Skill; for where theſe
are utterly wanting, yea, where there is not ſome
good meaſure of them, ſuch a Building I conceive
could never be raiſed. It is true, that conſidering
the manner of their bringing up, being little accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to labor, but the contrary, it is not much to
be marveled if they be not comparable therein to
ſome Engliſh, who from their Child-hood have
been trained up thereto; yet we ſee they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to it, and I hope will fall to it more and more;
let all that love their ſouls, pray for them that they
may, yea, let all that love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
pray for them, that the Work of God may ſtill proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
amongſt them, that many more of them may be
turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power
of Satan unto God; and that being converted they
may be preſerved in Chriſt, and be built up in him
to further growth and perfection, from day to day.
And let unfeigned thankſgiving be rendred to the
Lord by his Saints for all that is already wrought
amongſt them: And Oh, let the Engliſh take heed,
both in our dear Native Country, and here, leſt for
<pb facs="tcp:118441:18"/>
our unthankfulneſs, and many other ſins, the Lord
ſhould take the Goſpel from us, and beſtow our
mercy therein upon them, as upon a Nation that
would yeeld the fruits thereof in better ſort than
many of us have done. The ſins of the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to whom the Goſpel was firſt preached, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
God to take his Kingdom from them, and to
call in the Gentils: yet it appeareth by <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11.
14. 31. that this mercy vouchſafed to the Gentiles,
ſhall in time provoke the Jews to an holy Jealouſie,
and Emulation, to look after that mercy again that
once they refuſed, that ſo through the mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on the Gentiles, they (I mean the Jews)
might at laſt again obtain mercy. Happy were the
Engliſh if we could yeeld the fruits of Gods Goſpel,
that it might not be taken from us; and happy alſo
if the mercy coming to theſe Indians (though not
yet taken from us) might provoke us ſo to do, that
ſo the Kingdom of God, the Goſpel of Salvation,
being not taken from us, and given to them, but
though given to them, yet might ſtill continue with
us, and with our Poſterity from Generation to
Generation.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe <hi>Indians</hi> (the better and wiſer ſort of
them) have for ſome years inquired after
Church-Eſtate, Baptiſm, and the reſt of
the Ordinances of God, in the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof they ſee the Godly Engliſh to
walk. I have from time to time, delayed
them upon this point, That until they
were come up unto Civil Cohabitation, Government, and
Labor, which a fixed condition of life will put them upon,
they were not ſo capable to be betruſted with that Treaſure
of Chriſt, leſt they ſhould ſcandalize the ſame, and make it of
none effect, becauſe if any ſhould through temptation fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Cenſure, he could eaſily run away (as ſome have done)
and would be tempted ſo to do, unleſs he were fixed in an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
and had ſome means of livelihood to loſe, and leave
behind him: ſuch Reaſons have ſatisfied them hitherunto.
But now being come under Civil Order, and fixing themſelves
in Habitations, and bending themſelves to labor, as doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by their works of Fencings, Buildings &amp;c. and eſpecially
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118441:20"/>
in building, without any Engliſh Workmans help, or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a very ſufficient Meeting-Houſe, of fifty foot long twenty
five foot broad, neer twelve foot high betwixt the joynts, wel
ſawen, and framed (which is a ſpecimen, not only of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
ingenuity, and dexerity, but alſo of ſome induſtry) I
ſay this being ſo, now my argument of delaying them from
entering into Church-Eſtate, was taken away. Therefore in
way of preparation of them thereunto, I did this Summer call
forth ſundry of them in the dayes of our publick Aſſemblies
in Gods Worſhip; ſomtimes on the Sabbath when I could be
with them, and ſometimes on Lecture daies, to make confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before the Lord of their former ſins, and of their preſent
knowledg of Chriſt, and experience of his Grace; which they
ſolemnly doing, I wrote down their Confeſſions: which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done, and being in my own heart hopeful that there was
among them fit matter for a Church, I did requeſt all the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
about us to hear them reade, that ſo they might give me
advice what to do in this great, and ſolemn buſineſs; which
being done on a day appointed for the purpoſe, it pleaſed
God to give their Confeſſions ſuch acceptance in their hearts,
as that they ſaw nothing to hinder their proceeding, to try
how the Lord would appear therein. Whereupon, after a
day of Faſting and Prayer among our ſelves, to ſeek the Lord
in that behalf, there was another day of Faſting and Prayer
appointed, and publick notice thereof, and of the names of
Indians were to confeſs, and enter into Covenant that day,
was given to all the Churches about us, to ſeek the Lord yet
further herein, and to make ſolemn Confeſſions of Chriſt his
Truth and Grace, and further to try whether the Lord
would vouchſafe ſuch grace unto them, as to give them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
among the Saints, into the fellowſhip of Church-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and enjoyment of thoſe Ordinances which the Lord
hath betruſted his Churches withal. That day was the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of the eighth month.</p>
            <p>When the Aſſembly was met, the firſt part of the day was
ſpent in Prayer unto God, and exerciſe in the Word of God;
in which, my ſelf firſt; and after that, two of the Indians did
Exerciſe; and ſo the time was ſpent till after ten, or near ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118441:20"/>
of the clock. Then addreſſing our ſelves unto the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
work of the day, I firſt requeſted the reverend Elders
(many being preſent) that they would ask them Queſtions
touching the fundamental Points of Religion, that thereby
they might have ſome tryal of their knowledg, and better
that way, than if themſelves ſhould of themſelves declare
what they beleeve, or than if I ſhould ask them Queſtions in
theſe matters: After a little conference hereabout, it was
concluded, That they ſhould firſt make confeſſion of their
experience in the Lords Work upon their hearts, becauſe in
ſo doing, it is like ſomething will be diſcerned of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
in the Doctrines of Religion: and if after thoſe Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
there ſhould yet be cauſe to inquire further touching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Point of Religion it might be fitly done at laſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we ſo proceeded, and called them forth in order to
make confeſſion. It was moved in the Aſſembly by Reverend
Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> that their former Confeſſions alſo, as well as theſe
which they made at preſent, might be read unto the Aſſembly,
becauſe it was evident that they were daunted much to ſpeak
before ſo great and grave an Aſſembly as that was, but time
did not permit it ſo to be then: yet now in my writing of
their Confeſſions I will take that courſe, that ſo it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
what encouragement there was to proceed ſo far as we
did; and that ſuch as may reade theſe their Confeſſions, may
the better diſcern of the reality of the Grace of Chriſt in
them.</p>

               <head>The firſt which was called forth is named <hi>Tother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwamp,</hi>
whoſe former Confeſſion read before
the Elders, was as followeth:</head>
               <p>BEfore I prayed unto God, the Engliſh, when I came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their houſes, often ſaid unto me, Pray to God; but I
having many friends who loved me, and I loved them, and
they cared not for praying to God, and therefore I did not:
But I thought in my heart, that if my friends ſhould die, and
I live, I then would pray to God; ſoon after, God ſo
wrought, that they did almoſt all die, few of them left; and
then my heart feared, and I thought, that now I will pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and yet I was aſhamed to pray; and if I eat and did
not pray, I was aſhamed of that alſo; ſo that I had a double
ſhame upon me: Then you came unto us, and taught us, and
ſaid unto us, <hi>Pray unto God;</hi> and after that, my heart grew
ſtrong, and I was no more aſhamed to pray, but I did take
up praying to God; yet at firſt I did not think of God, and
eternal Life, but only that the Engliſh ſhould love me, and I
loved them: But after I came to learn what ſin was, by
the Commandements of God, and then I ſaw all my ſins, luſt,
gaming, &amp;c. (he named more.) You taught, That Chriſt
knoweth all our hearts, and ſeeth what is in them, if humility,
or anger, or evil thoughts, Chriſt ſeeth all that is in the
heart; then my heart feared greatly, becauſe God was angry
for all my ſins; yea, now my heart is full of evil thoughts,
and my heart runs away from God, therefore my heart fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and mourneth. Every day I ſee ſin in my heart; one
man brought ſin into the World, and I am full of that ſin, and
I break Gods Word every day. I ſee I deſerve not pardon,
for the firſt mans ſinning; I can do no good, for I am like the
Devil, nothing but evil thoughts, and words, and works. I
have loſt all likeneſs to God, and goodneſs, and therefore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118441:21"/>
every day I ſin againſt God, and I deſerve death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The firſt man brought ſin firſt, and I do every day ad
to that ſin, more ſins; but Chriſt hath done for us all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
and died for us becauſe of our ſins, and Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
us, That if we caſt away our ſins, and truſt in Chriſt,
then God will pardon all our ſins; this I beleeve Chriſt hath
done, I can do no righteouſneſs, but Chriſt hath done it for
me; this I beleeve, and therefore I do hope for pardon.
When I firſt heard the Commandements, I then took up
praying to God, and caſt off ſin. Again, When I heard,
and underſtood Redemption by Chriſt, then I beleeved Jeſus
Chriſt to take away my ſins: every Commandement taught
me ſin, and my duty to God. When you ask me, Why do I
love God? I anſwer, Becauſe he giveth me all outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
as food, clothing, children, all gifts of ſtrength, ſpeech,
hearing; eſpecially that he giveth us a Miniſter to teach us,
and giveth us Government; and my heart feareth leſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſhould reprove me: but the greateſt mercy of all is
Chriſt, to give us pardon and life.</p>

The Confeſſion which he made on the Faſt
day before the great Aſſembly, was as
followeth:</head>
               <p>I Confeſs in the preſence of the Lord, before I prayed, many
were my ſins, not one good word did I ſpeak, not one good
thought did I think, not one good action did I doe: I did act
all ſins, and full was my heart of evil thoughts: when the
Engliſh did tell me of God, I cared not for it. I thought it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
if they loved me: I had many friends that loved me, and
I thought if they died, I would pray to God: and afterward it
ſo came to paſs; then was my heart aſhamed, to pray I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed,
&amp; if I prayed not, I was aſhamed; a double ſhame was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118441:22"/>
upon me: when God by you taught us, very much aſhamed
was my heart; then you taught us that Chriſt knoweth all
our harts: therefore truly he ſaw my thoughts, and I had
thought, if my kindred ſhould die I would pray to God; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they dying, I muſt now pray to God: and therefore my
heart feared, for I thought Chriſt knew my thoughts: then I
heard you teach, <hi>The firſt man God made was named</hi> Adam, <hi>&amp; God
made a Covenant with him, Do and live, thou and thy Children;
if thou do not thou muſt die, thou and thy Children;</hi> And we are
Children of <hi>Adam</hi> poor ſinners, therefore we all have ſinned,
for we have broke Gods Covenant, therefore evil is my heart
therefore God is very angry with me, we ſin againſt him every
day; but this great mercy God hath given us, he hath
given us his only Son, and promiſeth, That whoſoever belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved: for Chriſt hath dyed for us in
our ſtead, for our ſins, and he hath done for us all the words
of God, for I can do no good act, only Chriſt can, and only
Chriſt hath done all for us; Chriſt have deſerved Pardon for
us, and riſen again, he hath aſcended to God, and doth ever
pray for us; therefore all Beleevers Souls ſhall goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Chriſt. But when I heard that word of Chriſt, Chriſt
ſaid <hi>Repent and Beleeve,</hi> and Chriſt ſeeth <hi>who Repenteth,</hi> then I
ſaid, dark and weak is my Soul, and I am one in darkneſs, I am
a very ſinful man, and now I pray to Chriſt for life. Hearing
you teach that Word that the Scribes and Phariſees ſaid
<hi>Why do thy Diſciples break the Tradition of the Fathers?</hi> Chriſt
anſwered, <hi>Why do ye make void the Commandements of God?</hi>
Then my heart feared that I do ſo, when I teach the Indians,
becauſe I cannot teach them right, and thereby make the
word of God vain. Again, Chriſt ſaid <hi>If the blind lead the
blind they will both fall into the ditch;</hi> Therfore I feared that I
am one blind, and when I teach other Indians I ſhal cauſ them
to fall into the ditch. This is the love of God to me, that he
giveth me all mercy in this world, and for them al I am thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
but I confeſs I deſerve Hell; I cannot deliver my ſelf, but I
give my Soul and my Fleſh to Chriſt and I truſt my ſoul with
him for he is my Redeemer, and I deſire to call upon him
while I live.</p>

This was his Confeſſion which ended, Mr. <hi>Allin</hi> further

               <p>His anſwer was; I am aſhamed of all my ſins, my heart is

               <p>BEfore I heard of God, and before the Engliſh came into
this Country, many evil things my heart did work,
many thoughts I had in my heart; I wiſhed for riches, I
wiſhed to be a witch, I wiſhed to be a Sachem; and many ſuch
other evils were in my heart: Then when the Engliſh came,
ſtill my heart did the ſame things; when the Engliſh taught
me of God (I coming to their Houſes) I would go out of their
doors, and many years I knew nothing; when the Engliſh
taught me I was angry with them: But a little while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
after the great ſikneſs, I conſidered what the Engliſh
do, and I had ſome deſire to do as they do; and after that I
began to work as they work; and then I wondered how the
Engliſh come to be ſo ſtrong to labor; then I thought I ſhall
quickly die, and I feared leſt I ſhould die before I prayed to
God; then I thought, if I prayed to God in our Language,
whether could God underſtand my prayers in our Language;
therefore I did ask Mr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mahu,</hi> If God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
prayers in our Language? They anſwered me, God
doth underſtand all Languages in the World. But I do not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118441:23"/>
know how to confeſs, and little do I know of Chriſt; I fear
I ſhall not beleeve a great while, and very ſlowly; I do not
know what grace is in my heart, there is but little good in
me; but this I know, That Chriſt hath kept all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
for us, and that Chriſt doth know all our hearts;
and now I deſire to repent of all my ſins: I neither have done,
nor can do the Commandements of the Lord, but I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of all I do, and I do repent of all my ſins, even of all that
I do know of: I deſire that I may be converted from all my
ſins, and that I might beleeve in Chriſt, and I deſire him; I
diſlike my ſins, yet I do not truly pray to God in my heart:
no matter for good words, all is the true heart; and this day
I do not ſo much deſire good words, as throughly to open my
heart: I confeſs I can do nothing, but deſerve damnation;
only Chriſt can help me and do for me. But I have nothing
to ſay for my ſelf that is good; I judg that I am a ſinner, and
cannot repent, but Chriſt hath deſerved pardon for us.</p>

Confeſſion read before the Elders, was as
followeth:</head>
               <p>I Confeſs that before I prayed, I committed all manner of
ſins, and ſerved many gods: when the Engliſh came firſt,
I going to their Houſes, they ſpake to me of your God, but
when I heard of God, my heart hated it; but when they ſaid
the Devil was my god, I was angry, becauſe I was proud:
when I came to their houſes I hated to hear of God, I loved
luſt in my own houſe and not God, I loved to pray to many
gods. Five years ago, I going to Engliſh houſes, and they
ſpeaking of God, I did a little like of it, yet when I went again
to my own houſe, I did all manner of ſins, and in my heart I
did act all ſins, though I would not be ſeen by man. Then
going to your houſe, I more desired to hear of God; and my
heart ſaid, I will pray to God ſo long as I live: then I went to
the Miniſter Mr. <hi>Browns</hi> houſe, and told him I would pray as
long as I lived; but he ſaid I did not ſay it from my heart, and
I beleeve it. When <hi>Wahan</hi> ſpake to me that I ſhould pray to
God, I did ſo. But I had greatly ſinned againſt God, and had
not beleeved the Word, but was proud: but then I was angry
with my ſelf, and loathed my ſelf, and thought God will not
forgive me my sins. For when I had been abroad in the woods
I would be very angry, and would lye unto men, and I could
not find the way how to be a good man: then I beleeved your
teaching, That when good men die, the Angels carry their
ſouls to God; but evil men dying, they go to Hell, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
for ever. I thought this a true ſaying, and I promiſed
to God, to pray to God as long as I live. I had a little grief
in my heart five years ago for my sins: but many were my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118441:24"/>
prides; ſomtime I was angry with my ſelf, and pityed my
ſelf; but I thought God would not pardon ſuch a proud heart
as mine is: I beleeve that Chriſt would have me to forſake my
anger; I beleeve that Chriſt hath redeemed us, and I am
glad to hear thoſe words of God; and I deſire that I might
do al the good waies of God, and that I might truly pray
unto God: I do now want Graces, and theſe Chriſt only
teacheth us, and only Chriſt hath wrought our redemption,
and he procureth our pardon for all our sins; and I beleeve
that when beleevers dy, Gods Angels carry them to Heaven:
but I want faith to beleeve the Word of God, and to open my
Eyes, and to help me to caſt away all sins; and Chriſt hath
deſerved for me eternall life: I have deſerved nothing my
ſelf; Chriſt hath deſerved all, and giveth me faith to beleeve
it.</p>

The Confeſſion which he made on the faſt day before
the great Aſſembly was as followeth.</head>
               <p>BEfore I prayed to God, I commited all sins; and ſerving
many gods. I much deſpiſed praying unto God, for
I beleeved the Devil, and he did dayly teach me to sin, and I
did them: ſomtimes hearing of God my heart did hate it, and
went to my own houſe, becauſe I did love to commit all sin
there. About Six years ago, a little I liked to hear of God,
and yet I hated that which was good: hearing that <hi>Cutſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moquin</hi>
prayed, then I thought I will pray alſo: a year after,
I heard of praying to God, and I went to Mr. <hi>Browns</hi> houſe
and told him I will pray to God as long as live; he ſaid, I
doubt of it, and bid me cut off my hair, and I did ſo preſently;
and then I desired to be like God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and to call
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118441:24"/>
on him, but I found it very hard to beleeve; yet I thought, I
wil pray as long as I live. Hearing that Word, That Chriſt dyed
for us, was buried &amp; roſe again, and hearing of that Word alſo,
Seek peace &amp; imbrace the Word: then I began to beleeve that
Chriſt died for us, for sin; and I ſaw my heart very full of sin.
And hearing that word, That Chriſt went to the Mount <hi>Olives,</hi>
and aſcended, I beleeved and thought, Oh that God would
pardon me; but I fear he will not, becauſe I have been ſo long
time a sinner. Somtime I am angry with my ſelf, for my
many Evil thoughts in my heart; and to this day I want grace,
and cannot confeſs, becauſe I have been ſo great a sinner: and
this day I confeſs, a little I pray, and that I can pray but a little
and weakly. When I heard that word of God, That all from
the rising to the ſetting Sun ſhall pray I firſt under ſtood it
it not, and wondered how it ſhould be: after I ſaw that
when they beleeve and obey God, then he will teach them
to do right things, and God will teach us to do al things
for God, ſleeping and waking to be with God. But
ſtill do fooliſhly, and not according to my prayer: I cannot
get pardon of my sins, for my sins are great in thought,
word, and deed: and no man can caſt off his own sins, but
that is the work of Chriſt only to work it in us; a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make a right prayer but when Chriſt aſſiſteth him; then
we ſhall do all things well. I beleeve that Chriſt is God, and
the Son of God becauſe when he dyed, he roſe again, and he
dyed for our ſins; and I beleeve he is in Heaven and ever pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for us, and ſendeth his goſpel unto us: and I am angry with
my ſelf, becauſe I do not beleeve the word of God, and goſpel
of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

followeth.</head>
               <p>I Confeſs my ſorrow for all my ſins againſt God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men: When I firſt heard inſtruction, I beleeved not,
but laughed at it, and ſcorned praying to God; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when we were taught at <hi>Cohannet</hi> (that is the place
where he lived) I ſtill hated praying, and I did think of
running away, becauſe I cared not for praying to God; but
afterwards, becauſe I loved to dwell at that place, I would
not leave the place, and therefore I thought I will pray to
God, becauſe I would ſtill ſtay at that place, therefore I
prayed not for the love of God, but for love of the place
I lived in; after that I deſired a little to learn the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme
on the Lecture daies, and I did learn the ten
Commandements, and after that, all the points in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme;
yet afterwards I caſt them all away again, then
was my heart filled with folly, and my ſins great ſins; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by hearing, I began to fear, becauſe of my
many ſins, leſt the wiſe men ſhould come to know them,
and puniſh me for them; and then again I thought of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away becauſe of my many ſins: But after that I thought
I would pray rightly to God, and caſt away my ſins; then
I ſaw my hypocricy, becauſe I did ask ſome queſtions,
but did not do that which I knew: afterward I conſidered
of my queſtion, and thought I would pray to God, and
would consider of ſome other Queſtion, and I asked this,
Queſtion, <hi>How ſhould I get Wiſdom?</hi> and the Anſwer to it
did a little turn my heart from sin, to ſeek after God; and I
then considered that the Word of God was good; then I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118441:25"/>
to God becauſe of the Word of God. The next Lecture day
you taught that word of God, <hi>If any man lack Wiſdom, let
him ask it of God, who giveth freely to them that ask him, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth
no man, James,</hi> 1. 5. Then again a little my heart was
turned after God, the Word alſo ſaid, <hi>Repent, mourn, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> this alſo helped me on. Then you
taught, <hi>That he that beleeveth not Chriſt, and repenteth not of
ſin, they are fooliſh and wicked; and becauſe they beleeve not, they
ſhall periſh:</hi> then I thought my ſelf a fool, becauſe I beleeved
not Chriſt, but ſinned every day, and after I heard the Word,
I greatly broke the Word. But afterward I heard this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of God, <hi>Who ever repenteth and beleeveth in Chriſt, God
will forgive him all his ſins, he ſhall not periſh;</hi> then I thought,
that as yet, I do not repent, and beleeve in Chriſt: then I
prayed to God, becauſe of this his Promiſe; and then I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to God, for God and for Chriſt his ſake: after that again
I did a little break the Word of Chriſt. And then I heard
ſome other words of God, which ſhewed me my ſins, and my
breakings of Gods word; and ſometimes I thought God and
Chriſt would forgive me, becauſe of the promiſe to them
that beleeve in Chriſt, and repent of ſin, I thought I did that
which God ſpake in the Promiſe. Then being called to confeſs,
to prepare to make a Church at <hi>Natick,</hi> I loved <hi>Cohannet;</hi>
but after hearing this inſtruction, <hi>That we ſhould not only be
Hearers, but Doers of the Word,</hi> then my heart did fear. And
afterward hearing that in <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chriſt ſaw two brethren
mending their Nets, he ſaid, <hi>Follow me and I will make you
Fiſhers of men,</hi> preſently they followed Chriſt; and when I
heard this, I feared, becauſe I was not willing to follow Chriſt
to <hi>Natick;</hi> they followed Chriſt at his Word, but I did not,
for now Chriſt ſaith to us, <hi>follow Me:</hi> then I was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and conſidered of this Word of God. Afterward I
heard another word, the blind men cryed after Chriſt and
ſaid, <hi>Have mercy on us thou Son of David,</hi> but after they came
to Chriſt, he called them, and asked them, <hi>What ſhall I do for
you?</hi> they ſaid, <hi>Lord open our eyes;</hi> then Chriſt had pity on
them, and opened their eyes, and they followed Chriſt;
when I heard this, my heart was troubled, then I prayed to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118441:26"/>
God and Chriſt, to open mine eyes, and if Chriſt open my
eyes, then I ſhall rejoyce to follow Chriſt: then I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of both theſe Scriptures, and I a little ſaw that I muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt. And now my heart deſireth to make confeſſion
of what I know of God, and of my ſelf, and of Chriſt: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that there is only one God, and that he made and ruleth
all the World, and that he the Lord, giveth us al good things:
I know that God giveth every day all good mercies, life, and
health, and all; I have not one good thing, but God it is that
giveth it me, I beleeve that God at firſt made man like God,
holy, wiſe, righteous; but the firſt man ſinned, for God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
him, <hi>If thou do my Commandements, thou ſhalt live, and
thy children; but if thou ſin, thou ſhalt die, thou and thy children;</hi>
this Covenant God made with the firſt man. But the firſt
man did not do the Commandements of God, he did break
Gods Word, he beleeved Satan; and now I am full of ſin,
becauſe the firſt man brought ſin; dayly I am full of ſin in my
heart: I do not dayly rejoyce in Repentance, becauſe Satan
worketh dayly in my heart, and oppoſeth Repentance, and
all good Works; day and night my heart is full of ſin. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that Jeſus Chriſt was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> God
promiſed her ſhe ſhould bear a Son, and his Name ſhould be
JESUS, becauſe he ſhall deliver his people from their ſins:
And when Chriſt came to preach, he ſaid, <hi>Repent, becauſe the
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> again Chriſt taught, <hi>Except ye
repent and become as a little child, ye ſhall not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven;</hi> therefore humble your ſelves like one of
theſe little children, and great ſhall be your Kingdom in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Again Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and
heavy laden with ſin, and I will give you reſt: take up my Croſs,
and Yoak, learn of me, for I am meek, and ye ſhall find reſt to
your ſouls, for my yoak is eaſie, and burden light:</hi> theſe are the
Words of Chriſt, and I know Chriſt he is good, but my works
are evil: Chriſt his words are good, but I am not humble;
but if we be humble and beleeving in Chriſt, he pardons all
our ſins. I now deſire to beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe of
the word of Chriſt, that I may be converted and become as a
little Child. I confeſs my ſins before God, and before Jeſus
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118441:26"/>
Chriſt this day; now I deſire all my ſins may be pardoned;
I now desire repentance in my heart, and ever to beleeve in
Chriſt; now I lift up my heart to Chriſt, and truſt him with
it, becauſe I beleeve Chriſt died for us, for all our ſins, and
deſerved for us eternal life in Heaven, and deſerved pardon
for all our ſins. And now I give my ſoul to Chriſt becauſe he
hath redeemed: I do greatly love, and like repentance in my
heart, and I love to beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt, and my heart is
broken by repentance: al theſe things I do like wel of, that they
may be in my heart, but becauſe Chriſt hath all theſe to give,
I ask them of him that he may give me repentance, and faith
in Chriſt, and therefore I pray and beſeech Chriſt dayly for
repentance and faith; and other good waies I beg of Chriſt
dayly to give me: and I pray to Chriſt for al theſe gifts and
graces to put them in my heart: and now I greatly thank
Chriſt for all theſe good gifts which he hath given me. I
know not any thing, nor can do any thing that is a good work:
even my heart is dark dayly in what I ſhould do, and my ſoul
dyeth becauſe of my ſins, and therefore I give my ſoul to
Chriſt, becauſe I know my ſoul is dead in ſin, and dayly doth
commit ſin; in my heart I ſin, and all the members of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are ſinful. I beleeve Jeſus Chriſt is aſcended to Heaven
through the clouds, and he will come again from Heaven:
Many ſaw Chriſt go up to Heaven, and the Angels ſaid, even
ſo he will come again to judg all the world; and therefore I
beleeve Gods promiſe, That all men ſhall riſe again when
Chriſt cometh again, then all ſhall riſe, and all their ſouls
comes again becauſe Chriſt is truſted with them, and keeps
their ſouls, therefore I desire my ſins may be pardoned; and
I beleeve in Chriſt; and ever ſo long as I live, I will pray to
God, and do all the good waies he commandeth.</p>

The Confeſſion which he made on the Faſt
day before the great Aſſembly was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth</head>
               <p>I Confeſs my sins before the Lord, and before men this day:
a little while ſince I did commit many ſins, both in my
hands and heart; luſts thefts, and many other sins, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day: and after I heard of praying to God, and that others
prayed to God, my heart did not like it, but hated it, yea
and mocked at it; and after they prayed at <hi>Cohannet</hi> I ſtil
hated it, and when I heard the Word I did not like of it, but
thought of running away, becauſe I loved ſin: but I loved the
place of my dwelling, and therfore I thought I wil rather pray
to God, and began to do it; a little I deſired to learn the ten
Commandements of God, and other points of Catechiſme;
and then a little I repented, but I was quickly weary of
repentance, and fell again to sin, and full of evil thoughts was
my heart: and then I played the Hypocrite, and my heart was
full of sin: I learned ſome things, but did not do what
God commanded, but I sinned and playd the Hypocrite;
ſome things I did before man, but not before God. But
afterward I feared becauſe of my ſins, and feared puniſhment
for my ſins, therefore I thought again I would run away;
yet again I loving the place, would not run away, but
would pray to God: and I asked a Queſtion at the Lecture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which was this, <hi>How I ſhould get wiſdom?</hi> the Anſwer made
me a little to underſtand: but afterward I heard the word
<hi>If any man lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to all that ask, and upbraideth none.</hi> But then I did fear
Gods anger, becauſe of all my ſins, becauſe they were great.
Afterward hearing that Word, That Chriſt is named <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
becauſe he redeemeth us from all our ſins: I thought Chriſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118441:27"/>
would not ſave me, becauſe I repent not, for he ſaveth only
penitent Beleevers; but I am not ſuch an one, but ſtill a day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſinner. Afterward hearing that Word, <hi>Bleſſed are they
that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled:</hi>
then I thought I am a poor ſinner, and poor is my heart: then
I prayed to God to teach me to do that which he requireth,
and to pray aright. Afterward hearing that word, <hi>Who ever
looks upon a Woman to luſt after her, hath already committed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultry
with her in his heart;</hi> then I thought I had done all
manner of ſins in the sight of God, becauſe he ſeeth luſt in the
heart, and knoweth all the evil thoughts of my heart; and
then I did pray unto God, <hi>Oh! give me Repentance and Pardon.</hi>
Afterwards when I did teach among the Indians, I was much
humbled becauſe I could not reade right, and that I
ſinned in it; for I ſaw that when I thought to do a good
work, I ſinned in doing it, for I knew not what was right,
nor how to do it. In the night I was conſidering of my ſins,
and could not find what to do: three nights I conſidered what
to do, and at laſt God ſhewed me mercy, and ſhewed me
what I ſhould do. And then I desired to learn to read Gods
Word, and hearing that if we ask wiſdom of God, he will
give it, then I did much pray to God, that he would teach me
to reade. After a years time, I thought I did not rightly
ſeek, and I thought I sinned, becauſe I did not rightly desire
to read Gods Word, and I thought my praying was sinful,
and I feared, how ſhould I, my wife, and child be cloathed, if
I ſpend my time in learning to reade; but then God was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to me, and ſhewed me that Word, <hi>Say not, what ſhall I
eat, or drink, or wherewith ſhall I be cloathed, wicked men ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
theſe; but firſt ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven, and theſe things
ſhall be added to you;</hi> then I pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yed God to teach me this word,
and that I might do it: and then I desired to read Gods word,
what ever I wanted. Afterward hearing that we muſt make
a Town, and gather a Church at <hi>Natick,</hi> my heart diſliked
that place; but hearing that word, <hi>That Chriſt met two Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers,
and ſaid, follow me, and I will make you fiſhers of men, and
they preſently left all and followed him;</hi> hearing this, I was much
troubled, becauſe I had not beleeved Chriſt, for I would not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118441:28"/>
follow him to make a Church, nor had I done what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me, and then I was troubled for all my ſins. Again
hearing that word, <hi>That the blind man called after Chriſt, ſaying,
thou Son of</hi> David <hi>have mercy on me; Chriſt asked him what he
would have him do, he ſaid, Lord open my eyes;</hi> and preſently
Chriſt gave him ſight, and he followed Chriſt: then again
my heart was troubled, for I thought I ſtill beleeve not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I do not follow Chriſt, nor hath he yet opened mine
eyes: then I prayed to Chriſt to open mine eyes, that I might
ſee what to do, becauſe I am blind and cannot ſee how to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt, and do what he commandeth, and I prayed to
Chriſt, Teach me Lord what to do, and to do what thou
ſayeſt; and I prayed that I might follow Chriſt: and then
I thought I will follow Chriſt to make a Church. All this
trouble I had to be brought to be willing to make a Church:
and quickly after, God laid upon me more trouble, by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and death; and then I much prayed to God for life, for
we were all ſick, and then God would not hear me, to give
us life; but firſt one of my Children died, and after that my
Wife; then I was in great ſorrow, becauſe I thought God
would no hear me, and I thought it was becauſe I would
not follow him, therefore he hears not me: then I found
this ſin in my heart, That I was angry at the puniſhment of
God: but afterward I conſidered, I was a poor ſinner, I have
nothing, nor Child, nor Wife, I deſerve that God ſhould
take away all mercies from me; and then I repented of my
ſins, and did much pray, and I remembred the promiſe to
follow Chriſt, and my heart ſaid, I had in this ſinned, that
followed not Chriſt, and therefore I cryed for pardon of this
ſin: and then hearing of this Word, <hi>Who ever beleeveth in
Chriſt, his ſins are pardoned, he beleeving that Chriſt died for us;</hi>
and I beleeved. Again hearing that Word, <hi>If ye be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and become as a little Child, you cannot go to Heaven;</hi> then
my heart thought, I do not this, but I deſerve Hell fire for
ever; and then I prayed Chriſt, Oh! turn me from my ſin,
and teach me to hear thy Word; and I prayed to my Father
in Heaven: and after this, I beleeved in Chriſt for pardon.
Afterward I heard that Word, That it is a ſhame for a man
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118441:28"/>
to wear long hair, and that there was no ſuch cuſtom in the
Churches: at firſt I thought I loved not long hair, but I
did, and found it very hard to cut it off; and then I prayed
God to pardon that ſin alſo: Afterward I thought my heart
cared not for the Word of God: but then I thought I would
give my ſelf up unto the Lord, to do all his Word. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
I heard that word, <hi>If thy right foot offend thee, cut it off,
or thy right hand, or thy right eye; its better to go to Heaven with
one foot, or hand, or eye, than having both to go to Hell;</hi> then I
thought my hair had been a ſtumbling to me, therefore I cut
it off, and grieved for this fin, and prayed for pardon. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hearing that word, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and
heavie laden with your ſins, and I will give reſt to your ſouls;</hi> then
my heart thought that I do dayly hate my ſins, Oh! that I
could go to Chriſt! and Chriſt looketh I ſhould come unto
him, therfore I will go unto him, and therfore then I prayed,
Oh! Chriſt help me to come unto thee: and I prayed becauſe
of all my ſins that they may be pardoned. For the firſt man
was made like God in holineſs, and righteouſneſs, and God
gave him his Covenant; but <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, beleeving the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
therefore God was angry, and therefore all we Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Adam</hi> are like the Devil, and dayly ſin, and break e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Law of God, full of evil thoughts, words, and works,
and only Chriſt can deliver us from our ſins, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
in Chriſt is pardoned; but my heart of my ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
beleeve: Satan hath power in me, but I cry to God, Oh!
give me faith, and pardon my ſin, becauſe Chriſt alone can
deliver me from Hell; therefore I pray, Oh! Jeſus Chriſt
deliver me. Chriſt hath provided the new Covenant to ſave
Beleevers in Chriſt, therefore I deſire to give my ſoul to
Chriſt, for pardon of all my ſins: the firſt Covenant is broke
by ſin, and we deſerve Hell; but Chriſt keepeth for us the
new Covenant, and therfore I betruſt my ſoul with Chriſt.
Again, I deſire to beleeve in Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt will come
to judgment, and all ſhall riſe again, and all Beleevers in
this life ſhall then be ſaved; therefore I deſire to beleeve
Chriſt, and mortifie ſin as long as I live; and I pray Chriſt to
help me to beleeve: and I thank God for all his mercies eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118441:29"/>
day: and now I confeſs before God that I loath my ſelf for
my ſins and beg pardon.</p>
               <p rend="indent">Thus far he went in his Confeſſion; but they being ſlow
of ſpeech, time was far ſpent and a great aſſembly of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh

and a great confusion was in the Houſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
and I perceived that the graver ſort thought the
time long, therfore knowing he had ſpoken enough unto
ſatisfaction (at leaſt as I judged) I here took him off.
Then one of the Elders asked, if I took him off, or
whether had he finiſhed? I anſwered, That I took him
off. So after my reading what he had ſaid, we called
another.</p>

               <p>VVHen God firſt had mercy on us, when they

firſt word that I heard was, <hi>That all from the riſing of the

Oh! let it be ſo. After I considered what the word may be,
and underſtood by it, That God was mercyfull; afterwards
when you alwayes came to us, I only heard the word, I
did not underſtand it, nor meditate on it, yet I found that
al my doings were sins againſt God; then I prayed unto God.
Afterwards I heard, That God would pardon all that beleeve
in Chriſt! and quickly after I ſaw my sins to be very many;
I ſaw that in every thing I did, I sinned: &amp; when I ſaw theſe my
sins againſt God, I was weary of my ſelf, &amp; angry with my ſelf
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118441:29"/>
in my heart; but the free mercy of God, cauſed me to hear
his word, and then I feared becauſe every day sin was in my
heart, and I thought in vain I looked to Chriſt: Then hearing
this word of Chriſt, that Chriſt taught through every town,
and village, <hi>Repent and beleeve.</hi> If any one repent, and mourn,
and beleeve, I will pardon him; then my heart thought I
will pray to God as long as I live: but ſomtimes my heart was
aſhamed, and ſomtimes my heart was ſtrong, and God ſeeth
my heart: I now desire to repent, and beleeve in Chriſt,
and that Chriſt will pardon me, and ſhew mercy to us all.</p>

His Second Confeſſion was as followeth:</head>
               <p>WHen I prayed not unto God I ever sinned every day:
but when <hi>Noonanetam Indians</hi> firſt prayed, I heard
of it, and three nights I conſidered whether I ſhould pray
or no, but I found not how to pray unto God, but how not
to pray: but then I heard Gods free mercy in his word,
call all to pray, <hi>from the riſing of the Sun to the going down
thereof;</hi> yet preſently I loſt that word, and ſinned again,
and committed many ſins. Then Gods free mercy ſhewed me
in the Catechiſm, <hi>That God made all the World,</hi> yet my heart did
not beleeve, becauſe I knew I ſprung from my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
I did alwaies act many ſins, becauſe I was born in ſin, and
in vain I heard Gods word. Then I heard Gods Word, <hi>That
Chriſt was made man,</hi> yet I did but hear it, though I thought
it might be true: I thought I would caſt off all sin, but
then I found that I loved them very much. I heard Gods
promiſe to <hi>Abraham, To increaſe his Children as the Stars for
number,</hi> but I beleeved not, becauſe he had but one Son:
and thus I caſt off the word, and committed sins. I heard
alſo from the word, That all men are not alike to God, ſome
are firſt to God, [or preferred before other;] but I did
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118441:30"/>
not beleeve it becauſe all men die alike; therefore they are
not the Sons of God, and God is not their Father: So ſtill
I beleeved not the Word, but broke Gods Word dayly, and
in vain I heard Gods Word. Afterward I heard that Word of
God to <hi>Moſes, I'le be with thy mouth, for who maketh the ſeeing
Eye, or hearing Ear, is it not I?</hi> ſaith the Lord: then I underſtood
a little of God, and of his Word; but ſtill I acted much ſin.
Afterward I heard that Word of Free-Grace, <hi>Repent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the Goſpel, and who ever beleeve ſhall be ſaved;</hi> then my heart
beleeved, then I ſaw I had prayed but afore man, &amp; ſo was my
hearing, or any other duty; and I ſaw other of my ſins againſt
God; and then I ſaw that my heart did not beleev as it ſhould,
&amp; I deſired to be open in my doings; I ſaw I brake every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God: yet preſently I loſt this, and the Word of Chriſt
was of little worth unto me; and I ſaw I loved ſin very much.
Then again I heard that word, That all ſhall pray from the
riſing to the ſitting Sun; then I thought I will pray to God,
and yet only my tongue prayed. Then again I heard the
Catechiſm, That God made <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and al the world,
and a little I beleeved that word. Afterward I heard ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
word, <hi>That they are Baſtards, not Sons, whom God afflicts
not:</hi> I did a little think this to be a truth, and then I prayed
more unto God, and yet I ſaw I feared man more than God:
but notwithſtanding, I have prayed unto God from that day
unto this day; yet I ſee <hi>I</hi> ſin every day. When I heard that
Word that God ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount by a Trumpet,
and ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not have any other God, thou ſhalt not luſt,
nor lye, nor kill, &amp;c.</hi> I ſaw all theſe I had broken; I heard the
Word, but ſinned in what I heard: I heard that my heart
muſt break and melt for ſin, and beleeve in Chriſt, and that
we ſhould try our hearts if it be ſo; yet I could try but little,
nor find but little, but ſtill I ſinned much. I heard that
Word, That they which caſt off God, God will caſt off them;
and I feared leſt God ſhould caſt me away, becauſe of my
ſins: I was aſhamed of my ſins, and my heart melted, and I
thought I wil give my ſelf to God, and to Chriſt, and do
what he will for ever; and becauſe of this promiſe of pardon
to al that repent and beleeve, my heart deſireth to pray to
God as long as I live.</p>

not beleeve it, becauſe I knew I ſprang from my Father and
Mother, and therefore I deſpiſed the Word, and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I did act all ſins, and I did love them. Then God was
merciful to me, to let me hear that Word, That al ſhal pray

I ſhould pray, but I found not in my heart that all ſhould
pray: but then I conſidered of praying, and what would
become of me if I did not pray, and what would become of
me, if I did pray; but I thought if I did pray, the <hi>Sacbems</hi>
would be angry, becauſe They did not ſay, pray to God, and
therefore I did not yet pray; but conſidering of that word,
that all ſhall pray, I was troubled, and I found in my heart
that I would pray unto God; and yet I feared that others
would laugh at me, and therefore I did not yet pray. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
God was yet merciful to me, and I heard that God
made the World, and the firſt man, and I thought it was
true, and therefore I would pray to God, becauſe he hath
made all; and yet when I did pray, I thought I prayed not
aright, becauſe I prayed for the ſake of man, and I thought
this to be a great ſin. But then I wondered at Gods free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to me, for I ſaw God made me, and giveth me all mercies:
and then was I troubled, and ſaw that many were my ſins,
and that I do not yet beleeve; then I prayed, yet my heart ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for I prayed only with my mouth: and then I repented
of my ſins, and then a little I conſidered and remembred
Gods love unto us: but I was a ſinner, and many were my

sins, and a little I repented of them; and yet again I sinned,
and quickly was my heart full of sin: then again was my
heart angry with my ſelf, and often I loſt all this again, and
fell into sin. Then I heard that word, <hi>That God ſent</hi> Moſes
<hi>to</hi> Egypt, <hi>and promiſed I will be with thee;</hi> that promiſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
but I thought that in vain I did ſeek, and I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
that I did ſo: and I prayed, Oh God teach me truly
to pray, not only before man, but before God, and pardon al
theſe my sins. Again I heard that word, that Chriſt taught
through every Town and Village, <hi>Repent and beleeve, and be
ſaved,</hi> and a little I beleeved this word, and I loved it, and
then I ſaw all my ſins, and prayed for pardon. Again I heard
that word, He that caſteth off God, him will God caſt off;
and I found in my heart, that I had done this, and I feared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of this my sin, leſt God ſhould caſt me off, and that I
ſhould for ever periſh in Hell, becauſe God hath caſt me off, I
having caſt of God: then I was troubled about Hell, and
what ſhall I do if I be damned! Then I heard that word, If ye
repent and beleeve, God pardons all sins; then I thought,
Oh that I had this, I desired to repent and beleeve, and I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of God, Oh give me Repentance and Faith, freely do it
for me; and I ſaw God was merciful to do it, but I did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Lord, only ſometimes; and I now confeſs I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of my sins, my heart is broken, and melteth in me; I

               <p rend="indent">By ſuch time as this man had finiſhed, the time was far
ſpent, and he was the fift in number, their ſpeeches being ſlow,
and they were the more ſlow at my requeſt, that I might write
what they ſaid; &amp; oft I was forced to inquire of my interpreter
(who ſat by me) becauſe I did not perfectly underſtand ſome
ſentences, eſpecially of ſome of them: theſe things did make
the work long-ſom, considering the inlargement of ſpirit God
gave ſome of them; and ſhould we have proceeded further,
it would have been ſun-ſet before the Confeſſions in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

besides all this, though I had fully uſed all fit means, to have

might not depend upon my single teſtemony, yet
ſo it was that they all failed, and I was alone (as I have been

be neglected in ſo ſolemn a busineſs. Wherfore the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
Elders, and Grave Men preſent, adviſed together what
to do, and the Concluſion was, Not to proceed any further
at preſent, yet ſo to carry the matter, as that the Indians
might in no wiſe be diſcouraged, but encouraged; to which
end, one of the Elders was requeſted to ſpeak unto the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
the two above ſaid Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> The want of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
And want of Time, to finiſh at this time ſo ſolemn a

to declare it to the Indians, which I did to this purpoſe,
That the Magiſtrates, Elders, and other Chriſtian People pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
did much rejoyce to hear their Confeſſions, and adviſed
them to go on in that good way; but as for the gathering a
Church among them this day, it could not be; partly, Becauſe
neither Mr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Leveridg.</hi> nor any Interpreter
was here (for whom they knew I had ſent, ſome of themſelves
being the Meſſengers to carry Letters time enough) and it was
Gods Ordinance, That when any were to judg a Caſe, though
they could beleeve one Witneſs, yet they could not judg un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
two or three. Alſo I told them, That themſelves might
easily ſee there was not time enough to finiſh ſo ſolemn a work
this day; therefore they adviſed, and God called to refer it
to a fitter ſeaſon; in which advice they reſted: And ſo was
the Work of that day, with prayers unto God, finiſhed; the

yea, and a greater advantage than I had before, becauſe this
diſpenſation of the Lord, doth give me occaſion to inſtruct
them of their need to be filled with deeper apprehenſions of
the weight and ſolemnity of that great Work, though it is
moſt true, that they alſo came on unto it with many fears,
and queſtions, what they ſhould do when they ſhould be a
Church: When therefore I ſaw the Lord by the Counſel of
his Servants (which is an holy reverend Ordinance of Chriſt)
and by his Providence denying me the help of all Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
having many witneſſes how much care and pains I took
every way I knew, to be ſupplied therein; and that the work
it ſelf was extended by the Lords gracious inlarging them in
their Confeſſions, ſo that the day was not ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
it; I ſay, when I ſaw the Lord ſpeaking that dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
word, I cannot expreſs what a load it took off my heart,
and I did gladly follow the Lord therein, yea, and I bleſs
the Lord for that day, that it was carried ſo far as it was, for
the cauſe of Chriſt hath many waies gained by it, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of the precious Saints, being much comforted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in their hopes of this work of Chriſt among them,
and their faith and prayers much quickned by what they
heard and ſaw. And becauſe all witneſſes failed me, let me
ſay but this, I began, and have followed this work for the
Lord according to the poor meaſure of grace received, &amp; not
for baſe ends. I have been true &amp; faithful unto their ſouls, and
in writing and reading their Confeſſions, I have not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
or willingly made them better, than the Lord helped
themſelves to make them, but am verily perſwaded on good
grounds, that I have rather rendered them weaker (for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118441:32"/>
moſt part) than they delivered them; partly by miſſing ſome
words of weight in ſome Sentences, partly by my ſhort and
curt touches of what they more fully ſpake, and partly by
reaſon of the different Idioms of their Language and ours.</p>

               <p>VVHen I firſt prayed to God, I did not fear God, but
I feared perdition, becauſe the Engliſh had told me,
that all ſhould be damned, that call not upon God. But now
I know that God made all the world, and I fear him;
now I beleeve that which you teach is true; Now I beleeve
that God calleth us to <hi>Natik,</hi> that here we may be ruled by
God, and gather a Church; now I beleeve that it is Gods
Command, that we ſhould labor Six dayes, and keep the
Sabbath on the Seventh day: now my heart is greatly abaſed
for all my ſins; for we ſee though we pray to God we are
ready to offend each other, and be angry with each other, and
that we love not each other as we ſhould do; and for this I
grieve &amp; my heart crieth: now I remember that God ſaith thou
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118441:33"/>
ſhalt not luſt, but before I prayed to God I was full of luſts.
God ſaith, We muſt have but one Wife, and at firſt did
make but one man and one woman; but I followed many
women. God ſaith, Remember to keep the Sabbath day ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but I did hunt, or ſhoot, or any thing on the Sabbath day:
many other ſins I committed; but now I ſee them, and wil caſt
them away becauſe they are vile, and God forbiddeth them:
when I prayed firſt my sins were not pardoned, for my praying
is worth nothing: now I am humbled, and mourn for my sins
and yet cannot deliver my ſelf nor get pardon, therfore I truſt
Chriſt with my ſoul.</p>

but only I did as my friends did, becauſe I loved them;
and though I prayed to God, yet I did not fear ſin, nor was
I troubled at it. I heard that when good men die, their
ſouls go to God, and are there happy, but I cannot ſay that
I beleeved it. Afterward my heart run away into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
after our old wayes, and I did almoſt caſt off praying to
God. A little while after that, I ſaw that I had greatly ſinned,
and then I ſaw all my ſins, afore I prayed to God, and ſince I
prayed to God, and I ſaw that God was greatly angry for
them, and that I cannot get pardon for them; but yet my heart
ſaith I will pray to God as long as I live: I thought God
would not pardon me, and yet I would caſt away my ſins. I
did greatly love hunting, and hated labor: but now I beleeve

This Confeſſion being ſhort in ſome main points, he
afterward made Confeſſion as followeth.</head>
               <p>WHen I firſt prayed I prayed not for my ſoul, but
for the ſake of men, I loved men, and for their ſakes
I prayed to God. Before I prayed many were my ſins,
and my heart was heaped full, and ran over in all
manner of luſts and ſins. After I heard of praying to God, I
let it fall and regarded it not; after I came to hear the word,
I ſometimes feared, but ſoon loſt it again. Then my heart
ran away after our former courſes, and then what ever I heard
I loſt, becauſe my heart was run away; and many were my
ſins, and therfore I could not get pardon, becauſe my heart run
away, and many were my ſins, and I did indeed go into the
Country. But afterwards, I hearing the Catechiſm, I deſired
to learn it, and then I beleeved that when Beleevers die, their
ſouls go to God, and are ever happy; when Sinners die, their
ſouls go to Hel and are ever tormented; and that when Chriſt
judges the world, our bodies riſe again, and then we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the judgment of Chriſt; the good ſhal ſtand at his right
hand, the bad at his left: this I beleeved was true, and then I
ſaw all my great follies and evils: and now my heart deſired
to lay by hunting, and to work every day; and this is Gods
Command, and therfore a good way; God ſaid, Thou ſhalt
work ſix daies, and if thou work, thou ſhalt eat; therfore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it, and my heart promiſeth that I will this do as long as I
live. Now I ſee I did great folly, for now I hear that God ſaith
<hi>Work;</hi> and now I fear becauſe God hath afflicted me, in taking
away my brother a Ruler: now I am troubled, I fear I ſinned
in not beleeving our Ruler, becauſe now God hath taken him
away; he taught me good words, but I beleeved them not,
and now I repent becauſe Chriſt calleth me to it: great
is the puniſhment of God in taking away our Ruler;
and now I pray, and ſay to Chriſt, Oh Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118441:34"/>
Chriſt I have ſinned: I beleeve that if I repent and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and pray not only outwardly but inwardly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in Chriſt, then God will pardon all my ſin; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get pardon of ſin, I cannot deſerve pardon, but only
Chriſt hath merited pardon for us: I cannot deliver my ſelf
from all my ſins, but Chriſt redeemeth, and delivereth from

               <p>I am dead in ſin, Oh! that my ſins might die, for they
cannot give life, becauſe they be dead: before I prayed
to God, I did commit all filthyneſſe, I prayed to many gods,
I was proud, full of luſts, adulteries, and all others ſins,
and therefore this is my firſt Confeſſion, that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and I am a ſinner, for God have given unto me inſtruction
and cauſeth me to pray unto God, but I only pray words;
when I prayed, I ſomtimes wondered, and thought true it is
that God made the world, and me: and then I thought I
knew God, becauſe I ſaw theſe his works, and then I was glad
ſomtimes, and gave thanks; yet preſently again I did not
rejoyce in it. Again ſomtimes I thought, now I do wel
becauſe I pray, and work not on the Sabbath daies, but come
to the Meetings, and hear the Word of God: But afterward
again, I thought I do not wel, becauſe true it is, That yet I do
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118441:36"/>
not truly pray; for now I ſee I ſin when I pray, becauſe
there is nothing but ſin in my mouth, or hand, or heart, and
all ſins are there, for of theſe my ſins my heart is full, becauſe
my heart doth ſometimes luſt, and ſteal, and the like. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I was not only proud before I prayed, but now I am
proud. Again, ſometimes my heart is humbled, and then
I pray, Oh God have mercy on me, and pardon theſe my
ſins; yet ſometimes I know not whether God did either hear
my prayer, or pardon my ſins. Again, afterwards I thought
I had greatly ſinned, becauſe I heard of the good way of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying
unto God, but I do wickedly becauſe I pray not truly,
yea, ſometimes I have much ado to pray with my mouth, and
therfore I ſin. I heard of that good way, to keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
and not to work on that day, and I did ſo: but yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I ſinned in it, becauſe I did not reverence the Word of
God; yea, and ſometimes I thought that working on the
Sabbath was no great matter. Again, I heard it was a good
way to come to the Meetings, and hear the word of God, and
I deſired to do it; but in this alſo I ſinned, becauſe I did not
truly hear: yea, ſometimes I thought it no great matter if I
heard not, and cared not to come to hear, and ſtill I ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Then I thought God was angry, becauſe I have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſinned; deſiring to do well, and yet again to ſin. When
I deſired to do well, then I ſinned, and in all things I ſinned.
But afterward I was angry with my ſelf, and thought I will
not ſin again; and what God ſaith, is good, but I am ſinful
becauſe I have done all theſe evils. Again, ſometimes my
heart is humbled, and then I repent, and ſay, Oh God and
Jeſus Chriſt, have mercy on me, and pardon my ſins. Now I
deſire truly to pray; now I deſire to reverence the Word every
Sabbath day: now I deſire to hear the Word of God truly;
now I deſire to bend my heart to pray, and it may be God
will hear me: but quickly after a temptation cometh to my
heart, and I did not deſire it. Again, ſometimes I did think,
true it is I can do nothing of my ſelf, but Jeſus Chriſt muſt
have mercy on me, becauſe Chriſt hath done for me all Gods
Commandements and good Works, therfore my heart ſaith,
Oh Jeſus give me deſires after thee: ſometimes I think it is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118441:36"/>
true, I have greatly ſinned againſt God, but great are his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
ſometimes I hear the Word on the Sabbath day, and
he giveth it me, [that is, maketh it my own] ſometimes I ſay
the great and mighty God is in Heaven, but theſe are but
words, becauſe I do not fear this great and mighty God; and
I ſometimes regard not Gods Word, and make it of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
becauſe I do not that which is good, but commit ſin:
ſometimes I ſay I know Chriſt, becauſe I know he died for us,
and hath redeemed us, and procured pardon for us: yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I ſay I ſin, becauſe I beleeve not Chriſt, for that only is
right to beleeve in Chriſt, and do what he ſaith; but I think
I do this in vain, becauſe I yet do not truly beleeve in Jeſus
Chriſt, nor do what he commandeth, and therefore my heart
plays the hypocrite; and now I know what is hypocriſie,
namely, when I know what I ſhould do, and yet do it not.
Sometimes I think I am like unto Satan, becauſe I do al theſe
ſins, and ſin in all things I do; if I pray I ſin, If I keep
Sabbath I ſin, if I hear Gods Word I ſin, therefore I am like
the Devil. Now I know I deſerve to go to Hell, becauſe all
theſe ſins I have committed: then my heart is troubled, and I
ſay, Oh God and Chriſt pardon all my ſin, for I cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my ſins my ſelf; for the firſt man brought ſin into the
world, and therfore I am ſinful, therfore I pray thee O Lord
pardon all the ſins which I have done. Again, ſometimes
my heart is humbled, and I deſire to fear God, becauſe he is
a great God, and I deſire to do what he ſaith, and now I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to do the right way, and now I deſire to beleeve Jeſus
Chriſt; and ſometimes I think it may be God will hear me,
it may be he will pardon me, yet again I think I cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of ſin; but now I am aſhamed of all my ſins, and my

of: yet then again I ſometimes ſay to God, I cannot my ſelf
be humbled, or break my heart, or caſt off ſin, but I pray
thee O Jeſus help me to do it. Again, ſometimes I confeſs
this is true, I cannot redeem my ſelf, nor deliver my ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

or pray to God; yet I went about to ſeek how to pray to
God. I told the wiſe men, I ſeek how to pray to God, and
all of them could not find how to pray to God. Afterward
I had a deſire to pray God, leſt I ſhould loſe my ſoul, but my
heart run away, and I could not find how to pray to God,
and therefore I thought of going away; yet I alſo thought
if I do go away, I ſhall loſe my ground. But after this I
heard of Gods anger againſt me, and I beleeved it; for God
made the firſt man good, and told him if he did well he
ſhould live, and this day I beleeve all men ſhould do ſo: and
then I thought I will pray as long as I live, and I will labor,

When ſome prayed to God, I went with them, but I did not
know God. Afterward my mind was changed thus far,
That I deſired to be wiſe, as others were, but yet I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of God; yea, after I prayed to God. I ſtill did
think there was no God. Afterward I found this in my heart,
That we pray to God for our ſouls, then I thought all my
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118441:38"/>
praying was nothing, becauſe I was ſo fooliſh that I never
thought of dying: but after, I learned, That all muſt die,
and good mens ſouls go to Heaven; and then I thought of
dying, and of my ſoul: but then I thought we prayed for
nothing but that our ſouls might go to Heaven; I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Chriſt. But after, when the Children were Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed,
and taught the ten Commandements, I hearkned, and
by them I came to know that there was a God, and that there
was ſin againſt God; and hereby God made me to ſee all my
ſins, both before I prayed to God, and ſince; and I ſaw Gods
anger againſt me for my ſins, before, and ſince I prayed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſometimes I came not to the Meeting; brake my word,
regarded not my children, and I ſee ſin in me, and therfore
I do greatly fear Gods anger.</p>

all ſins againſt God, coveting other mens goods; when I

angry with them; and thus I did every day: I would ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

with my neighbors, my heart was alwaies full of ſuch waies.
When the Engliſh ſaid, Pray to God, I cared not for God,
becauſe I loved ſin, nor did I deſire that God ſhould forgive
my ſin. Afterward I heard the word, That if we truly pray,
mourn for ſin, caſt off ſin; deſire to hear the word, and beleeve
in Chriſt, God will then pardon, and when he dieth Chriſt
will lead him to Heaven: I much rejoyced to hear of this

that was of no value; but we muſt beleeve in Chriſt, elſe there
is no pardon; and this I rejoyced at.</p>

               <p>FIve years ago, before I prayed I was ſick, I thought I ſhould
die; at which I was much troubled, and knew not what
to do; then I thought, if there be a God above, and he give

God did give me life: and after that I took up praying to
God. Now I beleeve God, one God that made all the World,
and governeth it, yet this I only ſaid with my mouth, I did
not truly beleeve it in my heart. Then I underſtood, That
God made the firſt man good, and like God, but he ſinned,

ſometimes I am ſlow to fear; I am very fooliſh becauſe I

not know all my ſins, I know but a little of the ſins I have
committed, therefore I thought I could not pray to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I knew not al my ſins before I prayed to God, and ſince I
heard of praying to God: formerly when the Engliſh did bid
me pray unto God I hated it, and would go out of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
when they ſpake of ſuch things to me. I had no delight
to hear any thing of Gods Word, but in every thing I ſinned;
in my ſpeeches I ſinned, and every day I broke the Commands
of God. After I heard of praying to God, that <hi>Waban</hi> and
my two brothers prayed to God, yet then I deſired it not, but
did think of running away; yet I feared if I did run away ſome
wicked men would kill me, but I did not fear God. After
when you ſaid unto me, pray, my heart thought, I will pray;
yet again I thought, I cannot pray with my heart, and no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for praying with words only: but when I did pray, I ſaw
more of my ſins; yet I did but only ſee them, I could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of them, but ſtill I did commit them: and after I prayed
to God, I was ſtill full of luſt, and then a little I feared. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I was ſick, and then I thought God was angry, and then
I ſaw that I did commit all ſins: then one of my brothers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and then my heart was broken, and after him another
friend, and again my heart was broken: and yet after all this
I broke my praying to God, and put away God, and then I
thought I ſhall never pray to God: but after this I was afraid
of the Lord, becauſe I alwaies broke my praying to God, and
then my heart ſaid, God doth nor hear my prayer. When I
was ſick, and recovered again, I thought then that God was
merciful unto me. Hearing that word of God, <hi>If you hear
the Word of God, and be forgetful hearers, you ſin againſt God;</hi>
then I thought God will not pardon ſuch a ſinner as I, who
dayly did ſo, and broke my praying to God. When I heard the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118441:40"/>
Commandements, I deſired to learn them, and other points of
Catechiſm, but my desires were but ſmall, and I ſoon loſt it,
becauſe I did not desire to beleeve: then ſometimes I feared
Gods anger becauſe of al my sins; I heard the Word and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
only this word, <hi>All you that hear this day, it may be
you ſhall quickly die,</hi> and then I quickly ſaw that God was very
angry with me. Then God brake my head, and by that I ſaw
Gods anger; and then I thought that the true God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is angry with me for my sin, even for al my sins, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day I live, I do. When I was almoſt dead, ſome body
bid me now beleeve, becauſe it may be I ſhal quickly die, and
I thought I did beleeve, but I did not know right beleeving in
Chriſt: then I prayed unto God to reſtore my health. Then
I beleeved that word, <hi>That we muſt ſhortly appear before Jeſus
Chriſt;</hi> then I did greatly fear leſt if I beleeved not, I ſhould
periſh for ever. When I was neer death, I prayed unto God,
<hi>Oh Lord give me life, and I will pray to God ſo long as I live,</hi> and I
ſaid, <hi>I will give my ſelf, ſoul, and body to Chriſt:</hi> after this, God
gave me health, and then I thought, truly, God in Heaven is
merciful; then I much grieved, that I knew ſo little of Gods
Word. And now ſometimes I am angry, and then I fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I know God ſeeth it: and I fear, becauſe I promiſed
God when I was almoſt dead, that if he giveth me life, I
will pray ſo long as I live; I fear leſt I ſhould break this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

beg faith in Chriſt, and I deſire to live unto God, ſo long as I

What good will it be if my ſoul go to Heaven? But
two years ago, I began to think, I had ſinned againſt God;

hear the Word of God; and then I purpoſed to pray

Chriſt God will pardon our ſins, this day I rejoyce to hear

               <p>The Story is this,</p>
               <p>THis Spring, in the beginning of the yeer, 1652. the Lord
was pleaſed to afflict ſundry of our praying Indians with
that grievous diſeaſe of the Bloody-Flux, whereof ſome with
great torments in their bowels died; among which were two
little Children of the age above-ſaid, and at that time both in
one houſe, being together taken with that diſeaſe. The firſt
of theſe Children in the extremities of its torments, lay crying
to God in theſe words, <hi>God and Jeſus Chriſt, God and Jeſus
Chriſt help me;</hi> and when they gave it any thing to eat, it
would greedily take it (as it is uſual at the approach of death)
but firſt it would cry to God, <hi>Oh God and Jeſus Chriſt, bleſs it,</hi>
and then it would take it: and in this manner it lay calling
upon God and Jeſus Chriſt untill it died: The mother of this
Child alſo died of that diſeaſe, at that time. The Father of
the Child told me this ſtory, with great wonderment at the
grace of God, in teaching his Child ſo to call upon God. The
name of the Father is <hi>Niſhohkou,</hi> whoſe Confeſſion you have
before.</p>
               <p>Three or four daies after, another Child in the ſame houſe,
ſick of the ſame diſeaſe, was (by a divine hand doubtleſs) ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the approach of death, (an unuſual thing at that age)
and called to its Father, and ſaid, <hi>Father, I am going to God,</hi>
ſeveral times repeating it, <hi>I am going to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The mother (as
other mothers uſe to do) had made for the Child a little Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
a little Spoon, and a little Tray: theſe things the child
was wont to be greatly delighted withal (as all children will)
therefore in the extremity of the torments, they ſet thoſe
things before it, a little to divert the mind, and cheer the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
but now, the child takes the Basket, and puts it away, and
ſaid, <hi>I will leave my Basket behind me, for I am going to God, I
will leave my Spoon and Tray behind me</hi> (putting them away)
<hi>for I am going to God:</hi> and with theſe kind of expreſſions, the
ſame night, finiſhed its courſe, and died.</p>
               <p>The Father of this child is named <hi>Robin Speen,</hi> whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118441:42"/>
you have before, and in one of them he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this child that died in faith. When he related this
ſtory to me, he ſaid, He could not tell whether the ſorrow for
the death of his child, or the joy for its faith were greater,
when it died.</p>
               <p>Theſe Examples are a teſtimony, That they teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
the knowledg and fear of God, whom they now call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and alſo that the Spirit of God co-worketh with their
inſtructions, who teacheth by man, more than man is able to
do.</p>
               <p>I have now finiſhed all that I purpoſe to publiſh at this
time; the Lord give them Acceptance in the hearts of his
Saints, to engage them the more to pray for them; and Oh!
that their judgings of themſelves, and breathings after Chriſt,
might move others (that have more means than they have, but
as yet regard it not) to do the like, and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
