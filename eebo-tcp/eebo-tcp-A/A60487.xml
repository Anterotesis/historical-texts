            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE intendment of this Preface is not to court the Reader into an high esteem of either these <hi>Discourses</hi> or their <hi>Author,</hi> (the <hi>Discourses</hi> will best speak what they are, and for the <hi>Author,</hi> his own Works will praise him;) but only to give a clear and plain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what concerns <hi>This Edition,</hi> and withall to observe Something concerning the <hi>Discourses</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the <hi>Author</hi> of them, not unnecessary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for the Reader to be acquainted with.</p>
            <p>The Papers now published I received from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's <note place="margin">Of this Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Executor, Mr. <hi>Samuel Cradock</hi> (then Fellow of <hi>Emmanuel</hi> College, now Rector of <hi>North-Cadbury</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset-shire,)</hi> whose Beneficence to the publick in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting these Treasures I thought worthy to be here in the first place gratefully remembred.</p>
            <p>Having taken a more general view of these, and some other, Papers (divers of which were loose and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, not being written by the Author in any Book,) my First care was to collect such as were Homogeneal and related to the same Discourse; as also to observe where any new additional Matter was to be inserted; (For the Author, whose Mind was a rich &amp; fruitful soil, a bountiful &amp; ever-bubling Fountain, sometimes would superadde upon further thoughts some other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations to what he had formerly delivered in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and this he would doe sometimes after he had gone


<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:66374:3"/>
off from that Argument, and though Matter of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature had come between.) This emploiment I found at first sufficiently perplex'd and toilsome; but through more then once reading over the Manuscripts, I got through those difficulties, and dispatch'd that First trouble. And I am well assured that the severed Parts, and also the additional Considerations, are brought to their due and proper places where the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself would have disposed them, if he had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed his Papers.</p>
            <p>And now I found that I stood in need of more Hands and Eyes then mine own for the fair transcribing of the Papers (otherwise impossible to be printed) as also for the examining of the material Quotations in this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume: and in this Labour I had the assistance of some Friends to whom the memory of the Author was very pretious. As for some short Allusions and Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons borrow'd out of ancient Authors, serving rather for <hi>Ornament</hi> then <hi>Support</hi> of the Matter in hand, there seem'd to be less need of being sollicitous about all of them: But for the other Testimonies, which are many and weighty, there were but Few (some possibly among such a number of Quotations might escape) that were not examin'd; and I am sure that this labour was not unnecessary and in vain, how wearisome soever it was, especially where the Authors, or the places in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, were not mention'd.</p>
            <p>And then for the sake of such Readers whose Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had not acquainted them with some of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages wherein many of the Testimonies were represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (being otherwise men of good accomplishments, and capable to receive the designed benefit of these Papers) it seemed expedient to render the Latine, but especially the Hebrew and Greek, Quotations into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish;


<pb n="v" facs="tcp:66374:3"/>
(except in such places where, the substance and main importance of the Quotations being insinuated in the neighbouring words, a Translation was less needful.) For the Author seldom translated the Hebrew, and more seldom the Greek, but into Latine; as conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he delivered these Discourses in the College-Chappel before an Auditory not needing any such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descensions as are requisite in the publishing of these Papers for the benefit of some Readers.</p>
            <p>To dispatch this First part of the Preface which concerns the Preparations to this Edition, I shall add only one thing more; That whereas the Papers now published (especially those that contain'd the Six first Discourses) were written in the Author's own Copy without any Distinction or Sections, <hi>(uno tenore &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuâ serie,</hi> as the Jews observe of the ancient writing of the Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The whole Law was but as one Verse;)</hi> it seem'd expedient for the Reader's accomodation to distinguish them into several <hi>Discourses</hi> or <hi>Treatises</hi> (the Title-page to each <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> giving a <hi>General</hi> account of the Matter contain'd therein) and the <hi>Discourses</hi> themselves into <hi>Chapters</hi> and <hi>Sections</hi> (except the <hi>Discourses</hi> were short, as two or three of them are, which therefore have the <hi>Contents</hi> set in the Beginning) and before the <hi>Chapters</hi> to give a <hi>Particular</hi> account of the Chief matters therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; that so the Reader might have a clearer and fuller view (as of the strength and importance, so also) of the Contexture of the whole, and the Coherence of the several Parts of the respective Discourses: which otherwise would not be so easily discerned by every Reader, especially where there are some <hi>Excursions</hi> and <hi>Digressions</hi> in any of the Treatises, (things not unusual in the Writings or Discourses of other men, when the


<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:66374:4"/>
Notion does strongly affect and possess their Minds, and their Phansies are therefore more active and vigorous) and some such <hi>Digressions</hi> the Reader will meet with here more then once; though even therein he will see that the Author did still <hi>respicere titulum,</hi> and kept the main designe alwaies in his Eye. Nor does the Author in these <hi>Digressions</hi> lead the Reader a little out of the way, only to see <hi>a Reed shaken with the wind,</hi> an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary trifle, some slight and inconsiderable Object; but for better purposes; that he might the better present to the perspicacious Reader something which is worthy his Observation: and therefore these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> being usually of such importance, need not be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely censured by rigid Methodists, if any such chance to read these Treatises.</p>
            <p>This is a plain Account of some Instances of the care and labour preparatory to this Edition; of all which I accounted the Author of these Discourses to be most <note place="margin">Of the Author.</note> worthy: For I considered him as <hi>a Friend,</hi> one whom I knew for many years, not only when he was Fellow of Queen's Col. but when a Student in Emman. Col. where his early Piety and the remembring his Creator in those days of his youth, as also his excellent improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the choicest parts of Learning, endear'd him to many, particularly to his careful Tutor, then Fellow of Emman. Col. afterwards Provost of Kings College, <hi>Dr. Whichcote;</hi> to whom for his Directions and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of him in his Studies, his seasonable provision for his support and maintenance when he was a young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as also upon other obliging Considerations, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor did ever express a great and singular regard.</p>
            <p>But besides I considered him (which was more) as <hi>a true</hi> Servant <hi>and</hi> Friend <hi>of God:</hi> and to such a one, and what relates to such, I thought that I owed no less care


<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:66374:4"/>
and diligence. The former Title <hi>[a Servant of God]</hi> is very often in Scripture given to that incomparable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>Moses:</hi> incomparable for his <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 7. 22.</note> Philosophical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments and knowledg of Nature, as also for his Political Wisdom, and great abilities in the Conduct and managing of affairs; and in speaking excellent sense, strong and clear Reason in any business and Case that was before him; for <hi>he was mighty in words and in deeds,</hi> Acts 7. (and of both these kinds of Knowledge wherein <hi>Moses</hi> excell'd, as also in the more recondite and mysterious knowledge of the Egyptians, there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Instances and Proofs in the Pentateuch written by him:) incomparable as well for the loveliness of his Disposition and Temper, the inward ornament and beauty of a <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 12. 3.</note> meek and humble Spirit, as for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary amiableness of his outward person; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable for his unexampled <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11. 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Self-denial in the midst of the greatest allurements and most tempting advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of this world. And from all these great Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments and Perfections in <hi>Moses,</hi> it appears how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently he was qualified and enabled to answer that Title <hi>[The Servant of God]</hi> more frequently given to him in Scripture then unto any other.</p>
            <p>The other Title <hi>[a Friend of God]</hi> is given to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, an eminent Exemplar of Self-resignation and Obedience even in <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4. Heb. 11. Jam. 2.</note> Trials of the greatest difficulty: and it is given to him thrice in Scripture, 2 Chron. 20. 7. Esay 41. 8.

Ostentation; not so much a talking or a disputing, as a living, a doing and an obeying Christian; one inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the Simplicity and <hi>Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> but no admirer of the <hi>Pharisaick</hi> forms and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimonious shews (though never so goodly and specious) which cannot and do not affect the adult and strong Christians, though they may and doe those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skillful and weak. For in this weak and low state of the divided Churches in Christendom weak and slight things (especially if they make a fair shew in the flesh, as the Apostle speaks,) are most esteemed; whereas in the mean time <hi>the weightier matters of the Law,</hi> the most concerning and Substantial parts of Religion are passed over &amp; disregarded by them, as being grievous to them, &amp; no way for their turns, no way for their corrupt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, fleshly ease, and worldly advantages. But God's thoughts are not as their thoughts: The <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 2. 29.</note>

               <hi>that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the sight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I shall further observe concerning the Author, is only this,</p>
            <p>That he was Eminent as well in those Perfections which have most of Divine worth and excellency in them, and rendred him a truly <hi>God-like</hi> man; as in those other Perfections and Accomplishments of the Mind, which rendred him a very <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> man: and withall, in the midst of all these great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments, as Eminent and Exemplary in unaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Humility</hi> and true Lowliness of Mind. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was like to <hi>Moses</hi> that <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Friend</hi> of God, who was most <hi>meek and lowly in heart</hi> (as our Lord is also said to be, Mat. 11. in this, as in all other respects, greater then <hi>Moses</hi> who was <hi>vir mitissimus) above all the


<pb n="x" facs="tcp:66374:6"/>
men which were upon the face of the Earth,</hi> Num. 12. And thus he excell'd others as much in <hi>Humility</hi> as he did in <hi>Knowledg,</hi> in that thing which, though in a lesser degree in others, is apt to puff up and swell them with <hi>Pride</hi> and Self-conceit. But <hi>Moses</hi> was <hi>humble,</hi> though he was a Person of brave parts, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> speaks of him, and having had the advantages of a most <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 7. 21, 22.</note> ingenuous Education was admirably, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd in the choicest parts of Knowledg, and * <hi>learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians;</hi> whereby some of the Antients understood the Mysterious Hieroglyphical learning, Natural Philosophy, Musick, Physick, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks. And for this last (to omit the rest) how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent this <hi>Humble</hi> man, the Author, was therein, did appear to those that heard him read a Mathematick Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in the Schools for some years, &amp; may appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to the Reader, if those Lectures can be recovered. To conclude, He was a plain-hearted both <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> one in whose Spirit and mouth there was no guile; a profitable Companion; nothing of vanity and trislingness in him, as there was nothing of sowrness &amp; <hi>Stoicism.</hi> I can very well remember, when I have had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate converse with him, how pertinently and freely he would speak to any Matter proposed, how weighty, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial and clearly expressive of his Sense his private Discourses would be, and both for Matter and Language much-what of the same importance &amp; value with such Exercises as he studied for, and performed in publick.</p>
            <p>I have intimated some things concerning <hi>the Author;</hi> much more might be added: but it needs not, there being (as I before insinuated) already drawn a fair and lively Character of him by a worthy Friend of his in the Sermon preached at his Funeral; for the publishing whereof and annexing it (as now it is) to these <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi>


               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:66374:6"/>
he was importun'd by Letters from several hands, and prevail'd with: wherein if some part of the Character should seem to have in it any thing of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolism and Strangeness, it must seem so to such on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who either were unacquainted with him &amp; Strangers to his worth, or else find it an hard thing not to be <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,</hi> and a difficulty to be <hi>Humble.</hi> But those that had a more inward converse with him, knew him to be one of those <note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> 
               <hi>of whom the world was not worthy,</hi> one of <hi>the</hi>

               <hi>Excellent ones in the Earth;</hi> a person truly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary in the temper and constitution of his Spirit, and in the well-ordered course of his life; a life <hi>unius quasi coloris, sine actionum dissensione</hi> (as I remember <hi>Seneca</hi> doth express it somewhere in his Epistles) <hi>all of one colour, everywhere like it self:</hi> and Eminent in those things that are worthy of Praise and Imitation. And certainly a just Representation of those Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that shined in him (as also a faithful Celebration of the like Accomplishments in others) is a doing honour to God who is wonderful in his Saints, (if I may with some apply to this sense that in Psal. 68. <gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">Of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.</note> and <hi>the Author</hi> of these Discourses, I proceed now (which was the Last thing intended in this Preface) to observe something concerning the several <hi>Discourses</hi> and <hi>Treatises</hi> in this Volume. And indeed some of these <hi>Observations</hi> I ought not in justice to the Author to pretermit: and all of them may be for the benefit of at least some Readers.</p>
            <p>The First Discourse <hi>Concerning the true Way or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of attaining to Divine Knowledg, and an Encrease therein,</hi> was intended by the Author as a necessary <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction</hi> to the ensuing Treatises; and therefore is the shorter: yet it contains <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (to use <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Expression) excellent Sense and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Matter well beaten and compacted and lying close


<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:66374:7"/>
together in a little room, many very seasonable Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations for this Age, wherein there is so much of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Notionality, so little of the true Christian life and practice.</p>
            <p>Shorter yet are the Two next Tracts <hi>Of Superstition</hi> and <hi>Atheism,</hi> which were also intended by the Author to prepare the way for some of the following Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses upon which the Author purposed to enlarge his Thoughts.</p>
            <p>Yet as for that Tract <hi>Of Superstition,</hi> some things that are but briefly intimated by the Author therein, may receive a further Explication from his other <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi> more especially from the Eighth, <hi>viz. Of the Shortness and Vanity of a Pharisaick Righteousness,</hi> or <note place="margin">Page 347.</note> 
               <hi>An Account of the false Grounds upon which men are apt vainly to conceit themselves to be Religious.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what the Author writes concerning <hi>that more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that more close and subtile Superstition</hi> (by which he understands the formal and specious Sanctity and vain Religion of <hi>Pharisaick</hi> Christians, who yet would seem to be very abhorrent from <hi>Superstition,</hi> and are apt to call every thing <hi>Babylonish</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> that is not of their way) I say what he writes concerning This in both these (or any other) Discourses, he would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently speak of, and that <hi>with Authority and Power.</hi> For being possess'd of the inward life and power of true Holiness, he had a very strong and clear sense of what he spake, and therefore a great and just indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as against open and gross Irreligion, so also) against that vain-glorious, slight and empty Sanctity of the spiritual Pharisees, who would (as our Saviour speaks of the old Pharisees, Mark 7.) <hi>make void</hi> and very <hi>fairly disannul</hi> the Commandments of God, the weightier things of Religion, the indispensable concernments of


<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:66374:8"/>
Christianity; while in stead of an inward living Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and entire Obedience they would substitute some external Observances and a mere outward, liveless and slight Righteousness, and in the room of <hi>the New creature</hi> made <hi>after God</hi> set up some Creature of their own, made after their own image, a Self-framed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: they being strict in some things which have <hi>a shew of Wisdom</hi> and Sanctity, things less necessary and more doubtful, and where the H. Scripture hath not placed the Kingdom of God, but in the mean time loose and careless in their plain duty toward God and toward their Neighbour, in things holy and divine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably just and good; yet to make some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation for their being deficient in things strictly and necessarily required, and primarily pleasing to God, and to excuse themselves, they would express a more then ordinary diligence and zeal in some easie and little things, as all the most specious observances of Formal Christians are, and not worthy to be named with those great Instances of <hi>the Power of Godliness,</hi> such as Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Universal Obedience, Entire Self-resignation, a being crucified to the world, plucking out of the right eye, and cutting off of the right hand, Mortification of the more dear and beloved Sins, and the closer ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies and inclinations to Sin and Vanity, and the like.</p>
            <p>This is a short character of the Pharisaick and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Righteousness; and in our Author's plain disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the thinness and slightness thereof, and free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of these false Religionists, it appears that the same <hi>Nobleness</hi> of Mind and Spirit was in him which was also in Christ Jesus, who never express'd himself with so much vehemency and smartness, as when he was to reprove the <hi>Pharisees</hi> in his days, those Patterns of <note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> Formal Christians in all ages. For there is nothing


<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:66374:8"/>
more grievous to the sincerely-religious Soul, then <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation</hi> and <hi>Canting</hi> in Religion, empty (though spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious) shews of Sanctity, great pretendings to Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and higher degrees of Grace, when to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirited and discerning Christian it clearly appears that such Boasters are but low and weak things, <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 5.</note>

            <p>But to let these alone, and to return to the former,


<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:66374:9"/>
(with whom our Author had to doe in both these Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, and in the 2, 3, and 4. chapters of his seventh Treatise) I shall add this word of faithful Admonition; <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked:</hi> God will not be put off with empty pretences and <hi>Pharisaick</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances (how glorious and precious soever in the eyes of men.) God will not be flattered with goodly praises, nor satisfied with words and notions, when the Life and Practice is a real contradiction to them. God will not be satisfied with a specious <hi>Form of Godliness,</hi> when men under this Form are <hi>Lovers of themselves, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.</note> 
               <hi>proud, high-minded, fierce, lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God,</hi> and are manifestly under <hi>the power</hi> of these and the like <hi>Spiritual</hi> (if not also <hi>Fleshly)</hi> wickednesses. For <hi>the Power of sin within</hi> can (it seems) easily agree and consist with <hi>the Form of Godliness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:</hi> but two such contrary <hi>Powers</hi> as the Power of <hi>Godliness</hi> and the Power of <hi>Sin,</hi> two such contrary Kingdoms as the Kingdom of <hi>the Spirit</hi> and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>the Flesh,</hi> which is made up of many petty and lesser Principalities of <note n="*" place="margin">Titus 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>various Lusts</hi> and Pleasures, warring sometimes amongst themselves, but alwaies confederate in warring against the Soul; these so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> cannot stand together nor be established in one Soul. Be wise now therefore and be ye instructed O ye sanctimonious Pharisees, ye blind leaders of the blind, and know the things that belong unto your peace: for the day of the Lord will come that shall burn as an oven, when all those fine coverings, wherewith men thought to hide their ungodlike dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, shall be torn from them and cast into the Fire; and in this day shall even these <hi>weak and beggerly Elements</hi> melt with a fervent heat, and for Hypocrites, <note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> all their paint shall then drop off, and their deformity


<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:66374:9"/>
shall appear: in this day all affected modes of Religion shall be rendred despicable, and all disguises and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial dresses (whereby false Christians thought to hide their crookednesses) shall be pluck'd off, and all things shall appear as they are. Verily there is a God that judgeth in the Earth: he will judge of men by other measures and rules then they used here, whereby they deceived themselves and others. God is for Reality and Truth: <hi>He desires Truth in the inward parts,</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in sincere and single minds. It will then appear That <hi>he that walks uprightly, walks surely;</hi> and That <hi>he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever,</hi> Prov. 10. 1 John 2.</p>
            <p>If what the Author, out of great Charity to the Souls of men, has observed concerning these things were seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously considered and lai'd to heart, Christianity would then recover its reputation, and appear in its own primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive lustre and native loveliness, such as shined forth in the lives of those First and Best Christians, who were Christians in good earnest, <gap reason="foreign">

nor prejudice their dear and more beloved lusts and pleasures, their profitable and advantageous Sins: and <hi>More then a power</hi> to observe some lesser and easier Commands, or to perform an outward obedience ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out of slavish Fear, void of inward Life and Love, and a Complacency in the Law of God (of which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per our Author discourses at large.)

These are some of <hi>the Exploits</hi> of strong and healthful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and for the encouraging of them in these <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts</hi> which shall end in glorious <hi>Conquests</hi> and joyous <hi>Triumphs,</hi> the Author hath in the Tenth and last Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course suggested what is worthy our Consideration.</p>
            <p>But I must not forget that there remains something to be observed concerning some other Treatises: and having been so large in the last Observation (which was not unnecessary, the world abounding, &amp; ever having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, with spiritual Pharisees) I shall be shorter in the rest. And now to proceed to the next, which is <hi>of Atheism;</hi> This Discourse (being but Preparatory to the ensuing Tracts) is short: yet I would mind the Reader, that what is more briefly handled here, may be supplied and further clear'd out of the Fifth Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, viz. <hi>Of the Existence and Nature of God,</hi> of which (if the former part seem more Speculative, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and Metaphysical, yet) the Latter and Greater part, containing several <hi>Deductions and Inferences from the Consideration of the Divine Nature and Attributes,</hi> is less obscure, and more Practical, as it clearly directs us to the best (though not much observed) way of <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying</hi> God, and being made happy and blessed by a Participation and Resemblance of him; &amp; as it plainly directs a man to <hi>such Apprehensions</hi> of God as are apt and powerful to beget in him the Noblest and dearest <hi>Love</hi> to God, the sweetest <hi>Delight,</hi> and the most peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Confidence</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>One thing more I would observe to the Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning


<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:66374:11"/>
the Discourse <hi>Of Atheism,</hi> and the same I would desire to be observed also concerning the next, that large Treatise <hi>Of the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the former part thereof; and it is shortly this, That the Author in these Treatises pursues his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with a particular reflexion on the <hi>Dogmata</hi> and Notions of <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his followers, especially that great admirer of him, <hi>Lucretius,</hi> whose Principles are here particularly examined and refuted. These were the men whose Opinions our Author had to combat with; He lived not to see <hi>Atheism</hi> so closely and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily insinuated, nor lived he to see <hi>Sadduceism</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curism</hi> so boldly owned and industriously propagated, as they have been of late, by some who being heartily desirous That there were no God, no Providence, no Reward nor Punishment after this life, take upon them to deride the Notion of <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Incorporeal Substance, the Existence of Separate Souls, and the Life to come:</hi> and by infusing into mens Minds Opinions contrary to these Fundamental Principles of Religion, they have done that which manifestly tends to the <note n="*" place="margin">This was of old confess'd, and boasted of by <hi>Lucretius</hi> more then once in his Poems.</note> overthrow of all Religion, the destruction of Morality and Vertuous living, the debauching of Mankind, the consuming and eating out of any good Principle left in the Conscience which doth testifie for God and Goodness, and against Sin and Wickedness, and to the defacing and expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Law written in mens hearts; and so the holy Apostle judges of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Notions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, (a taste of which he gives in that passage, 1 Cor. 15. <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die,</hi> and then ther's an End of all, no other life or state,) and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth his judgment concerning the evil and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness of these doctrines and their teachers, partly in a Verse out of <hi>Menander,</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>Evil commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications corrupt good manners,</hi> and in what he subjoins v. 34. besides many other passages in this Chapter in opposition to the doctrine of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans:</hi> and to the same purpose he speaks in 2. Tim. 2. 16, 17, 18. concerning those that denied the Doctrine of <hi>the Resurrection</hi> or any Future State and the Life to come. The sum and substance of the Apostles judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning these <hi>Epicurean</hi> principles is plainly this, That these Principles properly and powerfully tend to the corrupting of mens Minds and Lives, to the advancement of Irreligion and Immorality in the world; That they are no benigne Principles to Piety and a Good life. 'Tis true that some of the more wary and considerate modern <hi>Epicureans,</hi> may express some care to live inoffensively, and to keep out of danger, and to maintain a reputation in the world as to their converse with others, (and herein they mind their worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and the advantages of this present life, the only life which they have in their eye) they may also express a care in avoiding what is prejudicial to health and a long life in this world: But all this is short of a true and noble Love of Goodness; and if in these men there be any appearance of what is Good and praise-worthy, they would have been really better, if they had been of other Principles, and had believed in their Hearts That there is a Providence, a Future state, and Life to come, and had lived agreeably to the Truths of the Christian Philosophy, which do more ennoble and accomplish and every way better a man, then the Principles of the Epicurean Sect. But to return, We have before observed. That our Author in these Two Treatises pursued his design in opposition to the Master-Notions and chief Principles of <hi>Epicurus</hi>


               <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:66374:12"/>
and <hi>Lucretius</hi> of old: I shall only adde this, That if any of this Sect in our daies has done more then revived and repeated those Principles, if any such has superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any thing of any seeming force and moment to the pretensions of the old <hi>Epicureans</hi> mention'd in these Tracts, the Reader may find it particularly spoken to and fully answered by One whom our Author highly esteem'd, Mr. <hi>Henry More,</hi> in his late Treatise <hi>Of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul,</hi> and in another Discourse intituled <hi>An Antidote against Atheism,</hi> and in the <hi>Appendix</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto annexed.</p>
            <p>I pass on to the Discourse of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> which, as it cost the Author more pains (I believe) then any of the other, (it containing many considerable Enquiries in an Argument not commonly treated of, and more then vulgar Observations out of ancient Jewish writers,) so did it (together with the former part of the next Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) require more labour to prepare it for the Press and the benefit of the Reader then any of the other Tracts, by reason of the many Quotations, especially the Hebrew ones, to be examin'd: in the perusing of which there would sometimes occurr a dubious and dark Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and then I thought it safest to confer with our Hebrew Professor, Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> for whom the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had alwaies a great affection and respect.</p>
            <p>It's true, This Elaborate Treatise is of a more <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi> nature then any of the rest, yet is it also <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and contains sundry Observations not only of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Knowledg</hi> but also of <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> For, besides that in this Treatise several Passages of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are illustrated out of Jewish Monuments, (which is no small instance of its <hi>Usefulness,)</hi> there are Two Chapters (to name no more) viz. 4, and 8. (the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest in this Treatise) which more particularly relate to


<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:66374:12"/>
               <hi>Practice,</hi> and might be (if well considered) available to the bettering of some mens manners. The matter of the Fourth Chapter treating of <hi>the Difference between the true Prophetical Spirit and Enthusiastical impostures</hi> is seasonably usefull, and of no small importance. Not to mention any latter Experiments and Proofs how powerful such Enthusiastical impostures have been to disquiet and endanger several parts of Christendom, it appears by good History (and the Event is yet appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) how strangely that <hi>Political</hi> Enthusiast, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> has befool'd a very great part of the world by his pretensions of being inspir'd and taught by the divine Spirit whispering in his ear, by his Epileptical fits, pretended Visions and Revelations. Thus <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Dove hath as wonderfully prevailed in the World as of old the Roman Eagles: although yet (which may abate our wondring at this success) this impostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and pretendedly-inspired Doctrine was not propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and promoted with a <hi>Dove-like</hi> Spirit, but with force of Arms; <hi>Mahumetanism</hi> cut out its way by the <hi>Sword,</hi> the worst instrument for propagating of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; to say nothing of the advantages it had from its compliance with Flesh and blood and a Sensual life, and from the Ignorance, Rudeness and Barbarism of that people to whom that impure Prophet communicated his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> a people capable of any doctrine how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and irrational soever. Whereas Christianity was at first promoted and made its way in the world by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods more innocent and worthy of the Doctrine of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ that true and great Prophet, of whom the Voice from heaven was, <note n="*" place="margin">Matthew 17.

as <hi>pertaining to Life and Godliness</hi> and necessary to Salvation.

            </p>
            <p>What I would further intimate concerning this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>Of Prophesy,</hi> is briefly this, That though it be one of the <hi>largest</hi> Treatises in this Volume, yet there are some parts and passages in it which I think the Author would have more enlarged and fill'd up, had he not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten'd to that which according to the method design'd by him he calls <hi>The Third Great Principle of Religion.</hi> But of this I have given an account in an <note n="*" place="margin">Page 280.</note>

The Discourse <hi>Of the Legal and the Evangelical Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> &amp;c. which Discourse is a much <hi>Practical</hi> as the former was <hi>Speculative.</hi> Nor was the composure of that Treatise more painfull to the Author, then the elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this, at least the former half of this, wherein the Author has travers'd—<hi>loca nullius ante Trita solo</hi>—the more unknown Records and Monuments of Jewish Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, for the better stating the Jewish Notion of <hi>the Righteousness of the Law;</hi> the clearing of which in chap. 2, and 3. as also the settling the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>That Righteousness which is of the Law,</hi> and <hi>That which is of Faith,</hi> between <hi>the Old and the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and the Account of the Nature of <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Divine Acceptance,</hi> &amp;c. are all of them of no small use and consequence, but together with the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Tract (made up of certain brief but comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Observations) they offer to the Reader what is not unworthy of his serious consideration.</p>
            <p>Of the Eighth Discourse, shewing <hi>the Vanity of a Pharisaick Righteousness</hi> or <hi>Godliness falsly so call'd,</hi> I have spoken before.</p>
            <p>The next Discourse, largely treating of the <hi>Excellency and Nobleness of True Religion and Holiness,</hi> shews the Author's Mind to have been not slightly tinctur'd and wash'd over with Religion, but rather to have been double-dyed, throughly imbued and coloured with that <hi>generosum honestum,</hi> as the Satyrist not unfitly styles it,—<hi>incoctum generoso pectus honesto.</hi> But the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Life and Actions spake no less; and indeed there is no language so fully expressive of a man as the language of his Deeds.

               </gap> (as the Lxx. translate that Hebrew) is the genuine product of Religion in that Soul where it is suffer'd to rule, and (as S. <hi>James</hi> speaks of Patience) <hi>to have her perfect work.</hi> The <hi>Style</hi> in this Tract may seem more rais'd and sublime then in the other, (which might be perhaps from the Nature and quality of the subject matter, apt to heighten expressions;) but yet in this (as in the other Tracts) it is free from the Vanity of <hi>Affectation,</hi> which a Mind truly ennobled by Religion cannot stoop to, as counting it a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick business, and a certain argument of a Poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Weakness of Spirit in the either Writer or Speaker.</p>
            <p>But if in this Tract the <hi>Style</hi> seem more magnificent, yet in the Tenth and Last Discourse (viz. <hi>Of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Conflicts and Conquests)</hi> it is most familiar. The <hi>Matter</hi> of it is very <hi>Useful</hi> and <hi>Practical:</hi> for as it more fully and clearly acquaints a Christian with the more dangerous and unseen Methods of Satan's activity, (concerning which the Notions and Conceptions of many men are discovered here to be very short and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;) so it also acquaints him with such Principles as are available to beget in him the greatest Courage, Spirit and Resolution against the day of battel, chasing away all lazy faintheartedness and despair of Victory. This for the <hi>Matter.</hi> The <hi>Style</hi> is (as I said) most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar.

Yet even in these Discourses what is most <hi>Practical,</hi> is <hi>more easily intelligible</hi> by every <hi>honest-hearted</hi> Christian. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the whole might be made more familiar and easie, and more accommodate to the use of any such, I thought it would be very expedient (as to cast the <hi>Discourses</hi> into <hi>Chapters,</hi> so) before every Chapter to propose to the Readers view the full Scope, Sense and Strength of the principal Matters contained therein: &amp; I could willingly have spared such a labour (the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when busied about the Notions and Conceptions of another, and not our own,) if I had not conceived it to be greatly helpfull and beneficial to some Readers: besides another advantage to them hereby, viz. That

they may the more easily find out and select any such particular Matters in these Discourses, as they shall think most fit or desireable for their perusal.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given the Reader some account of what seem'd fit to be observ'd concerning these <hi>Ten Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> which now present themselves to his free and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Judgment.

               </gap>, it need not be a matter of wonder; for what Book (besides that Book of Books, the Bible) has not something in it that speaks the Author Man? It would not have displeased our Author in his life-time to have been thought less then Infallible. He was not <gap reason="foreign">

It is not with the fair Representations and Pictures of the Mind as with other Pictures; these of the Mind shew best the nearer they are viewed, and the longer the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Eye dwells upon them.</p>
            <p>There is only one thing more which I ought not to forget to mind the Reader of, and it is shortly this, That he would please to remember that the now-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished Tracts are <hi>Posthumous</hi> works; and then affording that charity, candour and fair respect which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed to such works of Worthy men, I nothing doubt but he will judge them too good to have been buried in obscurity; although its likely, if the Author himself had revis'd them in his life-time with an intent to present them to publick view, they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his happy hand some further polishing and enlargements. He could have easily obliged the world with other Discourses of as valuable importance, if he had liv'd and been so minded. But it pleas'd the only<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise God (in whose hand our breath is) to call for him home to the Spirits of just men made perfect, after he had lent him to this unworthy world for about Five and thirty years. A short life his was if we measure it by so many years; but if we consider the great Ends of Life and Being in the world, which he fulfill'd in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, his great Accomplishments qualifying him for eminent Service, and accompanied with as great a Readinesse to approve himself a good and faithful Servant to his gracious Lord and Master in heaven, his life was not to be accounted short, but long; and we may justly say of him what is said by the Author

            <p>Thus much for the Papers now published. There are some other pieces of this Author's (both English and Latine) which may make another considerable Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, especially if some papers of his (in other hands) can be retriv'd. For my particular, I shall wish and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that not the least Fragment of his may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, which his Friends shall think worthy of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing: and I think all such Fragments being gathered up may fitly be brought together under the Title of <hi>Miscellanies.</hi> If others who have any of his Papers shall please to communicate them, I doubt not but that there will be found in some of his Friends a readiness to publish them with all due care and faithfulness. Or if they shall think good to doe it themselves and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them apart, I would desire and hope that they would bestow that labour and diligence about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them for publick view and use, as may testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their respect both to the Readers benefit and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Author's memory.</p>

That Self-resignation, and the subduing of our own Wills, are greatly available to obtain Assurance. The vanity and absurdity of that Opinion, viz. <hi>That in a perfect resignation of our Wills to God's will, a man should be content with his own Damnation and to be the subject of Eternal wrath in Hell, if it should so please God. pag.</hi> 423.</item>

To converse with God in the Creation, and to pass out of the Sensible World into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, is most effectually taught by Religion. Wicked men converse not with God as shining out in the Creatures; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with them in a Sensual and Unspiritual manner. Religion does spiritualize the Creation to Good men: it teaches them to look at any Perfections or Excellencies in themselves and others, not so much as Theirs or That others, but as so many Beams flowing from One and the Same Fountain of Light; to love them all in God, and God in all; the Universal Goodness in a Particular Being.

That Wicked men by destroying what there is from God within them, and devest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves of all that which hath any alliance to God or true Goodness, and transforming themselves into the Diabolical image, fit themselves for correspondence and converse with the Devil.

of Apostasie and as a Degenerate nature in men. That the Devil is not only the name of one Particular thing, but a Nature. The Difference between the Devil and Wicked men is rather the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a Name then of Natures.

Men are apt to quarrell with the Devil in the name and notion, and defie him with their Tongues, while they entertain him in their Hearts, and comply with all that which the Devil is. The vanity of their pretended Love to God, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Devil. That there is nothing Better then God himself, for which we should love him; and to love him for his own Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Excellency is the best way of loving him.

That it is transacted upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Stage of mens Souls, and managed without Noise or pompous Observation; and without any hindrance or prejudice to the most peacefull, sedate and composed temper of a religious Soul.

speak it not; and though their tongues be silent, yet their lives cry it upon the house-tops, &amp; in the publick streets. That <hi>Idea</hi> which men generally have of God is nothing else but the picture of their own Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that Archetypall notion of him which hath the supermacie in their mindes, is none else but such an one as hath been shap'd out according to some pattern of themselves; though they may so cloathe and disguise this Idol of their own, when they carry it about in a pompous Procession to expose it to the view of the world, that it may seem very beautiful, and indeed any thing else rather then what it is. Most men (though it may be they themselves take no great notice of it) like that dissembling Monk, doe <hi>aliter sentire in Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, aliter in Musaeis,</hi> are of a different judgment in the Schools from what they are in the retirements of their private closets.

                  <p>I would not be thought all this while to banish the belief of all <hi>Innate notions</hi> of Divine Truth: but these are too often smother'd, or tainted with a deep dye of mens filthy lusts.

Though these <hi>Common notions</hi> may be very busie som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the <hi>vegetation</hi> of divine Knowledge; yet the corrupt vices of men may so clog, disturb and overrule them, (as the Naturalists say this unruly and masterless <hi>matter</hi> doth the natural <hi>forms</hi> in the formation of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures) that they may produce nothing but

                  <p>What are all our most sublime Speculations of the Deity, that are <hi>not impregnated</hi> with <hi>true Goodness,</hi> but insipid things that have no tast nor life in them, that do but swell like empty froath in the souls of men?

There are hidden Mysteries in Divine Truth, wrapt up one within another, which cannot be discern'd but onely by divine <hi>Epoptists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must not think we have then attained to the <hi>right knowledge</hi> of Truth, when we have broke through the <hi>outward Shell</hi> of <hi>words</hi> &amp; <hi>phrases</hi> that house it up; or when by a <hi>Logical Analysis</hi> we have found out the dependencies and coherencies of them one with another; or when, like stout champions of it, having well guarded it with the invincible strength of our Demonstration, we dare stand out in the face of the world, and challenge the field of all those that would pretend to be our Rivalls.</p>
                  <p>We have many Grave and Reverend Idolaters that worship Truth onely in the Image of their own Wits; that could never adore it so much as they may seem to doe, were it any thing else but such a Form of Belief as their own wandring speculations had at last met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, were it not that they find their own image and superscription upon it.</p>

                     </gap> by which the Souls of men were to be separated from sensuality and purged from fleshly filth, they devised a further way of <hi>Separation</hi> more accommodated to the condition of Philosophers, which was their <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> or Mathematical Contemplations, whereby the Souls of men might farther shake off their dependency upon Sense, and learn to go as it were alone, without the crutch of any Sensible or Material thing to support them; and so be a little inur'd, being once got up above the Body, to converse freely with Immaterial natures, without looking down again and falling back into Sense. Besides many other waies they had, whereby to rise out of this dark Body; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And thus we should pass from this Topick of our Discourse, upon which we have dwelt too long already, but that before we quite let it goe, I hope we may fairly make this use of it farther (besides what we have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven at all this while) which is, To learn not to devote or give up our selves to any private Opinions or Dictates of men in matters of Religion, nor too zealously to propugne the <hi>Dogmata</hi> of any Sect. As we should not like rigid Censurers arraign &amp; condemn the Creeds of other men which we comply not with, before a full &amp; mature understanding of them, ripened not onely by the natural sagacity of our own Reasons, but by the benign influence of holy and mortified Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: so neither should we over-hastily <hi>credere in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem alienam,</hi> subscribe to the Symbols and Articles of


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66374:35"/>
other men. They are not alwaies the <hi>Best</hi> men that blot most paper; Truth is not, I fear, so Voluminous, nor swells into such a mighty bulk as our Books doe. Those mindes are not alwaies the most chast that are most parturient with these learned Discourses, which too often bear upon them a foule stain of their unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full propagation. A bitter juice of corrupt affections may sometimes be strain'd into the inke of our greatest Clerks, their Doctrines may tast too sowre of the cask they come through. We are not alwaies happy in meeting with that wholsome food (as some are wont to call the Doctrinal-part of Religion) which hath been dress'd out by the cleanest hands. Some men have too <hi>bad hearts</hi> to have <hi>good heads:</hi> they cannot be good at Theorie who have been so bad at the Practice, as we may justly fear too many of those from whom we are apt to take the Articles of our Belief have been. Whilst we plead so much our right to the patrimony of our Fathers, we may take too fast a possession of their Errors as well as of their sober opinions. There are <hi>Idola specûs,</hi> Innate Prejudices, and deceitfull <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses,</hi> that many times wander up and down in the Mindes of good men, that may flie out from them with their graver determinations. We can never be well assur'd what our <hi>Traditional</hi> Divinity is; nor can we securely enough addict our selves to any Sect of men. That which was the Philosopher's motto, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we may a little enlarge, and so fit it for an ingenuous pursuer after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth: He that will finde Truth, must seek it with a <hi>free judgment,</hi> and a <hi>sanctified minde:</hi> he that thus seeks, shall finde; he shall live in Truth, and that shall live in him; it shall be like a stream of living waters issuing out of his own Soule; he shall drink of


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66374:35"/>
the waters of his own cisterne, and be satisfied; he shall every morning finde this Heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> lying upon the top of his own Soule, and be fed with it to eternal life; he will finde satisfaction within, feeling himself in conjunction with Truth, though all the World should dispute against him.</p>

                  <p>AND thus I should again leave this Argument, but that perhaps we may all this while have seemed to undermine what we intend to build up. For if Divine Truth spring onely up from the Root of true Goodness; how shall we ever endeavour to be good, before we know what it is to be so? or how shall we convince the gainsaying world of Truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we could also inspire Vertue into it?</p>
                  <p>To both which we shall make this Reply, That there are some <hi>Radical Principles</hi> of Knowledge that are so deeply sunk into the Souls of men, as that the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion cannot easily be obliterated, though it may be much darkned. Sensual baseness doth not so grosly sully and bemire the Souls of all Wicked men at first, as to make them with <hi>Diagoras</hi> to deny the <hi>Deity,</hi> or with <hi>Protagoras</hi> to doubt of, or with <hi>Diodorus</hi> to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the <hi>Immortality</hi> of Rational Souls. Neither are the <hi>Common Principles</hi> of Vertue so pull'd up by the roots in all, as to make them so dubious in stating the bounds of Vertue and Vice as <hi>Epicurus</hi> was, though he could not but sometime take notice of them. Neither is the <hi>Retentive power</hi> of Truth so weak and loose in all <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pticks,</hi> as it was in him, who being well scourg'd in the


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66374:36"/>
streets till the blood ran about him, question'd when he came home, whether he had been beaten or not. <hi>Arrianus</hi> hath well observed, That the <hi>Common Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> imprest upon the Souls of men, are more clear and perspicuous then any else; and that if they have not more <hi>certainty,</hi> yet have they more <hi>evidence,</hi> and display themselves with less difficulty to our <hi>Reflexive</hi> Faculty then any Geometrical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations: and these are both availeable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe out waies of Vertue to mens own souls, and to force an acknowledgment of Truth from those that oppose, when they are well guided by a skilfull hand. Truth needs not any time flie from Reason, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Eternal amitie between them. They are onely some private <hi>Dogmata,</hi> that may well be suspected as spurious and adulterate, that dare not abide the tryall thereof. And this Reason is not every where so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd, as that we may not by that enter into the Souls of men. What the <hi>Magnetical</hi> virtue is in these earthly Bodies, that Reason is in mens Mindes, which when it is put forth, draws them one to another. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides in wicked men there are sometimes Distasts of Vice, and Flashes of love to Vertue; which are the Motions which spring from a true Intellect, and the faint struglings of an Higher life within them, which they crucifie again by their wicked Sensuality. As Truth doth not alwaies act in good men, so neither doth Sense alwaies act in wicked men: they may sometimes have their <hi>lucida intervalla,</hi> their sober fits; and a Divine spirit blowing and breathing upon them may then blow up some live sparks of true Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing within them; though they may soon endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to quench them again, and to rake them up in the ashes of their own earthly thoughts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:66374:36"/>
All this, and more that might be said upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, may serve to point out the <hi>VVay of Vertue.</hi> We want not so much <hi>Means</hi> of knowing what we ought to doe, as <hi>Wills</hi> to doe that which we may know. But yet all that Knowledge which is separated from an inward acquaintance with Vertue and Goodness, is of a far different nature from that which ariseth out of a true <hi>living sense</hi> of them, which is the <hi>best discerner</hi> thereof, and by which alone we know the true Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Sweetness, Energie, and Loveliness of them, and all that which is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And further, the clearest and most distinct Notions of Truth that shine in the Souls of the common sort of men, may be extreamly clouded, if they be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with that answerable practice that might preserve their integrity: These tender Plants may soon be spoyl'd by the continual droppings of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections upon them; they are but of a weak and feminine nature, and so may be sooner deceived by that wily Serpent of Sensuality that harbours within us.</p>

up a most dilute, unsavourie, and muddie kinde of Knowledge.

                  <p>AND now if you please, setting aside the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> herd of Brutish men, who have drowned all their own sober Reason in the deepest <hi>Lethe</hi> of Sensuality, we shall divide the rest of Men into these Four ranks, according to that Method which <hi>Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> upon <hi>Epictetus</hi> hath already laid out to us, with a respect to a Fourfold kinde of Knowledge, which we have all this while glanced at.</p>
                  <p>The First whereof is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that <hi>Complex and Multifarious man</hi> that is made up of Soul &amp; Body, as it were by a just equality and Arithmetical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parts and Powers in each of them. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of these men I should call <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s phrase; a Knowledge wherein Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son are so twisted up together, that it cannot easily be unravel'd, and laid out into its first principles. Their highest Reason is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> complying with their senses, and both conspire together in vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. To these that Motto which the <hi>Storcks</hi> have made for them may very well agree, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, their <hi>life</hi> being steer'd by nothing else but <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Imagination.</hi> Their higher notions of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are so entangled with the Birdlime of fleshly Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and mundane Vanity, that they cannot rise up

above the surface of this dark earth, or easily entertain any but earthly conceptions of heavenly things. Such Souls as are here lodg'd, as <hi>Plato</hi> speaks, are <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>heavy behinde,</hi> and are continually pressing down to this world's centre: and though, like the Spider, they may appear sometime moving up and down aloft in the aire, yet they doe but sit in the loome, and move in that web of their own gross fansies, which they fasten and pin to some earthly thing or other.</p>
                  <p>The Second is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, The man that looks at himself as being what he <note place="margin">2.</note> is rather by his Soul then by his Body; that thinks not fit to view his own face in any other Glass but that of Reason and Understanding; that reckons upon his <hi>Soul</hi> as that which was made <hi>to rule,</hi> his <hi>Body</hi> as that which was born <hi>to obey,</hi> and like an handmaid perpetually to wait upon his higher and nobler part. And in such an one the <hi>Communes notitiae,</hi> or common Principles of Vertue and Goodness, are more clear and steady. To such an one we may allow <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>more clear and distinct Opinions,</hi> as being already <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in a Method or course of <hi>Purgation,</hi> or at least fit to be initiated into the <hi>Mysteria minora</hi> the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Mysteries of Religion. For though these <hi>Innate notions</hi> of Truth may be but poor, empty, and hungry things of themselves, before they be fed and fill'd with the practice of true Vertue; yet they are capable of being impregnated, and exalted with the Rules and Precepts of it. And therefore the Stoick suppos'd <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that the doctrine of Political and Moral vertues was fit to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to such as these; and though they may not be so well prepared for Divine Vertue (which is of an higher Emanation) yet they are not immature for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66374:38"/>
as having the Seeds of it already within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which being water'd by answerable practice, may sprout up within them.</p>
                  <p>The Third is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, He <note place="margin">3.</note> whose Soule is <hi>already purg'd</hi> by this lower sort of Vertue, and so is continually flying off from the Body and Bodily passion, and returning into himself. Such in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s language are those <hi>who have escaped the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which are in the world through lust.</hi> To these we may attribute a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a lower degree of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their inward sense of Vertue and moral Goodness being far transcendent to all meer Speculative opinions of it. But if this Knowledge settle here, it may be quickly apt to corrupt. Many of our most refined Moralists may be, in a worse sense then <hi>Plotinus</hi> means, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, full with their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancy; their Souls may too much heave and swell with the sense of their own Vertue and Knowledge: there may be an ill <hi>Ferment of Self-love</hi> lying at the bottome, which may puffe it up the more with Pride, Arrogance, and Self-conceit. These forces with which the Divine bounty supplies us to keep a stronger guard against the evil Spirit, may be abus'd by our own rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Pride, enticing of them from their allegiance to Heaven, to strengthen it self in our Souls, and fortifie them against Heaven: like that supercilious <hi>Stoick,</hi> who when he thought his Minde well arm'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with Wisdome and Vertue, cry'd out, <hi>Sapiens contendet cum ipso Jove de felicitate.</hi> They may make an aiery heaven of these, and wall it about with their own Self-flattery, and then sit in it as Gods, as <hi>Cosroes</hi> the Persian king was sometime laughed at for enshri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himself in a Temple of his own. And therefore if this <hi>Knowledge</hi> be not attended with <hi>Humility</hi> and a


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66374:39"/>
deep sense of <hi>Self-penury</hi> and <hi>Self-emptiness,</hi> we may easily fall short of that True Knowledge of God which we seem to aspire after. We may carry such an Image and <hi>Species</hi> of our Selves constantly before us, as will make us lose the clear sight of the Divinity, and be too apt to rest in a meer <hi>Logical life</hi> (it's <hi>Simplicius</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression) without any true participation of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> if we doe not (as many doe, if not all, who rise no higher) relapse and slide back by vain-glory, popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or such like vices, into some mundane and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Vanity or other.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaks; knitting his owne centre, if he have any, unto the centre of Divine Being. To such an one the <hi>Platonists</hi> are wont to attribute <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>a true Divine wisedome,</hi> powerfully displaying it self <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in an <hi>Intellectual life,</hi> as they phrase it. Such a Knowledge they say is alwaies pregnant with <hi>Divine Vertue,</hi> which ariseth out of an happy Union of Souls with God, and is nothing else but a living Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Godlike prefection drawn out by a strong servent love of it. This Divine Knowledge <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> &amp;c. as <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaks, makes us amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Divine beauty, beautifull and lovely; and this <hi>Divine Love and Purity</hi> reciprocally exalts <hi>Divine Knowledge;</hi> both of them growing up together like that <gap reason="foreign">

of. Though by the <hi>Platonists</hi> leave such a <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> as this is, peculiarly belongs to the true and sober Christian who lives in Him who is <hi>Life</hi> it self, and is enlightned by Him who is the <hi>Truth</hi> it self, and is made partaker of <hi>the Divine Unction, and knoweth all things,</hi> as S.

                     </gap>, <hi>the shining forth of the Father's glory.</hi> But yet we must not mistake, this Knowledge is but here in its Infancy; there is an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er knowledge or an higher degree of this knowledge that doth not, that cannot, descend upon us in these earthly habitations. We cannot here see <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>in Speculo lucido;</hi> here we can see <hi>but in a glass,</hi> and that <hi>darkly</hi> too. Our own <hi>Imaginative</hi> Powers, which are perpetually attending the highest acts of our Souls, will be breathing a grosse dew upon the pure Glasse of our Understandings, and so fully and besmear it, that we cannot see the Image of the Divinity sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in it. But yet this Knowledge being a true hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly fire kindled from God's own Altar, begets an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage in the Souls of Good men, &amp; ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them to cast a holy Scorn upon the poor petty trash of this Life in comparison with Divine things, and to pitty those poor brutish <hi>Epicureans</hi> that have nothing but the meer husks of fleshly pleasure to feed themselves with. This Sight of God makes pious Souls breath after that blessed time when Mortality shall be swallowed up of Life, when they shall no more behold the Divinity through those dark Mediums that eclipse the blessed Sight of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Superstition</hi> is most incident to such as Converse not with the Goodness of God, or are conscious to themselves of their own unlikeness to him.</p>
               <p>Right apprehensions of God beget in man a Nobleness and Freedome of Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Superstition,</hi> though it looks upon God as an angry Deity, yet it counts him easily pleas'd with flattering Worship.</p>
               <p>Apprehensions of a Deity and Guilt meeting together are apt to excite Fear.</p>
               <p>Hypocrites to spare their Sins seek out waies to compound with God.</p>
               <p>Servile and Superstitious Fear is encreased by Ignorance of the certain Causes of Terrible Effects in Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as also by frightful Apparitions of Ghosts and Spectres.</p>
               <p>A further Consideration of <hi>Superstition</hi> as a Composition of Fear and Flattery.</p>
               <p>A fuller Definition of <hi>Superstition,</hi> according to the Sense of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Superstition</hi> doth not alwaies appear in the same Form, but passes from one Form to another, and sometimes shrouds it self under Forms seemingly Spiritual and more refined.</p>

                  <hi>Anti-Deities</hi> that are set up against it, the chief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ATHEISM and SUPERSTITION; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may seeme to comprehend in them all kind of Apostasy and Praevarication from Religion.

               <p>And first of all for SUPERSTITION (to lay aside our Vulgar notion of it which much mistakes it) it is the same with that Temper of Mind which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

Because this unnaturall resemblance of God as an angry Deity in impure minds, should it blaze too furiously, like the Basilisk would kill with its looks; therefore these Painters use their best arts a little to sweeten it, and render it less unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. And those that fancy God to be most hasty and apt to be displeased, yet are ready also to imagine him so impotently mutable, that his favour may be won again with their uncouth devotions, that he will be taken with their formall praises, and being thirsty after glory and praise &amp; solemn addresses, may, by their pompous furnishing out all these for him, be won to a good liking of them: and thus they represent him to themselves <note n="*" place="margin">as <hi>Lusian</hi> in his <hi>De Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis</hi> speaks too truly, though it may be too profanely.</note>

We shall therefore a little further inquire into it, and what the Judgments of the soberest men anciently were of it; the rather for that a learned Author of our own seems unwilling to own that Notion of it which we have hitherto out of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and others contended for; who though he hath freed it from that gloss which the late Ages have put upon it, yet he may seem to have too strictly confined it to a Cowardly Worship of the ancient Gentile Daemons, as if <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Polytheism</hi> were indeed the same thing, whereas <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism</hi> or <hi>Daemon-worship</hi> is but one branch of it: which was partly observed by the learned <hi>Casaubon</hi> in his Notes upon that Chapter of <hi>Theophrastus</hi>

The whole progeny of the ancient Daemons, at least in the Minds of the Vulgar, sprung out of <hi>Fear,</hi> and were supported by it: though notwithstanding, this Fear, when in a Being void of all true sense of Divine goodness, hath not escaped the censure of <hi>Superstition</hi> in <hi>Varro's</hi> judgment, whose Maxim it was, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, <hi>Deum à religioso vereri, à superstitioso timeri:</hi> which distinction <hi>Servius</hi> seems to have made use of in his Comment upon <hi>Virgil, Aeneid.</hi> 6. where the Poet describing the torments of the wicked in hell, he runs out into an Allegorical exposition of all, it may be too much in favour of <hi>Lucretius</hi> whom he there magnifies.

               <p>The <hi>Common Notions</hi> of a Deity, strongly rooted in Mens Souls, and meeting with the apprehensions of <hi>Guiltiness,</hi> are very apt to excite this <hi>Servile</hi> fear: and when men love their own filthy lusts, that they may spare them, they are presently apt to contrive some other waies of appeasing the Deity and compounding with it. Unhallowed minds, that have no inward foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of true Holiness to fix themselves upon, are easily shaken and tossed from all inward peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity: and as the thoughts of some Supreme power above them seize upon them, so they are struck with the lightning thereof into inward affrightments, which are further encreas'd by a vulgar observation of those strange, stupendious and terrifying <hi>Effects</hi> in Nature, whereof they can give no certain reason, as Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, Thundrings and Lightnings, blazing Comets and other Meteors of a like Nature, which are apt to terrifie those especially who are already unsetled and chased with an inward sense of guilt, and, as <hi>Seneca</hi> speaks, <hi>inevitabilem metum ut supra nos aliquid time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remus incutiunt.

How <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously</hi> Superstition can discover &amp; manifest itself, we have intimated before: To which I shall onely adde this, That we are not so well rid of <hi>Superstition,</hi> as some imagine when they have expell'd it out of their Churches, expunged it out of their Books and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, or cast it out of their Tongues, by making Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in names (wherein they sometimes imitate those old <hi>Caunii</hi> that <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaks of, who that they might banish all the forrein Gods that had stollen in among them, took their procession through all their Country, beating &amp; scourging the Aire along as they went;) No, for all this, <hi>Superstition</hi> may enter into our chambers, and creep into our closets, it may twine about our secret Devotions, &amp; actuate our Formes of belief and Orthodox opinions, when it hath no place

else to shroud itself or hide its head in; we may think to flatter the Deity by these, and to bribe it with them, when we are grown weary of more pompous solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: nay it may mix it self with a seeming Faith in Christ; as I doubt it doth now in too many, who lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside all sober and serious care of true Piety, think it sufficient to offer up their Saviour, his Active and Passive Righteousness, to a severe and rigid Justice, to make expiation for those sins they can be willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themselves in.</p>

there were no God to trouble or disquiet it, and <hi>Atheism</hi> thinks there is none. And as <hi>Superstition</hi> is engendred by a base opinion of the Deity as cruell and tyrannicall (though it be afterwards brooded and hatcht by a <hi>slavish fear</hi> and abject thoughts) so also is <hi>Atheism:</hi> and that sowre and ghastly apprehension of God, when it meets with more stout and surly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is apt to enrage them, and cankering them with Malice against the Deity they so little brook, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes them to fight against it and undermine the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; as this <hi>Plastick</hi> Nature which intends to form Living creatures, when it meets with stubborn and unruly Matter, is fain to yield to it, and to produce that which answers not her own <hi>Idea;</hi> whence the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnatures</hi> and impressions of Nature sometimes vary so much from that Seal that Nature would have stamp'd upon them. <gap reason="foreign">

If these Melancholick Opinions and disquieting Fears of the Deity mould not the Minds of men into Devotion, as finding them too churlish and untameable to receive any such impressions; they are then apt to exasperate men against it, and stir them up to contend with that Being which they cannot bear, and to destroy that which would deprive them of their own Liberty. These unreasonable <hi>fears</hi> of a Deity will alwaies be moving into <hi>Flattery</hi> or <hi>Wrath. Atheism</hi> could never have so easily crept into the world, had not <hi>Superstition</hi> made way and open'd a Back-door for it; it could not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily have banish'd the Belief of a Deity, had not that first accused and condemn'd it as destructive to the <hi>Peace</hi> of Mankind; and therefore it hath alwaies justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and defended it self by <hi>Superstition:</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath well exprest it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </q>
This made <hi>Lucretius</hi> cry out with so much indignation, when he took notice of <hi>Agamemnon's</hi> Diabolicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in sacrificing his Daughter <hi>Iphigenia</hi> to make expiation at his <hi>Trojan</hi> Expedition, <hi>Tantum Relligio po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit suadere malorum.</hi> And indeed what sober man could brook such an esteem of himself as this blinde <hi>Superstition</hi> (which overspread the Heathen world and (I doubt) is not sufficiently rooted out of the Christian) fastned upon God himself? which made <hi>Plutarch</hi> so much in defiance of it cry out, as willing almost to be an <hi>Atheist</hi> as to entertain the Vulgar Superstition, <hi>As for me</hi> (saith he) <hi>I had rather men should say that there is no such man</hi> nor ever was <hi>as</hi> Plutarch, <hi>then to say that he is or was</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But it may not be amisse to learn from <hi>Atheists</hi> themselves what was the <hi>Impulsive cause</hi> that mov'd them to banish away all thoughts and sober fear of a Deity, what was the <hi>Principle</hi> upon which this black Opinion was built and by which it was sustein'd. And this we may have from the confessions of the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> who though they seemed to acknowledg a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet I doubt not but those that search into their Writings will soon embrace <hi>Tully's</hi> censure of them, <hi>Verbis quidem ponunt, reipsa tollunt Deos.</hi> Indeed it was not safe for <hi>Epicurus</hi> (though he had a good mind to let the World know how little he cared for their Deities)


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66374:51"/>
to profess he believed there was none, lest he should have met with the same entertainment for it that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoras</hi> did at <hi>Athens,</hi> who for declaring himself doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>sub voce Praeconis,</hi> as <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> and others record: and indeed the world was never so degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any where as to suffer <hi>Atheism</hi> to appear in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick View.</p>
               <p>But that we may return, and take the Confessions a little of these <hi>secret Atheists</hi> of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> sect: and of these <hi>Tully</hi> gives us a large account in his Books <hi>de Finibus</hi> and other parts of his Philosophy. <hi>Torquatus</hi> the <hi>Epicurean</hi> in his first book <hi>de Finibus</hi> liberally spends his breath to cool that too-much heat of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as he thought, in those that could not apprehend God as any other then <hi>curiosum &amp; plenum negotii Deum</hi> (as one of that Sect doth phrase it <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Nat. Deor.)</hi> and so he states this Maxim of the Religion that then was most in use, <hi>Superstitione qui est imbutus, quietus esse nunquam potest.</hi> By the way, it may be worth our observing, how this monstrous progeny of men, when they would seem to acknowledge a Deity, could not forget their own beloved Image which was always before their eyes; and therefore they would have it as careless of any thing but its own pleasure and idle life as they themselves were. So easy is it for all Sects some way or other to slide into a compliance with the <hi>Anthropomorphitae,</hi> and to bring down the Deity to a conformity to their own Image.</p>
               <p>But we shall rather chuse a litle to examine <hi>Lucretius</hi> in this point, who hath in the name of all his Sect largely told us the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Originall</hi> of this Design. After a short Ceremony to his following Discourse of

                  <hi>Nature,</hi> he thus begins his Prologue in commendation of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his exploit, as he fancies it.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>And a little after in a sorry Ovation, proudly cries out,

But to proceed; Our Author observing the <hi>timorous minds</hi> of men to have been struck with this dreadful <hi>Superstition</hi> from the observation of some <hi>stupendious Effects</hi> and <hi>Events</hi> (as he pleaseth rather to call them) <hi>in Nature;</hi> he therefore, following herein the steps of his great Master <hi>Epicurus,</hi> undertakes so to solve all those knots which <hi>Superstition</hi> was tied up into, by unfolding <hi>the Secrets of Nature,</hi> as that men might find themselves loosned from those <hi>saevi Domini</hi> and <hi>crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Tyranni,</hi> as he calls the vulgar Creeds of the Deity. And so begins with a simple Confutation of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Creation,</hi> which he supposed to contein a sure and sensible Demonstration of a Deity, and to have sprung up from an admiring ignorance of Natural productions.</p>

But herein all the <hi>Epicureans</hi> (who are not the true, but foster-fathers of that <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> they brag of, and which indeed <hi>Democritus</hi> was the first Author of) doe miserably blunder themselves. For though a lawful acquaintance with all the <hi>Events</hi> and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that shew themselves upon this mundane stage would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute much to free mens Minds from the slavery of dull <hi>Superstition:</hi> yet would it also breed a sober &amp; amiable Belief of the Deity, as it did in all the <hi>Pythagoreans, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists</hi> and other Sects of Philosophers, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themselves; and an <hi>ingenuous</hi> knowledge hereof would be as fertile with <hi>Religion,</hi> as the ignorance thereof in <hi>affrighted</hi> and <hi>base</hi> Minds is with <hi>Superstition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For which purpose I shall need onely to touch upon <hi>Epicurus</hi> his master-notion by which he undertakes to salve all difficulties that might hold our thoughts in suspence about a <gap reason="foreign">

the several parts of it, without taking notice in the mean-while of some external Weight or Spring that moves it: or, to use his own Similitude, as if one that undertakes to Analyse any Learned Book, should tell us how so many Letters meeting together in several Combinations, should beget all that sense that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined therein, without minding that Wit that cast them all into their several Ranks.

               <p>And yet could we allow <hi>Epicurus</hi> this <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be seated <hi>in Nature,</hi> yet that he might perform the true task of a <hi>Naturalist,</hi> he must also give us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how such a <hi>force</hi> and <hi>power</hi> in Nature should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist: which indeed is easy to doe, if we call in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God himself as the Architect and mover of this Divine Artifice; but without some Infinite power, impossible.</p>
               <p>And we should further inquire, How these moveable &amp; rambling <hi>Atomes</hi> come to place themselves so orderly in the Universe, and observe that absolute Harmony &amp; <hi>Decorum</hi> in all their Motions, as if they kept time with the Musical laws of some Almighty Mind that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd all their lessons &amp; measured out their Dances up and down in the Universe; and also how it comes to pass, if they be only mov'd by <hi>Chance</hi> &amp; <hi>Accident,</hi> that such <hi>Regular</hi> mutations and generations should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by <hi>a fortuitous concurse of Atomes,</hi> as sometimes they speak of, they having no centre to seat themselves about in an infinite Vacuity, as <hi>Tully</hi> argues; and how these Bodies that are once mov'd by some impulse from their former station, return again, or at least come to stay themselves, and doe not rather move perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66374:53"/>
the same way the First impulse and direction carried them; or why they doe not there rest where their Motion first began to cease, if they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by any thing without them: or again, if the proper motion of these <hi>Atomes</hi> be alwaies toward some Centre, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> sometimes is pleased to state the business, <hi>Lineis Rectis,</hi> as he saith, then how comes there, as <hi>Tully</hi> replies, to be any Generation? or if there be a <hi>Motus declinationis</hi> joyn'd with this Motion of Gravity (which was one of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which he borrowed not from <hi>Democritus)</hi> then why should not all tend the same way? and so all those Motions, Generations and Appearances in Nature all vanish, seeing all Variety of Motion would be taken away which way soever this unhallowed Opinion be stated?</p>
               <p>Thus we see, though we should allow <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Principle and fundamental absurdity in the frame of Nature, yet it is too aiery and weak a thing to support that massie bulk of Absurdities which he would build upon it. But it was not the lot of any of his stamp to be over-wise (however they did boast most in the title of <hi>Sophi)</hi> as is well observed of them; for then they might have been so happy too as to have dispelled these thick and filthy mists of <hi>Atheism,</hi> by those bright beams of Truth that shine in the frame of this inferiour world, wherein, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is made manifest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atheism</hi> most commonly lurks <hi>in confinio scientiae &amp; ignorantiae;</hi> when the Mindes of men begin to draw those gross, earthly vapours of sensuall and materiall Speculations by dark and cloudy disputes, they are then most in danger of being benighted in them. There is <hi>a Natural Sense</hi> of God that lodges in the


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66374:54"/>
minds of the lowest and dullest sort of vulgar men, which is alwaies roving after him, catching at him, though it cannot lay any sure hold on him; which works like <hi>a natural Instinct</hi> antecedent to any mature know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as being indeed the First principle of it: and if I were to speak precisely in the mode of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> I would rather call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> then with <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But when contentious disputes, and frothy reasonings, and contemplations informed by fleshly affections, conversant onely about the out-side of Nature, begin to rise up in mens Soules; they may then be in some danger of depressing all those <hi>In-bred notions</hi> of a Deity, and to reason themselves out of their own sense, as the old <hi>Scepticks</hi> did: and therefore it may be it might be wish'd that some men that have not Religion, had had more Superstition to accompany them in their passage from Ignorance to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>But we have run out too farre in this Digression: we shall now return, and observe how our former Author takes notice of another piece of <hi>Vulgar Superstition,</hi> which he thinks fit to be chas'd away by <hi>Atheism,</hi> and that is <hi>The terrours of the world to come,</hi> which he thus sets upon in his Third book,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>—Animi natura videtur</l>
                  <l>Atque Animae claranda meis jam versibus esse,</l>
                  <l>Et metus ille for as praeceps Acheruntis agendus</l>
                  <l>Funditus, humanam vitam qui turbat ab imo,</l>
                  <l>Omnia suffundens mortis nigrore—</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And afterwards he tells us how this <hi>Fear</hi> of the Gods thus proceeding from the former Causes, and from those <hi>Spectres</hi> and gastly <hi>Apparitions</hi> with which men were sometimes terrified, begat all those Fantastick rites and ceremonies in use amongst them, as their


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66374:54"/>
Temples, sacred Lakes and Pools, their Groves, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Images, and other like Vanities, as so many idle toyes to please these Deities with; and at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes himself thus into <hi>Atheism,</hi> as a strong Fort to preserve himself from these cruel Deities that <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> had made, because he could not find the way to true Religion,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Nunc quae sausa Deûm per magnas numina gentes <note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Pervulgarit, &amp; ararum compleverit urbes,</l>
                  <l>Suscipiendáque curarit solennia sacra,</l>
                  <l>Quae nunc in magnis florent rebúsque locìsque;</l>
                  <l>Unde etiam nunc est mortalibus insitus horror</l>
                  <l>Qui delubra Deûm nova toto suscitat orbi</l>

                  <l>Non ità difficile est rationem reddere verbis.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Thus we see how <hi>Superstition</hi> strengthened the wicked hands of <hi>Atheism;</hi> so far is a <hi>Formal</hi> and Ritual way of Religion proceeding from <hi>baseness</hi> and <hi>Servility</hi> of Mind (though back'd with never so much rigour and severity) from keeping it out. And I wish some of our Opinions in Religion in these dayes may not have the same evil influences as the notorious Gentile-<hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi> of old had, as well for the begetting this brat of <hi>Atheism,</hi> as I doubt it is too manifest they have for some other.</p>
               <p>Thus we should now leave this Argument; only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we passe from it, we shall observe two things which <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath suggested to us. The first whereof is, <hi>That howsoever</hi> Superstition <hi>be never so unlovely a thing, yet it is more tolerable then</hi> Atheism: which I shall repeat in his words, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>We should endeavor to take off Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66374:55"/>
from our Mindes, as a Film from our Eyes; but if that cannot be, we must not therefore pluck out our Eyes, and blind the faith that generally we have of the Deity. Superstition</hi> may keep men from the outward acts of sin sometimes, and so their future punishment may have some abatement. Besides that <hi>Atheism</hi> offers the greatest violence to mens Souls that may be, pulling up the Notions of a Deity, which have spread their Roots quite through all the Powers of mens Souls.</p>
               <p>The second is this, <hi>That</hi> Atheism <hi>it self is a most ignoble and uncomfortable thing,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> hath largely discussed it, and especially <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the above-named Tractate of his, written by way of Confutation of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes</hi> the Epicurean, who writ a Book to prove That a man could not live quietly by following any other sects of Philosophers besides his owne; as if all true good were onely conversant <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>about the belly, and all the pores and passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Body,</hi> and the way to true happinesse was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or else <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath not more wittily then judiciously replied upon him.</p>
               <p>What is all that <hi>Happiness</hi> that arifeth from these bodily pleasures to any one that hath any high or noble sense within him? This gross, muddy, and stupid Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is nothing else but a <hi>Dehonestamentum humani generis,</hi> that casts as great a scorn and reproach upon the nature of mankind as may be, and sinks it into the deepest Abysse of Baseness. And certainly were the <hi>Highest happiness</hi> of mankind such a thing as might be felt by a corporeal touch, were it of so ignoble a birth as to spring out of this earth, and to grow up out of this mire and clay; we might well sit down, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail our unhappy fates, that we should rather be born


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66374:55"/>
Men then Brute beasts, which enjoy more of this worlds happiness then we can doe, without any sin or guilt. How little of Pleasure these short lives tast here, which onely lasts so long as the <hi>Indigency</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> is in supplying, and after that, onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a flying shadow, or flitting dreame</hi> of that pleasure (which is choak'd as soon as craving Nature is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) remains in the Fancy, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath well observed in the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course!</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Epicurus</hi> seeing how slippery the <hi>Soule</hi> was to all Sensual pleasure, which was apt to slide away perpetually from it, and again how little of it the <hi>Body</hi> was capable of where it had a shorter stay; he and his followers could not well tell where to place this beggarly guest: and therefore, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one while they would place it in the Body, and then lead it back again into the Soul, not knowing where to bestow it. And <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and the <hi>Cyreniaci,</hi> and the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> tells us, who all could fancy nothing but a <hi>Bodily happiness,</hi> yet could not agree whether it should be <hi>Voluptas,</hi> or <hi>Vacuitas doloris,</hi> or something else; it being ever found so hard a thing to define, like that base <hi>Matter</hi> of which it is begotten, which by reason of it's penurie &amp; scantness of Beings as Philosophers tell us, doth <hi>effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere intellectum,</hi> and is nothing else but a shady kinde of Nothing, something that hath a name but nothing else. I dare say that all those that have any just esteem of humanity, cannot but with a noble scorn defy such a <hi>base-born</hi> Happiness as this is, generated onely out of the slime of this earth: and yet this is all the portion of <hi>Atheism,</hi> which teaches the entertainers of it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66374:56"/>
themselves nothing else but so many Heapes of more refined dust, fortuitously gathered together, which at last must be all blown away again.</p>
               <p>But a true Belief of a Deity is a sure Support to all serious minds, which besides the <hi>future hopes</hi> it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant with, entertains them here with <hi>Tranquillity</hi> and inward serenity. What the <hi>Stoick</hi> said in his cool and mature thoughts, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>it is not worth the while to live in a world empty of God and Providence,</hi> is the sense of all those that know what a Deity means. Indeed it were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test unhappiness that might be, to have been born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a world, where we should be perpetually tossed up and down by a rude and blind Fortune, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually liable to all those abuses which the savage Lusts and Passions of the world would put upon us. It is not possible for any thing well to bear up the spirit of that man that shall calmly meditate with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the true state and condition of this world, should that Mind and Wisedome be taken away from it which governs every part of it, and overrules all those disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that at any time begin to break forth in it. Were there not an <hi>Omniscient</hi> skill to temper, and fitly to rank up in their due places all those quarrelsome and extravagant spirits that are in the world, it would soon prove an <hi>unhabitable</hi> place, and sink under the heavy weight of it's own confusion; which was wittily signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in that Fable of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> who being admitted to drive the chariot of the Sun but for one day, by his rude and unskilful guidance of it made it fall down, and burn the world. Remove <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> out of the world, and then we have nothing to depend upon but <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> the <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> of men; and he that could then live in it, had need be as


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66374:56"/>
blind as these Lords would be, that he might not see his own misery alwaies staring upon him; and had need be more sensless and stupid, that he might not be affected with it.</p>

                  <p>And here we are to take Notice of those two Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal points which the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> makes the necessary Foundations of all Religion, viz. <hi>That God is,</hi> and <hi>That He is a rewarder of them that seek him.</hi> To which we should adde, <hi>The Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Reasonable Soul,</hi> but that that may seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the former: and indeed we can neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any <hi>Invisible reward</hi> of which he there speaks,

without a <hi>Prolepsis</hi> of the <hi>Soul's Immortality;</hi> neither can we entertain a serious belief of that, but the notions of <hi>Poena</hi> and <hi>Praemium</hi> will naturally follow from it; we never meet with any who were perswaded of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that ever doubted of the latter: and therefore the former two have been usually taken alone for the First principles of Religion, and have been most insisted upon by the <hi>Platonists;</hi> and accordingly a novel Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonist writing a Summary of <hi>Plato's</hi> Divinity, intitles his book, <hi>De Deo &amp; Immortalitate Animae.</hi> And also the <hi>Stoical</hi> Philosophy requires a belief of these as the <hi>Prolepses</hi> of all Religion, of the one whereof <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 38.</note>

That as they made certain <hi>Vicissitudes</hi> of <hi>Conflagrations</hi> and <hi>Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> whereby the World should perish in certain <hi>periods</hi> of time; so they thought the Souls of men should also be subject to these <hi>periodical revolutions;</hi> and therefore though they were of themselves immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, should in these changes fall under the power of the common fate.</p>
                  <p>And indeed we scarce ever finde that any were deem'd <hi>Religious,</hi> that did not own these two <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.</hi> For the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> the Jewish Writers are wont commonly to reckon them among the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>


                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:66374:59"/>
because though they held a God, yet they denied the <hi>Immortality</hi> of mens Souls, which the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seems to include, if not especially to aime at, in imputing to them a deniall of the Resurrection; which is therefore more fully explained in the <hi>Acts,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 23. 8.</note> where it is added that they held there was <hi>neither Angel nor Spirit.</hi> And these two Principles are chiefly aimed at in those two Inscriptions upon the Temple at <hi>Delphos,</hi> the one, EI, referring to God, by which Title those that came in to worship were supposed to invoke him, acknowledging his Immutable and Eternal nature; the other, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But if we will have the Fundamental Articles of Christian Religion, we must adde to the former, <hi>The Communication of God to Mankind through Christ;</hi> which last the Scripture treats of at large, so far as concerns our <hi>practice,</hi> with that plainness and simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I cannot but think, that whosoever shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously and with humility of Spirit addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God, converse therewith, will see the bright beams of Divinity shining forth in it, and it may be find the Text it self much plainer then all those Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that have been put upon it; though it may be it is not so clear in matters of <hi>Speculation,</hi> as some Magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial men are apt to think it is.</p>
                  <p>Now for these three Articles of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> I think if we duly consider the Scriptures, or the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the thing it self, we shall easily find all Practical Religion to be referr'd to them, and built upon them: <hi>The Nature of God and of our own Immortal Souls</hi> both

                  <p>In pursuing of these we shall first begin with <hi>The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul,</hi> which if it be once cleared, we can neither leave any room for <hi>Atheism</hi> (which those I doubt are not ordinarily very free from that have gross material notions of their own Souls) not be wholly ignorant what God is: for indeed the chief natural way whereby we can climbe up to the understanding of the Deity is by a Contemplation of our own Souls. We cannot think of him but according to the measure and model of our own Intellect, or frame any other <hi>Idea</hi> of him then what the impressions of our own Souls will permit us: and therefore the best Philosophers have alwaies taught us to inquire for God within our selves; <hi>Reason in us,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> tells us, being <hi>participata simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo rationis internae:</hi> and accordingly some good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positours have interpreted that place in S. <hi>John</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel chap. 1. <hi>He is that true light which enlightens every man that cometh into the world;</hi> which if I were to gloss upon in the language of the Platonists, I should doe it thus, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <argument>
                     <p>Some Considerations preparatory to the proof of the Soul's <hi>Immortality.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUT before we fall more closely upon this, <hi>viz.</hi> the demonstrating the Soul's <hi>Immortality,</hi> we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Immortality of the Soul doth not absolutely need any Demonstration to clear it by, but might be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather as a Principle or</hi> Postulatum, <hi>seeing the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is apt naturally to insinuate it self into the belief of the most vulgar sort of men.</hi> Mens understandings commonly lead them as readily to believe that their <hi>Souls</hi> are <hi>Immortal,</hi> as that they have any Existence at all. And though they be not all so wise and Logical, as to distinguish aright between their <hi>Souls</hi> and their <hi>Bodies,</hi> or tell what kind of thing that is that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call their <hi>Soul;</hi> yet they are strongly inclined to believe that some part of them shall survive another, and that that Soul, which it may be they conceive by a gross Phantasm, shall live, when the other more visible part of them shall moulder into dust. And therefore <hi>all Nations</hi> have consented in this belief, which hath almost been as vulgarly received as the belief of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as a diligent converse with History will assure us, it having been never so much questioned by the Idiotical sort of men, as by some unskilful Philosophers, who have had Wit &amp; Fancy enough to raise doubts, like E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Spirits, but not Judgement enough to send them down again.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Consensus Gentium Tully</hi> thinks enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Law and Maxim of Nature by, which though


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66374:61"/>
I should not universally grant, seeing sometimes Errour and Superstition may strongly plead this Argument; yet I think for those things that are the matter of our <hi>first</hi> belief, that Notion may not be refused. For we cannot easily conceive how any <hi>Prime notion</hi> that hath no dependency on any other antecedent to it, should be generally entertain'd; did not the common dictate of Nature or Reason acting alike in all men move them to conspire together in the embracing of it, though they knew not one anothers minds. And this it may be might first perswade <hi>Averroes</hi> to think of a <hi>Common Intellect,</hi> because of the uniform judgments of men in some things. But indeed in those Notions which we may call <hi>notiones ortae,</hi> there a <hi>communis notitia</hi> is not so free from all suspicion; which may be cleared by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Instance from our present Argument. The notion of the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the Soul is such an one as is generally owned by all those that yet are not able to collect it by a long <hi>Series</hi> and concatenation of sensible observations, and by a Logical dependence of one thing upon another deduce it from sensible Experiments; a thing that it may be was scarce ever done by the wisest Philosophers, but is rather believed with a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to Sense, which shews all things to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and which would have been too apt to have deluded the ruder sort of men, did not a more powerful impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon their own Souls forcibly urge them to believe their own Immortality. Though indeed if the common notions of men were well examined, it may be some common notion adherent to this of the <hi>Immortality</hi> may be as generally received, which yet in it self is false; and that by reason of a common prejudice which the earthly and Sensual part of man will equally possesse all men with, untill they come to be well acquainted with


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66374:61"/>
their own Souls; as namely a notion of the Souls <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality,</hi> and it may be it's <hi>Traduction</hi> too, which seems to be as generally received by the vulgar sort as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But the reason of that is evident, for the Souls of men exercising themselves first of all <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Greek Philosopher expresseth, meerly by a <hi>Progressive kind of motion,</hi> spending themselves about Bodily and Material acts, and conversing onely with Sensible things; they are apt to acquire such deep stamps of Material phantasms to themselves, that they cannot imagine their own Being to be any other then <hi>Material</hi> &amp; <hi>Divisible,</hi> though of a fine Aethereal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which kind of conceit, though it be inconsistent with an Immortal and Incorruptible nature, yet hath had too much prevalencie in Philosophers themselves, their Minds not being sufficiently abstracted while they have contemplated the highest Being of all. And some think <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself cannot be excused in this point, who seems to have thought God himself to be nothing else but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as he styles him. But such Common Notions as these are, arising from the deceptions and hallucinations of <hi>Sense,</hi> ought not to prejudice those which not <hi>Sense,</hi> but some <hi>Higher power</hi> begets in all men. And so we have done with that.</p>
                  <p>The second thing I should premise should be in place of a <hi>Postulatum</hi> to our following Demonstrations, or rather a <hi>Caution</hi> about them, which is, <hi>That, to a right conceiving the force of any such Arguments as may prove the Souls Immortality, there must be an antecedent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with our own Souls.</hi> It is no hard matter to convince any one by clear and evident principles, fetch'd from his own sense of himself, who hath ever well meditated the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of his own Soul, that it is <hi>Immaterial</hi> and <hi>Immortal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:66374:62"/>
But those very Arguments that to such will be Demonstrative, to others will lose something of the strength of Probability: For indeed it is not possible for us well to know what our Souls are, but onely by their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, their <hi>Circular and Reflex motions,</hi> and Converse with themselves, which onely can steal from them their own secrets. All those Discourses which have been written of the Soul's Heraldry, will not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon it so well to us as it self will doe. When we turn our own eyes in upon it, it will soon tell us it's own royal pedigree and noble extraction, by those sacred Hieroglyphicks which it bears upon it self. We shall endeavour to interpret and unfold some of them in our following Discourse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is one thing more to be considered, which may serve as a common <hi>Basis</hi> or Principle to our following Arguments; and it is this Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, <hi>That no Substantial and Indivisible thing ever pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth.</hi> And this <hi>Epicurus</hi> and all of his Sect must needs grant, as indeed they doe, and much more then it is lawful to plead for; and therefore they make this one of the first Principles of their <hi>Atheistical</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, <hi>Ex nihilo fieri nil, &amp; in nihilum nil posse reverti.</hi> But we shall here be content with that sober <hi>Thesis</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> who attributes the <hi>Perpetuation</hi> of all Substances to the Benignity and Liberality of the Creatour, whom he therefore brings in thus speaking to the <hi>Angels,</hi> those <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>You are not of your selves immortal, nor indissoluble; but would relapse and slide back from that Being which I have given you, should I withdraw the influence of my own power from you: but yet you shall hold your Immortality by a Patent of meer grace from my self.</hi> But to return, <hi>Plato</hi> held that the


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66374:62"/>
whole world, howsoever it might meet with many Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodicall mutations, should remain Eternally; which I think our Christian Divinity doth no where deny: and so <hi>Plotinus</hi> frames this general Axiom, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that no Substance shall ever perish.</hi> And indeed if we collate all our own Observations &amp; Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience with such as the History of former times hath delivered to us, we shall not find that ever any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance was quite lost; but though this <hi>Proteus-</hi>like <hi>Matter</hi> may perpetually change its shape, yet it will constantly appear under one <hi>Form</hi> or another, what art soever we use to destroy it: as it seems to have been set forth in that old <hi>Gryphe</hi> or Riddle of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> School, <hi>Aelia Laelia Crispis, nec mas, nec faemina, nec androgyna, nec casta, nec meretrix, nec pudica; sed omnia,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> hath expounded it. Therfore it was never doubted whether ever any piece of <hi>Substance</hi> was lost, till of latter times some hot-brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> who could not bring their fiery and subtile fancies to any cool judgement, began rashly to determine that all <hi>Material Forms</hi> (as they are pleas'd to call them) were lost. For having once jumbled and crouded in a new kind of Being, never anciently heard of, between the parts of a Contradiction, that is <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which they call <hi>Material Forms,</hi> because they could not well tell whence these new upstarts should arise, nor how to dispose of them when <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> began to shift herself into some new garb, they condemn'd them to utter destruction; and yet lest they should seem too rudely to controul all Sense and Reason, they found out this common tale which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing, that these <hi>Substantial Forms</hi> were educed <hi>ex potentia Materiae,</hi> whenever <hi>Matter</hi> began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in any new disguise, and afterwards again retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                     <hi>in gremium Materiae;</hi> &amp; so they thought them not quite lost. But this Curiosity consisting onely of words fortuitously packt up together, being too subtile for any sober judgment to lay hold upon, and which they themselves could never yet tell how to define; we shall as carelesly lay it aside, as they boldly obtrude it upon us, and take the common distinction of all <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Being</hi> for granted, viz. That it is either <hi>Body,</hi> and so <hi>Divisible,</hi> and of three Dimensions; or else it is something which is not properly a <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> &amp; so hath no such Dimensions as that the Parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of should be crouding for place, and justling one with another, not being all able to couch together or run one into another: and this is nothing else but what is commonly called <hi>Spirit.</hi> Though yet we will not be too Critical in depriving every thing which is not gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corporeal of all kind of <hi>Extension.</hi>

                     <p>The First Argument for the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the Soul. That the Soul of man is not Corporeal. The gross absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities upon the Supposition that the Soul is a Complex of fluid Atomes, or that it is made up by a fortuitous Concourse of Atomes: which is <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Notion concerning <hi>Body.</hi> The Principles and <hi>Dogmata</hi> of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philosophy in opposition to the Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and Incorporeal nature of the Soul, asserted by <hi>Lucretius;</hi> but discover'd to be false and insufficient. That <hi>Motion</hi> cannot arise from Body or Matter. Nor can the power of <hi>Sensation</hi> arise from Matter: Much less can <hi>Reason.</hi> That all Humane knowledge hath


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66374:63"/>
not its rise from <hi>Sense.</hi> The proper function of <hi>Sense,</hi> and that it is never deceived. An Addition of Three Considerations for the enforcing of this first Argument, and further clearing the Immateriality of the Soul. That there is in man a Faculty which 1. controlls Sense: and 2. collects and unites all the Perceptions of our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Senses. 3. That Memory and Prevision are not explicable upon the supposition of Matter and Motion.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE shall therefore now endeavour to prove That the <hi>Soul</hi> of man is something <hi>really distinct</hi> from his <hi>Body,</hi> of an <hi>Indivisible</hi> nature, and so cannot be divided into such Parts as should flit one from another; and consequently is apt of it's own Nature to remain to Eternity, and so will doe, except the Decrees of Heaven should abandon it from Being.</p>
                  <p>And first, we shall prove it <hi>ab absurdo,</hi> and here doe as the Mathematicians use to doe in such kind of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations: we will suppose that if the Reasonable Soul be not of such an <hi>Immaterial</hi> Nature, then it must be a <hi>Body,</hi> and so suppose it to be made up as all Bodies are: where because the Opinions of Philosophers dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, we shall only take one, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which supposeth it to be made up by a <hi>fortuitous Concourse of Atomes;</hi> and in that demonstrate against all the rest: (for indeed herein a <hi>particular</hi> Demonstration is an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,</hi> as it is in all Mathematical Demonstrations of this kind.) For if all that which is the <hi>Basis</hi> of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Understandings, which we here call <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Soul,</hi> be nothing else but <hi>a meer Body,</hi> and therefore be infinitely divisible, as all Bodies are; it will be all one in effect whatsoever notion we have of the generation or production thereof. We may give it, if we please, finer words, and use more demure &amp; smooth


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66374:64"/>
language about it then <hi>Epicurus</hi> did, as some that, lest they should speak too rudely and rustically of it by calling it <hi>Matter,</hi> will name it <hi>Efflorescentia Materiae;</hi> and yet lest that should not be enough, adde <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Quintessence to it too: they will be so trim and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in defining of it, that they will not call it by the name of <hi>Aer, Ignis,</hi> or <hi>Flamma,</hi> as some of the ancient vulgar Philosophers did, but <hi>Flos flammae:</hi> and yet the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Poet could use as much Chymistry in exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his fansy as these subtile Doctors doe; and when he would dress out the Notion of it more gaudily, he resembles it to <note n="*" place="margin">Lucret. lib. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Flos Bacchi,</hi> and <hi>Spiritus unguenti suavis.</hi> But when we have taken away this disguise of wanton Wit, we shall find nothing better then <hi>meer Body,</hi> which will be recoiling back perpetually into it's own inert and sluggish Passiveness: though we may think we have quicken'd it never so much by this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile artifice of Words and Phrases, a man's new-born <hi>Soul</hi> will for all this be but little better then his <hi>Body;</hi> and, as that is, be but a <hi>rasura corporis alieni,</hi> made up of some small and thin shavings pared off from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Parents by a continuall motion of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of it; and must afterwards receive its aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation from that food and nourishment which is taken in, as the Body doth. So that the very Grass we walk over in the fields, the Dust and Mire in the streets that we tread upon, may, according to the true meaning of this dull Philosophy, after many refinings, macerations and maturations, which Nature performs by the help of Motion, spring up into so many Rational Souls, and prove as wise as any <hi>Epicurean,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course as subtily of what it once was, when it lay droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in a sensless Passiveness. This conceit is so gross, that one would think it wanted nothing but that witty

                  <p>But because the heavy minds of men are so frequently sinking into this earthly fancy, we shall further search into the entralls of this Philosophy; and see how like that is to a Rational Soul, which it pretends to declare the production of. <hi>Lucretius</hi> first of all taking notice of the mighty swiftness and celerity of the <hi>Soul</hi> in all its operations, <hi>lest</hi> his <hi>Matter</hi> should be too soon tired and not able to keep pace with it, he first casts the <hi>Atomes</hi> prepared for this purpose into such perfect <hi>Sphaerical</hi> &amp; small figures as might be most capable of these swift impressions; for so he, <hi>lib.</hi> 3.</p>

And therefore the wisest Philosophers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ancients universally concluded that there was some higher Principle then meer <hi>Matter,</hi> which was the Cause of all Life and Sense, and that to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal: as the <hi>Platonists,</hi> who thought this reason suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to move them to assert a Mundane Soul.

that our meer accesses and recesses from any <hi>Visible</hi> Object have such a Magical power to change the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Visible Objects, and to transform them into all varieties of figures &amp; fashions; and so attribute all that variety to them which we find in our corporeal perceptions.

What <hi>Matter</hi> can thus bind up <hi>Past, Present</hi> and <hi>Future</hi> time together? which while the Soul of man doth, it seems to imitate (as far as its own finite nature will permit it to strive after an imitation of) God's eternity: and grasping and gathering together a long Series of duration into it self, makes an essay to free it self from the rigid laws of it, and to purchase to it self the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a true Eternity. And as by its <gap reason="foreign">

                  <argument>
                     <p>The second Argument for the Immortality of the Soul. Actions either <hi>Automatical</hi> or <hi>Spontaneous.</hi> That <hi>Spontaneous</hi> and <hi>Elicite</hi> Actions evidence the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Soul from the Body. <hi>Lucretius</hi> his Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion very slight and weak. That the <hi>Liberty of the Will</hi> is inconsistent with the <hi>Epicurean</hi> principles. That the Conflict of Reason against the Sensitive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite argues a Being in us superiour to Matter.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have done with that which we intended for the First part of our Discourse of the Soul's <hi>Immortality:</hi> we have hitherto look'd at it rather <hi>in Concreto</hi> then <hi>in Abstracto,</hi> rather as a Thing complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with and united to the Body; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered it in those Operations, which as they are not proper to the Body, so neither are they altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent upon it, but are rather of a mixt nature.</p>
                  <p>We shall now take notice of it in those <hi>Properties,</hi> in the exercise whereof it hath less commerce with the <hi>Body,</hi> and more plainly declares its own high descent to us, That it is able to subsist and act without the aid and assistance of this <hi>Matter</hi> which it informes.</p>
                  <p>And here we shall take that course that <hi>Aristotle</hi> did in his Books <hi>de Anima,</hi> and first of all inquire, <hi>Whether it hath</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>some kind of Action so proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to it self; as not to depend upon the Body.</hi> And this soon offers it self in the first place to us in those <hi>Elicite motions</hi> of it, as the Moralists are wont to name them, which though they may end in those they call <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66374:72"/>
acts,</hi> yet have their first Emanation from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the Soul it self.</p>
                  <p>For this purpose we shall take notice of Two sorts of <hi>Actions</hi> which are obvious to the experience of every one that observes himself, according to a double Source &amp; emanation of them, which a late Philosopher hath very happily suggested to us. The first are those <hi>Actions</hi> which arise up within us <hi>without any Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;</hi> the other are those that are <hi>consequent to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For we find frequently <hi>such Motions</hi> within our selves <note place="margin">1.</note> which <hi>first are,</hi> before we take notice of them, and which by their own turbulency and impetuousness force us to an <hi>Advertency:</hi> as those <hi>Fiery spirits</hi> and that <hi>inflamed Blood</hi> which sometimes fly up into the head; or those gross and Earthly <hi>Fumes</hi> that disturb our brains; the stirring of many other <hi>Humours</hi> which beget within us Grief, Melancholy, Anger, or Mirth, or other Passions; which have their rise from such Causes as we were not aware of, nor gave no consent to create this trouble to us. Besides all those <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Perceptions</hi> which are begotten within us by some externall motions which derive themselves through our Senses, and fiercely knocking at the door of our Minds and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings force them sometimes from their deepest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates &amp; musings of some other thing, to open to them and give them an audience.</p>
                  <p>Now as to such Motions as these are, it being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the preservation of our Bodies that our Souls should be acquainted with them, a mans Body was so contrived and his Soul so united to it, that they might have a speedy access to the Soul. Indeed some ancient Philosophers thought that the Soul descending more deeply into the Body, as they expresse it, first begot these corporeal motions unbeknown to it self by reason


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66374:72"/>
of its more deep immersion, which afterwards by their impetuousness excited its advertency. But whatsoever truth there is in that Assertion, we clearly find from the relation of our own Souls themselves, that our Soul disowns them, and acknowledgeth no such Motions to have been so busy by her commission; neither knows what they are, from whence they arise, or whither they tend, untill she hath duly examined them. But these <hi>Corporeal motions</hi> as they seem to arise from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but meerly from the <hi>Machina</hi> of the Body it self; so they could not at all be sensated but by the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Neither indeed are all our own <hi>Corporeal actions</hi> perceived by us, but only those that may serve to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a good correspondence &amp; intelligence between the Soul and Body, and so foment &amp; cherish that Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy between them which is necessary for the subsistence and well-being of the whole man in this mundane state. And therefore there is very little of that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done in our Body, which our Souls are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at all of. The <hi>constant Circulation</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> through all our <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries;</hi> the common <hi>motions</hi> of our <hi>Animal spirits</hi> in our <hi>Nerves;</hi> the <hi>maceration</hi> of <hi>Food</hi> within our <hi>Stomachs,</hi> and the <hi>distribution</hi> of <hi>Chyle</hi> and nourishment <hi>to every part</hi> that wants the relief of it; the constant <hi>flux</hi> and <hi>reflux of more sedate Humours</hi> within us; the <hi>dissipations</hi> of our corporeal <hi>Matter</hi> by <hi>insensible Transpiration,</hi> and the <hi>accesses</hi> of <hi>new</hi> in the room of it; all this we are little acquainted with by any vital energie which ariseth from the union of Soul and Body: and therefore when we would acquaint our selves with the <hi>Anatomy</hi> and vital functions of our own Bodies, we are fain to use the same course and method that we would to find out the same things in any other


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66374:73"/>
kind of Animal, as if our Souls had as little to doe with any of these in our own Bodies, as they have in the Bodies of any other Brute creature.</p>
                  <p>But on the other side, we know as well, that many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things <note place="margin">2.</note> that are done by us, are done at the dictate and by the commission of our own Wills; and therefore all such Actions as these are, we know, without any great store of Discoursive inquiry, to attribute to their own proper causes, as seeing the efflux and propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. We doe not by a naked speculation know our Bodies first to have need of nourishment, and then by the Edict of our Wills injoyn our Spirits and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to put themselves into an hungry and craving posture within us by corroding the Tunicles of the Stomach; but we first find our own Souls sollicited by these motions, which yet we are able to gainsay, and to deny those petitions which they offer up to us. We know we commonly meditate and discourse of such Arguments as we our selves please: we mould designs, and draw up a plot of means answerable thereto, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the free vote of our own Souls determines; and use our own Bodies many times, notwithstanding all the reluctancies of their nature, onely as our Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to serve the will and pleasure of our Souls. All which as they evidently manifest a true <hi>Distinction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>the Soul</hi> and <hi>the Body,</hi> so they doe as evidently prove the <hi>Supremacy</hi> and dominion which the Soul hath over the Body. Our Moralists frequently dispute what kind of government that is whereby the <hi>Soul,</hi> or rather <hi>Will,</hi> rules over the <hi>Sensitive</hi> Appetite, which they ordinarily resolve to be <hi>Imperium politicum;</hi> though I should rather say, that all good men have rather a true <hi>despotical power</hi> over their <hi>Sensitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> and over the whole Body, though they use it


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66374:73"/>
onely according to the laws of Reason and Discretion. And therefore the <hi>Platonists</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> thought the Soul of man to be absolutely freed from all the power of <hi>Astral Necessity,</hi> and uncontroulable impressions ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the subordination and mutual Sympathie and Dependance of all mundane causes, which is their proper notion of <hi>Fate.</hi> Neither ever durst that bold <hi>Astrologie</hi> which presumes to tell the Fortunes of all corporeal Essences, attempt to enter into the secrets of man's Soul, or predict the destinies thereof. And indeed whatever the destinies thereof may be that are contained in the vast volume of an Infinite and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Mind, yet we evidently find a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a liberty of Will within our selves, maugre the stubborn malice of all Second Causes. And <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole,</hi> who seems to have disputed so much against that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> of Souls which his Master before him had soberly maintained, does indeed but quarrel with that common sense and Experience which we have of our Souls; this <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> of the Soul being nothing else but that Innate force and power which it hath within it, to stir up such thoughts and motions within it self as it finds it self most free to. And therefore when we reflect upon the productions of our own Souls, we are soon able to find out the first Efficient cause of them. And though the subtilty of some Wits may have made it difficult to find out whether the <hi>Understanding</hi> or the <hi>Will</hi> or some other Facultie of the Soul be the <hi>First Mover,</hi> whence the <hi>motus primò primus</hi> (as they please to call it) proceeds; yet we know it is originally the Soul it self whose vital acts they all are: and although it be not <gap reason="foreign">

co-working with the First Causes of all: But on the other side, when we come to examine those Motions which arise from the Body, this stream runs so far under ground, that we know not how to trace it to the head of it; but we are fain to <hi>analyse</hi> the whole arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, looking from the <hi>Spirits</hi> to the <hi>Blood,</hi> from that to the <hi>Heart,</hi> viewing all along the <hi>Mechanical</hi> contrivance of <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries:</hi> neither know we after all our search whether there be any <hi>Perpetuum mobile</hi> in our own Bodies, or whether all the motions thereof be onely by the redundancy of some external motions without us; nor how to find the First mover in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; though could we find out that, yet we know that there is a Fatal determination which sits in all the wheels of meer Corporeal motion; neither can they exercise any such noble freedome as we constantly find in the Wills of men, which are as large and unbounded in all their Elections as Reason it self can represent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self to be.</p>

exact without any diminution of the whole; but yet no Mechanical art can possibly so perform either, but that the place of section will detract something from the whole. If any one should endeavour to double a <hi>Cube,</hi> as the <hi>Delian</hi> Oracle once commanded the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> requiring them to duplicate the dimensions of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Altar, by any Mechanicall subtilty; he would find it as impossible as they did, and be as much laugh'd at for his pains as some of their Mechanicks were.

For though we could suppose our <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> to be the School-Dames that first taught us the Alphabet of this learning; yet nothing else but a true Mental Essence could be capable of it, or so much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it as to <hi>unbody</hi> it all, and strip it naked of any Sensible garment, and then onely, when it hath done

it, embrace it as its own, and commence a true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect understanding of it. And as we all hold it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to shrink up any Material Quality, which will perpetually spread it self commensurably to the Matter it is in, into a Mathematical point: so is it much more impossible to extend and stretch forth any Immaterial and unbodied Quality or notion according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of <hi>Matter,</hi> and yet to preserve the integrity of its own nature.</p>
                  <p>Besides, in these <hi>Geometricall</hi> speculations we find that our Souls will not consult with our Bodies, or ask any leave of our Fansies how or how far they shall distribute their own notions by a continued progress of Invention; but spending upon their own stock, are most free and liberal, and make Fansie onely to serve their own purpose in painting out not what Matter will afford a copie of, but what they themselves will dictate to it; and if that should be too busie, silence and controul it by their own Imperial laws. They so little care for <hi>Matter</hi> in this kind of work, that they banish it as far as may be from themselves, or else cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise and tame the unruly and refractory nature of it, that it should yield it self pliable to their soveraign commands. These <hi>Embodied Bodies</hi> (for so this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Argument will allow me to call them) which our Senses converse with, are perpetually justling together, contending so irresistably each for its own room and space to be in, and will not admit of any other into it, preserving their own intervals: but when they are once in their <hi>Unbodied nature</hi> entertained into the Mind, they can easily penetrate one another <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. The Soul can easily pyle the vastest number up together in her self, and by her own force sustain them all, and make them all couch together in the same space:


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66374:77"/>
she can easily pitch up all those <hi>Five Regular Bodies</hi> together in her own Imagination, and inscribe them one in another, and then entring into the very heart and centre of them, discern all their Properties and several Respects one to another; and thus easily find her self freed from all Material or Corporeal confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; shewing how all that which we call <hi>Body,</hi> rather issued forth by an infinite projection from some <hi>Mind,</hi> then that it should exalt it self into the nature of any Mental Being; and, as the <hi>Platonists</hi> and <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> have long since well observed, how our Bodies should rather be in our Souls, then our Souls in them.

know that no Exorcisms of Material mutations have any power over them: though we our selves are but of yesterday, and mutable every moment, yet these are Eternall, and depend not upon any mundane vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; neither could we ever gather them from our observation of any Material thing where they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sown.</p>
                  <p>If we reflect but upon our own Souls, how mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly doe the <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Reason, Freedome, Perception,</hi> and the like, offer themselves to us, whereby we may <hi>know</hi> a thousand times <hi>more distinctly</hi> what our <hi>Souls</hi> are then what our <hi>Bodies</hi> are?

For whensoever we take notice of those <hi>Immediate motions</hi> of our own <hi>Minds</hi> whereby they make themselves known to us, we find no such thing in them as <hi>Extension</hi> or <hi>Divisibility,</hi> which are contained in every Corporeal essence: and having no such thing discovered to us from our nearest familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with our own Souls, we could never so easily know whether they had any such things as Bodies joyned to them or not, did not those extrinsecal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions that their turbulent motions make upon them admonish them thereof.</p>

But as the more we reflect upon our own Minds, we find all Intelligible things more clear, (as when we look up to the Heavens, we see all things more bright and radiant, then when we look down upon this dark Earth when the Sun-beams are drawn away from it:) so when we see all Intelligible Being concentring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a greater <hi>Oneness,</hi> and all kind of <hi>Multiplicity</hi> running more and more into the strictest <hi>Unity,</hi> till at last we find all Variety and Division suck'd up into a perfect <hi>Simplicity,</hi> where all happily conspire together in the most undivided peace and friendship; we then easily perceive that the reason of all Diversity and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is (that I may use <hi>Plotinus</hi> his words not much differently from his meaning) <gap reason="foreign">

Divine goodness cannot, it will not, be so cruel to holy souls that are such ambitious suitors for his love. The more they contemplate the blissfull Effluxes of his divine love upon themselves, the more they find themselves strengthned with an undaunted confidence in him; and look not upon themselves in these poor bodily relations and dependences, but in their eternal alliances, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I cannot omit a large recital of his Discourse, which tends so much to disparage that flat and dull Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy which these later Ages have brought forth; as also those heavy-spirited Christians that find so little divine life and activity in their own Souls, as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine them to fall into such a dead sleep as soon as they

And as for what pretends to <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> I think it may not be amiss briefly to search into one main difficulty concerning the Soul's Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: and that is, That strange kind of dependency which it seems to have on the Body, whereby it seems constantly to comply and sympathize therewith, and to assume to it self the frailties and infirmities thereof, to laugh and languish as it were together with that: and so when the Body is compos'd to rest, our Soul seems to sleep together with it; and as the Spring of bodily Motion seated in our Brains is more clear or muddy, so the conceptions of our Minds are more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct or disturbed.</p>
                  <p>To answer this difficulty, it might be enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to say, That the <hi>Sympathy</hi> of things is no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Argument to prove the <hi>Identity</hi> of their essences by, as I think all will grant; yet we shall endeavour more fully to solve it.</p>
                  <p>And for that purpose we must take notice, that though our Souls be of an Incorporeal nature, as we have already demonstrated, yet they are united to our Bodies, not as <hi>Assisting forms</hi> or <hi>Intelligences,</hi> as some have thought, but in some more immediate way; though we cannot tell what that is, it being the great <hi>arcanum</hi> in Man's nature, that which troubled <hi>Plotinus</hi> so much, when he had contemplated the <hi>Immortality</hi> of it, that, as he speaks of himself, <hi>Enn. 4. lib. 8. c.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. But indeed to make such a <hi>Complex</hi> thing as Man is, it was necessary that the <hi>Soul</hi> should be so united to the <hi>Body,</hi> as to share in its passions and infirmities so far as they are void of sinfulness. And as the <hi>Body</hi> alone could not perform any act of Sensation or Reason, and so it self become a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, so neither would the <hi>Soul</hi> be capable of providing for the necessities of the <hi>Body,</hi> without some way whereby a feeling and sense of them might be conveyed to it; neither could it take sufficient care of this corporeal life, as nothing pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to it, were it not sollicited to a natural compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and compassion by the indigencies of our Bodies. It cannot be a meer Mental Speculation that would be so sensibly affected with hunger or cold or other griefs that our Bodies necessarily partake of, to move our Souls to take care for their relief: and were there not such a commerce between our Souls and Bodies, as that our Souls also might be made acquainted by a pleasurable and delightful sense of those things that most gratifie our Bodies, and tend most to the support of their <hi>Crasis</hi> and temperament; the Soul would be apt wholly to neglect the Body, and commit it wholly to all changes and casualties. Neither would it be any thing more to us then the body of a Plant or Star, which we contemplate sometimes with as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment as we do our own bodies, having as much of the Theory of the one as of the other. And the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that our Souls bear to such peculiar bodies as they inhabite, is one and the same in point of notion and speculation with that which they have to any other body: and therefore that which determines the Soul


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66374:86"/>
to this Body more then that, must be some subtile <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> that knits and unites it to it in a more Physical way, which therefore <hi>Proclus</hi> sometimes calls <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>a way that leads upwards and downwards</hi> between the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> whereby their affairs are made known to one another. For as the Soul could not have a sufficient relation of the state and condition of our Bodies, except it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved some impressions from them; so neither could our Souls make use of our Bodies, or derive their own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue into them as they doe, without some intermediate motions. For as some motions may seem to have their beginning in our Bodies, or in some external mover, which are not known by our Souls till their advertency be awakened by the impetuousness of them: so some other motions are derived by our own Wills into our Bodies, but yet in such a way as they cannot be into any other body; for we cannot by the meer Magical virtue of our Wills move any thing else without our selves, nor follow any such virtue by a concurrent sense of those mutations that are made by it, as we doe in our own Bodies.</p>
                  <p>And as this Conjugal affection and sympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Soul and Body are thus necessary to the Being of Mankind; so we may further take notice of <hi>some peculiar part</hi> within us where all this first begins: which


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66374:87"/>
a late fagacious Philosopher hath happily observed to be in that part of the Brain from whence all those Nerves that conduct the Animal spirits up and down the Body take their first Original; seeing we find all Motions that first arise in our Bodies, to direct their course straight up to that, as continually respecting it, and there onely to be sensated, and all the imperate motions of our Wills issuing forth from the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory. Therefore the Animal spirits, by reason of their constant mobility and swift motion, ascending to the place of our Nerves origination, move the Soul, which there sits enthron'd, in some mysterious way; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending at the beck of our Wills from thence, move all the Muscles and joynts in such sort as they are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and directed by the Soul. And if we observe the subtile Mechanicks of our own Bodies, we may easily conceive how the least motion in these Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will, by their relaxing or distending the Nerves, Membranes and Muscles, according to their different quantity or the celerity and quality of their motions, beget all kind of motions likewise in the Organical part of our Bodies. And therefore that our Souls may the better inform our Bodies, they must perceive all their varieties; and because they have such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate proximity to these Spirits, therefore also all the Motions of our Souls in the highest way of Reason and Understanding are apt to stir these quick and nimble spirits alwaies attending upon them, or else fix them too much. And thus we may easily see that should our Souls be alwaies acting and working within us, our Bodies could never take that rest and repose which is requisite for the conservation of Nature. As we may easily perceive in all our studies and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are most serious, our Spirits are the more


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66374:87"/>
fix'd, attending the beck of our Minds. And except this knot whereby our Souls are wedded to our Bodies were unloosed that our Souls were loose from them, they could not act, but presently some Motion or other would be imprest upon our Bodies: as every Motion in our Bodies that is extraordinary, when our Nerves are distended with the Animal spirits, by a continual communication of it self in these Nerves like so many intended Chords to their original, moves our Souls; and so though we alwaies perceive that one of them is primarily affected, yet we also find the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently by consent to be affected too.</p>
                  <p>And because the Soul hath all Corporeal passions and impressions thus conveyed to it, without which it could not expresse a due benevolence to that Body which peculiarly belongs to it; therefore as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of these Animal Spirits are more or less either disorderly and confus'd, or gentle and compos'd, so those Souls especially who have not by the exercise of true Vertue got the dominion over them, are also more or less affected proportionably in their operations. And therefore indeed to question whether the Soul, that is of an Immortal nature, should entertain these corporeal passions, is to doubt whether God could make a Man or not, and to question that which we find by experience in our selves; for we find both that it doth thus, and yet that the Original of these is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from Bodies, and sometimes again by the force of our Wills they are impress'd upon our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Here by the way we may consider in a moral way what to judge of those <hi>Impressions</hi> that are derived from our Bodies to our Souls, which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> not because they are repugnant to Reason, or are aberrations from it; but because they derive not


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66374:88"/>
their original from Reason, but from the Body, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and are by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> more agreeably to the ancient Dialect, called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>material</hi> or <hi>corporeal Idea's</hi> or <hi>impressions.</hi> And these we may safely reckon, I think, amongst our <hi>Adiaphora</hi> in Morality, as being in themselves neither good nor evil, (as all the antient Writers have done) but onely are form'd into either by that stamp that the Soul prints upon them, when they come to be entertain'd into it. And therefore whereas some are apt in the most severe way to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all those Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Passions that first affect our Souls; they might doe well more cautelously to distinguish between such of these motions as have their origination in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and such as immediately arise from our Souls: else may we not too hastily displace the antient <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> and remove the land-marks of Vertue and Vice? For seeing the Soul could not descend into any corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real act, as it must doe while it is more present to one body then another, except it could partake of the griefs and pleasures of the Body; can it be any more sinful for it to sensate this, then it is for it to be united to the Body? If our Soul could not know what it is to eat or drink, but onely by a meer ratiocination, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting by a drie syllogisticall discourse [That meats and drinks preserve the health and fabrick of the Body, repairing what daily exhales from it] without sensating any kind of grief in the want, or refreshment in the use, of them; it would soon suffer the Body to languish and decay. And therefore as these Bodily infirmities and passions are not evil in themselves; so neither are they evil as they first affect our Souls. When our <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> begot of fine and good blood, gently and nimbly play up and down in our <hi>Brains,</hi> and swiftly


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66374:88"/>
flie up and down our whole Bodies, we presently find our Phansies raised with <hi>mirth</hi> and <hi>chearfulness:</hi> and as when our Phansies are thus exalted, we may not call this the <hi>Energy of Grace;</hi> so if our <hi>Spleen</hi> or <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondria,</hi> swelling with terrene and sluggish Vapours, send up such <hi>Melancholick</hi> fumes into our heads as move us to <hi>sadness</hi> and <hi>timorousness,</hi> we cannot justly call that <hi>Vice;</hi> nor when the <hi>Gall</hi> does degurgitate its bitter juyce into our <hi>Liver,</hi> which mingling it self with the blood, begets <hi>fiery</hi> Spirits that presently fly up into our Brain, and there beget impressions of <hi>Anger</hi> within us. The like we may say of those Corporeal passions which are not bred first of all by any Peccant humours or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperatures in our own bodies, but are excited in us by any External objects which by those <hi>idola</hi> and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that they present to our Senses, or rather those Motions they make in them, may presently raise such commotions in our Spirits: For our Body maintains not onely a conspiration and consent of all its own parts, but also it bears a like relation to other mundane bodies with which it is conversant, as being a part of the whole Universe. But when our Soul, once mov'd by the undisciplin'd petulancy of our Animal spirits, shall foment and cherish that Irrational Grief, Fear, Anger, Love, or any other such like Passions contrary to the dictates of Reason; it then sets the stamp of sinfulness upon them. It is the consent of our own Wills that by brooding of them brings forth those hatefull Serpents. For though our Souls be espoused to these Earthly Bodies, and cannot but in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure sympathize with them, yet hath the Soul a true dominion of its own acts. It is not the meer passion, if we take it in a Physicall sense, but rather some inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate action of our own Wills that entertain it: and


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66374:89"/>
these passions cannot force our Wills, but we may be able to chastise and allay all the inordinacy of them by the power of our Wills and Reasons: and therefore God hath not made us under the necessity of sin, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us men subject to such infirmities as these are which are meerly <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And, if I mistake not, our Divinity is wont some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to acknowledge some such thing in our Saviour himself, who was in all things made like to us, our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness excepted. He was <hi>a man of sorrows and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with griefs,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaks of him: and when he was in bodily agonies and horrours, the powerfull assaults thereof upon his Soul moved him to petition his Father, that <hi>if it were possible, that</hi> bitter <hi>Cup might pass from him;</hi> and the sense of death so much afflicted him, that it bred in him the sad <hi>griefs</hi> which S. <hi>Peter</hi> expresseth by <gap reason="foreign">

And we are wont to call this <hi>the language and dictate of Nature</hi> which lawfully endeavours to preserve it self, though presently an <hi>higher principle</hi> must bring all these under a subjection to God, and a free submission to his good pleasure: as it was with our Saviour, who moderated all these passions by a ready resignment of himself and his own Will up to the Will of God; and though his Humanity crav'd for ease and relaxation, yet that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature that was within him would not have it with any repugnancy to the supreme Will of God.</p>

So that if we rightly reflect upon our own <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>the Method</hi> of their <hi>Energies,</hi> we shall find them to be so framed, as not to admit of any other then <hi>One Infinite</hi> source of all that <hi>Reason and Understanding</hi> which themselves partake of, in which they live, move and have their Being. And therefore in the old Metaphysical Theology, an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and Uncreated <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And that is the next thing which our own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings <note place="margin">2.</note> will instruct us in concerning God, viz. <hi>His Eternall Power.</hi> For as we find <hi>a Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our selves to execute the Results of our own <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> so far as we are not hindred by some more potent Cause: so indeed we know it must be a mighty inward strength and force that must enable our Understandings to their proper functions, and that Life, Energy and Activity can never be separated from a Power of Understanding. The more <hi>unbodied</hi> any thing is, the more <hi>unbounded</hi> also is it in its <hi>Effective</hi> power: <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> being the most sluggish, inert and unwieldy thing that may be, having no power from it self nor over it self: and therefore the <hi>Purest Mind</hi> must also needs be the most <hi>Almighty Life and Spirit;</hi> and as it comprehends all things and sums them up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in its Infinite knowledge, so it must also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them all in its own life and power.

                  <p>We may also know from the same Principles, That <note place="margin">3.</note> an <hi>Almighty Love,</hi> every way commensurate to that most Perfect Being, eternally rests in it, which is as strong as that is Infinite, and as full of Life and Vigour as that is of Perfection. And because it finds no Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor Loveliness but onely in that and the issues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, therefore it never does nor can fasten upon any thing else. And therefore the Divinity alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joies it self and its own Infinite perfections, seeing it is that Eternall and stable Sun of goodness that neither rises nor sets, is neither eclipsed nor can receive any encrease of light and beauty. Hence <hi>the Divine Love</hi> is never attended with those turbulent passions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, or wrestlings within it self, of <hi>Fear, Desire, Grief, Anger,</hi> or any such like, whereby <hi>our Love</hi> is wont to explicate and unfold its affection towards its Object.

though our <hi>Love</hi> may sometimes transport us and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently rend us from our selves and from all Self-enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet the more forcible it is, by so much the more it will be apt to torment us, while it cannot centre it self in that which it so strongly endeavours to attract to it; and when it possesseth most, yet is it alwaies hungry and craving, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> hath well express'd it, <gap reason="foreign">

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think some men of later times have much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the nature of <hi>the Divine Love,</hi> in imagining that <hi>Love</hi> is to be attributed to God, as all other Passions are, rather <hi>secundùm effectum</hi> then <hi>affectum:</hi> whereas S. <hi>John,</hi> who was well acquainted with this noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Love,</hi> when he defin'd God by it, and calls him LOVE, meant not to signifie a bare nothing known by some Effects, but that which was infinitely such as it seems to be.

For as nothing can ever stray out of the bounds or get out of the reach of an Almighty Mind and Power; so when we barely think of <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> or any thing else most peculiar to the Divine Essence, we cannot find any of the Properties of <hi>Quantity</hi> mixing themselves with it: and as we cannot confine it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thereof to any one point of the Universe, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we well conceive it extended through the whole, or excluded from any part of it.

For as God cannot <hi>know</hi> himself to be any other then what indeed he is; so neither can he <hi>will</hi> himself to be any thing else then what he is, or that any thing else should swerve from those Laws which his own Eternall Nature and Understanding prescribes to it. For this were to make God free to dethrone himself, and set up a <hi>Liberty</hi> within him that should contend with the royall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of his own boundless Wisdome.</p>
                  <p>To be short; When we converse with our own Souls, we find the <hi>Spring</hi> of all <hi>Liberty</hi> to be nothing else but <hi>Reason;</hi> and therefore no <hi>Unreasonable</hi> creature can partake of it: and that it is not so much any <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency</hi> in our Wills of determining without, much less against, <hi>Reason,</hi> as the <hi>liberall Election of,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in,</hi> that which our <hi>Understandings</hi> propound to us as <hi>most expedient:</hi> And our <hi>Liberty</hi> most appears, when our <hi>Will</hi> most of all congratulates the results of our own Judgments; and then shews it self most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, when either the <hi>Particularness</hi> of that Good which the Understanding converseth with, or the weak knowledge that it hath of it, restrains it not. Then is


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66374:96"/>
it most pregnant and flows forth in the fullest stream, when its Object is most full, and the acquaintance with it most ample: all <hi>Liberty</hi> in the Soul being a kind of <hi>Liberality</hi> in the bestowing of our affections, and the want or scarce measure of it <hi>Parsimoniousness</hi> and <hi>Niggardise.</hi> And therefore the more the Results of our Judgments tend to an <hi>Indifferency,</hi> the more we find our <hi>Wills dubious</hi> and <hi>in suspense</hi> what to chuse; contrary inclinations arising and falling within enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably, as the Scales of a Ballance equally laden with weights; and all this while the Soul's <hi>Liberty</hi> is nothing else but <hi>a Fluctuation</hi> between uncertainties, and languisheth away in the impotency of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.

                     <p>How the Consideration of those restless motions of our Wills after some Supreme and Infinite Good, leads us into the knowledge of a Deity.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE shall once more take a view of our own Souls, and observe how the Motions thereof lead us into the knowledge of a Deity. We alwaies find a <hi>restless appetite</hi> within our selves which craves for some <hi>Supreme and Chief good,</hi> and will not be satisfied with any thing less then <hi>Infinity</hi> it self; as if our own <hi>Penury</hi> and <hi>Indigency</hi> were commensurate to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>fulness:</hi> and therefore no Question has been more canvas'd by all Philosophy then this, <hi>De summo hominis bono,</hi> and all the Sects thereof were antiently distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd by those Opinions that they entertain'd <hi>De fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Boni &amp; Mali,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> phraseth it. But of how weak and dilute a Nature soever some of them may have conceived that <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> yet they could not so satisfie their own inflamed thirst after it. We find by Experience that our Souls cannot live upon that thin and spare diet which they are entertain'd with at their own home; neither can they be satiated with those jejune and insipid morsels which this Outward world furnisheth their Table with. I cannot think the most voluptuous <hi>Epicurean</hi> could ever satisfie the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of his Soul with Corporeal pleasure, though he might endeavour to perswade himself there was no better: nor the most Quintessential <hi>Stoicks</hi> find an <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66374:97"/>
within their own Souls, arising out of the pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their own Mind and Reason; though their sullen thoughts would not suffer them to be beholden to an Higher Being for their Happiness. The more we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to extract an <hi>Autarchy</hi> out of our own Souls, the more we torment them, and force them to feel and sensate their own pinching poverty. Ever since our Minds became so dim-sighted as not to pierce into that Original and Primitive Blessedness which is above, our Wills are too big for our Understandings, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their beloved prey is to be found where Reason discovers it not: they will pursue it through all the vast Wilderness of this World, and force our Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to follow the chase with them: nor may we think to tame this violent appetite or allay the heat of it, except we can look upward to some Eternal and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty goodness which is alone able to master it.</p>
                  <p>It is not the <hi>nimbleness</hi> and <hi>agility</hi> of our own <hi>Reason</hi> which stirs up these <hi>hungry affections</hi> within us, (for then the most ignorant sort of men would never feel the sting thereof) but indeed some <hi>more Potent nature</hi> which hath planted <hi>a restless motion</hi> within us that might more forcibly carry us out to it self; and therefore it will never suffer it self to be controll'd by any of our thin Speculations, or satisfied with those aierie delights that our Fancies may offer to it: it doth not, it cannot, rest it self any where but upon the Centre of some Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty good, some solid and substantial Happiness; like the hungry childe that will not be still'd by all the mother's musick, or change its sower and angry looks for her smiling countenance; nothing will satisfie it but the full breasts.</p>
                  <p>The whole work of this World is nothing but a perpetuall contention for True <hi>Happiness,</hi> and men are


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66374:97"/>
scatter'd up and down the world, moving to and fro therein, to seek it. Our Souls by a Naturall Science as it were feeling their own Originall, are perpetually travailing with new designs and contrivances whereby they may purchase the scope of their high ambitions. <hi>Happiness</hi> is that Pearl of price which all adventure for, though few find it. It is not Gold or Silver that the Earthlings of this world seek after, but some <hi>satisfying</hi> good which they think is there treasur'd up. Neither is it a little empty breath that Ambition and Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity soars after, but some kind of <hi>Happiness</hi> that it thinks to catch and suck in with it.</p>
                  <p>And thus indeed when men most of all <hi>flie from God,</hi> they still <hi>seek after</hi> him. Wicked men pursue indeed after a Deity in their worldly lusts; wherein yet they most blaspheme; for God is not a meer empty Name or Title, but that <hi>Self-sufficient good</hi> which brings along that <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> with it which they so much seek after, though they doe most prodigiously conjoyn it with something which it is not, nor can it be, and in a true and reall strain of blasphemy, attribute all that which God is to something else which is most unlike him, and, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of those infatuated Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>turn the glory of the uncorruptible God into the image of corruptible man, of birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is not better defin'd to us by our <hi>Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> then by our <hi>Wills and Affections:</hi> He is not onely <hi>the Eternal Reason,</hi> that <hi>Almighty Mind and Wisdome</hi> which our <hi>Understandings</hi> converse with; but he is also that <hi>unstained Beauty</hi> and <hi>Supreme Good</hi> which our <hi>Wills</hi> are perpetually catching after: and wheresoever we find <hi>true Beauty, Love and Goodness,</hi> we may say, Here or there is <hi>God.</hi> And as we cannot understand any thing


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66374:98"/>
of an Intelligible nature, but by some primitive <hi>Idea</hi> we have of God, whereby we are able to guess at the elevation of its Being and the pitch of its Perfection; so neither doe our Wills embrace any thing without some <hi>latent sense</hi> of Him, whereby they can tast and discern how near any thing comes to that Self-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient good they seek after: and indeed without such an internal sensating Faculty as this is we should never know when our Souls are in conjunction with the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or be able to relish the ineffable sweetness of true Happiness. Though here below we know but little what this is, because we are little acquainted with frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and enjoyment; we know well what belongs to longings and languishment, but we know not so well what belongs to plenty and fulness; we are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the griefs and sicknesses of this in-bred love, but we know not what its health and complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this particular, <gap reason="foreign">

Nothing can beget a constant sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and composedness within, but something Supreme to its own Essence; as if having once departed from the primitive Fountain of its life, it were deprived of it self, perpetually contesting within it self and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against it self: and all this evidently proves to our inward sense and feeling, That there is some Higher Good then our selves, something that is much more amiable and desirable, and therefore must be loved and preferred before our selves, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> hath excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently observ'd, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Deductions and Inferences from the Consideration of the Divine Nature and Attributes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That all Divine productions are the free Effluxes of Omnipotent Love and Goodness.</hi> The true Notion of <hi>God's glory</hi> what it is. Men very apt to mistake in this point. God needs not the <hi>Happiness</hi> or <hi>Misery</hi> of his Creatures to make himself <hi>glorious</hi> by. God does most <hi>glorifie</hi> himself by communicating himself: we most <hi>glorifie</hi> God when we most partake of him, and resemble him most.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have seen how we may rise up to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Deity by the contemplation of our own Souls: and now it may seem worthy of the best attention of our Minds to consider some <hi>Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Inferences</hi> which naturally flow from the true knowledge of <hi>the Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Attributes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the First is this, <hi>That all Divine productions or operations that terminate in something without Him, are nothing else but the free Effluxes of his own Omnipotent Love and Goodness,</hi> which alwaies moves along with them, and never willingly departs from them. When God made the world, it was not out of a piece of <hi>Self-Interest,</hi> as if he had had any design to advance himself, or to enlarge his own stock of glory and happiness; for what Beauty or Perfection can be in this whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was not before contained in himself as the free Fountain of all? or what could he see out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66374:99"/>
that could adde any thing to his own stature, which he found not already in himself? He made not the World <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>It was not for any need, or that he might gain some honour to himself from Men, Archangels or Angels, as the Tribute or Rent to be paid to him from his Creation,</hi> as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> observes out of <note place="margin">Strom. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Plato.</hi> Though I know not how it comes about that some bring in God as it were casting about how he might erect a new Monopoly of glory to himself, and so to serve this purpose made the World, that he might have a stock of glory here going in it. And I doubt we are wont sometimes to paint him forth too much in the likeness of corrupt and impotent men, that by a fond ambition please themselves and feed their lustfull phansies with their own praises chanted out to them by their admirers, and another while as much sport themselves and applaud their own Greatness, to hear what hideous cries the Severity of their own Power can extort from those they have a mind to make miserable.</p>
                  <p>We all speak much of <hi>the Glory of God,</hi> and entertain a common belief that that's the onely End for which we were all made: and I wish we were all more inwardly moved with a true and lively sense of it. There can be nothing else that either God could propound to himself, or that we ought, if it be rightly understood. But we must not think that God, who is <hi>Infinite ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> would seek for any thing without himself: he needs neither our <hi>Happiness</hi> nor our <hi>Misery</hi> to make himself more illustrious by; but being full in himself, it was his good pleasure to communicate of his own fulness: for, as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 4. in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeum.</note>

                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>How can he look without himself, being he is a pure Mind alwaies encompass'd with its own glorious brightness? But the good pleasure of his Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd with bounty, and the power of a most gracious Deity proceeding from it, liberally dispensed themselves, and distributed those gifts of grace that might make all created Being the more to resemble that Archetypall Idea of themselves.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Timaeus Locrus</hi> represents the Creatour of the World in the same strain that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> did, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, delighted as it were in himself to see that all things that he had made were good, and some things exceeding good. God himself being infinitely full, and having enough and to spare, is alwaies overflowing; and <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> issue forth from him by way of redundancy. When he made the World, because there was nothing better then himself, he shadowed forth himself therein, and, as far as might be, was pleased to represent himself and manifest his own eternall glory and perfection in it. When he is said to seek his own glory, it is indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but to ray and beam forth, as it were, his own lustre; as <hi>R. Jehuda</hi> in his Book <hi>Cofri</hi> hath glanc'd at it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>God does then most <hi>glorifie</hi> and exalt himself in the most triumphant way that may be <hi>ad extra</hi> or out of himself, if I may so phrase it, when he most of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates himself, and when he erects such Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his own Majesty wherein his own <hi>Love and Goodness</hi> may live and reign.</p>
                  <p>And we then most of all <hi>glorifie</hi> him, when we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take most of him, when our serious endeavours of a true assimilation to him and conformity to his Image


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66374:100"/>
declare that we think nothing <hi>Better</hi> then He is, and are therefore most ambitious of being one with him by an Universall Resignation of our selves unto him.</p>
                  <p>This is his <hi>Glory</hi> in its lowest Humiliation, while it beams forth out of himself; and our Happiness in its Exaltation, which Heaven never separates nor divides though Earth doth. His Honour is His Love and Goodness in paraphrase, spreading it self over all those that can or doe receive it; and this he loves and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes wheresoever he finds it, as something of himself therein.</p>
                  <p>Thus I should leave this particular, but that being gone so far in it, it may be worth the while to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Three things wherein God most of all glories and takes the greatest complacency, in reference to Creatures, as they are laid down by <hi>Proclus l. 4. in Tim.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

of them, yet we may go about them, and tell how in a general way to define and distinguish them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Happiness</hi> is nothing else, as we usually describe it to our selves, but the Enjoyment of some Chief good: and therefore the Deity is so boundlesly Happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is every way one with its own Immense per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and every thing so much the more <hi>feelingly</hi> lives upon <hi>Happiness,</hi> by how much the more it comes <hi>to partake of God</hi> and <hi>to be made like to him:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Platonists</hi> well defin'd it to consist <hi>in idea Boni.</hi> And as it is impossible to enjoy <hi>Happiness</hi> without a fruition of God; so it is impossible to enjoy him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an <hi>assimilation</hi> and <hi>conformity</hi> of our Natures to him in a way of true goodness and Godlike perfection. It is a common Maxim of <hi>Socrates,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>it is not lawfull for any impure nature to touch pure Divinity.</hi> For we cannot enjoy God by any Externall conjunction with him: Divine fruition is not by a meer kind of <hi>Apposition</hi> or <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity</hi> of our Natures with the Divine, but it is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Union,</hi> whereby a Divine Spirit <hi>informing</hi> our Souls, derives the strength of <hi>a Divine life</hi> through them; and as this is more strong and active, so is <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> it self more Energeticall within us. It must be some Divine Efflux running quite through our Souls, awakening and exalting all the vitall powers of them into an active Sympathy with some Absolute good, that renders us compleatly blessed. It is not to sit gazing upon a Deity by some thin speculations; but it is an inward feeling and sensation of this Mighty Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness displaying it self within us, melting our fierce and furious natures, that would fain be something in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to God, into an Universall complyance with it self, and wrapping up our amorous Minds wholly


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66374:103"/>
into it self, whereby God comes to be all in all to us. And therefore so long as our Wills and Affections en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to fix upon any thing but God &amp; true Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we doe but indeed anxiously endeavour to wring <hi>Happiness</hi> out of something that will yeeld no more then a flinty Rock to all our pressing and forcing of it. The more we endeavour to force out our Affections to stay and rest themselves upon any Finite thing, the more violently will they recoil back again upon us. It is onely a true sense and relish of God that can tame and master that rage of our insatiable and restless de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires which is still forcing us out of our selves to seek some <hi>Perfect Good,</hi> that which from <hi>a latent sense</hi> of our own Souls we feel our selves to want.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> is laid in mens own Souls, in an ardent and vehement appetite after <hi>Happiness,</hi> which can neither attain to it, nor miss fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of it and of all appearances of it, without a quick and piercing sense. Our Souls are not like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lumps of <hi>dead</hi> and sensless <hi>Matter</hi> to a true living <hi>Happiness,</hi> they are not like these dull clods of Earth which sent not the good or ill savour of those Plants that grow upon them. <hi>Gain</hi> and <hi>Loss</hi> are very sensibly felt by greedy minds. The Soul of man was made with such a large capacity as it is, that so it might be better fitted to entertain a full and liberall Happiness, that the Divine Love and Goodness might more freely spread it self in it, and unite it to it self. And accordingly when it misseth of God, it must feel so much the more the fury and pangs of Misery, and find a severe <hi>Nemesis</hi> arising out of its guilty conscience, which like a fiery Scorpion will fasten its stings within it. And thus as <hi>Heaven, Love, Joy, Peace, Serenity,</hi> and all that which <hi>Happiness</hi> is, buds and blossoms out of holy and God-like


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66374:104"/>
spirits: so also <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> will perpetually spring out of impure Minds, distracted with <hi>Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Ambition, Self-will</hi> or any <hi>inordinate loves</hi> to any particular thing.</p>
                  <p>This is that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that <hi>Plato</hi> speaks of, that fatal Law that is first made in Heaven's Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>That Purity and Holiness shall be happy, and all Vice and Sin miserable.</hi> Holiness of Mind will be more and more attracting God to it self, as all Vice will lapse and slide more and more from him. The more pure our Souls are and abstracted from all mundane things, the more sincerely will they endeavour the nearest uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that may be with God, the more they will pant and breathe after him alone, leaving the chase of any other delight. There is such a noble and free-born spirit in true Goodness seated in Immortall natures, as will not be satisfied meerly with <hi>Innocency,</hi> nor rest it self in this <hi>mix'd Bodily</hi> state, though it could converse with Bodily things without sinking to a vitious love of them; but would alwaies be returning to a more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate union with that Being from whence it came, and which will be drawing it more and more to it self: and therefore it seems very reasonable to believe that if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had continued in a state of <hi>Innocency,</hi> he should have been raised by God to a greater fruition of him, and his nature should have been elevated to a more transcendent condition. And if there was any <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, I think we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it in any other sense but this: the Scripture speaks not of any other terms between God and Man. And this <hi>Law of life,</hi> which we have spoken of, is Eternall and Immutable; nor does the Dispensation of Grace by Christ Jesus at all abrogate or disannull, but rather enforce, it: for so we find that <hi>the Law of Christ,</hi> that


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66374:104"/>
which he gave out to all his Disciples, was this <hi>Law of perfection</hi> that carries <hi>true Happiness</hi> along in the Sense of it, which, as the great Prince of Souls, he dispenseth by his Eternall Spirit in a vitall way unto the Minds of men.</p>

                     <p>A Fourth Deduction.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fourth Deduction acquaints us with the true Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Divine Justice,</hi> That the proper scope and design of it, is to preserve Righteousness, to promote and encourage true Goodness. That it does not primarily intend Punishment, but onely takes it up as a mean to prevent Transgression. True Justice never supplants any that it self may appear more glorious in their ruines. How Divine Justice is most advanced.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the fourth place, we may further collect How rightly to state the Notion of <hi>the Divine Justice,</hi> the scope whereof is nothing else but to assert and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish <hi>Eternall Law and Right,</hi> and to preserve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity thereof; it is no design of <hi>Vengeance,</hi> which though God takes on wicked men, yet he delights not in it. The Divine Justice <hi>first</hi> prescribes that which is most conformable to the Divine Nature, and mainly pursues the conservation of Righteousness. We would not think him a good Ruler that should give out <hi>Laws</hi> to <hi>ensnare</hi> his Subjects, with an even indifferency of Mind whether his Laws be kept, or Punishments suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; but such a one who would make the best secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66374:105"/>
for Right and Equity by wholsome <hi>Laws,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing <hi>Punishments</hi> as a mean to prevent transgression, and not to manifest Severity. The proper scope of <hi>Justice</hi> seems to be nothing else but the preserving and maintaining of that which is Just and Right: the scope of that <hi>Justice</hi> which is in any <hi>Righteous Law,</hi> is properly to provide for a righteous execution of that which is just and fit to be, without intending <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> for to intend that properly and directly, might rather seem <hi>Cruelty</hi> then <hi>Justice:</hi> and therefore <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> takes not up <hi>Punishment,</hi> but onely for a security of performance of Righteous Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> either for the amendment of the person transgressing, or a due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to others to keep them off from transgression. For I would here suppose a Good and Righteous man, who in some desolate place of the World should have the command of a 100 more, and himself be Supreme &amp; under no command. He prescribes Laws to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, makes it death for any one to take away ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life. But now one proves a Murtherer, kills one of his fellows; afterwards repents heartily, and is like to prove usefull among the rest of his fellows: they all are so heartily affected one to another, that there is no danger, upon sparing this Penitent's life, that any one of them should be encouraged to commit the like evil. The Case being thus stated, it will not seem difficult to conclude that the <hi>Justice</hi> of this <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> Commander would <hi>spare</hi> this poor Penitent: for his <hi>Justice</hi> would have preserved that life which is lost, and seeing there is nothing further that it can obtain in taking away this, it will save this which may be saved; for it affects not any blood; and when it destroies, it is out of necessity, to take away a destructive person, and to give example, which in the Case stated falls not out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:66374:105"/>
Again, <hi>Justice</hi> is the <hi>Justice of Goodness,</hi> and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not delight to punish; it aimes at nothing more then the maintaining and promoting <hi>the Laws of Goodness,</hi> and hath alwaies some <hi>good end</hi> before it, and therefore would never punish except some further <hi>good</hi> were in view.</p>
                  <p>True Justice never supplants any that it self might appear more glorious in their ruines; for this would be to make <hi>Justice</hi> love something better then <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> and to advance and magnifie it self in something which is not it self, but rather an aberration from it self: and therefore God himself so earnestly contends with the Jews about <hi>the Equity</hi> of his own waies, with frequent asseverations that his Justice is thirsty after no man's blood, but rather that Sinners would repent, turn from their evil waies, and live. And then Justice is most advanced, when the contents of it are fulfill'd; and though it does not, and will not, acquit the guilty without Repentance, yet the design of it is to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Innocency and promote true Goodness.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE former Deduction leads me to another a-kin to it, which shall be my last, and it is that which <hi>Tully</hi> intimates in his <hi>De legibus,</hi> viz. <hi>That seeing there is such an Entercourse and Society as it were between God and Men, therefore there is also some Law between them, which is the Bond of all Communion.</hi> God himself, from whom all <hi>Law</hi> takes its rise and emanation, is not <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex</hi> and <hi>without all Law,</hi> nor, in a sober sense, <hi>above it.</hi> Neither are the Primitive rules of his Oeconomy in this world the sole Results of an <hi>Absolute will,</hi> but the Sacred Decrees of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Goodness.</hi> I cannot think God to be so <hi>unbounded</hi> in his <hi>Legislative</hi> power, that he can make any thing <hi>Law,</hi> both for his own <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations</hi> and our <hi>Observance,</hi> that we may sometime


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66374:106"/>
imagine. We cannot say indeed that God was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely determin'd from some Law within himself to make us; but I think we may safely say, when he had once determin'd to make us, he could neither make us <hi>sinfull,</hi> seeing he had no <hi>Idea</hi> nor shadow of Evil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himself, nor lap us those dreadfull fates within our Natures, or set them over us, that might <hi>arcanâ inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione</hi> (as some are pleas'd to phrase it) secretly work our ruine, and silently carry us on, making use of our own naturall infirmity, to eternall misery. Neither could he design to make his creatures <hi>miserable,</hi> that so he might shew himself <hi>Just.</hi> These are rather the by-waies of <hi>Cruell</hi> and <hi>Ambitious</hi> men, that seek their own advantage in the mischiefs of other men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive their own Rise by their Ruines: this is not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Justice,</hi> but the <hi>Cruelty</hi> of degenerated men.</p>
                  <p>But as the Divinity could propound nothing to it self in the making of the World but the <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of its own <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> so it can never swerve from the same Scope and End in the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it self to it. Neither did God so boundlesly enlarge the appetite of Souls after some All-sufficient Good, that so they might be the more unspeakably tortur'd in the missing of it; but that they might more certainly return to the Originall of their Beings. And such busie-working Essences as the Souls of men are, could neither be made as dull and sensless of true Happiness as Stocks and Stones are, neither could they contain the whole summe and perfection of it within themselves: therefore they must also be inform'd with such Principles as might conduct them back again to Him from whom they first came. God does not make Creatures for the meer sport of his Almighty arm, to raise and ruine and toss up and down at meer pleasure.

                  <p>And so we come to consider that Law embosom'd in the Souls of men which ties them again to their Creatour, and this is called <hi>The Law of Nature;</hi> which indeed is nothing else but a Paraphrase or Comment upon the Nature of God as it copies forth it self in the Soul of Man.</p>
                  <p>Because God is the <hi>First Mind</hi> and the <hi>First Good,</hi> propagating an <hi>Imitation</hi> of himself in such Immortall Natures as the Souls of Men are, therefore ought the Soul to renounce all mortall and mundane things, and preserve its Affections chast and pure for God himself; to love him with a most Universall and Unbounded Love; to trust in him and reverence him; to converse with him in a free &amp; chearful manner, as One <hi>in whom we live and move and have our Beings,</hi> being perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually encompassed by him, and never moving out of him; to resign all our Waies and Wills up to him with an equall and indifferent mind, as knowing that he guides and governs all things in the Best way; to sink our selves as low in <hi>Humility,</hi> as we are in <hi>Self-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And because all those scatter'd <hi>Raies</hi> of <hi>Beauty</hi> and Loveliness which we behold spread up and down all the World over, are onely the <hi>Emanations</hi> of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhausted <hi>Light</hi> which is above; therefore should we <hi>love</hi> them all in that, and climb up alwaies by those Sun-beams unto the Eternall Father of Lights: we should look upon him and take from him the pattern of our lives, and alwaies eying of him should <gap reason="foreign">

We should endeavour more and more to be perfect, as he is; in all our dealing with men, doing good, shewing mercy and compassion, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing justice and righteousness, being alwaies full of charity and good works; and look upon our selves as having nothing to doe here but to display &amp; blazon the glory of our heavenly Father, and frame our hearts and lives according to that Pattern which we behold in the Mount of a holy Contemplation of him. Thus we should endeavour to preserve that Heavenly fire of the Divine Love and Goodness (which issuing forth from God centres it self within us, and is the Protopla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick virtue of our Beings) alwaies alive and burning in the Temple of our Souls, and to sacrifice our selves back again to him. And when we fulfill this <hi>Royall Law</hi> arising out of the heart of Eternity, then shall we here appear to be <hi>the Children of God,</hi> when he thus lives in us, as our Saviour speaks <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And so we shall close up this Particular with that <hi>High privilege</hi> which Immortall Souls are invested with: they are all <hi>the Off-spring of God,</hi> for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> allows the Heathen Poet to call them: they are all royally descended, and have no Father but God himself, being originally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into his image and likeness; and when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the purity and holiness of the Divine Life in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect as God is perfect, then they <hi>manifest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> to be his <hi>Children, Matth.</hi> 5.

                     <p>An <hi>APPENDIX</hi> concerning the Reason of Positive Laws.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUT here, as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the two former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, it may be of good use to enquire into the <hi>Reason</hi> of such <hi>Laws</hi> as we call <hi>Positive,</hi> which God hath in all times, as is commonly suppos'd, enjoyn'd obedience to; which are not the Eternall dictates and Decretals of the Divine Nature communicating it self to Immortall Spirits, but rather deduce their Originall from the free will and pleasure of God.</p>
                  <p>To solve this Difficulty, that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> may seem a fit <hi>Medium,</hi> who tells us, <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The Law was added because


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66374:108"/>
of transgression;</hi> though I doubt not but he means thereby the <hi>Morall</hi> Law as well as any other. The true intent and scope of these <hi>Positive</hi> laws, (and it may be of such an externall promulgation of the <hi>Morall)</hi> seems to be nothing else but this, to secure the Eternall Law of Righteousness from transgression. As the Jews say of their <hi>decreta sapientum,</hi> that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>an hedge to the Law;</hi> so we may say of these Divine Decretals, they were but cautionary and preventive of disobedience to that Higher Law: and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us why the Morall Law was made such a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical business by an external promulgation, &amp;c. 1 Tim. 1. 9. not so much because of righteous men, in whom the Law of Nature lives, who perform the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> without any outward Law, but it was given <hi>for the lawless and disobedient,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore I doubt not but we may safely conclude, that God gave not those <hi>Positive</hi> Laws meerly <hi>pro imperio,</hi> if I may use that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; it was not meerly to manifest his Absolute Dominion &amp; Soveraignty, as some think, but for the good of those that were enjoyned to obey; and this belief <hi>Moses</hi> endeavours almost throughout the whole Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> to strengthen the Israelites in: and therefore God was so ready upon all occasions to <hi>dispense</hi> with these Laws, and requires the Jews to omit the observance of them, when they might seem to justle with any other Law of <hi>Morall duty</hi> or <hi>Humane necessity,</hi> as may be observ'd in many Instances in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>But for a more distinct unfolding of this point, we may take notice of this difference in the notion of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> as we are to converse with them. Some things are so <hi>absolutely,</hi> and somethings are so onely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively.</hi> That which is <hi>absolutely good,</hi> is every way


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66374:109"/>
                     <hi>Superiour to us,</hi> and we ought alwaies to be <hi>commanded by it,</hi> because we are made under it: But that which is <hi>relatively good to us,</hi> may sometime be <hi>commanded by us.</hi> Eternall Truth and Righteousness are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves perfectly &amp; <hi>absolutely good,</hi> and the more we <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> our selves <hi>to them,</hi> the better we are. But those things that are onely <hi>good relatively</hi> and in order to us, we may say of them, that they are so much the better, by how much the more they are <hi>conform'd to us,</hi> I mean, by how much the more they are accommodated and fitted to our estate and condition, and may be fit means to help and promote us in our pursuit of some <hi>Higher good:</hi> and such indeed is the matter of all <hi>Positive</hi> Laws, and the <hi>Symbolicall</hi> or <hi>Rituall</hi> part of Religion. And as we are made for the former, <hi>viz.</hi> what is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely good, to serve that; so are these latter made for us, as our Saviour hath taught us when he tells us that <hi>the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath:</hi> and as sincere and reall Christians grow up towards true perfection, the lesse need have they of <hi>Positive</hi> precepts or Externall helps. Yet I doubt it is nothing else but a wanton <hi>fastus</hi> and proud temper of spirit in our times that makes so many talk of being <hi>above Ordinances,</hi> who, if their own arrogance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption would give them leave to lay aside the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering glasse of their own Self-love, would find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to have most need of them.</p>
                  <p>What I have observ'd concerning the <hi>Things abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely good,</hi> I conceive to be included in that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> mention'd Dan. 9. <hi>everlasting righteousness,</hi> which the Prophet there saith should be <hi>brought in</hi> and advanced by <hi>Messiah:</hi> this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is of an eternall and immutable nature, as being a conformity with Eternall and Unchangeable


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66374:109"/>
Truth: For there is a Righteousness which thus is not <hi>Eternall,</hi> but <hi>Positive</hi> and at the pleasure of God that dictates it: and such was the <hi>Righteousness</hi> which Christ said <hi>it became him to fulfill</hi> when he was baptiz'd; there <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> was no necessity that any such thing should become due. But the Foundation of this <hi>Everlasting righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is something unalterable. To speak more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, <hi>That the Highest good should be loved in the Highest degree; That dependant creatures, that borrow all they have from God, should never glory in themselves, or admire themselves, but ever admire and adore that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Goodness which is the Source of their Beings and all the Good they partake of; That we should alwaies doe that which is just and right, according to the measure we would others should doe with us:</hi> these, and some other things which a rectified Reason will easily supply, are <hi>immutably true and righteous;</hi> so that it never was nor can be true, that they are unnecessary. And whoso hath his Heart molded into <hi>a delight</hi> in such a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and the practise thereof, hath this <hi>Eternall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness brought into his Soul,</hi> which Righteousness is also <hi>true</hi> and <hi>reall,</hi> not like that <hi>imaginary Externall</hi> righteousness of the Law which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> boasted in.</p>

                     <p>That <hi>Prophesie</hi> is the way whereby Revealed Truth is dispensed and conveighed to us. Man's Mind capable of conversing and being acquainted as well with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed or Positive Truth, as with Naturall Truth. Truths of Naturall inscription may be excited in us and cleared to us by means of Propheticall Influence. That the <hi>Scripture</hi> frequently accommodates it self to vulgar apprehension, and speaks of things in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test way of condescension.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving spoken to those <hi>Principles of Naturall Theologie</hi> which have the most proper and necessary <hi>influence</hi> into <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Practise,</hi> and are most pregnant with morall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; we come now to consider <hi>Those pieces of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Truth</hi> which tend most of all to foment and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish true and reall Piety.</p>
                  <p>But before we fall pressly into any strict Enquiry concerning them, it may not be amiss to examine <hi>How and in what manner This kind of Truth, which depends solely upon the Free will of God, is manifested unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> and so treat a little concerning <hi>Prophesie,</hi> which indeed is the <hi>onely way</hi> whereby <hi>This kind of Truth</hi> can be dispensed to us. For though our own Reason and


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66374:114"/>
Understanding carry all <hi>Natural Truth</hi> necessary for <hi>Practice</hi> in any sort, engraven upon themselves, and folded up in their own Essences more immediatly, as being the first participations of the Divine Minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in its own Eternal nature: yet <hi>Positive Truth</hi> can only be made known to us by a free influx of the Divine Mind upon our Minds and Understandings. And as it ariseth out of nothing else but the free plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Divinity, so without any natural determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it freely shines upon the Souls of men where and when it lifteth, hiding its light from them or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing it forth upon them, as it pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>Yet the souls of men are as capable of conversing with it, though it doe not naturally arise out of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity of their own Understandings, as they are with any Sensible and External Objects. And as our Sensations carry the notions of Material things to our Understandings which before were unacquainted with them; so there is some Analogical way whereby the knowledge of Divine Truth may also be revealed to us. For so we may call as well that Historical Truth of Corporeal and Material things, which we are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of by our Senses, <hi>Truth of Revelation,</hi> as that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth which we now speak of: and therefore we may have as certain and infallible a way of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the one, as with the other. And God having so contrived the nature of our Souls, that we may converse one with another, and inform one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of things we knew not before, would not make us so deaf to his Divine voice that breaks the rocks, and rends the mountains asunder; He would not make us so undisciplinable in Divine things, as that we should not be capable of receiving any Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from himself of those things which we were before


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66374:114"/>
unacquainted with. And <hi>this way</hi> of communicating Truth to the Souls of men is originally nothing else but <hi>Prophetical</hi> or Enthusiastical; and so we may take notice of <hi>the General nature of Prophesie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I would not all this while be mistaken, as if I thought no <hi>Natural Truth</hi> might be by the means of Prophetical influence awakened within us, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to us, or that we could not <hi>lumine prophetico</hi> behold the <hi>Truths of Naturall inscription;</hi> for indeed one main end and scope of the <hi>Prophetical Spirit</hi> seems to be the <hi>quickning up</hi> of our Minds to a more lively converse with those <hi>Eternal Truths</hi> of Reason, which commonly lie buried in so much fleshly obscurity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, that we discern them not. And therefore the Scripture treats not only of those Pieces of Truth which are the Results of God's free Counsells, but also of those which are most a-kin and allied to our own Understandings, and that in the greatest way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention that may be, speaking to the weakest sort of men in the most vulgar sort of dialect: which it may not be amiss to take a little notice of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Divine Truth</hi> hath its <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Exinanition,</hi> as well as its <hi>Exaltation. Divine Truth</hi> becomes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in Scripture <hi>incarnate,</hi> debasing it self to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume our rude conceptions, that so it might converse more freely with us, and infuse its own Divinity into us. God having been pleased herein to manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not more jealous of his own Glory, then he is (as I may say) zealous of our good. <hi>Nos non habemus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, sicut Deus habet linguam.</hi> If he should speak in the language of <hi>Eternity,</hi> who could understand him, or interpret his meaning? or if he should have declared his Truth to us only in a way of the <hi>purest abstraction</hi> that Humane Souls are capable of, how should then


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:66374:115"/>
the more rude and illiterate sort of men have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to apprehend it? <hi>Truth</hi> is content, when it comes into the world, to wear our mantles, to learn our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to conform it self as it were to our dress and fashions: it affects not that State or <hi>Fastus</hi> which the disdainfull Rhetorician sets out his style withall, <hi>Non Tarentinis aut Siculis haec scribimus;</hi> but it speaks with the most <hi>Idiotical</hi> sort of men in the most <hi>Idiotical</hi> way, and becomes all things to all men, as every sonne of Truth should doe, for their good. Which was well observed in that old Cabbalistical Axiome among the Jewes, <hi>Lumen supernum nunquam descendit sine indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento.</hi> And therefore (it may be) the best way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the true sense and meaning of the Scripture is not rigidly to examine it upon Philosophical Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories, or to bring it under the scrutiny of School-Definitions and Distinctions. It speaks not to us so much in the tongue of the learned <hi>Sophies</hi> of the world, as in the plainest and most vulgar dialect that may be. Which the Jews constantly observed and took notice of, and therefore it was one common Rule among them for a true understanding of the Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Lex loquitur linguâ filorum hominum.</hi> Which <hi>Maimonides</hi> expounds thus, in <hi>More Nevoch.</hi> Par. 1. C. 26. <hi>Quicquid homines ab initio cogitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis suae intelligentiâ &amp; imaginatione suâ possunt assequi, id in Scriptura attribuitur Creatori.</hi> And therefore we find almost all <hi>Corporeal properties</hi> attributed to God in Scripture, <hi>quia vulgus hominum ab initio cogitationis Entitatem non apprehendunt, nisi in rebus corporeis,</hi> as the same Author observes. But such of them as sound <hi>Imperfection</hi> in vulgar eares, as <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> &amp; the like, these (saith he) the Scripture no where attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to him. The reason of this plain and Idiotical


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66374:115"/>
style of Scripture it may be worth our farther taking notice of, as it is laid down by the forenamed Author C. 33. <hi>Haec causa est propter quam Lex loquitur linguâ filiorum hominum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For this reason the Law speaks according to the language of the sons of men, because it is the most commodious and easie way of initiating and teaching Children, Women, and the Common people, who have not ability to apprehend things according to the very nature and essence of them.</hi> And in C. 34. <hi>Et si per Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empla &amp; Similitudines non deduceremur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if we were not led to the knowledge of things by Examples and Similitudes, but were put to learn and understand all things in their Formal notions and Essential definitions, and were to believe nothing but upon preceding Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations; then we may well think that (seeing this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done but after long preparations) the greater part of men would be at the conclusion of their daies, before they could know whether there be a God or no,</hi> &amp;c. Hence is that Axiome so frequent among the Jewish Doctors, <hi>Magna est virtus vel fortitudo Prophetarum, qui assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant formam cum formante eam,</hi> i. e. Great is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who while they looked down upon these Sensible and Conspicable things, were able to furnish out the notion of Intelligible and Inconspica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beings thereby to the rude Senses of Illiterate people.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture was not writ only for Sagacious and Abstracted minds, or Philosophical heads; for then how few are there that should have been taught the true Knowledge of God thereby? <hi>Vidi filios coenaculi, &amp; erant pauci,</hi> was an antient Jewish proverb. We are not alwaies rigidly to adhere to the very Letter of the Text. There is a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Scripture, as the Jewish interpreters observe. We must not think


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:66374:116"/>
that it alwaies gives us Formal Definitions of things, for it speaks commonly according to Vulgar apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: as when it tells of <hi>the Ends of the heaven,</hi> which now almost every Idiot knows hath <hi>no ends</hi> at all. So <note place="margin">Psal. 19. Mat. 24.</note> when it tells us Gen. 2. 7. that <hi>God breathed into man the breath of life, and man became a living soul;</hi> the expression is very Idiotical as may be, and seems to comply with that vulgar conceit, that the Soul of Man is nothing else but a kind of <hi>Vital breath</hi> or <hi>Aire:</hi> and yet the <hi>Immortality</hi> thereof is evidently insinuated in setting forth a double Original of the two parts of Man, his Body and his Soul; the one of which is brought in as arising up out of the <hi>Dust</hi> of the earth, the other as proceeding from the <hi>Breath</hi> of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p>So we find very Vulgar expressions concerning God himself, besides those which attribute <hi>Sensation</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> to him, as when he is set forth as <hi>riding upon the wings of the Wind, riding upon the Clouds, sitting in Heaven,</hi> and the like, which seem to determine his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Omnipresence to some peculiar place: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed such passages as these are can be fetch'd from nothing else but those crass apprehensions which the generalitie of men have of God, as being most there, from whence the objects of dread and admiration most of all smite and insinuate themselves into their Senses, as they doe from the <hi>Aire, Clouds, Winds</hi> or <hi>Heaven.</hi> So the state of <hi>Hell</hi> and Miserie is set forth by such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations as were most apt to strike a terror into the minds of men, and accordingly it is called <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Gigantum,</hi> the place where all those old <hi>Giants,</hi> whom divine vengeance pursued in the general Deluge, were assembled together, as it is well observed by a late Author of our own upon <hi>Proverbs 21. 16. The</hi>

                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:66374:116"/>
                     <hi>man that wandreth out of the way of understanding, in coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Gigantum commorabitur.</hi> And accordingly we find the state and condition of these expressed <hi>Job 26. 5. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes gemunt sub aquis; &amp; qui habitant cum iis. Nudus est infernus coram illo, &amp; nullum est operimentum perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni,</hi> as the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> renders it, <hi>The Giants groan under the waters, and they that dwell with them. Hell is naked before him,</hi> (that is, God,) <hi>and destruction hath no covering.</hi> In like manner our Saviour sets forth <hi>Hell</hi> as a great valley of fire like that of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> which was prepared with a great deal of skill, to torture and torment the Devils in. Again we find <hi>Heaven</hi> set forth sometimes as a place of continual <hi>banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> where, according to the Jewish customes, they should lye down in one anothers bosomes at a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Feast: Sometimes as a <hi>Paradise</hi> furnished with all kinds of delight and pleasure. Again, when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture would infinuate God's seriousness and realitie in any thing, it brings him in as ordering it a great while agoe before the foundation of the world was laid, as if he more regarded that then the building of the world.</p>
                  <p>I might instance in many more things of this nature, wherein the <hi>Philosophical</hi> or <hi>Physical</hi> nature and Literal veritie of things cannot so reasonably be supposed to be set forth to us, as the <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Theological.</hi> But I shall leave this Argument, and now come more precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to consider of <hi>the nature of Prophesie,</hi> by which God flows in upon the Minds of men extrinfecally to their own proper operations, and converghs truth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from himself into them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Prophetical Spirit did not alwaies manifest it self with the same clearnesse and evidence. The Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual difference of Divine illumination between <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Hagiographi.</hi> A general survey of the Nature of Prophesie properly so called. Of the joint impressions and operations of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Phansie in Prophesie. Of the four degrees of Prophesie. The difference between a <hi>Vision</hi> and a <hi>Dream.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUT before we doe this, we shall briefly premise something in general concerning that <hi>Gradual varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> whereby these Divine Enthusiasms were discover'd to the Prophets of old. The <hi>Prophetical Spirit</hi> did not alwaies manifest it self <hi>eodem vigore luminis,</hi> with the same clearness and evidence, in the same exaltation of its light: But sometimes that <hi>light</hi> was more <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>vivid,</hi> sometimes more <hi>wan</hi> and <hi>obscure;</hi> which seems to be insinuated in that passage, <hi>Heb. 1. 1. God who in time past spake unto the Fathers</hi> by the Prophets <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So we find an evident difference of <hi>Prophetical illumination</hi> asserted in Scripture between <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>the rest of the Prophets,</hi> Deut. 34. 10. <hi>And there arose not a Prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face:</hi> which words have a manifest reference to that which God himself in a more publick and open way declared concerning <hi>Moses,</hi> upon occasion of some arrogant speeches of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> who would equalize their own Degree of Prophesie to that


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66374:117"/>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> Numb. 12. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>And the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the Tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth: And he said, Hear my words; If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my self known unto him in a Vision, and will speak unto him in a Dream: My servant Moses is not so, who is faithfull in all mine house; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and not in dark speeches, and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold. Wherefore then were ye not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to speak against my servant Moses?</hi> In which words that degree of Divine illumination whereby God made himself known to <hi>Moses</hi> seems to be set forth as something transcendent to the <hi>Prophetical</hi> illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and so the phrase of the New Testament is wont to distinguish between <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Moses</hi> had been greater then any <hi>Prophet.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this <hi>Gradual difference</hi> between <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> there is another difference very famous amongst the Jewish Writers between the <hi>Prophets</hi> and the <hi>Hagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographi,</hi> which <hi>Hagiographi</hi> were suppos'd by them to be much inferior to the <hi>Prophets.</hi> But what this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them was, we shall endeavour to shew more fully hereafter.</p>
               <p>Having briefly premised this, and glanced at a Threefold <hi>Inspiration</hi> relating to <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Hagiographi;</hi> we shall first of all enquire into <hi>the Nature</hi> of that which is <hi>peculiarly</hi> amongst the Jews called <hi>Prophetical.</hi> And this is thus defined to us by <hi>Maimonides</hi> in <hi>Par.</hi> 2. c. 36. of his <hi>More Nevochim, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas &amp; quidditas Prophetiae nihil aliud est quàm Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia à Deo Optimo Maximo, mediante intellectu Agente, super facultatem Rationalem primò, deinde super facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem Imaginatricem influens.</hi> i. e. <hi>The true essence of


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66374:118"/>
Prophesie is nothing else but an Influence from the Deitie upon the Rational first, and afterwards the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Facultie, by the mediation of the Active intellect.</hi> Which Definition belongs indeed to <hi>Prophesie</hi> as it is Technicallie so called, and distinguished by <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> both from that degree of Divine illumination which was above it, which the Masters constantly attribute to <hi>Moses,</hi> and from that other degree inferior to it, which they call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Spiritus Sanctus,</hi> that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit that moved in the Souls of the <hi>Hagiographi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Rabbi Joseph Albo</hi> in <hi>Maam</hi> 3. c. 8. <hi>De funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis fidei,</hi> hath given us a more large description, so as to take in also the <hi>gradus Mosaicus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie is an influence from God upon the Rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, either by the Mediation of the Fansie or otherwise: and this influence, whether by the ministry of an Angel or otherwise, makes a man to know such things as by his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abilities he could not attain to the knowledg of.</hi> Though here our Author seems too much to have streightned the latitude of <hi>Prophetical</hi> influence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as we intimated before) not only those pieces of Divine truth may be communicated to the Souls of men which are not contained within their own Ideas, but also those may be excited which have a necessarie connexion with and dependence upon Reason.</p>
               <p>But the main thing that we shall observe in this descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is, that Facultie or Power of the Soul upon which these Extraordinarie impressions of Divine light or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence are made; which in all proper <hi>Prophesie</hi> is both the <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Imaginative</hi> power. For in this Case they supposed the <hi>Imaginative</hi> power to be set forth as a <hi>Stage</hi> upon which certain <hi>Visa</hi> and <hi>Simulacra</hi> were represented to their Understandings, just indeed as


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66374:118"/>
they are to us in our common Dreams; only that the Understandings of the Prophets were alwaies kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and strongly acted by God in the midst of these apparitions, to see the intelligible Mysteries in them, and so in these Types and Shadows, which were Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of some spiritual things, to behold the Antitypes themselves: which is the meaning of that old Maxime of the Jews which we formerly cited out of <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Magna est virtus seu fortitudo Prophetarum qui assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milant formam cum formante eam.</hi> But in case the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative</hi> facultie be not thus set forth as the <hi>Scene</hi> of all <hi>Prophetical</hi> illumination, but that the Impressions of things nakedly without any <hi>Schemes</hi> or <hi>Pictures</hi> be made immediately upon the Understanding it self, then is it reckoned to be the <hi>gradus Mosaicus,</hi> wherein God speaks as it were <hi>face to face;</hi> of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Accordingly <hi>R. Albo,</hi> in the Book before cited and 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, hath distinguished <hi>Prophesie</hi> into these four <hi>degrees.</hi> The first and lowest of all is, when the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative</hi> power is most predominant, so that the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions made upon it are too busie, &amp; the Scene becomes too turbulent for the Rational facultie to discern the true Mystical and Anagogical sense of them clearly; and in this case the Enthusiasms spend themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in <hi>Parables, Similitudes</hi> and <hi>Allegories,</hi> in a dark and obscure manner, as is very manifest in <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and many of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> his Prophesies, as also those of <hi>Daniel:</hi> where though we have first the outward frame of things <hi>Dramatically</hi> set forth so potently in the Prophet's phansie, as that his Mind was not at the same time capable of the mystical meaning, yet that was afterward made known to him, but yet with much obscuritie still attending it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>declining state</hi> of <hi>Prophesie</hi> the Jews supposed


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66374:119"/>
then principally to have been, and this Divine illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to have been then setting in the Horizon of the Jewish Church, when they were carried captive into <hi>Babylon.</hi> All which we may take a little more fully from our Author himself in his 3.

                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>Every Prophet that is of a strong, fagacious and piercing Understanding, will apprehend the thing nakedly without any Similitude, whence it comes to pass that all his sayings prove distinct and clear, and free from all obscuritie, having a literal truth in them: But a Prophet of an inferior rank or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, his words are obscure, enwrapp'd in Riddles and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, and therefore have not a Literal but Allegorical truth contained in them.</hi> Thus he. And so afterwards, according to the general opinion of the Jewish Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, he tells us that after the Captivity, in the twilight of Prophesie, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> began to speak altogether in Riddles and Parables; and so he himself complains to God, <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 20. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>Ah Lord God, they say of me, Doth he not speak Parables?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second degree which our forementioned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes of <hi>Prophesie</hi> is, when the strength of the Imaginative and Rational powers equally ballance one another.</p>
               <p>The third is, when the Rational power is most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant; in which case (as we heard before) the Minde of the Prophet is able to strip those things that are represented to it in the glass of Phansie of all their materiality and sensible nature, and apprehend them more distinctly in their own naked Essence.</p>
               <p>The last and Highest is the <hi>gradus Mosaicus,</hi> in which all <hi>Imagination</hi> ceaseth, &amp; the Representation of Truth descends not so low as the Imaginative part, but is made in the highest stage of Reason and Understanding.</p>

But we shall hereafter speak more fully concerning the several degrees of Prophetical Inspiration, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course more particularly of the <hi>Ruach hakkodesh,</hi> the <hi>highest</hi> degree of Prophesie or <hi>gradus Mosaicus,</hi> and <hi>Bath col</hi> or the <hi>lowest</hi> degree of Prophesie.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that generally all <hi>Prophesie</hi> or Prophetical Enthusiasm lies in the joint-impressions and operations of both these forementioned faculties, the Jews were wont to understand that place <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 6, &amp;c. as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally decyphering that <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> by which God would discover himselfe to all those Prophets that ever should arise up amongst them, or ever had been, except <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And there are only these <note n="*" place="margin">In ist is dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus partibus, <hi>Somnio</hi> &amp; <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione,</hi> continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur omnes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetiae gradus. <hi>Maimon.</hi> in <hi>More Nev. p. 2. c.</hi> 36.</note> Two waies declared whereby God would reveal himself to every other Prophet, either in a <hi>Vision</hi> or a <hi>Dream;</hi> both which are perpetually attended with those <hi>Visa</hi> and <hi>Simulacra sensibilia</hi> as must needs be impressed upon Common sense or Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, whereby the Prophets seemed to have all their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses waking and exercising their several functions, though indeed all was but <hi>Scenicall</hi> or <hi>Dramatical.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Twofold way of Divine inspiration, the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 2. 28.</note> Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> foretells the Nature of that <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Spirit that should be powred out in the latter times; and in <hi>Jeremy</hi> 14. 14. we have the false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets brought in as endeavouring apishly to imitate the true Prophets of God, in fortifying their Fansies by the power of Divination, that they might talk of <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions</hi> when they came among the people.</p>
               <p>Now for the Difference of these two, a <hi>Dream</hi> and a <hi>Vision,</hi> it seems rather to lie in Circumstantials then in any thing Essential; &amp; therefore <hi>Maim. part. 2. More Nev. cap.</hi> 45. tells us that in a <hi>Dream</hi> a voice was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard, which was not usual in a <hi>Vision.</hi> But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66374:120"/>
of Divine things by some Sensible images or some Narrative voice must needs be in both of them. But yet the Jews are wont to make a <hi>Vision</hi> superiour to a <hi>Dream,</hi> as representing things more to the life, which indeed seizeth upon the Prophet while he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, but it no sooner surpriseth him but that all his external senses are bound; and so it often declines into a <hi>true Dream,</hi> as <hi>Maimon.</hi> in the place forenam'd proves by the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15. 12. where the <hi>Vision</hi> in which God had appeared to him (as it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ver. 1.) passed into a <hi>Sleep. And when the Sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abraham, and loe an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</hi> Which words seem to be nothing else but a description of that passage which he had by Sleep out of his <hi>Vision</hi> into a <hi>Dream.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now these <hi>Ecstatical</hi> impressions whereby the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi> of the <hi>Prophet</hi> was thus ravish'd from it self, and was made subject wholy to some <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> intellect informing it and shining upon it, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose S. <hi>Paul</hi> had respect to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Now we see</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>by a glass, in riddles</hi> or <hi>parables;</hi> for so he seems to compare the Highest illuminations which we have here, with that constant Irradiation of the Divinity upon the Souls of men in the life to come: and this glassing of Divine things by Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks and Emblems in the Fansie which he speaks of, was the proper way of Prophetical inspiration.</p>
               <p>For the further clearing of which I shall take notice of one passage more out of a Jewish writer, that is, R. <hi>Bechai,</hi> concerning this present argument, which I find Com. in <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

               </argument>
               <p>WE have now taken a <hi>General</hi> survey of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Prophesie,</hi> which is alwaies attended (as we have shewed) with a <hi>Vision</hi> or a <hi>Dream,</hi> though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no <hi>Dream</hi> properly without a <hi>Vision.</hi> And here before we pass from hence, it will be necessarie to take notice of a man Distinction the Hebrew Doctors are wont to make of <hi>Dreams,</hi> lest we mistake all those <hi>Dreams</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we meet with in Scripture, &amp; take them all

for <hi>Prophetical,</hi> whereas many of them were not such. For though indeed they were all <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sent by God, yet many were sent as <hi>Monitions</hi> and <hi>Instructions,</hi> and had not the true force and vigor of <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dreams</hi> in them; and so they are wont commonly to distinguish between <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There are <hi>somnia vera<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>somnia Prophetica:</hi> and these <hi>Maimonides</hi> in <hi>More Nev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Par. 2. Cap. 41. hath thus generally characterized, <hi>Quando dicitur,</hi> Deus venit ad N, in somnio noctis, <hi>id</hi> Prophetia <hi>minimè nuncupari potest, neque vir talis,</hi> Propheta, <hi>&amp;c. When it is said in Holy writ,</hi> That God came to such a man in a Dream of the night, <hi>that cannot be called a</hi> Prophesie, <hi>nor such a man</hi> a Prophet; <hi>for the meaning is no more then this, That some Admonition or Instruction was given by God to such a man, and that it was in a Dream.</hi> Of this sort He and the rest of the Hebrew Writers hold those <hi>Dreams</hi> to be which were sent to <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Laban;</hi> upon which two last our Author observes the great Caution of <hi>Onkelos</hi> the Proselyte (who was instructed in the Jewish learning by R. <hi>Eleazar</hi> and R. <hi>Joshua,</hi> the most famous Doctors of that age) that in his Preface to those <hi>Dreams</hi> of <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Abimelech</hi> he saies, <hi>Et venit verbum à Domino:</hi> but doth not say (as when the Dreams were <hi>Prophetical) Et revelavit se Dominus.</hi> Besides, a main reason for which they deny those <hi>Dreams</hi> to be <hi>Prophetical</hi> is, for that they that were made partakers of them were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified men; whereas it is a tradition amongst them, that the Spirit of Prophesie was not communicated to any but good men.</p>
               <p>But indeed the main difference between these two sorts of <hi>Dreams</hi> seems to consist in this, That such as were not <hi>Prophetical</hi> were much <hi>weaker</hi> in their Energy


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66374:121"/>
upon the Imagination then the Other were, in so much that they wanted the strength and force of a Divine evidence, so as to give a plenary assurance to the Mind of him who was the subject of them, of their Divine original; as we see in those <hi>Dreams</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 3. v. 5; 15. and ch. 9. 2. where it is said of him, when he awaked he said, <hi>Behold it was a Dream;</hi> as if he had not been effectually confirmed from the Energy of the Dream it self that it was a true <hi>Prophetical</hi> influx.</p>
               <p>But there is yet another difference they are wont to make between them, which is, That these <hi>somnia vera</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ordinarily contained in them <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or void of reality: as in that Dream of <hi>Joseph</hi> concerning <hi>the Sun, the Moon, and the eleven Stars bowing down to him;</hi> whereas his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which should there have been signified by the <hi>Moon,</hi> was dead and buried before, and so uncapable of performing that respect to him which the other at last did.

                  </gap>, <hi>void of reality, &amp; insignificant.</hi> Accordingly Rab. <hi>Albo</hi> in <hi>Maam.</hi> 3. c. 9. hath framed this distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>There is no meer Dream without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it that is</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>but Prophesie is a thing wholy and most exactly true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The general difference between <hi>Prophetical</hi> Dreams and those that are meerly <hi>Nouthetical</hi> or <hi>Monitorie,</hi> and all else which we find recorded in Scripture, <hi>Philo Jud.</hi> in his Tract <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and elsewhere, hath at large laid down. The proper character of those that


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66374:122"/>
were <hi>Prophetical</hi> he clearly insinuates to be that <hi>Ecstatical</hi> rapture whereby in all Prophetical Dreams some more potent cause, acting upon the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Imagination</hi> of the Prophets, snatch'd them from themselves, and so left more potent and evident impressions upon them.</p>
               <p>I shall the more largely set down his Notion, because it tends to the clearing of this business in hand, and is, I think, much obscured, if not totally corrupted by his translator <hi>Gelenius.</hi> His design is indeed to shew that <hi>Moses</hi> taught these several waies whereby <hi>Dreams</hi> are conveyed from Heaven, that so his sublime and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite doctrine might be the better hid up therein; and therefore sailing between <hi>Cabbalisme</hi> and <hi>Platonisme</hi> he gropes after an Allegorical and Mystical meaning in them all. His first sort of <hi>Divine Dreams</hi> he thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The first kind was when God himself did begin the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Phansie, and secretly whispered such things as are unknown indeed to us, but perfectly known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> And of this sort he makes <hi>Joseph</hi>'s dreams, the sense whereof was unknown to <hi>Joseph</hi> himself at first, and then runs out into an Allegorical exposition of them in the Book intituled <hi>Joseph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second kind is this, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Thus we have seen these Three sorts of <hi>Dreams</hi> according to <hi>Philo,</hi> the First and Last where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Jewish Doctors conjoin together, and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prefer the <hi>Oneirocriticks</hi> of them to the Dreamers themselves: and therefore whereas they depress the notion of them considered in themselves below any Degree of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> yet the Interpretation of them they attribute to the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> except there be an Interpretation of the Dream in the Dream it self, so as that the Mind of the Dreamer be fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied both in the meaning and divinity thereof; for then it is truly <hi>Prophetical.</hi> And thus much for this Particular.</p>

                  <p>A large Account of the Difference between the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Spirit and Enthusiastical impostures. That the Pseudo-Prophetical Spirit is seated only in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative Powers and Faculties inferior to Reason. That <hi>Plato</hi> and other Wise men had a very low opinion of this Spirit, and of the Gift of Divination, and of Consulting the Oracles. That the True Prophetical Spirit seats it self as well in the Rational Powers as in the Sensitive, and that it never alienates the Mind, but informs and enlightens it. This further cleared by several Testimonies from Gentile and Christian Writers of old. An Account of those Fears and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternations which often seized upon the Prophets. How the Prophets perceived when the Prophetical influx sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon them. The different Evidence and Energy of the True and false Prophetical Spirit.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FRom what we have formerly discoursed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Stage</hi> of <hi>Phansie</hi> and <hi>Imagination</hi> upon which those <hi>Visa</hi> presented themselves to the Mind of the Prophet, in which he beheld the real objects of Divine truth in which he was inspired by this means; it may be easily apprehended how easie a matter it might be for the <hi>Devils Prophets</hi> many times, by an apish imitation, to counterfeit the <hi>True Prophets</hi> of God, and how sometimes <hi>Melancholy</hi> and turgent Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, fortified with a strong power of <hi>Divination,</hi> might unfold themselves in a semblance of true Enthusiasms. For indeed herein the <hi>Prophetical influx</hi> seems to agree


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66374:124"/>
with a <hi>mistaken Enthusiasm,</hi> that both of them make strong impressions upon the <hi>Imaginative</hi> powers, and require the Imaginative facultie to be vigorous and potent: and therefore <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us that the gift of <hi>Divination,</hi> which consisted in a mighty force of Imagination, was alwaies given to the Prophets, and that <hi>This</hi> and <hi>a Spirit of Fortitude</hi> were the main <hi>Bases</hi> of <hi>Prophesie; More Nev.</hi> part. 2. c. 38. <hi>Duas istas faculta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> Fortitudinis <hi>scilicet &amp;</hi> Divinationis, <hi>in Prophetis fortissimas &amp; vehementissmas esse necesse est,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>It is necessary that these two Faculties of</hi> Fortitude <hi>and</hi> Divination <hi>should be most strong and vehement in the Prophets: whereunto if at any time there was an accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the influence of the Intellect, they were then beyond measure corroborated; in so much that (as it is well known) it hath come to this, that one man by a naked Staffe did prevail over a potent King, and most manfully delivered a whole Nation from bondage, viz. after it was said to him Exod.</hi> 3. 12. I will be with thee. <hi>And though there be different Degrees of these in men, yet none can be altogether without that</hi> Fortitude <hi>and</hi> Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>So it was said to Jeremy</hi> Chap. 17. 18. Be not dismaied at their faces, &amp;c. Behold I have made thee this day a defenced City; <hi>and so to Ezek.</hi> Ch. 2. 6. Be not afraid of them nor their words: <hi>and generally in all the Prophets we shall find a great Fortitude and Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirit. But by the excellency of the gift of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they could on a sudden and in a moment foretell fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things; in which Facultie notwithstanding there was great diversitie.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>It will not be therefore any great Digression here, awhile <hi>to examine the Nature of this False light which pretends to Prophesie, but is not;</hi> as being seated only in the <hi>Imaginative</hi> power, from whence the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66374:125"/>
of this delusion ariseth, seeing that Power is also the Seat of all Prophetical vision. For this purpose it will not be amiss to premise that Threefold degree of <hi>Cognitive influence</hi> pointed out by <hi>Maimonides,</hi> part. 2. cap. 37. <hi>More Nev.</hi> The first is wholly Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, descending <hi>only</hi> into the <hi>Rational</hi> facultie, by which that is extreamly fortified and strengthened in the distinct apprehension of Metaphysicall Truths, from whence, as he tells us, ariseth the Sect of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> and <hi>Contemplative persons.</hi> The second is <hi>joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> into the <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Imaginative</hi> facultie together, and from thence springs the Sect of <hi>Prophets.</hi> The third into the <hi>Imaginative</hi> only, from whence proceeds the Sect of <hi>Polititians, Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Law-givers</hi> (whose Conceptions only run in a secular channel,) as also the Sect of <hi>Diviners, Inchanters, Dreamers</hi> and <hi>Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We shall coppy out of him a Character of some of this Third sort, the rather because it so graphically delineates to us many <hi>Enthusiastical Impostors</hi> of our Age. His words are these, <hi>Hic verò monendus es, ex tertio genere esse quasdam, quibus Phantasiae, Somnia &amp; Ecstases, quales in Prophetiae Visione esse solent, ita mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiles obveniunt, ut planè sibi persuadeant se Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas esse,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>But here I must advertise thee, that there are some of this Third sort who have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times such strange Phansies, Dreams and Ecstasies, that they take themselves for Prophets, and much marvel that they have such Phansies and Imaginations; concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at last that all Sciences and Faculties are without any pains or study infused into them. And hence it is that they fall into great confusions in many Theoretical matters of no small moment, and do so mix true notions with such as are meerly seeming, and imaginary, as if


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66374:125"/>
Heaven and Earth were jumbled together. All which proceeds from the too-great force of the Imaginative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and the imbecillity of the Rational, whence it is that nothing in it can pass forth into act.</hi> Thus he. This delusion then in his sense of those <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which pretend to <hi>Revelations,</hi> ariseth from hence, that all this forrain force that is upon them serves only to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate &amp; impregnate their Phansies and Imaginations, but does not inform their Reasons, nor elevate them to a true understanding of things in their coherence and contexture; and therefore they can so easily imbrace things absurd to all true and sober Reason: Whereas the <hi>Prophetical Spirit</hi> acting <hi>principally</hi> upon the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Understanding</hi> of the Prophets, guided them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistently and intelligibly into the understanding of things. But this <hi>Pseudo-prophetical</hi> Spirit being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to rise up above this low and dark Region of Sense or Matter, or to soar aloft into a clear Heaven of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, endeavoured alway as much as might be to strengthen it self in the <hi>Imaginative</hi> part: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wizzards and false prophets of old and later times have been wont alway to heighten their Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and Imaginations by all means possible; which <hi>R. Albo</hi> insinuates <hi>Maam. 3. cap.</hi> 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>There are some men whose Imaginative faculty is strong, either by Nature, or by some Artifice which they use to fortifie this Imaginative facultie with; and for such purpose are the artifices which Witches and such as have familiar Spirits do use, by the help whereof the similitudes of things are more easily excited in the Imagination.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Wierus</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 17. <hi>de Praestigiis Daemonum</hi> (who was a man (as some think) too well acquainted with these mysteries, though he himself seems to defie them)


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66374:126"/>
speaks to the same purpose concerning Witches, how that, so they may have more pregnant Phansies, they anoint themselves, and diet themselves with some such food as they understand from the Devil is very fit for that purpose. And for further proof hereof he there quotes <hi>Baptista Porta,</hi> Lib. 2. and <hi>Cardan de Subtil.</hi> Cap. 18. But we shall not over-curiously any further pry into these Arts.</p>
               <p>This kind of <hi>Divination</hi> resting meerly in the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative faculty</hi> seemed so exactly to imitate the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Energy</hi> in this part of it, that indeed it hath been by <hi>weaker</hi> minds mistaken for it, though the <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> sort of the <hi>Heathens</hi> have happily found out the <hi>lameness</hi> and <hi>delusiveness</hi> of it. We have it excellently set forth by <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> where speaking of God's liberality in constituting of Man, he thus speaks of this <hi>Divination,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. i. e. <hi>As for our worser part, that it might in some sort par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Truth, God hath seated in it the power of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and it is a sufficient signe that God has indulged this faculty of Divining to the foolishness of men; for there is no sober man that is touch'd with this Power of Divination, unless in Sleep, when his Reason is bound, or when by Sickness or Enthusiasm he suffers some aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind. But it is then for the Wise and Sober to understand what is spoken or represented in this Fatidical passion.</hi> And so it seems <hi>Plato,</hi> who was no careless ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of these matters, could no where find this <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning spirit</hi> in his time, except it were joined some way or other <hi>cum mentis alienatione;</hi> and therefore he looks upon it as that which is <hi>inferior to Wisdome,</hi> and to be regulated by it: for so he further declares his

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. that is, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a law that Prophets should be set as it were Judges over these Enthusiastick Divinations, which Prophets some ignorantly and falsly call Diviners.</hi> For indeed <hi>these Prophets</hi> in his sense to whom he gives the preeminence, are none else but <hi>Wise and prudent men,</hi> who by reason of the sagacitie of their Understandings were able to judge of those things which were uttered by this dull Spirit of <hi>Divination,</hi> which resided only in Faculties inferior to Reason. So in his <hi>Charmides,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. i. e. <hi>But, if you will, we will grant the Gift of Divination to be a knowledge of what is to come: but withall that it is fit that Wisdome and Sobrietie should be Judge and Interpreter.</hi> But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his age was acquainted with no other <hi>Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> then that which ariseth from a <hi>troubled</hi> Phansie, and is conceived in a dark <hi>Melancholy</hi> imagination, he confirms to us in his <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> where he rightly gives us the true <hi>Etymon</hi> of this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that it was called so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>from rage and furie,</hi> and therefore saies it was antiently called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. However he grants that it happened to many <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by Divine allotment; yet it was most vulgarly incident to Sick and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly men, who oftentimes by the power thereof were able to presage by what Medicines their own distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers might be best cured, as if it were nothing else but a discerning of that sympathizing &amp; symbolizing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of their own Bodies with some other Bodies without them. And elsewhere he tells us that these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> never, or verie rarely, understood the meaning and nature of their own <hi>Visa.</hi>

And therefore indeed the <hi>Platonists</hi> generally seem'd to reject or very much to slight all this kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and to acknowledge nothing transcendent to the naked Reason and Understanding of Man. So <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> in Dissert. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>It's a bold assertion, yet I shall not doubt to say, that God's Oracles and Men's Understandings are of a near al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.</hi> And so according to <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> lib. 2. §. 52. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, one that needs not soothsaying, being familiarly and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with God himself.</p>
               <p>Likewise the <hi>Stoicks</hi> will scarce allow their <hi>Wise</hi> man at any time to <hi>consult an Oracle,</hi> as we may learn from <hi>Arrian,</hi> l. 2. c. 7. and <hi>Epictetus,</hi> c. 39. and <hi>Simplicius</hi> his Comment thereupon: where that great Philosopher making a scrupulous search what those things were which it might be fit to consult the <hi>Oracle</hi> about, at last brings them into so narrow a compass, that a Wise man should never find occasion to honour the <hi>Oracle</hi> with his presence. A famous instance whereof we have in <hi>Lucan lib.</hi> 9. where <hi>Cato</hi> being advised to consult <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Hammon</hi> his Oracle after <hi>Pompey's</hi> death, answers,</p>

               </lg>
               <p>But enough of this Particular; and I hope by this time I have sufficiently unfolded the true <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> and shewed the right <hi>Stage</hi> thereof: as also how lame and delusive the Spirit of <hi>Divination</hi> was, which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to imitate it.</p>

                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:66374:127"/>
Now from what hath been said ariseth one main Characteristical distinction between the <hi>Prophetical</hi> and <hi>Pseudo-prophetical</hi> spirit, viz. That the <hi>Prophetical</hi> spirit doth never alienate the Mind, (seeing it seats it self as well in the <hi>Rational</hi> powers as in the <hi>Sensitive,)</hi> but alwaies maintains a consistency and clearness of Reason, strength and soliditie of Judgment, where it comes; it doth not <hi>ravish</hi> the Mind, but <hi>inform</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten</hi> it: But the <hi>Pseudo-prophetical</hi> spirit, if indeed without any kind of dissimulation it enters into any one, because it can rise no higher then the Middle region of Man, which is his <hi>Phansy,</hi> it there dwells as in storms and tempests, and being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in it self, is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with alienations and abreptions of mind. For whensoever the Phantasms come to be disordered and to be presented tumultuously to the Soul, as it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Furie,</hi> or in <hi>Melancholy,</hi> (both which Kinds of <hi>alienation</hi> are commonly observed by Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians) or else by the Energy of this Spirit of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Mind can pass no true Judgment upon them; but its light and influence becomes eclipsed. But of this <hi>alienation</hi> we have already discoursed out of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> and others. And thus the <hi>Pythian</hi> Prophetess is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Scholiast upon <hi>Aristophanes</hi> his <hi>Plutus,</hi> and by <hi>Lucan,</hi> lib. 5. as being filled with inward furie, while she was inspired by the Fatidical spirit, and utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Oracles in a strange disguise with many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick gestures, her hair torn, and foaming at her Mouth.

               </p>
               <p>But here we must not mistake the business, as if there were nothing but the most absolute <hi>Clearness</hi> and <hi>Serenitie</hi> of thoughts lodging in the Soul of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> amidst all his <hi>Visions:</hi> And therefore we shall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take notice of that Observation of the Jews, which is vulgarly known by all acquainted with their Writings, which is concerning those <hi>Panick fears, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternations</hi> and <hi>Affrightments</hi> and <hi>Tremblings,</hi> which frequently seized upon them together with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical influx. And indeed by how much <hi>stronger</hi> and <hi>more vehement</hi> those Impressions were which were


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66374:129"/>
made by those unwonted <hi>Visa</hi> which came in to act upon their <hi>Imaginative</hi> facultie, by so much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was this <hi>Perturbation</hi> and <hi>Trouble:</hi> and by how much the more the Prophets Imagination was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the laboriousness of these Phantasms, the more were his natural strength and Spirits exhausted, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it must needs be. Therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> being wearied with the <hi>toilsome work</hi> of his <hi>Phansie</hi> about those <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that were presented to him, Chap. 10. 8. &amp;c. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that <hi>there was no strength left in him;</hi> that <hi>his comeliness was turned into corruption, and he retained no strength;</hi> that <hi>when he heard the voice, he was in a deep sleep, and his face toward the ground;</hi> that <hi>his sorrows were turned upon him, and no breath was left in him.</hi> So Gen. 15. 12. when the <hi>Vision</hi> presented to <hi>Abraham</hi> passed into a <hi>Prophetical Dream,</hi> it is said, <hi>a deep sleep fell upon Abraham, and a horror of great darkness fell upon him.</hi> Upon which passage <hi>Maimonides,</hi> in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Part, &amp; 41. Ch. of his <hi>More Nevochim,</hi> thus discourseth; <hi>Quandoque autem Prophetia incipit in Visione Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, &amp; postea multiplicatur terror &amp; passio illa vehemens, quae sequitur perfectionem operationum facultatis Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natricis, &amp; tum demum venit Prophetia, sicuti contigit Abrahamo. In principio enim Prophetiae illius dicitur, (Gen.</hi> 15. 1.) Et fuit verbum Domini ad Abrahamum in Visione; <hi>et in fine ejusdem (vers.</hi> 12.) Et sopor ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit in Abrahamum, &amp;c. And in like manner he speaks of those <hi>Fatigations</hi> that <hi>Daniel</hi> complains of, <hi>Est au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem terror quidam Panicus qui occupat Prophetam inter vigilandum, ficut ex Daniele patet, quando ait,</hi> Et vidi Visionem magnam hanc, neque remansit in me ulla fortitudo, &amp; vis mea mutata est in corruptionem, nec retinui fortitudinem ullam. Et fui lethargo oppressus super faciem meam; &amp; facies mea ad terram. And


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:66374:129"/>
thus this whole business is excellently decyphered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by <hi>R. Albo</hi> in his Third book and tenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Behold, by reason of the strength of the Imaginative facultie and the precedencie of the Influence upon that to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Rational, the Influx doth not remain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prophet without Terrour and Consternation; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his members shake and his joints are loosned, and he seems like one that is readie to give up the ghost by reason of his great astonishment: After all which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation the Prophetical influx settles it self upon the Rational Facultie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this Notion perhaps we may borrow some light for the clearing of <hi>Jeremie 23. 9. Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets, all my bones shake: I am like a drunken man (and like a man whom Wine hath overcome) because of the Lord, and because of the words of his Holiness.</hi> The importance of which words is, That the Energy of Prophetical vision wrought thus potently upon his Animal part. Though I know <hi>R. Solomon</hi> seems to look at another mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: But <hi>Abarbanel</hi> is here full for our present purpose, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>When Jeremy saw those false prophets eating and drinking and faring deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouslie, he cried out and said,</hi> My heart is broken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me because of the Prophets; <hi>For while I behold their works, my heart is rent asunder with the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Sorrow, and because of the Prophetical influx residing upon me,</hi> my bones are all rotten, and I am like a drunken man <hi>that neither sees nor hears. And all this hath befell me</hi> because of the Lord, <hi>that is, because of the divine influx that seized upon me, and</hi> because of the words of his Holinesse, <hi>which have


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66374:130"/>
wrought such a conturbation within me, that all my senses are stupified thereby.</hi> And thus I suppose is also that passage in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 3. 14. to be expounded, where the Prophet describes the Energie and dominion which the Prophetical spirit had over him, when in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Vision he was carried by way of Imagination a tedious journey to those of the Captivitie that dwelt by the river <hi>Chebar. The Spirit of the Lord lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, and in the heat</hi> (or hot chafing and anger) <hi>of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.</hi> So <hi>Habak. 3. 2. O Lord, I have heard thy speech, and was affraid;</hi> that is, the Prophetical voice heard by him, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Imagination, was so strong that it struck a Panick fear (as <hi>Maimon.</hi> expresseth it) <hi>into him.</hi> And it may be the same thing is meant <hi>Esay</hi> 21. 3. where the Prophet describes that inward conturbation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation that his Vision of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s ruine was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied withall. <hi>Therefore are my loins fill'd with pain, pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it, I was dismaied at the seeing of it.</hi> Though I know there may be another meaning of that place not improper, viz. that the Prophet personates <hi>Babylon</hi> in the horrour of that anguish that should come upon them, whereby he sets it forth the more to the Life, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Targumist and others would have it; though yet I cannot think this the most congruous meaning.</p>
               <p>But I have now done with this Particular, and I hope by this time have gain'd a fair advantage of sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one Difficultie, which though it be not so much observ'd by our own as it is by the Jewish writers, yet it is worth our scanning, viz. How the Prophets per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66374:130"/>
when the Prophetical inspiration first seized upon them. For (as we have before shewed) there may be such <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions</hi> which are meerly <hi>delusive,</hi> and such as the false prophets were often partakers of; and besides the true Prophets might have often such Dreams as were meerly <hi>vera somnia,</hi> True dreams, but not Prophetical.</p>
               <p>For the full Solution of this knot we have before shewed how this <hi>Pseudo-prophetical</hi> Spirit only flutters below upon the more terrene parts of mans Soul, his <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Phansie.</hi> The Prince of darkness comes not within the Sphere of Light and Reason to order affairs there, but that is left to the sole Oeconomy and Soveraignty of the Father of Lights. There is a clear and bright heaven in mans Soul, in which <hi>Lucifer</hi> himself cannot subsist, but is tumbled down from thence as often as he assayes to climbe up into it.</p>
               <p>But to come more pressely to the business; The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Masters here tell us that in the beginning of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical inspiration the Prophets use to have some <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi> presenting itself to their <hi>Imagination.</hi> Sometimes it began with a <hi>Voice,</hi> and that either <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>vehement,</hi> or else <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>familiar.</hi> And so God is said first of all to appear to <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam.</hi> 3. 7. who is said <hi>not yet to have known the Lord,</hi> that is, as <hi>Maimon.</hi> in Part. 2. c. 44. of his <hi>More Nevochim</hi> expounds it, <hi>Ignoravit adhuc tunc tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris Deum hoc modo cum Prophet is loqui solere, &amp; quod hoc mysterium nondu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuit ei revelatum.</hi> In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>R. Albo, Maam.</hi> 3. cap. 11. For otherwise we must not think that <hi>Samuel</hi> was then ignorant of the true God, but that he knew not the manner of that Voice by which the Prophetical spirit was wont to awaken the attention of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:66374:131"/>
And that this was the antient opinion of the Jews <hi>R. Solomon</hi> tells us out of the <hi>Massecheth Tamid,</hi> where the Doctors thus gloss upon this place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>as yet he knew not the Lord,</hi> that is, <hi>he knew not the manner of the Prophetical voice.</hi> This is that <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>gentle voice</hi> whereby the Sense of the Prophet is sometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, but sometimes this <hi>Voice</hi> is <hi>more vehement.</hi> It will not be amiss to hear <hi>Maimonides</hi> his words, Part. 2. c. 44. of his <hi>More Nev. Nonnunquam fit ut Verbum illud quod Propheta audit in Visione Prophetiae, ei videatur fieri voce robustissimâ,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>It sometims happens that the Word which the Prophet hears in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Vision, seems to strike him with a more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment noise; and accordingly some dream that they hear Thunder and Earthquake or some great Clashing; and sometimes again with an ordinarie and familiar noise, as if it was close by him.</hi> We have a famous Instance of the last in that Voice whereby God appeared unto <hi>Adam</hi> after he had sinned, and of the former in <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Elijah.</hi> That instance of <hi>Adam</hi> is set down Gen. 3. 8, 9. <hi>And they heard the voice of the Lord walking in the Garden in the coole of the day, and Adam hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden: and the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?</hi> Where those words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which we render <hi>the coole of the day,</hi> the Jews expound of <hi>a gentle vocal air,</hi> such an one as breathed in the day-time more pacately. For this appearance of God to him they suppose to be in a <hi>Prophetical Vision;</hi> and so <hi>Nachmanides</hi> comments upon those words, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the gale of the day] <hi>is, that ordinarily in the manifestation of the</hi> Shechina <hi>or


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66374:131"/>
divine presence, there comes a great and mighty wind to usher it in, according to what we read of Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings 19. 11. And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the Mountains, and brake in pieces the Rocks before the Lord: <hi>and in</hi> Psalme 18. <hi>and elsewhere,</hi> He flew upon the wings of the wind: <hi>Accordingly it is written concerning</hi> Job, c. 38. v. 1. <hi>that</hi> the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind. <hi>Wherefore by way of distinction it is said in this place, that</hi> they heard the voice of the Lord, <hi>that is, that the Divine Majestie was revealed to them in the garden, as approaching to them,</hi> in the gale of the day. <hi>For the wind of the day blew according to the manner of the day-time in the garden; not as a great and strong wind in this Vision (as it was in other Prophetical approaches) lest they should fear and be dismaied.</hi> This <hi>mightie voice</hi> we also find recorded as rowzing up the attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> chap. 9. 1. <hi>He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying,</hi> &amp;c. So that all these <hi>Schemes</hi> are meerly <hi>Prophetical,</hi> and import nothing else but the strong awakening and quickning of the Prophets mind into a lively sense of the Divine majesty appearing to him.</p>
               <p>And of these the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is full, there being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no Prophetical writ, where the whole <hi>Dramatical series</hi> of things, as they were acted over in the Mind of the Prophet, are more graphicallie and to the Life set forth. So we have this <hi>Vox praecentrix</hi> to the whole Scene sometimes sounding like a Trumpet, Rev. 1. 10. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day, and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet.</hi> And chap. 4. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beginning of a new Vision we find this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, <hi>I looked, and behold a door was opened in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were the


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66374:132"/>
sound of a Trumpet, talking with me, which said, Come up hither,</hi> &amp;c. And when a new Act of opening <hi>the Seals</hi> begins, chap. 6. 1. he is excited by another voice sounding like Thunder. <hi>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the Seals, and I heard as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four Beasts saying, Come and see.</hi> And chap. 8. ver. 5. <hi>voices and thunders and lightnings and an earthquake</hi> are the <hi>Prooemium</hi> to the Vision of the Seven Angels with seven trumpets. Lastly, to name no more, sometimes it is brought in sounding like the roaring of a Lion. So when he was to receive <hi>the little Book of Prophesie</hi> chap. 10. 3. <hi>An Angel cryed with a loud voice, as when a Lion roareth; and when he had cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, seven thunders uttered their voices.</hi> Hence it is that we find the Prophets ordinarily prefacing to their Visions in this manner, <hi>The hand of the Lord was upon me;</hi> that is indeed some potent force rouzing them up to a lively sense of the Divine majesty, or some hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Embassador speaking with them. And that the sense hereof might be the more Energetical, sometimes in a Prophetical Vision they are commanded to eat those Prophetick rolls given them, which are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with the greatest contrarietie of tast that may be, <hi>sweet as hony in their mouths, and in their bellies as bitter as gall,</hi> Rev. 10. 9. Ezek. 2. 8.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen in part how those Impressions, by which the Prophets were made partakers of Divine inspiration, carried a strong evidence of their Original along with them, whereby they might be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them both from any <hi>hallucination,</hi> as also from their own <hi>True dreams,</hi> which might be <gap reason="foreign">

For so I think those words are spoken by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and to provoke a self-condemnation, verse 32. <hi>Behold I am against those that prophesie false dreams, saith the Lord, and doe tell them, and cause my people to erre by their lies and by their lightness, yet I sent them not, neither commanded them.</hi> And this might be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them from <hi>the feeble nature</hi> of those <hi>Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which they boasted of, as it is insinuated verse 28, 29. <hi>The prophet that hath a dream,</hi> &amp;c.

               <argument>
                  <p>An Enquiry concerning <hi>the Immediate Efficient that represented the Prophetical Visions to the Phansie of the Prophet.</hi> That these Representations were made in the Prophet's Phansie by some Angel. This cleared by several passages out of the Jewish Monuments, and by Testimonies of Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore I conclude this present Discourse concerning <hi>Prophesie</hi> properly so called, I think it may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to treat a little of Two things more that most commonly are to be considered in this <hi>Degree</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inspiration, which we call <hi>Prophesie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The First whereof is to enquire <hi>what that</hi> Intellectus <note place="margin">1.</note> agens <hi>was, or, if you will, that Immediate Efficient that represented the Prophetical Visions to the Phansie of the Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>What the meaning of those Actions is that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>are frequently attributed to the Prophets, whether they were Real, or only Imaginary and Scenical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall begin with the First, and enquire <hi>By whom these Representations were made in the Prophet's Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or who ordered the Prophetical scene, and brought up all those</hi> Idolums <hi>that therein appeared upon the Stage.</hi> For though there be no question but that it was God himself by whom the whole Frame of Prophesie was disposed and originally dispensed, seeing the scope thereof was to reveal his Mind and Will; yet the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Efficient</hi> seems not to be God himself, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:66374:134"/>
some may think, but indeed an <hi>Angel:</hi> And so the generalitie of all the Jewish Writers determin. <hi>Maimon.</hi> his sense is full for this purpose, both in his <hi>De Fundament is Legis</hi> and his <hi>More Nevochim.</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he hath too universally determined that every Apparition of Angels imports presentlie some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical dispensation: which hath made some of his Country-men by an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to fall too much off from him into a contrarie assertion. His words are these, <hi>More Nev.</hi> Part. 2. c. 41. <hi>Scito quòd omnium eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Prophetarum qui Prophetiam sibi factam esse dicunt, quidam eam Angelo alicui, quidam verò Deo Opt. Max<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ascribant &amp; attribuant, licèt per Angeli ministerium quoque ipsis obtigerit: de quo Sapientes nostri nos erudie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt quando aiunt,</hi> Et dixit Dominus ad eam <hi>(scilicet</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, h. e. <hi>per manus Angeli)</hi> Gen. 25. 23. For so it seems the Masters expounded this place (where God reveals to <hi>Rebekah</hi> her future conception and progenie) of a Propheticall apparition by some Angel; though yet all agree not in it. But it may be worth our while to hear out <hi>Maimon.</hi> who pleads the authoritie of all Jewish antiquitie for this opinion that we have now laid down. <hi>Insuper, de quocunque scriptum occurrit, quòd Angelus cum eo locutus, aut quod aliquid ipsi à Deo revelatum sit, id nullo alio modo quàm in Somnio aut Visione Prophetica factum esse noveris,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Moreover, of whomsoever you read that an Angel spoke with him, or that something was revealed to him by God, you are to understand that it was performed no other way then by a Dream or a Prophetical Vision. Our Wise men have a discourse about the Word that came to the Prophets, according to what the Prophets themselves have declared (that is,</hi> concerning the several waies <hi>(as</hi> Buxtorf <hi>expounds it)</hi> by which the Prophets say


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:66374:135"/>
the Word of God came to them.) Now <hi>this was (say they) four waies. The first is, when the Prophet declares he received the word from an Angel in a Dream or in a Vision. Secondly, when he only mentions the words of the Angel, without declaring that they came to him in a Dream or in a Vision; relying upon this known Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,</hi> viz. <hi>That there is no Prophesie revealed but by one of these two waies, whereof God makes mention, saying,</hi> I will make my self known in a Vision, and speak to him in a Dream. <hi>Thirdly, when he makes no mention of the Angel, but ascribes all to God, as if he alone had conveyed it; yet with this addition, that it came in a Vision or in a Dream. Fourthly, when the Prophet saies absolutelie, that God speak with him, or said unto him,</hi> Doe this, <hi>or,</hi> Speak this, <hi>making no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all either of Angel, or Vision, or Dream; and that because of this known Principle and Fundamental truth, That there is no Prophesie but either in a Dream or Vision, or by the ministrie of an Angel.</hi> Thus <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> who, as we see, pretends this to be a known thing and generallie agreed upon by all Jewish anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</p>
               <p>But before we goe on to any Confirmation of it, it will be requisite a little to see what <hi>Nachmanides,</hi> his great adversarie in this business, alledgeth against him, which I find in his Comment upon <hi>Genesis</hi> 18. which Chap. <hi>Maimonides</hi> makes to relate nothing else but a Prophetical apparition of three Angels to <hi>Abraham</hi> which promised a Son: they are said to eat and drink with him, and two of them to depart from him to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to be there entertained by <hi>Lot,</hi> whom they rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the violence of his neighbour-Citizens, and led him the next day out of the Citie, before they brought down fire and brimstone from heaven upon it.


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:66374:135"/>
All which passages seem to make it evident that this Apparition of Angels was Real and Historical, and not meerly Prophetical and Imaginarie. Wherefore <hi>Nach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manides</hi> having got this unhappy advantage of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie, pursues this mistake of his with another of his own as gross in an opposite way. His words are these, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>He that beholds an Angel, or hath any conference with one, is not a Prophet: For the business is not so as</hi> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides <hi>hath determined it, namely, That everie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet receives his Prophesie by the ministrie of an Angel, our Master</hi> Moses <hi>only excepted: for our Rabbins have told us concerning</hi> Daniel <hi>and his companions, that they were upon this account more excellent then he, because they were Prophets, and he none. And therefore his Book is not reckoned amongst the Prophets, because he had to doe with the Angel</hi> Gabriel, <hi>although he both beheld him, and had conference with him when he was awake.</hi> Thus we see <hi>Nachman.</hi> as clearly expungeth all those out of his Catalogue of the <hi>Prophets</hi> to whom any Apparition of Angels was made, as <hi>Maimon.</hi> had put them in: and pretends for this the Authoritie of the <hi>Talmudists;</hi> who for this cause exclude <hi>Daniel</hi> from the number of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and, as he would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, reckoned his Book among the <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> because of his converse with the Angel <hi>Gabriel:</hi> But all this is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and scarce <hi>bonâ fide;</hi> for it is manifest that all Antiquitie reckoned upon <hi>Zacharie</hi> as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> notwithstanding all his Visions are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally represented by <hi>Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we shall a little examine that sentence of the <hi>Talmudists</hi> which <hi>Nachman.</hi> founds his Opinion upon, which I find set down <hi>Massecheth Megillah,</hi> cap. 1. in the <hi>Gemara,</hi> where the Masters gloss on that <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 7.


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66374:136"/>
                  <hi>And I Daniel alone saw the Vision: for the men that were with me saw not the Vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</hi> Here they enquire who those Companions of <hi>Daniel</hi> were, and then pass their Verdict upon him and them. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>What are those men that were with</hi> Daniel? <hi>R. Jeremie said, They were</hi> Haggai, Zacharie <hi>and</hi> Malachie. <hi>They excelled</hi> Daniel, <hi>and he also excelled them. Herein they excelled him, because they were Prophets, and he none; and in this he excelled them, that he beheld a Vision, and they none.</hi> Thus those Masters; who indeed denie <hi>Daniel</hi> to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and accordingly his Book was by them reckoned among the <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> yet they here give no reason at all for it. But whereas <hi>Nachman,</hi> saies that the <hi>Visions of Angels</hi> which <hi>Daniel</hi> conversed with were <hi>Real,</hi> and not <hi>Imaginarie</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical,</hi> it is a manifest Elusion, and contrarie to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words of the Text, which relates these Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions to have been <hi>in his sleep,</hi> Chap. 10. verse 9. <hi>And when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep upon my face, and my face towards the ground.</hi> And Chap. 8. 18. <hi>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep.</hi> This <hi>sleep</hi> was upon the <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Exit</hi> of his Vision: For so (as we have shewed before) there was a frequent <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from a <hi>Vision</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun upon the Prophets while they were awake into a Prophetical <hi>Dream.</hi> So Chap. 7. verse 1. <hi>In the first year of Belshazzar King of Babylon, Daniel had a Dream, and Visions of his head upon his bed;</hi> and in this Dream and night-Vision, as in the other before mentioned, a Man or Angel comes in to expound the matter, verse 15, 16. <hi>I Daniel was grieved in my Spirit in the midst of my body, and the Visions of my head troubled me.


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66374:136"/>
I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this: so he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that the <hi>Talmudists</hi> do maintain <hi>True Prophesie</hi> to have been communicated by <hi>Angels,</hi> we shall further confirm from one place which is in <hi>Gemara Beracoth cap.</hi> 9. where the Doctors are brought in comparing Two places of Scripture, which seem contradictory. One of them is Numb. 12. 6. <hi>In a Dream will I speak unto him;</hi> the other is Zech. 10. 2. <hi>They have told false dreams:</hi> which they solve thus. <hi>R.

                  <hi>by an evil</hi> Genius. And this Opinion is generally followed by the rest of the Jewish writers, Commentators and others, who thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the difference between those two famous adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries <hi>Nachman.</hi> and <hi>Maimon.</hi> by granting a twofold appearance of Angels, the one <hi>Real,</hi> and the other <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie.</hi> And so they say this <hi>Real vision</hi> of Angels is a Degree inferior to the Prophetical vision of them. As we are told by <hi>R. Jehudah</hi> in the Book <hi>Cosri;</hi> where having disputed, <hi>Maam.</hi> 3. what hallowed minds they ought to have who maintain commerce with the Deitie, he thus goes on, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>If a man be very pious, and be in those places where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence uses to manifest it self, the Angels will accompanie him with their Real presence, and he shall see them face to face; yet in an inferiour way to that Vision of Angels which accompanies the Prophetical degree. Under the Second temple, according as men were more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with wisdom, they beheld Apparitions and heard


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:66374:137"/>
the</hi> Bath Col, <hi>which is a degree of Sanctitie, but yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the Prophetical.</hi> To conclude, <hi>R. Bechai</hi> makes it an Article of faith to believe the Existence of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for this reason, that Angels were the furnishers of the Prophetical scene, and therefore to denie them was to denie all Prophesie; so he in <hi>Parasha Terumah</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>because</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Divine influx comes by the ministrie of Angels, who order and dispose the word in the mouth of the Prophet according to the mind of God: And if <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> were not so, there would be no Prophesie; and if no Prophesie, no Law.</hi> So <hi>Jos. Albo,</hi> we may remember, defin'd <hi>Prophesie</hi> by the immediate orderers of it, the Angels.</p>
               <p>But it is best to consult the Scripture it self in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, which declares all that way by which it descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from God to the sons of men. The first place which <hi>Maimon.</hi> in <hi>More Nev.</hi> Part. 2. cap. 42. brings for confirmation of this opinion is that of <hi>Genesis</hi> 18. v. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. with the exposition of <hi>R. Chija,</hi> which he leaves as a great secret. But that which is more for his and our purpose, is Gen. 32. 24. where <hi>Jacob wrestled all night with the Angel;</hi> for so <hi>that man</hi> was, as <hi>Hosea</hi> tells us; and verse 1. <hi>The Angels of God met Jacob.</hi> Neither doth this Interpretation of that <hi>Lucta</hi> between the <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to have been only in a Prophetical Vision, at all prejudice the Historical truth of that Event of it, which was <hi>Jacobs</hi> halting upon his thigh: For that is no very unusual thing at other times to have some Real passions in our bodies represented to us in our dreams then when they first begin. Another place is Jos. 5. 13. <hi>Joshua lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold a man stood over against him.</hi> Again, Judges 5. 23. <hi>Deborah</hi> attributes the command she had to


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:66374:137"/>
curse <hi>Meroz,</hi> to an Angel. <hi>Curse ye Meroz, said the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord:</hi> which words <hi>Kimchi</hi> would have to be understood in a <hi>literal sense,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for Deborah was a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess, and so spake according to Prophetical inspiration;</hi> and so <hi>Rabbi Levi Ben Gersom</hi> also expounds it: <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelos</hi> and <hi>Rasi,</hi> with less reason I think, make this Angel to be none else but <hi>Baruch.</hi> Though I am not ignorant that sometimes the <hi>Prophets</hi> themselves are called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God,</hi> and thence <hi>Malachie</hi> the last of them had his Name; yet we have no such testimonie concerning <hi>Baruch,</hi> that ever he was any Prophet, but only a Judge or Commander of the militarie forces. In the first Book of <hi>Kings</hi> chap. 19. ver. 11, 12. we have a large description of this <hi>Imaginarie</hi> appearance of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in the several modes of it; <hi>Behold the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the Mountains, and brake in pieces the Rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake, and after the earthquake a fire,</hi> &amp;c. All which Appearances <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Targumist expounds by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Armies of Angels,</hi> which were attended with those ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> And <hi>the still voice</hi> in which the Lord was, he renders answerably to the rest by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the voice of Angels praising God in a gentle kind of Harmonie.</hi> For though it be there said that <hi>the Lord was in the soft voice,</hi> yet that Paraphrast seems to understand it only of <hi>his Embassador:</hi> which in some other places of Scripture is very manifest; as in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> chap. 1. ver. 3, 15, 16. where verse 3. we find <hi>the Angel</hi> delivered to <hi>Elijah</hi> the Message to <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of Israel, who sent to <hi>Baal-Zebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron</hi> to enquire about his disease; <hi>But the Angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, goe up to


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66374:138"/>
meet the messengers of the King of Samaria, and say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye goe to enquire of Baal-Zebub.</hi> And verse the 16, we have all this message attributed <hi>to God</hi> himself by the Prophet, as if he had received the dictate immediately from God himself? And in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and <hi>Zacharie,</hi> we find all things perpetually represented and interpreted by <hi>Angels.</hi> And <hi>Abarbanel</hi> upon <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi> 2. tells us that several Prophets had several An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that delivered the heavenly Embassie to them, for that every Prophet was not so well fitted to converse with any kind of Angel: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Every Prophet was not in a fit capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Prophetical influence from any Angel indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie; but according to the disposition of the Receiver the degree and quality of the Angel was accommodated.</hi> But I shall not further pursue this Argument. In the general, that the <hi>Prophetical scene was perpetuallie orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by some Angel,</hi> I think it is evident from what hath been already said, which I might further confirm from <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> all whose Prophesies about the Temple are expresly attributed to <hi>a man</hi> as the Actor of them, that is indeed <hi>an Angel;</hi> for so they used constantly to appear to the Prophets in an humane shape. And likewise <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 18. in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Vision of a Ladder that reached up to heaven we find the Angels ascending and descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to intimate that this <hi>Scala prophetica</hi> whereby Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence descended upon the Mind of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is alwaies filled with Angels. From this place compared with Gen. 31. 11. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Vision of <hi>Laban</hi>'s sheep presented to him by an Angel, <hi>Philo</hi> thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in his book <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>You see how the Scripture represents such Dreams as sent of God, not only those that proceed from the first Cause</hi> [God,] <hi>but such also as come by his Ministers, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> But S. <hi>Jerome</hi> hath given us a more full and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Testimonie in this matter, in his Comment on Gal. 3. 19. <hi>The Law was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator.</hi> His words are these; <hi>Quod autem ait, Lex ordinata per Angelos, hoc vult intelligi, quòd in omni Veteri Testamento, ubi Angelus primùm visus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur, &amp; postea quasi Deus loquens inducitur, Angelus quidem verè ex ministris pluribus quicumque sit visus, sed in illo Mediator</hi> [Christus] <hi>loquatur qui dicat, Ego sum Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac, &amp; Deus Jacob. Nec mirum si Deus loquatur in Angelis, cum etiam per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos qui in hominibus sunt loquatur Deus in Prophetis; dicente Zacharia, Et ait Angelus qui loquebatur in me, ac deinceps inferente, Haec dicit Dominus Omnipotens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We might further add to all this those <hi>Visions</hi> which we meet with in the New Testament, which, as a thing vulgarlie known, were attributed to Angels. So Acts 27. 23. <hi>There stood by me the Angel of God this night,</hi> that is, in a Prophetical dream. And Acts 12. when the Angel of God did reallie appear to <hi>Peter,</hi> and bring him out of prison, he could scarce be perswaded of a long time but that all this was a <hi>Vision,</hi> this indeed being the common manner of all Prophetical Vision. And Acts 23. when the Pharisees would describe S. <hi>Paul</hi> as a Prophet that had received some Vision or Revelation from heaven, they phrase it by <hi>the speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Angel</hi> or <hi>Spirit unto him,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>We find no evil in this man; but if an Angel or Spirit hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</hi>

What we are to think of several Actions and <hi>res gestae</hi> recorded of <hi>Hosea, Jeremie</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in their Prophesies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus we have done with our first Enquiry <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Contriver and Orderer of the Prophetical Stage:</hi> That which was acted upon it, no doubt, every one will grant to have been a <hi>Masking</hi> or <hi>Imaginarie</hi> business. But there are many times in the midst of <hi>Prophetical Narrations</hi> some things related to be done by the Prophets themselves upon the command of the Prophetick Voice, which have been generally concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have been acted <hi>really,</hi> the grossest of all not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as <hi>Hosea</hi> his taking a harlot for his Wife and begetting Children, &amp;c. Which conceit Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> hath in part happily undermined. But we shall not here doubt to conclude both of <hi>That</hi> and all other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prophets which they were enjoined upon <hi>the Stage of Prophesie,</hi> that they were only <hi>Scenical</hi> &amp; <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie;</hi> except indeed they were such as of their own Nature must have an <hi>Historical</hi> meaning, in which an <hi>Imaginarie</hi> performance would not serve the turn. For this purpose it may be worth our while to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what <hi>Maimonides</hi> hath well determined in this


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66374:139"/>
Case, <hi>More Nev.</hi> Part. 2. cap. 46. <hi>Scias ergo, quemad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum in somnio accidit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Know therefore, that as it is in a Dream, a man thinks that he hath been in this or that Countrie, that he has married a Wife there, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there for some certain time, that by this Wife he has had a Son of such a name, of such a disposition, and the like; Know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that even just so it is with the Prophetical Parables as to what the Prophets see or doe in a Prophetical Vision. For whatsoever those Parables in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us concerning any Action the Prophet doth, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the space of time between one Action and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or going from one place to another; all this is in a Prophetical Vision: neither are these Actions real to sense, although some particularities may be precisely recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up in the writings of the Prophets. For because it was well known that it was all done in a Prophetical Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it was not necessarie in the rehearsing of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularitie to reiterate that it was in a Prophetical Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as it was also needless to inculcate that it was in a Dream. But now the Vulgar sort of men think that all such Actions, Journies, Questions and Answers were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and sensibly performed, and not in a Prophetical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And therefore I have an intention to make plain this business, and shall bring such things as no man shall be able to doubt of; adding thereunto some Examples, by which you may be able to judge of the rest which I shall not for the present mention.</hi> Thus we see how <hi>Maimon.</hi> rejects it as <hi>a vulgar error</hi> to conceive that those <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which are commonlie attributed to the Prophets in the current of their Prophesie, their <hi>travailing from place to place,</hi> their <hi>propounding questions and receiving answers,</hi> &amp;c. were <hi>real</hi> things to sense; whereas they were only <hi>Imaginarie,</hi> represented meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Phansie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:66374:140"/>
But for a more distinct understanding of this business, we must remember what hath been often suggested, <hi>That the Prophetical scene</hi> or <hi>Stage upon which all apparitions were made to the Prophet, was his Imagination;</hi> and that there all those things which God would have revealed unto him were acted over <hi>Symbolicallie,</hi> as in a <hi>Masque,</hi> in which divers persons are brought in, amongst which the Prophet himself bears a part: And therefore he, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exigencie of this Dramatical <hi>apparatus,</hi> must, as the other Actors, perform his part, sometimes by speaking and reciting things done, propounding que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, sometimes by acting that part which in the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> he was appointed to act by some others; and so not only by Speaking, but by Gestures and Actions come in in his due place among the rest; as it is in our ordinarie Dreams, to use <hi>Maimonides</hi> his expression of it. And therefore it is no wonder to hear of those things done which indeed have no <hi>Historical</hi> or <hi>Real</hi> veritie; the scope of all being to represent something strongly to the Prophets Understanding, and sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inform it in the Substance of those things which he was to instruct that People in to whom he was sent. And so sometimes we have only the Intelligible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Prophesies delivered to us nakedly without the Imaginarie Ceremonies or Solemnities. And as this Notion of those Actions of the Prophet that are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weav'd with their Prophesies is most genuine and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the <hi>general nature of Prophesie,</hi> so we shall further clear and confirm it in some Particulars.</p>
               <p>We shall begin with that of <hi>Hosea</hi> his marrying of <hi>Gomer</hi> a common harlot, and taking to himself <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of whoredomes,</hi> which he is said to doe a first and second time, Chap. 1. and Chap. 3. Which kind of Action however it might be void of true <hi>Vice,</hi> yet it


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:66374:140"/>
would not have been void of all <hi>Offence,</hi> for a <hi>Prophet</hi> to have thus <hi>unequally yoaked himself</hi> (to use S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expression) with any such Infamous persons, though by way of lawful wedlock, if it had been done <hi>really.</hi> I know that this way of interpreting both This and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophetical actions displeaseth <hi>Abarbanel,</hi> who thinks the <hi>Literal</hi> sense &amp; <hi>Historical</hi> verity of all ought to be entertained, except it be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> expressed to have been done in <hi>a Vision;</hi> and the general current of our Christian writers till <hi>Calvin</hi>'s time have gone the same way. And to make the <hi>Literal</hi> interpretation here good, R. <hi>Solomon</hi> and our former Author both tell us, that the antient Rabbins have determined those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical narrations of <hi>Hosea</hi> to be understood <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>literally.</hi> The place they refer to is <hi>Gem. Pesac.</hi> cap. 8. where yet I find no such thing positively concluded by the <hi>Talmudists.</hi> Indeed they there, after their fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, expound the place by inserting a long dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Prophet about this matter, but so as that without R. <hi>Sol.</hi> or <hi>Abarbanel</hi>'s gloss we could no more think their scope was to establish the <hi>Literal sense,</hi> then I think that the Prophet himself intended to insinuate the same to us. We shall therefore chuse to follow <hi>Abenezra</hi> as a more genuine Commentator, who in this place and others of the like nature follows <hi>Maimonides</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, making all those Transactions to have been <hi>only Imaginarie.</hi> For though it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies positively lay'd down in these Narrations, that the <hi>Res gesta</hi> was in <hi>a Vision;</hi> yet the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of <hi>Prophesie</hi> so requiring that things should thus be acted in <hi>Imagination,</hi> we should rather expect some Positive declaration to assure us that they were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the <hi>History,</hi> if indeed it were so.</p>
               <p>And therefore in these recitals of <hi>Prophetical Visions,</hi>


                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:66374:141"/>
we find many times things less coherent then can agree to a true History; as in the narrative of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Gen. 15. (for so the Rabbins in <hi>Pirke R. Eliezer</hi> expound that whole Chapter to be nothing else) we find v. 1. that <hi>God appeared to Abraham in a Vision,</hi> and v. 5. God brings him into the field as if it were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the shutting up of evening, and shews him the Stars of Heaven: and yet for all this ver. 12. it was yet day-time, and the Sun not gone down: <hi>And when the Sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abraham;</hi> and verse 17. <hi>And it came to pass that when the Sun went down and it was dark, behold a smoaking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</hi> From whence it is manifest that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s going out into the field before to take a view of the Stars of Heaven, and his ordering of those several living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ver. 9, 10. for a Sacrifice, was all performed in a <hi>Prophetical Vision,</hi> and <hi>upon the Stage of his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> It being no strange thing to have incoherent junctures of time made in such a way.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Jeremie</hi> 13. we have there a very precise Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s getting a linen girdle, and putting it upon his loines; and after a while he must needs take a long journey to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> to hide it there in a hole of the rock; and then returning, after many days makes another weary journie to the same place to take it out again after it was all corrupted: all which could manifestly be nothing else but <hi>meerly Imaginarie;</hi> the scope thereof being to imprint this more deeply upon the Understanding of the Prophet, That the House of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> which was nearly knit and united to God, should be destroied and ruined.</p>
               <p>The same Prophet Chap. 18. is brought in going to the house of a Potter, to take notice how he wrought


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66374:141"/>
a piece of work upon the wheel; and when the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel he intended was all marred, that then he made of his clay another Vessel. And Chap. 19. he is brought in as taking the Ancients of the people and the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of the Priests along with him into the valley of the Son of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> with a Potter's earthen bottle under his arm, and there breaking it in pieces in the midst of them.</p>
               <p>In this last Chapter it's very observable how the Scheme of speech is altered, when the Prophet relates a <hi>Real</hi> History concerning himself, ver. 14. speaking of himself in the Third person, as if now he were to speak of some body else, and not of a Prophet or his Actions; for so we read ver. 14. <hi>Then came Jeremiah from Tophet,</hi> &amp;c. The like change of the person we find Chap. 28. ver. 10. where a formal storie is told of some things that passed between <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naniah</hi> the false prophet, who in the presence of all the people broke <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s yoke from off his neck: For it seems to have been a wonted thing for the Prophets by <hi>Bonds</hi> and <hi>Yokes</hi> to type out unto the people <hi>Victorie</hi> or <hi>Captivitie</hi> in war. Not unlike is that we read of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the false prophet, 1 Kings 22. who made himself <hi>horns of iron,</hi> when he prophesied to <hi>Ahab</hi> his prosperitie against the <hi>Syrians</hi> at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly to represent to him the success he should have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Enemies. But in all this business the <hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s language insinuates a <hi>Literal sense,</hi> by speaking altogether in the Third person, as if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation concerned some body else, and not himself, and so must be of some real thing, and that which to Sense and Observation had it's realitie, and not only a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in Apprehension or Imagination. So Chap. 32. we seem to have an insinuation of a <hi>real</hi> History in


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66374:142"/>
                  <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s purchase of a Field of <hi>Hanameel</hi> his Uncles Son, from the Mode of expression which is there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable.</p>
               <p>But other-times we meet with things graphically described with all the Circumstantial pomp of the business, when yet it could be nothing else but a <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> thing; as Chap. 35. where the Prophet goes and finds out the chief of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> particularly described, and brings them into such a particular cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as is there set forth by all it's bounds, and there sets pots and cups full of wine before them, and bids them drink wine. Just in the same mode with this we have another story told, Chap. 25. 15, and 17, &amp;c. of his taking a wine-cup from God, and his carrying it up and down to all nations far and near, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Kings and Princes thereof; to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and his Servants, Princes, People; to all the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and Kings of the Land of <hi>UZ;</hi> to the Kings of the Land of the <hi>Philistines, Edom, Moab, Ammon;</hi> the Kings of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> and of the Isles beyond the Sea, <hi>Dedan, Tema, Buz;</hi> the Kings of <hi>Zimri,</hi> of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> and all the Kings of the North: and all these he said he made to drink of this Cup. And in this fashion Chap. 27. he is sent up &amp; down with <hi>Yokes,</hi> to put upon the necks of several Kings: all which can have no other sense then that which is <hi>meerly Imaginarie,</hi> though we be not told that all this was acted only in a <hi>Vision,</hi> for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing would not permit any <hi>real</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof.</p>
               <p>The like we must say of <hi>Ezekiel's res gestae,</hi> his eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a roll given him of God, Chap. 3. And Chap. 4. it's especially remarkable how ceremoniously all things are related concerning his taking a Tile, and pourtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66374:142"/>
the City of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon it, his laying siege to it; all which I suppose will be evident to have been meerly <hi>Dramatical,</hi> if we carefully examine all things in it, notwithstanding that God tells him he should in all this be a <hi>Signe to the people.</hi> Which is not so to be understood, as if they were to observe in such real a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in a sensible way what their own Fates should be: for he is here commanded to lie continually before a Tile 390 days, which is full 13 Months, upon his left side, and after that 40 more upon his right, and to bake his bread that he should eat all this while with dung, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So Chap. 5. he is commanded to take a Barbers rasour, and to shave his head and beard, then to weigh his hair in a pair of Scales, and divide it into three parts; and after the days of his Siege should be fulfilled, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before, then to burn a third part of it in the midst of the City, and to smite about the other third with a knife, and to scatter the other third to the wind. All which as it is most unlikely in it self ever to have been really done, so was it against the Law of the Priests to shave the corners of their heads and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their beards, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> observes. But that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> himself was a <hi>Priest,</hi> is manifest from Chap. 1. ver. 3. Upon these passages of <hi>Ezekiel Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> hath thus soberly given his judgment, <hi>More Nev.</hi> Part. 2. c. 46. <hi>Absit ut Deus Prophetas suos stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis vel ebriis similes reddat, eósque stultorum aut furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osorum actiones facere jubeat: praeterquam quòd praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum illud ultimum Legi repugnasset,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Far be it from God to render his Prophets like to fools and drunken men, and to prescribe them the actions of fools and mad men: besides that this last injunction would have been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Law; for Ezekiel was a great Priest, and


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66374:143"/>
therefore oblig'd to the observation of those two Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative precepts,</hi> viz. <hi>of not shaving the corners of his head and corners of his beard: And therefore this was done only in a Prophetical Vision.</hi> The same sentence likewise he passeth upon that story of <hi>Esaiah,</hi> Chap. 20. 3. his walking naked and bare-foot, wherein <hi>Esai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was no otherwise a <hi>Signe</hi> to <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> or rather <hi>Arabia,</hi> where he dwelt not, and so could not more literally be a Type therein, then <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was here to the Jews.</p>
               <p>Again Chap. 12. we read of <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> removing his houshold-stuff in the night, as a Type of the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and of his digging with his hands through the wall of his house, and of the peoples coming to take notice of this strange action, with many other uncouth ceremonies of the whole business which carry no shew of probabilitie: and yet ver. 6. God declares upon this to him, <hi>I have set thee for a signe to the house of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi> and ver. 9. <hi>Son of man, hath not the house of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, the rebellions house, said unto thee, What doest thou?</hi> As if all this had been done <hi>really;</hi> which indeed seems to be nothing else but a <hi>Prophetical Scheme.</hi> Neither was the Prophet any <hi>real Signe,</hi> but only <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary,</hi> as having the Type of all those Fates symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically represented in his phansie which were to befall the Jews: which sense <hi>Kimchi,</hi> a genuine Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, follows, with the others mentioned. And it may be according to this same notion is that in Chap. 24. to be understood of the death of the Prophet's Wife, with the manner of those funeral solemnities and obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies which he performed for her.</p>
               <p>But we shall proceed no farther in this Argument, which I hope is by this time sufficiently cleared, That we are not in any Prophetical narratives of this kind


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66374:143"/>
to understand any thing else but the History of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions themselves which appeared to them, except we be led by some farther argument of the realitie of the thing in a way of sensible appearance to determine it to have been any sensible thing.</p>

                     </gap>les,</hi> who held there were two Suns, the one Archetypal, which was alwaies in the inconspicable Hemisphear of the World, but the beams thereof shining upon this World's Sun were reflected to us, and so further enlightned us.</p>
               <p>Now this kind of Inspiration as it alwaies acted pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls into strains of Devotion, or moved them strongly to dictate matters of true piety and goodness, did manifest it self to be of a Divine nature; and as


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66374:145"/>
it came in abruptly upon the Minds of those holy men without courting their private thoughts, but transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them from that Temper of Mind they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so that they perceived themselves captivated by the power of some Higher light then that which their own understanding commonly poured out upon them, they might know it to be more immediately from God.</p>
               <p>For indeed that seems to be the main thing wherein this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> differed from that constant Spirit and frame of Holiness and Goodness dwelling in hallowed minds, that it was too quick, potent and transporting a thing, and was a kind of vital Form to that Light of divine Reason which they were perpetually pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd of. And therefore sometimes it runs out into a <hi>Foresight</hi> or <hi>Prediction</hi> of things to come, though it may be those <hi>Previsions</hi> were less understood by the Prophet himself; as (if it were needfull) we might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in some of <hi>David</hi>'s prophesies, which seem to have been revealed to him not so much <hi>for himself</hi> (as the Apostle speaks) as <hi>for us.</hi> But it did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies spend it self in Strains of <hi>Devotion</hi> or Dictates of <hi>Vertue, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Prudence;</hi> and therefore (if I may take leave here to express my conjecture) I should think the antient Jews called this Degree <hi>Spiritus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> not because it flows from the Third Person in the Trinity (which I doubt they thought not of in this business) but because of the near affinitie and alliance it hath with that <hi>Spirit of Holiness</hi> and true Goodness that alwaies lodgeth in the breasts of Good men. And this seems to be insinuated in an old proverbial speech of the Jewish Masters, quoted by <hi>Maimonides</hi> in the fore-quoted place, <hi>Majestas Divina habitat super eum, &amp; loquitur per Spiritum Sanctum.</hi> Though some think it might be so called as being the lowest Degree of


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66374:145"/>
Divine Inspiration: for sometimes the ancientest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Jewish learning call <hi>all Prophesie</hi> by the name of <hi>Spiritus Sanctus.</hi> So in Pirke R. Eliezer c. 39. <hi>R. Phineas inquit, Requievit Spiritus Sanctus super Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephum ab ipsius juventute usque ad diem obitûs ejus, atque direxit eum in omnem sapientiam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Holy Spirit rested upon Joseph from his youth till the day of his death, and guided him into all wisdome,</hi> &amp;c. Though it may be all that might be but an <hi>Hagiographical</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: For indeed the Jews are wont, as we shew'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to distinguish <hi>Joseph</hi>'s dreams from Prophetical. But this <hi>Spiritus Sanctus</hi> in the same chap. (to put all out of doubt) is attributed to <hi>Esaiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which were known Prophets: and chap. 33. <hi>R. Phineas ait, Postquam omnes illi interfecti fuerant, viginti annis in Babel requievit Spiritus Sanctus super Ezekielem, &amp; eduxit eum ex convalle Dora, &amp; ostendit ei multa ossa,</hi> &amp;c. And among those <hi>five</hi> things that the Jews alwaies supposed the Second Temple to be inferior to the First in, one was the want of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Spiritus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Prophesie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we are here to consider this <hi>Spiritus Sanctus</hi> more strictly, and as we have formerly defin'd it out of Jewish antiquity. And here we shall first shew what Books of the Old Testament were ascribed to this Degree by the Jews. The Old Testament was by the Jews divided into <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Law, the Prophets, and the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And this division is insinuated in <hi>Luke 24. 44. And Jesus said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written concerning me in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms:</hi> where by the <hi>Psalms</hi> may seem to be meant the <hi>Hagiographa;</hi> for the Writers of


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66374:146"/>
these <hi>Hagiographa</hi> might be termed <hi>Psalmodists</hi> for some Reasons which we shall touch upon hereafter in this Discourse. But to return; the Old Testament being antiently divided into these parts, it may not be amiss to consider the Order of these parts as it is laid down by the Talmudical Doctors in <hi>Gemara Bava Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra,</hi> c. 1. towards the end, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Our Doctors have delivered unto us this Order of the Prophets, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah and the Twelve Prophets, the First of which is Hosea,</hi> for so they understand those words in <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Deus inprimis locutus est per Hoseam.</hi> The same <hi>Gemarists</hi> go on to lay down the Order of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> thus; <hi>Ruth, the Book of Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, the Chronicles:</hi> And these the Jews did ascribe to the <hi>Ruach hakkodesh.</hi> But why <hi>Daniel</hi> should be reckoned amongst the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and not amongst <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the Prophets,</hi> I can see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, seeing the strain of it wholy argues the nature of a Prophetical degree spending it self in <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> though those were joined with more obscurity (it being then the <hi>Crepusculum</hi> of the Prophetical day, which had long been upon the Horizon of the Jewish Church) then in the other Prophets. And therefore whatever the latter Jews here urge, for thus ranking up <hi>Daniel</hi>'s books with the other <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet seeing they give us no Traditional reason which their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors had for so doing, I should rather think it to have been first of all some fortuitous thing which gave an occasion to this after-mistake, as I think it is.</p>
               <p>But to pass on, besides those Books mentioned, there were some things else among the Jews usually attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this <hi>Spiritus Sanctus:</hi> And so <hi>Maimonides</hi> in the


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:66374:146"/>
fore-mentioned place tells us that <hi>Eldad</hi> &amp; <hi>Medad,</hi> and all the High Priests who asked counsel by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> spake <hi>per Spiritum Sanctum,</hi> so that it was a Character Enthusiastical whereby they gave judicial answers, by looking upon the Stones of the High Priests breast-plate, to those that came to enquire of God by them. And so R. <hi>Bechai</hi> in Parash <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> speaks of <hi>one of the Degrees of the Holy Spirit which was superior to</hi> Bath Kol (i. Filia Vocis) <hi>and inferior to Prophesie.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It will not be amiss by a short digression to shew what this <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> was: And we may take it out of our former Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor R. <hi>Bechai,</hi> who for the substance agrees with the generalitie and best of the Jewish writers herein. It was, as he there tells us, done in this manner. The High Priest stood before the Ark, and he that came to enquire of the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> stood behind him, enquiring with a submisse voice, as if he had been at his private prayers, <hi>Shall I doe so, or so?</hi> Then the High Priest looked upon the Letters which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon the Stones of the Breast-plate, and by the concurrence of an Enthusiastical Spirit of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own (if I may add thus much upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reasons to that which he there speaks) with some modes whereby those letters appeared, he shaped out his answer. But for those that were allowed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at this Oracle, they were none else but either the King or the whole Congregation, as we are told in <hi>Massec. Sotah,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>None may enquire of it but the congregation of the people, or the King;</hi> by which it seems it was a <hi>Political</hi> oracle.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Argument in hand, viz. What pieces of Divine writt are ascribed to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>


                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:66374:147"/>
or <hi>Spiritus Sanctus;</hi> we must further know that the Jews were wont to reckon all those <hi>Psalms</hi> or <hi>Songs</hi> which we any where meet with in the Old Testament among the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For though they were penned by the Prophets, yet because they were not the proper results of a <hi>Visum Propheticum,</hi> therefore they were not <hi>true Prophesie:</hi> For they have a common Tradition, that the Prophets did not alwaies prophesie <hi>eodem gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du,</hi> but sometime in a higher, sometime in a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as among others we are fully taught by <hi>Abarbinel</hi> in <hi>Es.</hi> 4. upon occasion of that Song of <hi>Esay,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The same Prophet prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies sometime in the form of the supreme Prophetical Degree, and sometime in a lower Degree,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>or by the Holy Spirit only.</hi> And thus having made his way, he tells us that common notion they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, <hi>that all Songs were dictated by this</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Sanctus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Every Song that is found in the Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, it was such a thing as was ordered or dictated by the Pen-men themselves together with the superintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Holy Spirit: forasmuch as they received them not in that higher way which is called Prophesie, as all Visions were received, for all Visions were perfect Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</hi> But the Author goes on further to declare his, and indeed the common opinion, concerning any such <hi>Song,</hi> that it was not the proper work of God himself, but the work of the Prophet's own Spirit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Yet we must suppose the Prophet's Spirit enabled by the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of divine help with it, as he puts in the caution, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Spirit of God and his divine assistance did still cleave unto the Prophet, and was present with him.</hi> For, as he tells us, the Prophets,


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66374:147"/>
being so much accustomed to divine Visions as they were, might be able sometime <hi>per vigiliam,</hi> without any Prophetical Vision, to speak excellently by the Holy Ghost, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>with very elegant language, and admirable similitudes.</hi> And this he there proves from hence, that these <hi>Songs</hi> are commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Prophet himself, and not to God, there being so much of the work of the Prophet's own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Wherefore the Scripture commonly attributes these Songs to the Prophets themselves, and not unto God; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly speaks of the Song at the Red sea,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> Then Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and the people of Israel sang this Song, <hi>that is, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and the children of Israel did compose and order it.</hi> So in the Song at <hi>Beer-Elim</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 21. 17.</note>, <hi>Then sang Israel this Song.</hi> So in <hi>Moses</hi> his Song in the later end of Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy, which was to to be preserved as a Memorial, the Conclusion runs, <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 32. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>Set your hearts upon all those words,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>which I testifie to you this day.</hi> So all those <hi>Psalms</hi> which are supposed to have been composed by <hi>David,</hi> are perpetually ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto him, and the rest of them that were composed by others are in like manner ascribed unto them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Prophetick strain is very different, alwaies inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling God to it, and so is brought in with such kind of Prologues <hi>[The word of the Lord]</hi> or <hi>[The hand of the Lord]</hi> or the like.</p>
               <p>But enough of that: yet seeing we are fallen now upon the Original Author of these <hi>Divine Songs</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> it will not be amiss to take a little notice of the frequency of this <hi>Degree of Prophesie,</hi> which is by <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> composed by an Enthusiastical Spirit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews. We find many of these Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:66374:148"/>
                  <hi>David,</hi> who were Authors of sundry Psalms bound up together with his; for we must not think all are his: as after the 72 Psalm we have eleven together which are ascribed to <hi>Asaph,</hi> the 88 to <hi>Heman,</hi> the 89 to <hi>Ethan,</hi> some to <hi>Jeduthun,</hi> and very many are <hi>incerti Authoris,</hi> as it seems, being anonymous. Thus <hi>Kimchi</hi> in his Preface to the Psalms, and the rest of the Hebrew Scholiasts, suppose divers Authors to have come in for their particular Songs in that Book.</p>
               <p>And these divine Enthusiasts were commonly wont to compose their <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> at the sounding of some one <hi>Musical instrument</hi> or other, as we find it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten suggested in the Psalms. So <hi>Plutarch,</hi> lib. <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Maimonid.</hi> himself rather preferrs the opinion of the wise Sages and Philosophers of the Heathen then of these vulgar Masters, which required also some Perfection in the nature of him that should be set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for Prophesie, augmented with study and industry; <hi>Whence it cannot be that a man should goe to bed no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and rise the next day a Prophet</hi> (as he there speaks) <hi>quemadmodum homo qui inopinatò aliquid invenit.</hi> And

a little after he adds, <hi>Fatuos &amp; hujus terrae filios quod at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet, non magis, nostro judicio, prophetare possunt, quàm Asinus aut Rana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Perfections</hi> then which <hi>Maimonides</hi> requires as <hi>Preparaterie</hi> Dispositions to render a man <hi>a Prophet,</hi> are of Three sorts, viz. 1. <hi>Acquisite</hi> or <hi>Rational; 2. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> or <hi>Animal;</hi> lastly, <hi>Moral.</hi> And according to the difference of these he distinguisheth the <hi>Degrees of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,</hi> c. 36. <hi>Has autem Tres perfectiones</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As to these Three Perfections which we have here compriz'd,</hi> viz. <hi>the Perfection of the Rational facultie acquired by study, the Perfection of the Imaginative facultie by birth, and the Perfection of Manners or vertuous Qualities by puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and freeing the Heart and affections from all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual pleasures, from all pride, and from all foolish and pestilent desire of glory; As to these, I say, It's evident that they are differently, and not in the same degree par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated by men: And according to such different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of participation the degrees of the Prophets are also to be distinguished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who indeed in all this did but aim at this <hi>Technical notion</hi> of his, That all Prophesie is the proper result of these Perfections, as a Form ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out of them all as out of its elements compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together. For it is plain that he thought there was a kind of <hi>Prognostick</hi> virtue in Souls themselves, which was in this manner to be excited; which was the opinion of some Philosophers, among which <hi>Plutarch</hi> laies down his sense in this manner, according to the minds of many others; <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <gap reason="foreign">

So Chap. 32. <hi>Meo judicio res hîc se habet sicut in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculis,</hi> &amp;c. (i.) <hi>In my judgment</hi> (saith he) <hi>the matter here is just so as it is in Miracles, and bears proportion with them. For natural Reason requires, that he who by his nature is apt to prophesie, and is diligently taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, and of fit age, that such a one should prophesie; but he that notwithstanding cannot doe so, is like to one that cannot move his hand, as Jeroboam, or one that cannot see, as those that could not see the Tents of the King of Syria (as it is in the Story of Elisha.)</hi> And again Chap. 36. he further beats upon this String, <hi>Si vir quidam ita comparatus fuerit, nullum dubium est, si fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultas ejus Imaginatrix (quae in summo gradu perfecta est, &amp; Influentiam ab Intellectu secundùm perfectionem su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am speculativam accipit) laboraverit &amp; in operatione fuerit, illum non nisi res divinas &amp; admirandas appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensurum, nihil praeter Deum &amp; ejus Angelos visurum, nullius denique rei scientiam habiturum &amp; curaturum, nisi earum quae verae sunt &amp; quae ad communem hominum spectant utilitatem.</hi> This Opinion of <hi>Maimonides</hi> I find not any where entertained, but only by the Author of the Book <hi>Cozri.</hi> That which seems to have led him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this conceit was his mistaken sense (it may be) of some Passages in the story of the Kings that speak of <hi>the Schools of the Prophets,</hi> and the like, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>But I know no Reason sufficient to infer any such


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66374:151"/>
thing as the <hi>Prophetical</hi> Spirit from the highest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> endowments. And I cannot but wonder how <hi>Maimonides</hi> could reconcile all this with the right Notion of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> which must of necessity include a <hi>Divine inspiration,</hi> and therefore may freely be bestowed by God where and upon whom he pleaseth. Though indeed common Reason will teach us, that it is not likely that God would extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily inspire any men, and send them thus specially authorized by himself to declare his mind authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, and dictate what his Truth was, who were themselves vitious and of unhallowed lives; and so indeed the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> 2 Epist. Chap. I. tells us plainly, They were <hi>holy men of God who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Neither is it probable that those who were any way of <hi>crazed Minds,</hi> or who were inwardly of <hi>inconsistent tempers</hi> by reason of any <hi>perturbation,</hi> could be very fit for these <hi>Serene impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi> A troubled Phansie could no more receive these Ideas of Divine Truth to be imprest upon it, and clearly reflect them to the Understanding, then a crack'd glass or troubled water can reflect sincerely any image to be made upon them. And therefore the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors universally agree in this Rule, <hi>That the Spirit of Prophesie never rests upon any but a Holy and Wise man, one whose passions are allay'd.</hi> So the <hi>Talmud Masses, Sanhedrin,</hi> as it is quoted by R. <hi>Albo, Maam. 3. c.</hi> 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (i.) <hi>The Spirit of prophesie never resides but upon a Man of Wisdome and Fortitude,</hi> as also upon <hi>a rich and great man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two last qualifications in this rule <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his <hi>Fundamenta legis</hi> hath left out, and indeed it is full enough without them. But those other two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications


<pb n="245" facs="tcp:66374:151"/>
of <hi>Wisdome and Fortitude</hi> are constantly lay'd down by them in this argument. And so we find it ascribed to the Author of this Canon, who is said to be R. <hi>Jochanan, c. 4. Gem. Nedar.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, (i.) <hi>R. Jochanan saies, God doth not make his Shechina to reside upon any but a rich and humble man, a man of fortitude, all which we learn from the example of Moses our Master.</hi> Where by <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> they mean nothing else but <hi>that Power whereby a good man subdues his Animal part;</hi> for so I suppose I may safely translate that solution of theirs which I have sometime met with, and I think in <hi>Pirke Avoth,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>Who is the man of fortitude? It is he that subdues his figmentum malum,</hi> by which they meant nothing else but the <hi>Sensual</hi> or <hi>Animal</hi> part: of which more in another Discourse. And thus they give us another Rule as it were paraphrastical upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which I find <hi>Gem.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Divine presence or</hi> Spiritus Sanctus <hi>doth not reside where there is grief and dull sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, laughter and lightness of behaviour, impertinent talk or idle discourse; but with due and innocuous chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness it loves to reside, according to that which is written concerning Elisha,</hi> Bring me now a Minstrel: and it came to pass when the Minstrel played, the hand of the Lord was upon him, 2 Kings 3. Where we see that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind principally required by them is a <hi>free Chearfulness,</hi> in opposition to all <hi>Griefs, Anger,</hi> or any

                  </gap>, <hi>The Spirit of Prophesie dwells not with Sadness, but with Chearfulness.</hi> I will not here dispute the Punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these Traditions concerning <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> though I doubt not but the main Scope of them is true, viz. that the Spirit of Prophesie used not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side with any black or Melancholy passions, but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a serene and pacate temper of Mind, it being it self of a mild and gentle nature; as it was well observed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

the Holy Ghost in another notion by <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in his <hi>de Spectaculis, Deus praecepit Spiritum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, utpote pro naturae suae bono tenerum &amp; delicatum, tranquillitate &amp; lenitate, &amp; quiete &amp; pace tractare; non furore, non bile, non irâ, non dolore inquietare.</hi>

               <p>Now according to this notion I think we have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned some light for the further understanding of some Passages in Psalm 51. which the Chaldee Paraphrast and Hebrew Commentators also understand of the <hi>Spirit of Prophesie</hi> which was taken from <hi>David</hi> in that time of his <hi>sorrow and grief of Mind,</hi> upon the reflection of his shameful miscarriage in the matter of <hi>Uriah;</hi> and this is called ver. 12. <gap reason="foreign">

Joma. c.</hi> 2. where they thus descant upon those words, ver. 11. <hi>Take not thy Holy Spirit from me,</hi> and tell us


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:66374:153"/>
how <hi>David</hi> was punish'd by Leprosie and double Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; one from this Spirit, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But its now time to look a little into that place which the Masters constantly refer to in this notion, viz. 1 Kings 3. where when the Kings of Israel and Judah and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their distress for water, upon their warlike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition against the King of Moab, came to <hi>Elisha</hi> to enquire of God by him, the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> (ver. 14.) seems to have been <hi>moved with indignation</hi> against the King of Israel, and so makes a very unwelcome address to him, <hi>Surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehosaphat the King of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee:</hi> and then it follows ver. 15. <hi>But now bring me a Minstrell: and it came to pass when the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strell play'd, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.</hi> Which words are thus expounded by <hi>R. D. Kimchi,</hi> out of the Rabbines, (with which <hi>R. S. Jarchi</hi> &amp; <hi>R. L. Ben Gersom</hi> agree for the substance of his meaning) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Our Doctors tell us, that from that day wherein his Master Elijah was took up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Spirit of Prophesie remained not with him for a certain time; for, for this cause he was very sorrowful,


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66374:153"/>
and the divine Spirit doth not reside with heaviness.</hi> Others say that by reason of the indignation he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against the King of Israel, he was <hi>disquieted in his mind; and touching this they say, That whensoever a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is disturbed through anger or passion, the Holy Spirit forsakes him. From whence learn we this? From the example of Elisha, who said,</hi> Give me a Minstrel.</p>
               <p>Thus we may by this time see the Reason why <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal instruments</hi> were so frequently used by the Prophets, especially the <hi>Hagiographi;</hi> which indeed seems to be nothing else but that their Minds might be thereby put into <hi>a more composed, liberal</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> temper, and so the <hi>better disposed</hi> and <hi>fitted</hi> for the transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophetical Spirit. So we have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. how <hi>Asaph, Heman</hi> and <hi>Jeduthun</hi> composed their rapt and Divine Poems at the sound of the Quire-Musick of the Temple. Another famous place we find for this purpose 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. which place (as well as the former) hath been (I think) much mistaken and misinterpreted by some of <hi>Singing;</hi> whereas certainly it cannot be meant of any thing less then <hi>Divine Poetrie,</hi> and a Composure of Hymns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by a Divine Energy inwardly moving the Mind. In that place <hi>Samuel</hi> having anointed <hi>Saul</hi> King of Israel, to assure him that it was so ordained of God, he tells him of some Events that should occur to him a little after his departure from him; whereof this is one, that meeting with some Prophets, he himself should find the Impulses of a Prophetical Spirit also moving in him, ver. 5. These Prophets are thus descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>After that, thou shalt come to the hill of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the City, that thou shalt meet a company of Prophets coming down from the high place, with a Psaltery, and a Tabret,


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66374:154"/>
and a Pipe, and an Harp before them; and they shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie. And the Spirit of the Lord shall come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesie with them, and shalt be turned into another man.</hi> Where this <hi>Musick</hi> which they were accompanied with, was to <hi>vigorate</hi> and <hi>compose</hi> their Minds, as <hi>Kimchi</hi> comments upon the place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>And before them was a Psalterie (or Lute) and a Tabret, and a Pipe, and an Harp: for asmuch as the holy Spirit dwells no where but with alacritie and chearfulness: And they prophesied, that is, as Jonath the Targumist expounds it, they praised God: As if he had said, Their Prophesies were Songs and Praises to God, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>Now as this <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> thus acted <hi>free and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Souls,</hi> so the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> actuated <hi>sad, Melancholy Minds,</hi> as we heard before, and as we may see in the Example of <hi>Saul.</hi> And indeed that <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> which is said to have possessed him, seems to be nothing else originally but <hi>Anguish and grief of Mind,</hi> however wrought upon by some tempting insinuations of an Evil Spirit. And this sometime instigated him to <hi>prophesie</hi> after the fashion of such Melancholy furie, 1 <hi>Sam. 18. 10. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the Evil Spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house;</hi> which <hi>Jonathan</hi> renders by <gap reason="foreign">

An Account of several Schools of Prophetical Education, as at <hi>Nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth</hi> in <hi>Rama,</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem, Bethel, Jericho, Gilgal, &amp;c.</hi> Several passages in the Historical Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture pertinent to this Argument explained.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND therefore we find also frequently such Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in Scripture as strongly insinuate to us that anciently many were trained so up in a way of School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discipline, that they might become <hi>Candidati Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> and were as Probationers to these Degrees which none but God himself conferr'd upon them. Yet while they heard others <hi>prophesie,</hi> there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time an <hi>afflatus</hi> upon them also, their Souls as it were sympathizing (like <hi>Unisons</hi> in Musick) with the Souls of those which were touched by the Spirit. And this seems to be the meaning of that story 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. where all <hi>Saul</hi>'s messengers sent to <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Rama</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>David</hi> (and at last he himself) are said to fall a <hi>prophesying.</hi> For it is probable that the <hi>Prophesies</hi> there spoken of were <hi>Anthems divinely dictated,</hi> or <hi>Doxologies</hi> with such elegant strains of Devotion and Phansie as might also excite and stir up the Spirits of the Auditors: As often we find that any admirable Discourses, in which there is a chearful and free flowing forth of a rich Phansie in an intelligible, and yet extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, way, are apt to beget a symbolizing qualitie of Mind in a stander-by.</p>
               <p>And this notion we now drive is clearly suggested


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:66374:155"/>
by the Jewish writers, who tell us that this <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Rama</hi> was indeed <hi>a School of Prophetical education,</hi> and so the <hi>Targum</hi> expounds the word <hi>Naioth,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>Our Masters say That there was a School for the Prophets near the City of Ramah, to which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets congregated:</hi> And to the like purpose <hi>R.

For so we find it verse 20. <hi>And when they saw the company of the Prophets prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the Messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</hi> Where the Chaldee Paraphrast trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>He stood as a Teacher</hi> or <hi>Master over them,</hi> as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast reads it. But <hi>R. Levi B. G.</hi> strains a little higher, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too high, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And thus we must understand the meaning of that Question ver. 12. <hi>Who is their Father?</hi> which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to that Proverbial speech afterwards used com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly amongst the Jews <hi>[Is Saul also amongst the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?]</hi> used of one that was suddenly raised up to some dignitie or perfection which by his education he was not fitted for.

That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie was a kind of <hi>Hereditary</hi> thing. For so he speaks, <hi>Don't wonder for that he is called the Father of them,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, <hi>For Prophesie is an hereditary thing.</hi> But I think we may content our selves with what our former Authors have told us, to which we may adde the testimony of <hi>R.

                  </gap>, <hi>because that Samuel instructed them, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them up by his discipline to a degree of Prophetical perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of these <hi>Disciples</hi> we find very frequent mention in Scripture; So 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. we read of the <hi>Sons</hi> or <hi>Disciples of the Prophets in Gilgal.</hi> And chap. 6. <hi>Elisha</hi> is there brought in as their Master, at whose command they were, and therefore they ask leave to enlarge their dwellings. And <hi>Elisha</hi> himself was trained up by <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> as his <hi>Disciple;</hi> and therefore in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. it was thought a reason good enough to prove that he was <hi>a Prophet,</hi> for that he had been <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Disciple, and <hi>powred water upon his hands,</hi> as all the Jewish Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liasts observe. And 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 1. <hi>Elisha</hi> sends one of these his <hi>ministring Disciples</hi> to anoint <hi>Jehu</hi> to be King of Israel. And 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 35.

And therefore Divine inspiration found him out of the ordinary road of Prophets, among his Heards of cattel, and in an extraordinary way moved him to goe to <hi>Bethel,</hi> there to declare God's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against King and people, even in the King's Chappel. To conclude, In the New Testament, when <hi>John</hi> Baptist and our Saviour called <hi>Disciples</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon them and to learn divine Oracles from them, it seems to have been no new thing, but that which was the common custome of the old Prophets.</p>
               <p>Now of these Prophets there were several <hi>Schools</hi> or <hi>Colledges,</hi> as the Jews observe, in several Cities, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as occasion was to employ them.

                  <hi>a School.</hi> So 2 Kings ch. 2, &amp; 4. we meet with divers places set down as those where the residence of those young Prophets was, as <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Jericho</hi> and <hi>Gilgal,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Kimchi</hi> observes upon the place <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>As the Sons of the Prophets were in Bethel and Jericho, so were there also of them in several other places. And the main reason why they were thus dispersed in many of the Cities of Israel was this, that they might reprove the Israelites that were there: and their Prophesie was wholly according

to the exigencie of those times; and therefore it was that their Prophesie was not committed to writing.</hi> From hence some of the Jewish writers tell us of a certain <gap reason="foreign">

is there so described as coming out of a Cloud, as if it had been loud like the noise of Thunder, <hi>Behold a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold a Voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased:</hi> which Voice it is said the three Disciples that were then with him in the Mount heard, as we are told in the following verse, and also 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Highest Degree of Divine Inspiration, viz. the <hi>Mosaical.</hi> Four Differences between the Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations made to <hi>Moses,</hi> and to the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. How the Doctrine of men Prophetically inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is to approve it self by Miracles, or by it's Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness. The Sympathy and Agreeableness between an Holy Mind and Divine Truth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE now come briefly to enquire into the <hi>Highest</hi> degree of Divine Inspiration, which was the <hi>Mosaical,</hi> that by which the Law was given; and this we may best doe by searching out the Characteristical differences of <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Inspiration</hi> from that which was Technically called <hi>Prophesie.</hi> And these we shall take out of <hi>Maimon.</hi> his <hi>De Fund. Legis,</hi> c. 7. where they are fully described according to the general strain of all the Rabbinical Doctrine delivered upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The first is, That <hi>Moses</hi> was made partaker of these <note place="margin">1.</note> Divine Revelations <hi>per vigiliam,</hi> whereas God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested himself to all the other Prophets in a <hi>Dream</hi> or <hi>Vision</hi> when their Senses were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>What is the difference between the Prophesie of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and the Prophesie of all other Prophets? All other Prophets did prophesie in a Dream or Vision: but Moses our Master when he was waking and standing, according to what is written</hi> (Num. 7. 89.) And when Moses


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:66374:160"/>
was gone into the Tabernacle of the Congregation to speak with him, <hi>(i. e. God)</hi> then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him. By which place in <hi>Numb.</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears he had free recourse to this Heavenly Oracle at any time. And therefore the Talmudists have a Rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>That Moses had never any Prophesie in the night-time,</hi> (i.) in a <hi>Dream</hi> or <hi>Vision of the night,</hi> as the other Prophets had.</p>
               <p>The second difference is, That <hi>Moses</hi> prophesied <note place="margin">2.</note> without the mediation of any Angelical power, by an influence derived immediately from God; whereas in all other Prophesies (as we have shewed heretofore) some Angel still appeared to the Prophet, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>All Prophets did prophesie by the help or ministery of an Angel, and therefore they did see that which they saw in parables or under some dark representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but Moses prophesied without the ministery of an Angel.</hi> This he proves from Numbers 12. 8. where God saies of <hi>Moses, I will speak with him mouth to mouth;</hi> and so Exod. 33. 11. <hi>The Lord spake unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses face to face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we must not here so much adhere to that Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which <hi>Maimonides</hi> and the rest of his Country-men give us of this place, as to forget what we are told in the New Testament concerning the Ministerie of Angels which God used in giving the Law it self: And so S. <hi>Stephen</hi> discourseth of it, Acts 7. 53. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galatians ch. 3. tells us, <hi>the Law was given by the disposition of Angels in the hands of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> that is, <hi>Moses,</hi> the Mediator then between God and the people. And therefore I should rather think the meaning of those words <hi>[Face to face]</hi> to import the <hi>clearness</hi> and evidence of the Intellectual <hi>light</hi> wherein


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:66374:160"/>
God appeared to <hi>Moses,</hi> which was greater then any of the Prophets were made partakers of. And therefore the old tradition goes of them, that they saw <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in Speculo non lucido,</hi> whereas Moses saw <hi>in Speculo lucido,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Philo</hi> tells us (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Maimonides)</hi> in his Book, <hi>Quis Rerum divin. haeres sit,</hi> that is, without any impressions or Images of things in his Imagination in an Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical way, as was wont to be in all <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions;</hi> but by characterizing all immediately upon his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: though otherwise much of the Law was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed almost little more for the main scope and aim of it but an Emblem or Allegory.</p>
               <p>But there may be yet a farther meaning of those words <hi>[Face to face,]</hi> and that is the <hi>friendly and amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way</hi> whereby all divine Revelations were made to <hi>Moses;</hi> for so it is added in the Text, <hi>As a man speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto his friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the third difference which <hi>Maimonides</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, <note place="margin">3.</note> viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>All the other Prophets were afraid and troubled and fainted; but Moses was not so: for the Scripture saith,</hi> God spake to him as a man speaks to his friend; <hi>that is to say, As a man is not afraid to hear the words of his friend, so was Moses able to understand the words of Prophesie without any disturbance and astonishment of Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth and last difference is the Libertie of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s <note place="margin">4.</note> Spirit to prophesie at all times, as we heard before out of <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. 89. He might have recourse at any time to the sacred Oracle (in the Tabernacle) which spake from between the Cherubins: and so <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> lays down this difference, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>None of the Prophets did prophesie at what time they would, save Moses, who was clothed with


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:66374:161"/>
the Holy Spirit when he would, and the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie did abide upon him: neither had he need to predis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Mind or prepare himself for it, for he was alwaies disposed and in readiness as a ministring Angel; and therefore could he prophesie at what time he would, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is spoken in</hi> Numb. 9. 8. Tarry you here a little, and I will hear what the Lord will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning you. Thus <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who, I think, here somewhat hyperbolizeth, and scarce speaks consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stently with the rest of the Hebrew Masters. For we may remember what we heard before concerning the Talmudical Tradition, that <hi>Moses</hi>'s mind was indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for Prophesie when he was transported with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation against the Spies; though I think it is most probable that he had a greater libertie of prophesying then any other of the Prophets had.</p>
               <p>Now this clear distinct kind of Inspiration made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon an Intellectual facultie in a familiar way, which we see was the <hi>gradus Mosaicus,</hi> was most fit and proper for <hi>Laws</hi> to be administred in: which was excellently took notice of by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in that Discourse of his, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, where he tells us the Poetrie that was usually interlaced with Riddles and Parables was taken away in his time, and a more familiar way of Prophesie brought in; though he by a Gentile superstition applies that to his <hi>Pythia;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>God hath now taken away from his Oracles Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrie, and the varietie of dialect, and circumlocution, and obscuritie; and hath so ordered them to speak to those that consult them, as the Laws doe to the Cities under their subjection, and Kings to their people, and Masters to their Scholars, in the most intelligible and porswasive


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:66374:161"/>
language.</hi> But by <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s leave this character agrees neither to his <hi>Pythia,</hi> nor indeed to <hi>Moses</hi> himself (who put a veil upon his face in giving the Law it self to the people) but to our Saviour alone, the Dispenser of the true Law of God inwardly to the Souls of Men; and therein conversing with them, not so much <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not so much <hi>Face to Face</hi> as <hi>Mind to Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have now seen what is this <hi>gradus Propheticus Mosaicus,</hi> which indeed was necessarie should be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent and extraordinary, because it was the Basis of all future Prophesie among the Jews: For all the Prophets mainly aim at that to establish and confirm the Law of Moses, as to the practical observation of it; and therefore it was also so strongly manifested to the Israelites by Signs and Miracles done in the sight of all the people, and his familiaritie and acquaintance with Heaven testified to them all, the divine voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard by them all at Mount Sinai; which dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amounted at least to as much as a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the very lowest of the people. All which Considerations put <hi>R. Phineas</hi> into such an admiration of this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Statio montis Sinai,</hi> (as the Doctors are wont to call it) that he determines in <hi>Pirke Eliezer, That all this Generation that heard the voice of the Holy Blessed God, was worthie to be accounted as the ministring Angels.</hi> But what <hi>That Voice</hi> was which they heard, the later Jews are scarce well agreed: but <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> according to the most received opinion, in <hi>More Nev.</hi> p. 2. c. 33. tells that they only heard those first words of the Law <hi>distinctly,</hi> viz. <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> and, <hi>Thou shalt have none other gods,</hi> &amp;c. and but <hi>only the sound</hi> of all the rest of the words in which the remainder of the Law was given: and this, as he saies,


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:66374:162"/>
was <hi>the great Mysterie of that Station,</hi> so much spoken of by the Ancients.</p>
               <p>And here by the way we may take notice, That that divine Inspiration which is conveighed to any one man, primarily benefits none but himself; and therefore many times, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us, it rested in this private use, not profiting any else but those to whom it came. And the reason of this is manifest, for that an Inspiration abstractly considered can only satisfie the mind of him to whom it is made, of its own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and Authenticalness (as we have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:) And therefore that one man may know that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hath that Doctrine revealed to him by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical spirit which he delivers, he must also either be <hi>inspired,</hi> and so be <hi>in gradu Prophetico</hi> in a true sense, or be confirmed in the belief of it by some <hi>Miracle,</hi> whereby it may appear that God hath committed his Truth to such an one, by giving him some signal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in altering the course of Nature; which indeed was the way by which the Prophets of old ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their Doctrine, when they delivered any thing new to the people; which course our Saviour himself and his Disciples also took to confirm the Truth of the Gospel: Or else there must be so much <hi>Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in the thing it self, as that by Moral arguments it may be sufficient to beget a belief in the Minds of sober and good men.</p>
               <p>And I wish this last way of becoming acquainted with Divine Truth were better known amongst us: For when we have once attained to a true sanctified frame of Mind, we have then attained to the End of all Prophesie, and see all divine Truth that tends to the salvation of our Souls in the Divine light, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies shines in the Puritie &amp; Holiness of the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,


<pb n="267" facs="tcp:66374:162"/>
and so need no further Miracle to confirm us in it. And indeed that God-like glory and majesty which appears in the naked simplicitie of true Goodness, will by its own Connateness and Sympathy with all saving Truth friendly entertain and embrace it.</p>

               <p>THus we have now done with <hi>all those sorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie</hi> which we find any mention of: And as a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronis</hi> to this Discourse we shall farther enquire a little <hi>what Period of time it was in which this Prophetical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ceased both in the Jewish and Christian Church.</hi> In which business because the Scripture it self is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner silent, we must appeal to such Histories as are like to be most Authentical in this business.</p>
               <p>And first <hi>for the Period of time when it ceased in the Jewish,</hi> I find our Christian writers differing. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> would needs perswade us that it was not till the <hi>Aera Christiana.</hi> This he inculcates often in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:66374:163"/>
never ceased in your Nation either Prophet or Prince, till Jesus Christ was both born and had suffered.</hi> And so he often there tells us that <hi>John the Baptist</hi> was the last Prophet of the Jewish Church; which conceit he seems to have made so much of, as thinking to bring in our Saviour <hi>lumine Prophetico,</hi> with the greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Divine authoritie, as the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> into the world. But <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> hath much trulier, with the consent of all Jewish Antiquity, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, that all Prophesie determin'd in <hi>Malachy,</hi> in his <hi>Strom. lib.</hi> 1. where he numbers up all the Prophets of the Jews, Thirty five in all, and <hi>Malachy</hi> as the last.

                  </gap>, <hi>The Rabbins say that there were 48 Prophets and 7 Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses that did prophesie to the Iraelites:</hi> Which after they had reckoned almost up, they tell us that <hi>Malachy</hi> was the last of them, and that he was contemporary with <hi>Mordecai, Daniel, Haggai, Zacharie,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (whose Prophesies are not extant) whom for their number sake they there reckon up, who all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied in the second year of <hi>Darius.</hi> But commonly they make only these Three, <hi>Haggai, Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> to be <hi>the last of the Prophets,</hi> and so call them <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of the first Temple, and the <hi>Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores,</hi> because they prophesied in the time of the second Temple: and when these <hi>later</hi> Prophets died, then all Prophesie expired, and there was left, as they say, only a <hi>Bath Kol</hi> to succeed some time in the room of it. So we are told <hi>Gem. Sanhedrim</hi> c. 1. §. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Our Rabbins say, that from that time the later Prophets died, the Holy Spirit was taken away from Israel; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless they enjoyed the</hi> Filia vocis: and this is repeated <hi>Massec. Joma c.</hi> 1. Now all that time which the Spirit of Prophesie lasted among the Jews under the second Temple, their Chronologie makes to be but Forty years.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (i.) <hi>The continuance of Prophesie under the time of the second Temple was almost forty years.</hi> And this <hi>R. Jehuda</hi> his Scholiast confirms out of an Historico-Cabbalistical Treatise of <hi>R. Abraham Ben Dior.</hi> and a little after he tells us, that after forty years their <hi>Sapientes</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Senators,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>after forty years were pass'd, all the Wise-men were called The Men of the great Synagogue.</hi> And therefore the Author of that Book useth this <hi>Aera</hi> of the Cessation of Prophesie; and so this is commonly noted as a famous <hi>Epocha</hi> among all their Chronologers, as the Book <hi>Juchasin,</hi> the <hi>Seder Olam Zuta,</hi> as <hi>R. David Gantz</hi> hath summ'd them all up in his chronological History put forth lately by <hi>Vorstius.</hi> The like may be observed from 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 9. 27. and chap. 4. 46. and chap. 14. 41.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Cessation of Prophesie</hi> determined as it were all that old Dispensation wherein God hath manifested


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:66374:164"/>
himself to the Jews under the Law, that so that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old and thus wearing away, they might expect that new Dispensation of the Messiah which had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised so long before, and which should again restore this Prophetical Spirit more abundantly. And so this <hi>Interstitium</hi> of Prophesie is insinuated by Joel 2. in those words concerning <hi>the later times; In those days shall your Sons and Daughters Prophesie,</hi> &amp;c. And so S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Acts 2. makes use of the place to take off that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration which the Jews were possess'd withall to see so plentiful an effusion of the <hi>Prophetical Spirit</hi> again: And therefore this <hi>Spirit of Prophesie</hi> is called the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of Jesus</hi> in the Apocalypse, ch. 19.</p>
               <p>According to this notion we must understand that passage in <hi>John 7. 39. The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</hi> To which that in <hi>Ephes. 4. He ascended up on high, and gave gifts unto men,</hi> plainly answers: As likewise the Answer which the Christians at <hi>Ephesus</hi> made to <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 19. when he asked them whether they had received the Holy ghost, <hi>That they knew not whether there was a Holy ghost</hi> (that is) whether there were any <hi>Extraordinary Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Prophesie</hi> restored again to the Church or not, as hath been well observed of late by some learned men.

               <p>We come now briefly to dispatch the second Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, viz. <hi>What time the Spirit of Prophesie, which was again restored by our Saviour, ceased in the Christian Church.</hi> It may be thought that S. <hi>John</hi> was the <hi>last</hi> of Christian <hi>Prophets,</hi> for that the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is the latest dated of any Book which is received into the Canon of the New Testament. But I know no place of Scripture that intimates any such thing, as if the <hi>Spirit of Prophesie</hi> was so soon to expire. And indeed if

we may believe the Primitive Fathers, it did not; though it overliv'd S. <hi>John</hi>'s time but a little. <note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Eccles. lib. 3. §. 37.</note>

                  <p>Some Rules and Observations concerning Prophetical Writ in general.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE should now shut up all this Discourse about <hi>Prophesie;</hi> only before we conclude, it may not be amiss to add a few Rules for the better understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Prophetical</hi> Writ in general.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The First, (which yet we shall rather put under debate,) is concerning <hi>the Style</hi> and Manner of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guaging


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:66374:165"/>
all pieces of Prophesie; whether that was not peculiarly the work of the Prophet himself; whether it does not seem that the Prophetical Spirit dictated the Matter only or principally, yet did leave the words to the Prophet himself. It may be considered that God made not use of Idiots or Fools to reveal his Will by, but such whose Intellectuals were entire and perfect; and that he imprinted such a clear copy of his Truth upon them, as that it became their own Sense, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested fully into their Understandings; so as they were able to deliver and represent it to others as truly as any can paint forth his own Thoughts. If the Matter and Substance of things be once lively in the Mind, <hi>verba non invita sequentur:</hi> And according as that <hi>Matter</hi> operates upon the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Phantasie,</hi> so will the <hi>Phrase</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> be in which it is express'd. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think to doubt whether the Prophets might not mistake in representing the Mind of God in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Inspirations, except all their <hi>Words</hi> had been also dictated to them, is to question whether they could speak Sense as wise men, and tell their own Thoughts and Experiences truly or not. And indeed it seems most agreeable to the nature of all these Prophetical <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Dreams</hi> we have discoursed of, wherein the nature of the Enthusiasme consisted in a Symbolical and Hieroglyphical shaping forth of Intelligible things in their Imaginations, and enlightning the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Prophets to discern the scope and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of these <hi>Visa</hi> or <hi>Phantasmata;</hi> that those <hi>Words</hi> and Phrases in which they were audibly express'd to the Hearers afterwards or penned down, should be the Prophets own: For the Matter was not (as seems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what hath been said) represented alwaies by <hi>Words,</hi> but by <hi>Things.</hi> Though I know that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:66374:166"/>
in these Visions they had a <hi>Voice</hi> speaking to them; yet it is not likely that Voice should so dilate and comment so largely upon things, as it was fit the Prophet should doe when he repeated the same things to vulgar ears.</p>
               <p>It may also further be considered That our Saviour and his Apostles generally quote Passages out of the Old Testament as they were translated by the Lxx, and that where the Lxx have not rendered them <hi>verbatim,</hi> but have much varied the manner of phrasing things from the Original; as hath been abundantly observed by Philologers: Which it is not likely they would have done, had the Original words been the very Dictate of the Spirit; for certainly that would seem not to need any such Paraphrastical variations, as being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves full and clear enough; besides herein they might seem to weaken the Authenticalness of the Divine Oracles. And indeed hath not the swerving from this Notion made some of late conceit (though erroneous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the Translation of the Lxx to be more Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical then the Hebrew, which they would needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us had been corrupted by the Jews, our Saviour declining the Phraseologie thereof?</p>
               <p>Besides, we find the Prophets speaking every one of them in his own Dialect; and such a Varietie of Style and Phraseologie appears in their Writings, as may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue them to have spoken according to their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Genius:</hi> which is observed by the Jews themselves (who are most zealously, as is well known, devoted to the very Letter of the Text) in all the Prophets ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Moses,</hi> and that part of <hi>Moses</hi> only which contains the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> And hence we have that Rule <hi>Gem. Sanhedr.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The same form doth not ascend


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:66374:166"/>
upon two Prophets, neither doe both of them prophesie in the same form.</hi> Which Rule <hi>Cocceius</hi> confesseth he knows not the meaning of: But <hi>Abarbanel,</hi> who better understood the Mind of his own Compatriots, in his Comment upon <hi>Jeremy</hi> ch. 49. gives us a full account of it, upon occasion of some Phrases in that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie concerning <hi>Edom,</hi> parallel to what we find in <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah.</hi> From this congruencie of the Style in both he thus takes occasion to lay down our present Notion as the Sense of that former Theorem, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Prophets did not prophesie in the same manner as Moses did: For he prophesied from God immediately, from whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not only the Prophesie, but also the very Words and Phrases; and accordingly as he heard them, so he wrote them in the Book of the Law, in the very same words which he heard from God: but as for the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, they beheld in their Visions the things themselves which God made known to them, and both declared and expressed them in their own Phraseologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we see he ascribes the <hi>Phrase</hi> and <hi>Style</hi> every where to the Prophet himself, except only in the <hi>Law,</hi> which he supposeth to have been dictated <hi>totidem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis:</hi> which is probable enough, if he means <hi>the Law</hi> strictly so taken, <hi>viz.</hi> for the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> as it is most likely he doth. And again a little after, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>The things themselves they saw in Prophesie, but they themselves did explain and interpret them in that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect which was most familiar to them.</hi> And this, as he there tells, was the reason why the same kind of Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seologie occurred not among the Prophets, according to the sense of the Talmudists Maxime we mentioned. The like the Jewish Scholiasts observe upon those


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:66374:167"/>
false Prophets who did all <hi>uno ore</hi> bid <hi>Ahab</hi> ascend up to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi> and prosper, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus idemque loquendi modus nunquam reperitur in duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Prophetis:</hi> And therefore they made it an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that these were false Prophets, because they did <hi>idem Canticum canere,</hi> for they all said, <hi>Goe up and prosper.</hi> And thus the Heathenish Philosopher <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thought likewise concerning his Oracle, telling us, <hi>That all Enthusiasme is a mixture of two Motions, the one is impress'd upon the Soul which is Gods Organ, the other ariseth from it;</hi> and therefore he saies, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>All Prophetical Enthusiasme, like as also that which is Amatorious, doth make use of the subject facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and moves every Recipient according to it's dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and nature.</hi> And thence he thus excuseth the rough and unpolish'd language in which the Oracles were sometime deliver'd, most fitly to our purpose descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Prophetical Inspiration, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>For neither the voice, nor sound, nor phrase, nor metre is from God, but from Pythia her self; God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suppeditates the phantasms, and kindles a light in the Soul to signifie future things: For all Enthusiasme is after this manner.</hi> Hence was that old saying of <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That the King whose Oracle is at</hi> Delphi, <hi>neither plainly expresses, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals, but only obscurely intimates by signs.</hi> But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this first Particular, I shall add by way of caution,


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:66374:167"/>
We must not think that we can vary Scripture-expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so securely with retaining the true meaning, except we likewise had as real an understanding of the Sense it self as the Prophets had, over whom God also did so far superintend in their copying forth his Truth, as not to suffer them to swerve from his meaning. And so we have done with that Particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place, for the better understanding all Prophetical writ, we must observe That there is sometimes a seeming inconsistence in things spoken of, if we shall come to examine them by the strict Logical rules of Method: we must not therefore in the matter of any <hi>Prophetical</hi> Vision look for a constant Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal contexture of things carried on in a perpetual cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The Prophetical Spirit doth not tie it self to these Rules of Art, or thus knit up its Dictates Syste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically, fitly framing one piece or member into a combination with the rest, as it were with the joints and sinews of Method: For this indeed would rather argue an humane and artificial contrivance then any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, which as it must beget a Transportation in the Mind, so it must spend it self in such Abrupt kind of Revelations as may argue indeed the Prophet to have been inspired. And therefore <hi>Tully</hi> lib. 2. <hi>de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinat.</hi> judiciously excepts against the Authenticalness of those Verses of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> which he met with in his time, (and which were the same perhaps with those we now have) because of those <hi>Acrosticks</hi> and some other things which argued an elaborate artifice, and an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected diligence of the Writer, and so indeed <hi>non fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentis erant, sed adhibentis diligentiam,</hi> as he speaks. <hi>Lumen Propheticum est lumen abruptum,</hi> as was well noted anciently by the Jews. And therefore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Jewish Tradition have laid down this Maxime,


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66374:168"/>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Non est prius &amp; posterius in Lege,</hi> We must not seek for any Methodical conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenation of things in <hi>the Law,</hi> or indeed in any other part of <hi>Prophetical</hi> writ; it being a most usual thing with them many times <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to knit the Beginning and End of Time together. <hi>Nescit tarda molimina Spiritûs Sancti gratia,</hi> is true also of the Grace or Gift of Prophesie. We find no curious Transitions, nor true dependence many times of one thing upon another; but things of very different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that were cast into periods of time secluded one from another by vast intervals, all couched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the same Vision; as <hi>Jerome</hi> hath observed in many places, and therefore tells us, <hi>Non curae fuit Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritui prophetali historiae ordinem sequi.</hi> And thus he takes notice in <hi>Daniel</hi> 11. 2. that whereas there were Thirteen Kings between <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> the Prophet speaks of but Four, skipping over the rest, as if the other Nine had fill'd up no part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval. The like he observes upon <hi>Jeremy</hi> 21. 1. and otherwhere; as likewise sudden and abrupt Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of persons, Mutations of persons, <hi>(Exits</hi> and <hi>Intrats</hi> upon this Prophetical stage being made as it were in an invisible manner) and Transitions from the voice of one person to another. The Prophetical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit though it make no noise and tumult in its motions, yet it is most quick, spanning as it were from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre to the Circumference; it moves most swiftly, though most gently. And thus <hi>Philo</hi>'s observation is true, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There must be some kind of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p n="3">3. The last Rule we shall observe is, That no piece of Prophesie is to be understood of the state of the World to come or the <hi>Mundus animarum:</hi> For indeed it is altogether impossible to describe that, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it in this life. And therefore all divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in Scripture must concern some state in this world. And so we must understand all those places that treat of <hi>a new Heaven and a new Earth,</hi> and such like. And so we must understand the <hi>new Jerusalem</hi> mentioned in the New Testament, in that Prophetical book of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> ch. 21. And thus the Jews were wont universally to understand them, according to that Maxime we now speak of ascribed to <hi>R. Jochanan</hi> in <hi>Massec. Berac.</hi> c. 5. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>All the Prophets prophesied to the daies of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah; but as for the world to come, Eye hath not seen it.</hi> So they constantly expound that passage in <hi>Esay 64. 4. Since the beginning of the world Men have not heard, nor perceived by the Eare, neither hath the Eye seen, O God, besides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.</hi> And according to this Aphorisme our Saviour seems to speak, when he saies, <hi>All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and the Law prophesied until John,</hi> Mat. 11. 13. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>THE Reader may remember That our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in the beginning of his Treatise <hi>of the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> propounded these Three great Principles of Religion to be discoursed of; 1. <hi>The Immortalitie of the Soul, 2. The Existence and Nature of God, 3. The Communication of God to Mankind through Christ.</hi> And having spoken largely to the Two former Principles of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Theology, he thought it fit (as a Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Third, which imports the Revelation of the Gospel) to speak something concerning <hi>Prophesie,</hi> the way whereby Revealed Truth is dispensed to us. Of this he intended <hi>to treat but a little</hi> (they are his words in the beginning of the Treatise of <hi>Prophesie)</hi> and then pass on to the Third and Last part, viz. <hi>Those Principles of Revealed Truth which tend most of all to advance and cherish true and real Piety.</hi> But in his discoursing of <hi>Prophesie</hi> so many considerable Enquiries of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:66374:169"/>
themselves to his thoughts, that by that time he had finished this Discourse (designed at first only as a Preface) his Office of being Dean and Catechist in the Colledge did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Thus far had the Author proceeded in that year of his Office: and it was not long after that Bodily distempers and weaknesses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan more violently to seize upon him, which the Summer following put a Period to his life here; (a life so every way beneficial to those who had the happiness to converse with him.) <hi>Sic multis ille bonis flebilis occidit.</hi> Thus he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to speak of God's <hi>Communication of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Mankind through Christ,</hi> was taken up by God into a more inward and immediate partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Himself in Blessedness. Had he liv'd and had health to have finish'd the remaining part of his designed Method, the Reader may easily conceive what a Valuable piece that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course would have been. Yet that he may not altogether want the Authors labours upon such an Argument, I thought good in the next place to adjoine a Discourse of the like importance and nature, (delivered heretofore by the Author in some Chappel-Exercises) from which I shall not detain the Reader by any more of Preface.</p>

                     <p>The Introduction, shewing What it is to have a right Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Divine Truth, and What it is that is either Availeable or Prejudicial to the true Christian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Life.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Doctrine of Christian Religion propounded to us by our Saviour and his Apostles, is set forth with so much simplicity, and yet with so much repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to that degenerate <hi>Genius</hi> and Spirit that rules in the hearts and lives of Men, that we may truly say of it, it is both the <hi>Easiest</hi> and the <hi>Hardest</hi> thing: it is a Revelation wrapt up in a Complication of mysteries, like that Book of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which both unfolds and hides those great <hi>Arcana</hi> that it treats of; or as


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66374:172"/>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> sometimes chose so to explain the secrets of his Metaphysical or Theological Philosophy, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that he that read might not be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, except he were a Son of Wisdome, and had been train'd up in the knowledge of it. The Principles of True Religion are all in themselves plain and easie, deliver'd in the most familiar way, so that he that runs may read them; they are all so clear and perspicuous, that they need no Key of <hi>Analytical</hi> demonstration to unlock them: the Scripture being written <hi>doctis pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; indoctis,</hi> and yet it is <hi>Wisdome in a mystery which the Princes of this world understand not;</hi> a <hi>sealed</hi> Book which the greatest Sophies may be most unacquainted with: it is like that <hi>Pillar of Fire</hi> and <hi>of a Cloud</hi> that parted between the Israelites and the Egyptians, giving a clear and comfortable light to all those that are under the manuduction and guidance thereof, but being full of darkness and obscurity to those that rebell against it. Divine Truth is not to be discerned so much in a mans <hi>Brain,</hi> as in his <hi>Heart.</hi> Divine wisdome is <hi>a Tree of life</hi> to them that find her, and it is only <hi>Life</hi> that can <hi>feelingly</hi> converse with <hi>Life.</hi> All the thin Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and subtilest Discourses of Philosophy cannot so well unfold or define any Sensible Object, nor tell any one so well what it is, as his own naked Sense will doe. There is a Divine and Spiritual sense which only is able to converse internally with the life and soul of Divine Truth, as mixing and uniting it self with it; while vulgar Minds behold only the body and out-side of it. Though in it self it be most intelligible, and such that mans Mind may most easily apprehend; yet there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as the Hebrew writers call that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>incrustamentum immunditiei</hi> upon all corrupt Minds, which hinders the lively taste and relish of it.


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66374:172"/>
This is that thick and palpable Darkness which cannot comprehend that divine Light that shines in the Minds and Understandings of all men, but makes them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that very Truth which they seem to entertain. <hi>The World through wisdome</hi> (as the Apostle speaks) <hi>knew not God.</hi> Those great Disputers of this world were too full of nice and empty Speculations to know him who is only to be discerned by <hi>a pacate, humble and self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying mind:</hi> their Curiosity served rather to dazzle their Eyes then to enlighten them; while they rather proudly braved themselves in their knowledge of the Deity, then humbly subjected their own Souls to a complyance with it; making the Divinity nothing else but as it were a flattering Glass that might reflect and set off to them the beauty of their own Wit and Parts the better: and while they seemed to converse with God himself, they rather amorously courted their own Image in him, and fell into love with their own Shape. Therefore the best acquaintance with Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a knowledge taught by God:</hi> it is a Light that descends from Heaven which is only able to guide and conduct the souls of men to Heaven from whence it comes. The Jewish Doctors use to put it among the fundamental Articles of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That their Law was from heaven,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: I am sure we may much rather reckon it amongst the Principles of our Christian Religion in an higher way, That it is an Influx from God upon the Minds of good men. And this is the great designe and plot of the Gospel, to open and unfold to us the true way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to God; a Contrivance for the uniting the Souls of men to him, and the deriving a participation of God to men, to bring in <hi>Everlasting righteousness,</hi> and to establish the true Tabernacle of God in the


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:66374:173"/>
Spirits of men, which was done in a Typical and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematical way under the Law. And herein consists the main preeminence which <hi>the Gospel</hi> hath above <hi>the Law,</hi> in that it so clearly unfolds the Way and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Uniting humane nature to Divinity; which the Apostle seems mainly to aim at in these words, <hi>But Israel which followed after the Law of righteousness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>An Enquiry into that Jewish Notion of a Legal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, which is opposed by S. Paul. That their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it was such as this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Law externally dispensed to them (though it were, as a Dead letter, merely without them) and conjoined with the power of their own Free-will, was sufficient to procure them Acceptance with God, and to acquire Merit enough to purchase Eternal Life, Perfection and Happiness. That this their Notion had these two Grounds; First, An Opinion of their own Self-sufficiency, and that their Free-will was so absolute and perfect, as that they needed not that God should doe any thing for them but only furnish them with some Law to exercise this Innate power about. That they asserted such a Freedom of Will as might be to them a Foundation of Merit.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FOR the unfolding whereof, we shall endeavour to search out, First, <hi>What the Jewish Notion of a Legal righteousness was, which the Apostle here condemns.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>What that Evangelical righteousness, or Righteousness of Faith, is, which he endeavours to establish</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>in the room of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:66374:173"/>
For the First, That which the Apostle here blames the Jews for, seems to be indeed nothing else but an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome</hi> or <hi>Compendium</hi> of all that which he otherwhere disputes against them for: which is not merely and barely concerning the Formal notion of <hi>Justification,</hi> as some may think, viz. Whether the Formal notion of it respects only Faith, or Works in the Person justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, (though there may be a respect to that also) it is not merely a subtile School-controversie which he seems to handle; but it is of a greater latitude; It is indeed concerning the whole Way of Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and the proper scope of restoring Mankind to Perfection and Union with the Deity, which the Jews expected by virtue of that Systeme and Pandect of Laws which were delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and enlarged by the <hi>Gemara</hi> of their own Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                  <p>Which that we may the better understand, perhaps it may not be amiss a little to traverse the Writings of their most approved ancient Authors, that so finding out their constant received opinions concerning their <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>the Works thereof,</hi> we may the better and more fully understand what S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apostles aim at in their disputes against them.</p>
                  <p>The Jewish notion generally of the Law is this; <q>That in that Model of life contained in that Body of Laws, distinguished ordinarily into Moral, Judicial &amp; Ceremonial, was comprised the whole Method of raising Man to his perfection; and that they having only this Book of Laws without them, to converse with, needed nothing else to procure Eternal life, Perfection and Happiness: as if this had been the only means God had for the saving of Men and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them happy, to set before them in an External


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:66374:174"/>
way a Volume of Laws, Statutes and Ordinances, and so to leave them to work out and purchase to themselves Eternal life in the observance of them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this General notion of theirs we shall unfold in 2 Particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, as a Foundation of all the rest, They took up this as an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> or common Principle, <q>That Mankind had such an absolute and perfect Free-will, and such a sufficient power from within himself to determine himself to Vertue and Goodness, as that he only needed some Law as the Matter or Object to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise this Innate power about; and therefore needed not that God should doe any thing more for him then merely to acquaint him with his Divine will and pleasure.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for this we have <hi>Maimonides</hi> speaking very fully and magisterially, That this was one of their <hi>Radices fidei</hi> or Articles of their Faith, and one main Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which the <hi>Law</hi> stood. His words are these in <hi>Halacah teshubah</hi> or Treatise of <hi>Repentance,</hi> Chap. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The Power of Free-will is given to every man to determine himself (if he will) to that which is good, and to be good; or to determine himself to that which is evil, and to be wicked, (if he will.) Both are in his power, according to what is written in the Law,</hi> Behold, Man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: <hi>that is to say, Behold this sort of Creature, Man, is alone (and there is not a Second like to Man) in this,</hi> viz. <hi>That Man from himself by his own proper knowledge and power knowes good and evil, and does what pleaseth him in an uncontrollable way, so as none can hinder him as to the doing of either good or evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And a little after he thus interprets those words in


<pb n="291" facs="tcp:66374:174"/>
the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> of the <hi>repenting</hi> Church, ch. 3. 40. <hi>Let us search and try our waies, and turn unto the Lord,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Seeing that we who are endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the power of Free-will, have most wittingly and freely committed all our transgressions; it is meet and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming that we should convert our selves by repentance, and forsake all our iniquities, forasmuch as this also is in our power: This is the importance of those words,</hi> Let us search and try our ways, and turn unto the Lord. <hi>And this is a great Fundamental, the very Pillar of the Law and Precept, according to what is written</hi> Deuter. 30. See, I have set before thee this day life and death, good and evil.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who was well vers'd in the ancientest Jewish learning, and in high esteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Jews, is pleased to reckon this as a main Principle and Foundation upon which that Law stood; as indeed it must needs be, if <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> might be acquired by virtue of those Legal precepts which had only an External administration, being set before their External Senses, and promulged to their Eares as the Statute-laws of any other Common-wealth use to be. Which was the very notion that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had of these Laws. And therefore in <hi>Breshith Rabba</hi> (a very ancient Writing) the Jewish Doctors ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of that passage in the Canticles, <hi>Let him kiss m with the kisses of his mouth,</hi> they thus gloss upon it; <hi>At the time of the giving of the Law, the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Israel desired that Moses might speak to them, they being not able to heare the words of God himself: and while he spake, they heard, and hearing forgat; and thereupon moved this debate among themselves, What is this Moses, a man of flesh and blood? and what is his law, that we so soon learn, and so soon forget it? O that


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:66374:175"/>
God would kiss us with the kisses of his mouth!</hi> that is, in their sense, that God would teach them in a more vital and internal way. And then (as they goe on) <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> makes this answer, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>That this could not be then: But it should so come to pass in the time to come, in the daies of the Messiah, when the Law should be written in their hearts, as it is said,</hi> Jer. 31. I will write it in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>By this we may see how necessarie it was for the Jews, that they might be consistent to their grand Principle of obtaining <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> by this <hi>dead letter</hi> and a thing merely without themselves, (as not being radicated in the vital powers of their own Souls) to establish such a power of <hi>Free-will</hi> as might be able uncontrollably to entertain it, and so readily by its own Strength perform all the dictates of it.</p>
                  <p>And that <hi>Maimonides</hi> was not the first of the Jewish writers who expound that passage Gen. 3. <hi>[Behold, man is become like one of us, to know good and evil]</hi> of <hi>Free-will,</hi> may appear from the several Chaldee Paraphrasts upon it, which seem very much to intimate that Sense. Which by the way, (though I cannot allow all that which the Jews deduce from it) I think is not without something of Truth, viz. That that Liberty which is founded in Reason, and which Mankind only in this lower world hath above other Creatures, may be there also meant. But whatever it is, I am sure the Jewish Commentators upon that place generally follow the rigid sense of <hi>Maimonides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpose <hi>R. Bechai,</hi> a man of no small lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning both in the Talmudick and Cabalistical doctrine of the Jews, tells us, That upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s first transgression, that grand <hi>Liberty of Indifferency</hi> equally to Good or


<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66374:175"/>
Evil began first to discover it self; whereas before that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>all Intellect and wholy Spiritual,</hi> (as that common Cabalistical Notion was) being from within only determined to that which was Good. But I shall at large relate his words, because of their pertinency and usefulness in the Matter now in hand. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>Adam before his sin, acted from a necessity of Nature, and all his actions were nothing else but the issues of pure and perfect Understanding. Even as the Angels of God, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but Intelligences, put forth nothing else but acts of intelligence; just so was Man before he sinned, and did eat of the Tree of Knowledg of good and evil: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this transgression, he had the power of Election and Free-will, whereby he was able to will good or evil.</hi> And a little after glossing on those words Gen. 3. 7. <hi>[And the eyes of them both were opened]</hi> he addeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>They derived the power of Free-will from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil: And now they became endued with this power of determining themselves to Good or Evil; and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is divine, and in some respect a good Property.</hi> So that according to the mind of our Author, the First original &amp; pedigree of <hi>Free-will</hi> is to be derived not so much from the <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>Creation,</hi> as from that after-<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocha</hi> of Mans transgression or <hi>Eating of the forbidden fruit:</hi> so that the Indifferency of mans Will to Good or Evil, and a Power to determine himself freely to either, did then first of all unfold it self; whereas before he conversed like a pure Intelligence with its First cause, without any propension at all to Material things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determined like a proper natural Agent solely to that which is good: and these Propensions arising upon the First transgression to Material things (which they


<pb n="294" facs="tcp:66374:176"/>
supposed to be in mens power either so to correct and castigate as to prevent any sin in them, or else to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue in a way of vice) are, if not the Form and Essence, yet at least the Original and Root of that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which they speak so much of. But of this in another place.</p>
                  <p>All this we have further confirmed out of <hi>Nach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manides,</hi> an Author sufficiently versed in all Matters concerning the Jewish Religion. His words are these in his Comment upon Deut. 30. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>From the time of the Creation Man had a power of Free-Will within him to do Good or Evil according to his own choice, as also through the whole time of the Law; that so he might be capable of Merit in freely chusing what is Good, and of Punishment in electing what is Evil.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that he tells us that this <hi>Free-will</hi> hath continued e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since the <hi>Creation,</hi> we must not understand rigidly the very moment of mans Creation, but that <hi>Epocha</hi> taken with some latitude, so that it may include the time of mans First transgression: for he after suggests thus much, That before the First Sin <hi>Adam</hi>'s power to Good was a mere Natural power without any such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency to Evil; and therefore he makes that State of <hi>Adam</hi> the Model and platform of future perfection which the most ancient Jewish Authors seem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the time of their Messiah, which he expresseth in this manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>He shall not covet nor desire</hi> (after a Sensitive manner,) <hi>but Man shall return in the times of the Messiah to that Primitive State he was in before the sin of the First man, who natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally did whatsoever was good, neither was there any thing and its contrary then in his choice.</hi> Upon which Ground he afterwards concludes, That in those times of the Messiah there shall neither be <hi>Merit</hi> nor <hi>Demerit,</hi>


                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:66374:176"/>
because there shall be no <hi>Free-will,</hi> which is the alone Mother and Nurse of both of them: But in the mean while, That Good or Evil are to men (that I may phrase it in the language of the Stoick) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. none prejudicing or in the least degree hindering the exercise of this Liberty, neither from within nor from without, <hi>none either in Heaven or in Earth</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And thus the same <hi>Nachmanides</hi> expounds that solemn At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, Deut. 30. 19. wherein Heaven and Earth are called to witness That that day <hi>Life and Death</hi> were set before them; as if God himself had now established such a <hi>Monarchical</hi> power in man which Heaven and Earth should be in league withall and faithfull to.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon R. <hi>Saadia Gaon</hi> (so call'd by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency) doubts not to tell us that the common sense of all the Jewish Doctors was, That this <hi>Liberty to good or evil</hi> was such an <hi>Absolute</hi> kind of authority establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a mans soul, that it was in a sort <hi>Independent</hi> upon God himself; this being, as he saith (in the book call'd <hi>Sepher emunah)</hi> the meaning of that old and vulgar Maxime amongst the Jews, sometimes mentioned in the Talmud, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant there is another Axiome of the Jews as common, which may seem partly to cross this and what hitherto hath been spoken, viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the meaning of which is this, <hi>That assistence is perpetually afforded to all endeavours both of Sanctity and Impiety.</hi> But <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> hath somewhere told us (and, as I remember, in his <hi>Sepher Hamedang)</hi> how they mince the matter, and mean nothing else by it but this, That when men endeavour after the performance of the Law, God in a


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:66374:177"/>
way of providence furnisheth them with External mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and means, giving them peace and riches and other outward accommodations, whereby they might have advantage and opportunity to perform all that good which their own Free-will determines them to: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Wicked men find the like help of External matter and means for promoting and accomplishing their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ungodly designes.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see how the Jews, that they might lay a Foundation of <hi>Merit,</hi> and build up the stately and magnificent fabrick of their Happiness upon the sandy Foundation of <hi>a dead Letter without them,</hi> endeavour to strengthen it by as weak a Rampart of their own <hi>Self-sufficiency</hi> and the Power of their own <hi>Free-will</hi> able (as they vainly imagined) to perform all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, as being adequate and commensurate to the whole Law of God in its most Extensive and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive sense and meaning; rather looking upon the <hi>Fall of man</hi> as <hi>the Rise</hi> of that <hi>Giant-like Free-will</hi> whereby they were enabled to bear up themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Heaven it self, as being a great Accessory to their happiness (rather then prejudicial to it) through the access of that multitude of divine Laws which were given to them; as we shall see afterwards. And so they reckoned upon a more Triumphant and Illustrious kind of Happiness victoriously to be atchieved by the <hi>Merit</hi> of their own works, then that Beggerly kind of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness (as they seem to look upon it) which cometh like an Alms from Divine bounty.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Second Ground of that Jewish Notion of <hi>a Legal Righteousness</hi> is this, <q>That the Law deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was a sufficient Dispensation from God, and all that needed to be done by him for the advancing of them to a State of Perfection and Blessedness; and That the proper Scope and End of their Law was nothing but to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them several waies and means of <hi>Merit.</hi> Which</q> is expresly delivered in the <note n="*" place="margin">lib. <hi>Maccoth</hi> sect. ult.</note>

                     </gap>. The meaning whereof is this, That therefore the precepts of the Law were so many in number, that so they might single out where they pleased, and in exercising themselves therein procure Eternal life; as <hi>Obadias de Bartenora</hi> expounds it, <hi>That


<pb n="298" facs="tcp:66374:178"/>
whosoever shall perform any one of the 613 Precepts of the Law</hi> (for so many they make in number) <hi>without any worldly respects, for love of the Precept,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>behold, this man shall merit thereby everlasting life.</hi> For indeed they supposed a <hi>Reward</hi> due to the performance of every <hi>Precept,</hi> which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> they supposed to be encreased according to the secret estimation which God himself hath of any <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> as we find suggested in the <hi>Mishnah,</hi> in the Book <hi>Pirke avoth,</hi> in the words of the famous <hi>R. Jehuda,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Here we must take notice that this was a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among the Jews, which <hi>Precepts</hi> they were that had the greatest <hi>Reward</hi> due to the performance of them; in which controversie <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this place thus resolves us, That the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>Reward</hi> that was annex'd to the <hi>Negative Precepts</hi> might be collected from the measure of the <hi>Punishments</hi> that were consequent upon the breach of them. But this knot could not be so well solved in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Affirmative Precepts,</hi> because the <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> annex'd to the breach of them were more rarely defined in the <hi>Law:</hi> accordingly he expresseth himself to this sense, <hi>As for the Affirmative Precepts</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>it is not express'd what Reward is due to every one of them; and all for this end, that we may not know which Precept is most necessary to be observed, and which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is of less necessity and importance.</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he tells us that for this reason their Wise men said, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Qui operam dat prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto, liber est à praecepto;</hi> which he expounds to this


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:66374:178"/>
sense, That whosoever shall exercise himself about any one Precept, ought without haesitation or dispute to continue in the performance of it, as being in the mean while freed from minding any other. For if God had declared which Precepts himself had most valued and settled the greatest revenue of happiness upon, then other Precepts would have been less minded; and any one that should have busied himself in a Precept of a lower nature, would presently have left that, when opportunity should have been offered of performing a higher. And hence we have also another Talmudical Canon for the performing of Precepts, of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the former quoted by our foresaid Author, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>It is not lawfull to skip over Precepts,</hi> that is, as he expounds it, <hi>When a man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to observe one Precept, he may not skip over and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish that, that so he might apply himself to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of another.</hi> And thus, as the performance of any Precept hath a certain <hi>Reward</hi> annex'd to it; so the <hi>Measure</hi> of the <hi>Reward</hi> they suppose to be encreased ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Number</hi> of those <hi>Precepts</hi> which they observe, as it is defined by <hi>R. Tarphon</hi> in the foresaid <hi>Mishnah,</hi> c. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>If thou hast been much in the study of the Law, thou shalt be rewarded much: For faithfull is thy Lord &amp; Master, who will render to thee a Reward proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to thy Work.</hi> And a little before we have the same thing in the words of another of their Masters, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>righteous,</hi> whose Merits outweighed their

demerits: Whereas on the other side the <hi>perfectly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in their sense were such as had no Merits at all; and those <hi>simply</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>wicked,</hi> whose demerits made the weightiest scale: And the <hi>Middle sort</hi> were such as their good deeds and evil deeds equally balanced one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Of this First sort of Men, viz. <hi>the perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> they supposed there might be many; and <hi>such</hi> the <hi>Pharisees</hi> seem to have been in their own esteem, in our Saviours time. And according to this Notion our Saviour may seem to have shaped his answer to that <hi>Young man</hi> in the Gospel, who asked him, <hi>What shall I doe to inherit eternal life?</hi> To which our Saviour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>Keep the Commandements:</hi> which our Saviour propounds to him in so great a latitude, as thereby to take him off from his self-conceit, and that he might be convinced upon reflexion on himself, that he had fallen short of Eternal life, in failing of a due perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Divine law. But he insisting upon his own <hi>Merit</hi> in this respect, enquires of our Saviour whether there be yet any thing wanting to make him a <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>one perfectly righteous.</hi> To this our Saviour replies, <note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 19. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning of which Reply may, as I conceive, be this, to convince him of his imperfect Obedience to, and compliance with, the law of God, from his over-eager love of this world. But secondly, for the <hi>Medii,</hi> or those that were in <hi>the middle rank</hi> of men, the Jewish Doctors had divers Rules, as, 1. In case a mans Evil works and Good were equal, the addition of one ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way might determine them to Eternal life or mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 2. That in case a mans Evil works should prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and weigh down his Good, yet he may cast the scale by <hi>Repentance,</hi> if he will; or in the other world by chastisements and punishments he may make expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

                  <p>And by the way we may observe what a <hi>Lean</hi> and <hi>Spiritless Religion</hi> this of the <hi>Jews</hi> was, and how it was nothing else but a Souleless and Liveless form of External performances, which did little or nothing at all reach the Inward man, being nothing but a mere Bodily kind of drudgery and servility: and therefore our Saviour when he modells out Religion to them Matth. 5. he points them out to <hi>Something fuller of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life and spirit,</hi> and such a one as might make them <hi>Perfect, as their Father in heaven is Perfect.</hi> Such dull heavy-spirited Principles as this <hi>Talmudical</hi> doctrine we have quoted affordeth us, is very like began to possess the Chair in <hi>Antigonus</hi> his time, who therefore put in this Caution against part of it, That God was not to be served so much upon the account of <hi>Merit</hi> and for hope of Wages, as out of <hi>Love;</hi> though his Disciples <hi>Sadoc</hi> and <hi>Baithus,</hi> the founders of the sect of the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> straining that sober Principle too far, might more strengthen that <hi>Mercenary</hi> belief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

Thus much, That since the Israelites are signed with the Holy seale in their flesh, they are thereby acknowledged for the Sons of God: as on the contrary, They that are not sealed with this mark in their flesh, are not the Sons of God, but are the children of uncleanness: Wherefore it is not lawful to contract familiarity with them, or to teach them the Words of the Law.</hi> Which afterwards is urged further by another of their Masters, <hi>Whosoever instructeth any uncircumcised person</hi>

                  <p>All which plainly amounts to thus much (as we had before out of the Talmudists,) That the Law was given unto the Israelites for this purpose, To enrich them with good works, and to augment their Merits, &amp; so to establish the foundations of Life &amp; Blessedness amongst them; and to make it a <hi>Medium</hi> of the Union betwixt God and Men, as <hi>R.

                     <hi>the world was then perfum'd with a most aromatick smell, and Heaven and Earth were established, and the Holy Blessed One was known above and below, and he ascended in his glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all which Mystical and Allegorical Expressions our Author seems to aim at this main Scope, <hi>viz.</hi> To set forth the <hi>Law</hi> as that which of it self was sufficient, without any other Dispensation from God, for the perfecting of those to whom it was dispensed; and to make them Comprehensours of all Righteousness here


<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66374:182"/>
and Glory hereafter: Which they are wont to set forth in that transcendent state of <hi>Perfection</hi> which the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites were in at the receiving of the <hi>Law;</hi> whence it hath been an ancient Maxime amongst them, <hi>In Statione montis Sinai Israelitae erant sicut Angeli ministerii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we have endeavoured to make good that which we first propounded, namely, to shew That the grand Opinion of the Jews concerning the way to Life and Happiness was this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Law of God externally dispensed, and only furnished out to them in Tables of Stone and a Parchment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll, conjoined with the power of their own Free-will, was sufficient both to procure them acceptance with God, and to acquire Merit enough to carry them with spread sails into the Harbour of Eternal rest and blessedness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that by this time we may see that those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes which S. <hi>Paul</hi> and other Apostles maintain against the Jews touching the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> were not merely about that one Question, <hi>Whether Justification formally and precisely respects Faith alone;</hi> but were of a much greater latitude.</p>

                        <hi>The Second Enquiry, Concerning</hi> the Evangelical Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness <hi>or</hi> the Righteousness of Faith, <hi>and the true difference between</hi> the Law and the Gospel, the Old and the New Covenant, <hi>as it is laid down by the Apostle Paul. A more General Answer to this enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, together with a General observation of the Apostle's main End in opposing</hi> Faith <hi>to the</hi> Works of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> To beat down the Jewish proud conceit of Merit. <hi>A more particular and Distinct answer to the Enquiry, viz.</hi> That the Law or Old Covenant is considered only as an External administration, a dead thing in it self, a Dispensation consisting in an Outward and Written Law of Precepts: But the Gospel or New Covenant is an Internal thing, a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Form and Principle of Righteousness in the Souls of men, an Inward manifestation of Divine life, and a living Impression upon the Minds and Spirits of Men. <hi>This proved from several Testimonies of Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving done with the First Enquiry, we now come to the Second, which was this, <hi>What the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteousness</hi> or <hi>the Righteousness of Faith is which the Apostle sets up against that of the Law, and in what Notion the Law is considered by the Apostle:</hi> Which in summe was this, viz. That the <hi>Law</hi> was the Ministery of death, and in it self an <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> thing, neither could it procure or beget that <hi>Divine life</hi> and spiritual Form of Godliness in the Souls of


<pb n="309" facs="tcp:66374:183"/>
men, which God expects from all the heirs of Glory, nor that Glory which is only consequent upon a true Divine life. Whereas on the other side the <hi>Gospel</hi> is set forth as a mighty <hi>Efflux</hi> and Emanation of <hi>life and spirit</hi> freely issuing forth from an Omnipotent source of Grace and Love, as that true God-like vital influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereby the Divinity derives it self into the Souls of men, enlivening and transforming them into its own likeness, and strongly imprinting upon them a Copy of its own Beauty and Goodness: Like the Spermatical virtue of the Heavens, which spreads it self freely upon this Lower world, and subtily insinuating it self into this benummed feeble earthly Matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets life and motion in it. Briefly, <hi>It is that whereby God comes to dwell in us, and we in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that we may the more distinctly unfold the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>That Righteousness which is of the Law,</hi> &amp; <hi>That which is of Faith,</hi> &amp; so the better shew how the Apostle undermines that fabrick of Happiness which the Jews had built up for themselves; we shall observe First in general, That the main thing which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <note place="margin">1.</note> endeavours to beat down was, that proud and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant conceit which they had of <hi>Merit,</hi> and to advance against it the notion of the Divine grace and bounty as the only Fountain of all Righteousness and Happiness. For indeed that which all those Jewish notions, which we have before taken notice of, aim principally at, was the advancing of the weakened Powers of Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such an height of Perfection as might render them capable of <hi>Meriting</hi> at Gods hands: and that <hi>Perfection</hi> which they speak so much of (as is clear from what hath been said) was nothing else but a mere sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own Natural Powers and Principles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the strength of their own Fancies. And


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:66374:184"/>
therefore these Contractors with Heaven were so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to look upon Eternal life as a fair Purchase which they might make for themselves at their own charge; as if the spring and rise of all were in themselves: their eyes were so much dazled with those foolish fires of <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Reward</hi> kindled in their own Fancies, that they could not see that light of Divine grace and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which shone about them.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Fastus</hi> and swelling pride of theirs (if I mistake not) is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> principally endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to chastise in advancing <hi>Faith</hi> so much as he doth in opposition to <hi>the works of the Law.</hi> For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he spends the First and Second Chapters of this Epistle to the Romans in drawing up a charge of such a nature both against Gentiles and Jews, but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Jews, who were the grand Justitiaries, that might make them bethink themselves of implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Mercy, and of laying aside all plea of Law and Justice; and so chap. 3. 27. he shuts up all with a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere check to such presumptuous arrogance, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>Where then is boasting?</hi> This seems then to be the main End which S. <hi>Paul</hi> every where aims at in opposing <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>the works of the Law,</hi> namely to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish the Foundation of Righteousness and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon the Free mercy and grace of God: the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying and magnifying of which in the real manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it he holds forth upon all occasions, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe &amp; plot of the Gospel-administration; seeing it is impossible for men by any Works which they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to satisfie God's Justice for those Sins which they have committed against him, or truly to comply with his Divine will, without his Divine assistance. So that the Method of reconciling men to God, and reducing of straying Souls back again to him, was to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:66374:184"/>
wholy to another Original then that which the Jews imagined. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That <hi>Righteousness of Faith</hi> which the <note place="margin">2.</note> Apostle sets up against the <hi>Law,</hi> and compares with it, is indeed in its own nature a <hi>Vital</hi> and <hi>Spiritual admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,</hi> wherein God converseth with Man; whereas the <hi>Law</hi> was merely an <hi>External</hi> or <hi>Dead thing</hi> in it self, not able to beget any true Divine life in the Souls of Men. All that <hi>Legal Righteousness</hi> which the Jews boasted so much of, was but <hi>from the Earth, earthly;</hi> consisting merely in <hi>External performances,</hi> &amp; so falling extremely short of that <hi>Internal &amp; God-like frame of Spirit</hi> which is necessary for a true conjunction and union of the Souls of Men with God, and making of them capable of true Blessedness.</p>
                  <p>But that we may the more distinctly handle this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, we shall endeavour to unfold <hi>the true Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Law and the Gospel,</hi> as it seems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to be laid down every where by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistles: and the Difference between them is clearly this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Law</hi> was merely an <hi>External</hi> thing, consisting in such Precepts which had only an <hi>Outward administration;</hi> but the <hi>Gospel</hi> is an <hi>Internal</hi> thing, a <hi>Vital</hi> Form and Principle seating it self in the Minds and Spirits of Men. And this is the most proper and formal <hi>Difference</hi> between the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> that the one is considered only as an <hi>External</hi> administration, and the other as an <hi>Internal.</hi> And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle 2 Cor. 3. 6, 7. calls the <hi>Law</hi>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:66374:185"/>
the Souls of men, whereby they are <hi>inwardly</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to express a real conformity thereto. Upon this Ground the Apostle further pursues the <hi>Effects</hi> of both these from the 14. verse to the end.</p>
                  <p>By all which the Apostle means to set forth to us How vast a Difference there is between the <hi>External</hi> manifestations of God in a Law of Commandements, and those <hi>Internal</hi> appearances of God whereby he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the mighty power of his Goodness to the Souls of men.</p>
                  <p>Though the History and outward Communication of the Gospel to us <hi>in scriptis,</hi> is to be always acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as a special mercy &amp; advantage, and certainly no less Privilege to Christians then it was to the Jews to be the <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 3. 2.</note> Depositaries of the Oracles of God: yet it is plain that the Apostle, where he compares the Law and the Gospel, and in other places, doth by the Gospel mean something which is more then a piece of Book-learning, or an Historical Narration of the free love of God in the several contrivances of it for the Redemption of mankind. For if this were all that is meant properly by the <hi>Gospel,</hi> I see no reason why it should not be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>as weak and impotent</hi> a thing, as <hi>dead a letter</hi> as the <hi>Law</hi> was, (as we intimated before;) and so there would be no such vast <hi>Difference</hi> between them as the Apostle asserts there is; the one being properly an <hi>External declaration of Gods will,</hi> the other an <hi>Internal manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of Divine life upon mens Souls:</hi> and therefore Gal. 3. 21. he so distinguisheth between this double Dispensation of God, that this <hi>Evangelical dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is a vital and quickening thing, able to beget a Soul and Form of Divine goodness upon the Souls of men; which because <hi>the Law</hi> could not doe, it was laid aside, as being insufficient to restore man to the favour of

All the outward Teachings of men are but dead things in themselves. But God's imprinting his Mind and Will upon mens hearts is properly that which is called <hi>the Teaching of God,</hi> and then they become <hi>living</hi> Laws written in the <hi>living</hi> Tables of mens Hearts fitted to receive and retain Divine impressions.

                     <hi>the righteousness of faith,</hi> because it is received from God in a way of believing. For I cannot easily think that he should mean nothing else in this place but merely the Righteousness of Justification, as some would perswade us, but rather


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:66374:187"/>
that his Sense is much more comprehensive, so as to include the state of Gospel-dispensation, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not only <hi>Pardon of sins,</hi> but <hi>an Inward spirit of Love, Power, and of a sound Mind,</hi> as he expresseth it 2 Tim. 1. 7. And this he thus opposeth to the <hi>Law,</hi> Rom. 10. 6, &amp;c. <hi>But the Righteousness of Faith speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on this wise; Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven? &amp;c. or, Who shall descend into the deep? But what saith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is, the word of faith which we preach.</hi> In which words <hi>Cunaeus</hi> in his <hi>De Repub. Hebr.</hi> would have us to understand some <hi>Cabbala</hi> or Tradition amongst the Jews for this meaning of that place, Deut. 30. 12. from which these words are borrowed, which as they there stand, seem not to carry that Evangelical sense which here S. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds them into; though yet <hi>Cunaeus</hi> hath not given us any reason for this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his. But indeed the Jewish writers general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who were acquainted with the principles of the <hi>Cabbala,</hi> commenting upon that place do wholly refer it <hi>to the Times of the Messiah,</hi> making it parallel with that place of <hi>Jeremy</hi> which defines the <hi>New Covenant</hi> to be <hi>a writing of the Law of God in mens hearts.</hi> And thus that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> that results from the <hi>Righteousness of Faith</hi> is all, as Faith it self is, deriving from God gratuitously dispensing himself to the Minds of men: Whereas if <hi>Life</hi> could have been by the <hi>Law,</hi> its Original and Principal must have been resolved into men themselves who must have acted that <hi>dead matter without them,</hi> and have produced that Virtue and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy in it, by their exercising themselves therein, which of it self it had not; as the Observance of any Law ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that Law it self to dispense that Reward which is due to the observance of it: and therefore the <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:66374:188"/>
of the Law</hi> was so defin'd, that <hi>he that did those things should live in them.</hi> And thus the New Testament every where seems to present to us this twofold Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation or Oeconomy, the one consisting in an <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and written law of Precepts,</hi> the other in <hi>Inward life and power.</hi> Which S. <hi>Austin</hi> hath well pursued in his Book <hi>de Litera &amp; Spiritu,</hi> from whom <hi>Aquinas</hi> (who endeavours to tread in his foot-steps) seems to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken first of all an occasion of moving that Question, <hi>Utrum Lex nova sit lex scripta, vel lex indita;</hi> and thus resolves it, That the <hi>New Law</hi> or <hi>Gospel</hi> is not properly <hi>lex scripta,</hi> as the <hi>Old</hi> was, but <hi>Lex indita:</hi> and that the <hi>Old</hi> Law is <hi>foris scripta,</hi> the other <hi>intus scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pta,</hi> written in the tables of the Heart.</p>
                  <p>Now from all this we may easily apprehend how much the <hi>Righteousness of the Gospel transcends that of the Law,</hi> in that it hath indeed <hi>a true command over the inward man</hi> which it acts and informs; whereas the <hi>Law</hi> by all its <hi>menaces</hi> and <hi>punishments</hi> could only <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell</hi> men to an <hi>External observance</hi> of it in the <hi>outward</hi> man; as the Schoolmen have well observed, <hi>Lex ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ligat manum, Lex nova ligat animum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And herein S. <hi>Paul</hi> every where magnifies this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the free mercy &amp; grace of God, as being the only soveraign remedy against all the inward radicated maladies of sin and corruption, as that <hi>Panacea</hi> or <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samum vitae</hi> which is the universal restaurative of decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; impotent Nature. So he tells us Rom. 6. <hi>Sin shall not have dominion, because we are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> And this is that which made him so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol his acquaintance with Christ in the Dispensation of grace, and to despise all things as loss, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. where among his other Jewish privileges having reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned up his blamelesness in all points touching the


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:66374:188"/>
Law, he undervalues them all, and counts all but loss <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>for the excellency of the knowledg of Christ Jesus.</hi> In which place the Apostle doth not mean to disparage <hi>a real inward righteousness</hi> and the strict observance of the Law; but his meaning is to shew how poor and worthless a thing all <hi>Outward observances</hi> of the Law are in comparison of a true <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conformity</hi> to Christ in the renovation of the Mind and Soul according to his Image and likeness; as is manifest from v. 9, 10. &amp;c. in which he thus delivers his own meaning of <hi>that knowledge of Christ</hi> which he so much extoll'd, very emphatically, <hi>That I may be found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.</hi> Where by the way we may further take notice what this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the righteousness of faith</hi> and <hi>the righteousness of God</hi> (which we have already spoke much of) is according to his own true meaning, as he expounds himself, viz. a <hi>Christ-like</hi> Nature in a mans Soul, or Christ appearing in the Minds of men by the mighty power of his Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and thereby deriving a true participation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them: so we have it v. 10. <hi>That I may know the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, being made conformable unto his death.</hi> And thus <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> are opposed, as <hi>Christ</hi> is the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of Grace and Truth, of Gods free and gratuitous bounty, of Life and Substance: whereas <hi>Moses</hi> was but the Minister of the Law, of Rites and Shadows.</p>
                  <p>But it may perhaps be questioned whether the same <hi>Internal</hi> dispensation of God was not as well under the <hi>Law,</hi> as since our Saviour's coming, and so consequently that the Jews were equally parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:66374:189"/>
thereof; and so it could be no new thing to them.</p>
                  <p>To all which I might reply, That this Dispensation of grace was then a more Mystical thing, and not so manifested to the world as it hath been since our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours coming. Secondly, This dispensation of Free grace was not that which properly belonged to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, but only a Type and shadow of it.</p>
                  <p>For the fuller understanding of which and all that hath been spoken, we must know, That before our Saviour's coming the great Mysteries of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrapt up in Hieroglyphicks and Symbolical rites, (the unfolding of all which was reserved for him who is the great Interpreter of Heaven and Master of Truth) God was pleased to draw forth a Scheme or Copy of all that divine Oeconomy and Method of his commerce with mankind, and to make a draught of the whole artifice thereof in External matter: and therefore he singled out a Company and Society of men of the same common Extraction, marked out from all other sorts of men by a character of Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Sanctity (for so <hi>Circumcision</hi> was) collected and united together by a common band of Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and this he set up as an Emblem of a divine and holy seed or society of men which are all by way of Spiritual generation descended from himself. And hence it is that the Jews (the whole Jewish nation uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally considered) who were but a mere Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of this Spiritual fraternity &amp; congregation, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Holy seed</hi> or the <hi>Holy people.</hi> Then afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these he erects a Government &amp; <hi>Politie,</hi> &amp; rules over them in the way &amp; manner of a <hi>Political</hi> prince, as hath been long since well observed by <hi>Josephus,</hi> who therefore properly calls the Jewish government <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a Theocracy,</hi> or <hi>the Government of God himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:66374:189"/>
And thus in a <hi>Scheme</hi> or Figure he shadows forth that Spiritual kingdome and government which he would establish amongst that Divine society of men, in reference to which we have so much mention made of <hi>the Kingdome of heaven</hi> in the Gospel, which is not generally and solely meant of the <hi>State of glory,</hi> much less of any outward <hi>Church-rites,</hi> but mainly of that <hi>Idea</hi> and Exemplar of which the Jewish <hi>Theocracy</hi> was an imitation. Lastly, as a Political Prince God draws forth <hi>a Body of laws</hi> as the Political Constitutions and Rules of this Government which he had set up, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> for the Theatre whereon he would promulge those Laws by which all his Subjects should be governed. And so I doubt not but that Preface by which the Law is usher'd in, Exod. 20. which speaks of God's mercy in delivering them from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> thraldome, may very well be allegorized and mystical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expounded. And all this was to signifie and set forth that <hi>Law</hi> which was to goe forth from mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the promulgation whereof was to be in a Vital and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way among the Subjects of this Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. To all which we may add those <hi>Temporal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances</hi> which he distributed to the Jewish families, in imitation of that Eternal blessedness and those <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal inheritances</hi> which he shares out amongst his Spiritual Sons and Subjects in Heaven. And this I the rather add, because here the Jews are much perplex'd about untying this knot, namely, what the Reason should be that their <hi>Law</hi> speaks so <hi>sparingly</hi> of any <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reward,</hi> but runs out <hi>generally</hi> in promises of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane and <hi>Earthly blessings</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But by this we may see the true Reason of that which the Apostle speaks concerning them, 2 Cor. 3. 14. <hi>Until this day</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>the same vail in the reading of

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>remaineth untaken away.</hi> That <hi>Vail</hi> which was on <hi>Moses</hi> his face was an Emblem of all this great Mystery: and this <hi>Vail</hi> was upon the face of the Jews in their reading the Old Testament; they dwelling so much in a carnal converse with these Sacramental Symbols which were offered to them in the reading of the Law, that they could not see through them into the thing signified thereby, and so embraced Shadows in stead of Substance, and made account to build up Happiness and Heaven upon that Earthly Law to which properly the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was annex'd: whereas indeed this <hi>Law</hi> should have been their <hi>School-master to have led them to Christ</hi> whose Law it prefigured; which that it might doe the more effectually, God had annexed to the breach of any one part of it such severe Curses, that they might from thence perceive how much need they had of some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dispensation. And therefore this state of theirs is set forth by <hi>a State of bondage</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. For all External precepts carry perpetually an aspect of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity and rigour to those Minds that are not informed by the internal sweetness of them. And this is it only which makes the <hi>Gospel</hi> or the <hi>New Law</hi> to be <hi>a Free, Noble</hi> and <hi>Generous</hi> thing, because it is <hi>seated in the Souls</hi> of men: and therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> out of <hi>Austin</hi> hath well observed another difference between the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel, Brevis differentia inter Legem &amp; Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um est Timor &amp; Amor.</hi> This I the rather observe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the true meaning of that <hi>Spirit of Bondage</hi> which the Apostle speaks of is frequently mistaken. We might further (if need were) for a confirmation of this which we have spoken concerning the <hi>Typicalness</hi> of the whole Jewish Oeconomy appeal to the third and fourth chapters of the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> which cannot


<pb n="323" facs="tcp:66374:190"/>
well be understood without this Notion, where we have the Jewish Church, as a <hi>Type</hi> of the true Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Church, brought in as a Child in it's Minority in servitude under Tutors and Governours, shut up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law till the time of that Emphatical revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great Mysterie of God should come, till the Day should break, and all the shadows of the Night flee away.</p>
                  <p>That I may return from this Digression to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument we before pursued, this briefly may be added, That under the Old Covenant and in the time of the Law there were amongst the Jews <hi>some</hi> that were <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelized,</hi> that were <hi>re, non nomine Christiani;</hi> as under the Gospel there are <hi>many</hi> that do <hi>Judaize,</hi> are of as <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Servile</hi> Spirits as the Jews, <hi>children of the Bond-woman,</hi> resting in mere External observances of Religion, in an outward seeming Purity, in a Form of Godliness, as did the Scribes and Pharisees of old.</p>
                  <p>From what hath hitherto been discoursed, I hope the Difference between both Covenants clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and that the <hi>Gospel</hi> was not brought in only to hold forth a new Platform and Model of Religion; it was not brought in only to refine some Notions of Truth, that might formerly seem discoloured and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured by a multitude of Legal rites and ceremonies; it was not to cast our Opinions concerning the Way of Life and Happiness only into a New mould and shape in a <hi>Pedagogical</hi> kind of way: it is not so much <hi>a System</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> of saving Divinity, but the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>vital Influx</hi> of it spreading it self over all the Powers of mens Souls, and quickening them into a Divine life: it is not so properly a Doctrine that is wrapt up in ink and paper, as it is <hi>Vitalis Scientia,</hi> a living impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made upon the Soul and Spirit. We may in a true


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:66374:191"/>
sense be as <hi>Legal</hi> as ever the Jews were, if we converse with the <hi>Gospel</hi> as <hi>a thing only without us;</hi> and be as far short of the <hi>Righteousness of God</hi> as they were, if we make the Righteousness which is of Christ by Faith to serve us only as an <hi>Outward Covering,</hi> and endeavour not after an Internal transformation of our Minds and Souls into it. The Gospel does not so much consist <hi>in Verbis</hi> as <hi>in Virtute:</hi> Neither doth <hi>Evangelical</hi> dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation therefore please God so much more then the <hi>Legal</hi> did, because, as a finer contrivance of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite understanding, it more clearly discovers the Way of Salvation to the Minds of men; but chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a more Powerful Efflux of his Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon them, as being the true Seed of a happy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality continually thriving and growing on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. I shall adde further, The <hi>Gospel</hi> does not therefore hold forth such a transcendent priviledge and advantage above what the <hi>Law</hi> did, only because it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us that Christ our true High priest is ascended up into the Holy of holies, and there in stead of the bloud of Bulls and Goats hath sprinkled the Ark and Mercy-seat above with his own bloud: but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it conveys that <hi>bloud of sprinkling</hi> into our defiled Consciences, to purge them from dead works. Farr be it from me to disparage in the least the Merit of Christ's bloud, his becoming obedient unto death, whereby we are justified. But I doubt sometimes some of our <hi>Dogmata</hi> and Notions about Justification may puff us up in far higher and goodlier conceits of our selves then God hath of us; and that we profanely make the unspotted righteousness of Christ to serve only as a <hi>Covering</hi> to wrap up our foul deformities and filthy vices in; and when we have done, think our selvs in as good credit and repute with God as we are with our

selves, and that we are become Heaven's darlings as much as we are our own. I doubt not but the Merit and Obedience of our Saviour gain us favour with God, and potently move down the benign influences of Heaven upon us: But yet I think we may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be too lavish and wanton in our imaginations, in fondly conceiting a greater change in the Esteem which God hath of us then becomes us, &amp; too little reckon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Real and Vital Emanations of his favour upon us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore for the further clearing of what hath been already said, and laying a ground upon which the next part of our Discourse (viz. <hi>Concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiance of this God-like righteousness to us by Faith)</hi> is to proceed, We shall here speak something more to the business of Justification and Divine Acceptance, which we shall dispatch in two Particulars.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Two Propositions for the better understanding of the Doctrine of</hi> Justification and Divine Acceptance. 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> That the Divine judgment and estimation of every thing is according to the truth of the thing; and God's acceptance or disacceptance of things is suitable to his judgment. <hi>On what account S.</hi> James <hi>does attribute a kind of Justification to Good works. 2. Prop.</hi> Gods justifying of Sinners in pardoning their Sins carries in it a necessary reference to the sanctifying of their Natures. <hi>This abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Nature of the thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>OUR first Proposition is this, <hi>The Divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>and estimation of every thing is according to


<pb n="326" facs="tcp:66374:192"/>
the truth of the thing; and Gods acceptance or disacceptance of things is suitable and proportionable to his judgment.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Peter</hi> plainly tells us Act. 10. <hi>God is no respecter of persons; But every one that worketh righteousness is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him.</hi> And God himself posed <hi>Cain</hi> (who had entertained those unworthy and ungrounded suspitions of his partiality) with that Question, <hi>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?</hi> Wheresoever God finds any stamps and impressions of Goodness, he likes and approves them, knowing them well to be what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are, nothing else but his own Image and Superscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Whereever he sees his own Image shining in the Souls of men, and a conformity of life to that Eternal Idea of Goodness which is himself, he loves it and takes a complacency in it, as that which is from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and is a true Imitation of himself. And as his own unbounded Being &amp; Goodness is the Primary and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal object of his Immense and Almighty Love: so also every thing that partakes of him, partakes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably of his Love; all Imitations of him and Participations of his Love and Goodness are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally adequate and commensurate the one to the other. By so much the more <hi>acceptable</hi> any one is to God, by how much the more he comes to <hi>resemble</hi> God. It was a common Notion in the old <hi>Pythagorean</hi> and <hi>Platonick</hi> Theology, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. as <hi>Proclus</hi> phraseth it, That the Divinity transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Love, and enamour'd with it's own unlimited Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and spotless Beauty, delighted to copy forth and shadow out it self as it were in created Beings, which are perpetually embraced in the warm bosome of the same Love, which they can never swerve nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatize from, till they also prove apostate to the estate of their Creation. And certainly it is true in our


<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66374:192"/>
Christian divinity, that that Divine light and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which flows forth from God, the Original of all, upon the Souls of men, never goes solitary and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Love, Complacency</hi> and <hi>Acceptation,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies lodg'd together with it in the Divine Essence. And as the Divine <hi>Complacency</hi> thus dearly and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertains all those which beare a similitude of true Goodness upon them; so it alwaies abandons from its embraces all Evil, which never doth nor can mix it self with it: The Holy Spirit can never suffer any unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed or defiled thing to enter into it or to unite it self with it. Therefore in a sober sense I hope I may truly say, There is no perfect or through-reconciliation wrought between God and the Souls of men, while any defiled and impure thing dwells within the Soul, which cannot truly close with God, nor God with that. The Divine <hi>Love</hi> according to those degrees by which it works upon the Souls of men in transforming them into its own likeness, by the same it renders them more <hi>acceptable</hi> to it self, mingleth it self with and uniteth it self to them: as the <hi>Spirit</hi> of any thing mixeth it self more or less with any <hi>Matter</hi> it acts upon, according as it works it self into it, and so makes a way and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage open for it self.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account I suppose it may be that S. <hi>James</hi> attributes a kind of <hi>Justification</hi> to <hi>Good works,</hi> which unquestionably are things that God <hi>approves</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> and all those in whom he finds them, as seeing there <hi>a true conformity to his own Goodness and Holiness.</hi> Whereas on the other side he disparageth that <hi>barren, sluggish</hi> and <hi>drowsie Belief,</hi> that a lazy Lethargy in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion began in his times to hugg so dearly, in reference to <hi>acceptation</hi> with God. I suppose I may fairly thus gloss at his whole Discourse upon this Argument:


<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66374:193"/>
God respects not <hi>a bold, confident and audacious Faith,</hi> that is big with nothing but its own <hi>Presumptions.</hi> It is not because our Brains swim with <hi>a strong Conceit</hi> of God's Eternal love to us, or because we grow big and swell into a mighty bulk with airy fancies and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of our acceptance with God, that makes us ere the more acceptable to him: It is not all our <hi>strong Dreams</hi> of being in favour with Heaven that fills our hungry souls ere the more with it: It is not <hi>a pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Imagination</hi> of our Names being enrolled in the Book of life, or of the Debt-books of Heaven being crossed, or of Christ being ours, while we find him not living within us, or of the washing away of our sins in his bloud, while the foul and filthy stains thereof are deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sunk in our own Souls; it is not, I say, <hi>a pertinacious Imagination</hi> of any of these that can make us ere the better: And <hi>a mere Conceit</hi> or <hi>Opinion</hi> as it makes us <hi>never the better in reality</hi> within our selves; so it cannot render us <hi>ere the more acceptable</hi> to God <hi>who judges of all things as they are.</hi> No, it must be <hi>a true Compliance with the Divine will,</hi> which must render us such as the Divinity may take pleasure in. <hi>In Christ Jesus neither Circumcision nor Uncircumcision availeth any thing</hi> (nor <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 19.</note> any Fancy built upon any other External privilege) <hi>but the keeping of the Commandments of God.</hi> No, but <hi>If any man does the will of God, him will both the Father</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Son love; they will come in to him and make their abode with him.</hi> This is the Scope and Mark which a true <hi>Heaven-born Faith</hi> aims at; and when it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd this End, then is it indeed perfect and compleat in its last accomplishment. And by how much the more ardency and intention <hi>Faith</hi> levels at this mark of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward goodness and divine activity, by so much the more perfect and sincere it is. This is that which God <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,</hi>


                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:66374:193"/>
it being just and correspondent to his own good pleasure: and in whomsoever he finds this, both <hi>it</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are <hi>accepted</hi> of him. And so I come to the second Particular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God's justifying of Sinners in pardoning and remitting</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>their sins carries in it a necessary reference to the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their Natures;</hi> without which <hi>Justification</hi> would rather be a <hi>glorious name</hi> then a <hi>real privilege</hi> to the Souls of men. While men continue in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, they do but vainly dream of a device to tie the hands of an Almighty Vengeance from seizing on them: No, their own Sins, like so many armed Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, would first or last set upon them, and rend them with inward torment. There needs no angry Cherub with a flaming Sword drawn out every way to keep their unhallowed hands off from the Tree of life: No, their own prodigious Lusts, like so many arrows in their sides, would chase them, their own Hellish na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would sink them low enough into eternal death, and chain them up fast enough in fetters of darkness among the filthy fiends of Hell. <hi>Sin</hi> will alwaies be <hi>miserable;</hi> and the Sinner at last, when the empty blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of all those hopes and expectations of an aiery mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane Happiness, that did here bear him up in this life, shall be cut, will find it like <hi>a Talent of Lead</hi> weighing him down into the bottomless gulf of Misery. If all were clear towards Heaven, we should find Sin raising up storms in our own Souls. We cannot carry Fire in our own bosoms, and yet not be burnt. Though we could suppose the greatest Serenity without us, if we could suppose our selves nere so much to be at truce with Heaven, and all divine displeasure laid asleep; yet would our own Sins, if they continue unmortified, first or last make an <hi>Aetna</hi> or <hi>Vesuvius</hi> within us. Nay those


<pb n="330" facs="tcp:66374:194"/>
Sun-beams of Eternal Truth, that by us are detained in unrighteousness, would at last in those hellish vaults of vice and darkness that are within us kindle into an unquenchable fire. It would be of small benefit to us, That Christ hath triumph'd over the principalities and powers of darkness <hi>without us,</hi> while Hell and Death, strongly immur'd in a Fort of our own Sins and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, should tyrannize <hi>within us:</hi> That his Blood should speak peace in heaven, if in the mean while our own Lusts were perpetually warring and fighting in and against our own Souls: That he hath taken off our guilt and cancell'd that hand-writing that was against us, which bound us over to Eternal condemnation; if for all this we continue fast sealed up in the Hellish dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of our own filthy Lusts. Indeed we could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any relief from Heaven out of that misery under which we lie, were not Gods displeasure against us first pacified and our Sins remitted: But should the Divine Clemency stoop no lower to us then to a <hi>mere pardon</hi> of our sins and an abstract Justification, we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rise out of that Misery under which we lie. This is the Signal and Transcendent benefit of our free Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation through the Bloud of Christ, that God's offence justly conceived against us for our sins (which would have been an eternal bar and restraint to the Efflux of his Grace upon us) being taken off, the Divine grace and bounty may freely flow forth upon us. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Divine grace and love is now unlock'd and opened, which our Sins had shut up; and now the Streams of holiness and true goodness from thence free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow forth into all gasping Souls that thirst after them. The warm Sun of the Divine love, whenever it breaks through and scatters the thick Cloud of our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities that had formerly separated between God &amp; us,


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:66374:194"/>
it immediately breaks forth upon us with <hi>healing in its wings;</hi> it exerciseth the mighty force of its own light and heat upon our dark and benummed Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting in them a lively sense of God, and kindling into sparks of Divine goodness within us. This Love, when once it hath chased away the thick Mist of our Sins, it will be <hi>as strong as Death upon us, as potent as the Grave: many Waters will not quench it, nor the Floods drown it.</hi> If we shut not the windows of our Souls against it, it will at last enlighten all those Regions of darkness that are within us, and lead our Souls to the Light of Life, Blessedness and Immortality. God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons mens Sins out of an Eternal designe of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and whenever the sentence of death is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from a Sinner, it is at the same time denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against his Sins. God does not bid us be warm'd and be fill'd, and deny us those necessaries which our starving and hungry Souls call for. Christ having made peace through the bloud of his cross, the Heavens shall be no more as Iron above us: but we shall receive freely the vital dew of them, the former and the later Rain in their season, those Influences from above, which Souls truly sensible of their own Misery and Imperfection uncessantly gaspe after, that Righteousness of God which drops from above, from the unsealed Spring of Free goodness which makes glad the city of God. This is that Free Love and Grace which the Souls of Good men so much triumph in; This is that Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which begets in them lively Hopes of an happy Immortality in the present Anticipations thereof which spring forth from it in this life. And all this is that which we have called sometimes <hi>the Righteousness of Christ,</hi> sometimes <hi>the Righteousness of God;</hi> and here, <hi>the Righteousness which is of Faith.</hi> In Heaven it is a


<pb n="332" facs="tcp:66374:195"/>
not-imputing of sin; in the Souls of men it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of rebellious Natures to Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. In Heaven it is the lifting up the light of God's countenance upon us, which begets a gladsome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in the Souls of men, holy and dear reflections and reciprocations of Love: Divine Love to us, as it were by a natural emanation, begetting a Reflex love in us towards God, which, like that <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>How the Gospel-righteousness is conveighed to us by Faith,</hi> made to appear from these two Considerations. 1. <hi>The Gospel lays a strong foundation of a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dependance upon the Grace and Love of God, &amp; affiance in it.</hi> This confirmed by several Gospel-expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions containing plainly in them the most strong Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Encouragements to all ingenuous addresses to God, to all chearfull dependance on him, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent expectation of all assistance from him. 2. <hi>A true Evangelical Faith is no lazy or languid thing, but an ardent breathing and thirsting after Divine grace and righteousness:</hi> it looks beyond a mere par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin, and mainly pursues after an inward parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Divine nature. The mighty power of a living Faith in the Love and Goddness of God, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of throughout the whole Chapter.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE come now to the last part of our Discourse, <hi>viz. To shew the Way by which this God-like and Gospel-righteousness is conveighed to us;</hi> and that is <hi>by


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66374:195"/>
Faith.</hi> This is that powerful Attractive which by a strong and divine Sympathy draws down the virtue of Heaven into the Souls of men, which strongly and forcibly moves the Souls of good men into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with that Divine goodness by which it lives and grows: This is that Divine Impress that invincibly draws and sucks them in by degrees into the Divinity, and so unites them more and more to the Centre of Life and Love: It is something in the hearts of men which, feeling by an Occult and inward sensation the mighty insinuations of the Divine goodness, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately complies with it, and with the greatest ardency that may be is perpetually rising up into conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it; and being first begotten and enlivened by the warm Beams of that Goodness, it alwaies breaths and gasps after it for its constant growth and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is then fullest of life and vivacity, when it partakes most freely of it; and perpetually languisheth when it is in any measure deprived of that sweet and pure nourishment it derives from it.</p>
                  <p>But that we may the more clearly unfold this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>How Gospel-righteousness comes to be communicated through Faith,</hi> we shall lay it forth in 2 Particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>The Gospel lays a strong foundation of a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>

                     <hi>dependance upon the Grace and Love of God, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fianee in it.</hi> We have the greatest security and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that may be given us of God's readiness to relieve such forlorn and desolate Creatures as we are: That there are no such dreadful Fates in Heaven as are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually thirsting after the bloud of sinners, insatiably greedy after their prey, never satisfied till they have devoured the Souls of men. Lest we should by such dreadful apprehensions be driven from God, we are told of the <hi>Bloud of sprinkling that speaks better things</hi>


                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:66374:196"/>
for us; of a mighty <hi>Favourite</hi> solliciting our Cause with perpetual <hi>intercessions</hi> in the Court of heaven; of <hi>a new and living way</hi> to the Throne of grace and to the Holy of holies which our Saviour hath <hi>consecrated through his flesh:</hi> We are told of a great and mighty Saviour <hi>able to save to the utmost</hi> all that come to God by him: We heare of the most compassionate and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Promises</hi> that may be from the Truth it self, that <hi>Whosoever comes to him he will in no wise</hi> cast out; that <hi>They that believe on him, out of them should flow streams of living water:</hi> We hear of the most <hi>gracious invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> that Heaven can make to <hi>all weary and heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden</hi> sinners to come to Christ, that they may find rest: The great Secrets of Heaven and the <hi>Arcana</hi> of Divine Counsells are revealed, whereby we are acquainted that <hi>Glory to God in the highest, Peace on earth, Good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men,</hi> are sweetly joined together in Heavens harmony, and happily combin'd together in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of it's Ditties: That the <hi>Glory of the Deity</hi> and <hi>Salvation of men</hi> are not <hi>allaied</hi> by their union one with another, but both <hi>exalted</hi> together in the most tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent way, that Divine love and bounty are the supreme rulers in Heaven and Earth, <gap reason="foreign">

We are taught that <hi>the mild and gentle breathings of the Divine Spirit</hi> are moving


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:66374:196"/>
up and down in the World to produce life, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and quicken the Souls of men into a feeling sense of a blessed Immortality. This is that mighty Spirit that will, if we comply with it, <hi>teach us all things,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the hidden things of God; mortifie all the lusts of rebellious Flesh, and <hi>seal us up to the day of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi> We are taught that with all holy boldness we may <hi>in all places lift up holy hands to God, without wrath or doubting,</hi> without any sowre thoughts of God, or fretfull jealousies, or harsh surmises. We can never distrust enough in our selves, nor ever trust too much in God. This is the great <hi>Plerophory,</hi> and that full Confidence which the Gospel every where seems to promote: and should I run through all the Arguments and Solicitations that are there laid down, to provoke us to an entertainment hereof, I should then run quite through it from one end to another: it containing almost nothing else in the whole Complex and Body of it but <hi>strong and forcible Motives</hi> to all <hi>Ingenuous addresses</hi> to God, and the most effectual <hi>Encouragement</hi> that may be to <hi>all chearfull dependance</hi> on him, and <hi>confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of all assistance</hi> from him to carry on our poor endeavours to the atchievment of Blessedness, and that in the <hi>most plain</hi> and simple way that may be, <hi>sine fraude &amp; fuco,</hi> without any double mind or mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; Heaven is not acquainted so feelingly with our wicked arts and devices. But it is very strange that where God writes <hi>Life</hi> so plainly in fair Capital letters, we are so often apt to read <hi>Death;</hi> that when he tells us over and over, that Hell &amp; destruction arise from our selves, that they are the workmanship of our own hands, we will needs understand their Pedegree to be from Heaven, and that they were conceived in the Womb of Life and Blessedness. No, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel


<pb n="336" facs="tcp:66374:197"/>
tells us we are not come to <hi>Mounts of burning,</hi> nor unto <hi>blackness and darkness and tempest,</hi> &amp;c. Hebr. 12. v. 18. Certainly <hi>a lively Faith</hi> in this <hi>Love</hi> of God, and a sober converse with his <hi>Goodness</hi> by a cordial enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and through perswasion of it, would <hi>warm</hi> and chafe our benummed Minds, and <hi>thaw</hi> our Hearts frozen with <hi>Self-love;</hi> it would make us <hi>melt</hi> and dissolve out of all <hi>Self-consistencie,</hi> and by <hi>a free and noble Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> with the Divine love to yield up our selves to it, and dilate and spread our selves more fully in it. This would banish away all <hi>Atheisme</hi> and ireful slavish <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition;</hi> it would cast down every high thought and proud imagination that swells within us and exalts it self against this soveraign Deity; it would free us from all those poor, sorry, pinching and particular Loves that here inthrall the Souls of men to Vanity and Baseness; it would lead us into the true liberty of the sons of God, filling our Hearts once enlarged with the sense of it with <hi>a more generous and universal love,</hi> as unlimited and unbounded as true Goodness it self is. Thus <hi>Moses-</hi>like conversing with God in the Mount, and there beholding his glory shining thus out upon us in the face of Christ, we should be deriving a Copy of that Eternal beauty upon our own Souls, and our thirstie and hungry spirits would be perpetually suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a true participation and image of his glory. A true divine <hi>Love</hi> would wing our Souls, and make them take their flight swiftly towards Heaven and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. Could we once be throughly possess'd and mastered with a full confidence of the Divine love, and God's readiness to assist such feeble, languishing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as we are, in our assays after Heaven and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we should then, finding our selves borne up by an Eternal and Almighty strength, dare to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:66374:197"/>

A <note place="margin">John 7. 38.</note> truely-believing Soul by an ingenuous affiance in God and an eager thirst after him is alwaies sucking from the full breasts of the Divine love; thence it will not part, for there, and there only, is its life and nourishment; it starves and faints away with grief and hunger, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is pull'd away from thence; it is perpetually hanging upon the arms of Immortal Goodness, for there it finds its great strength lies; and as much as may be armes it self with the mighty Power of God, by which it goes forth like a Gyant refreshed with wine to run that race of Grace &amp; Holiness that leads to the true <hi>Elysium</hi> of Glory, and that heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> which is above. And whensoever it finds it self enfeebled in its difficult Conflict with those fierce and furious Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, those tall sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> which arising from our terrene and sensual affections doe here encounter it in the Wilderness of this world; then turning it self to God, and putting it self under the conduct of the Angel of his presence, it finds it self presently out of weakness to become strong, enabled from above to put to flight those mighty armies of the aliens.

When the Divinity united it self to Humane nature in the person of our Saviour, he then gave mankind a pledge and earnest of what he would further doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in assuring of it into as near a conjunction as might be with Himself, and in dispensing and communicating himself to Man in a way as far correspondent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable as might be to that first Copy. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are told of <hi>Christ being formed in us,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us; of our being made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to him, of having fellowship with him, of being as he was in this world, of living in him and his living in us, of dying, and rising again, and ascending with him into Heaven,</hi> and the like: because indeed the same Spirit that dwelt in him, derives it self in its mighty Virtue and Energy through all believing Souls, shaping them more and more into a just resemblance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie

                  <p>And according to this which hath been said I suppose we may fairly gloss upon S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Discourses which so much prefer <hi>Faith</hi> above <hi>Works.</hi> We must not think in a Gyant-like pride to scale the walls of Heaven by our own Works, and by force thereof to take the strong Fort of Blessedness, and wrest the Crown of Glory out of God's hands whether he will or no.

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An Appendix to the foregoing Discourse;</hi> How the whole business and Undertaking of Christ is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently available both to give full relief and ease to our Minds and Hearts, and also to encourage us to Godliness or a God-like righteousness, <hi>briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in sundry Particulars.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FOR the further illustration of some things especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the latter part of this Discourse, it may not be amiss in some Particulars (which might easily be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged) to shew <hi>How the Undertaking of Christ</hi> (that Great Object of Faith) <hi>is greatly advantageous and available to the giving full relief and ease to our Minds and Hearts, and also to the encouraging us to Godliness, or a true God-like righteousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the General therefore we may consider, That full and evident assurance is given hereby to the world, <hi>That God doth indeed seek the saving of that which is lost;</hi> and men are no longer to make any doubt or scruple of it. Now what can we imagine more avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to carry on a Designe of Godliness, and to rouze dul and languid Souls to an effectual minding of their own Salvation, then to have this News sounding in their Ears by men that (at the first promulgation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) durst tell them roundly in the Name of God, that God required them every where to repent, for that his Kingdome of grace was now apparent; and that he was not only willing, but it was his gracious designe to save &amp; recover lost Sinners who had forsaken his Goodness?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:66374:201"/>
Particularly, That the whole business of Christ is very advantageous for this purpose, and highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate thereto, may appear thus:</p>
                  <p>We are fully assured that God hath this forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <note place="margin">1.</note> designe upon lost men, because here is one <hi>(viz.</hi> Christ) that partakes every way of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> whom the Divinity magnifies it self in, and carries through this world in Humane infirmities and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to Eternal glory: a clear manifestation to the World that God had not cast off <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> but had a real mind to exalt and dignifie it again.</p>
                  <p>The way into the Holy of holies or to Eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness <note place="margin">2.</note> is laid as open as may be by Christ, in his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Life,</hi> and <hi>Death:</hi> in all which we may see with open face what <hi>Humane Nature</hi> may attain to, and how it may by <hi>Humility, Self-denial</hi> and <hi>divine Love,</hi> a Christ-like life, rise up above all visible heavens into a state of Immortal glory and bliss.</p>
                  <p>Here is a manifestation of <hi>Love</hi> given, enough to <hi>thaw</hi> all the <hi>iciness</hi> of mens hearts which <hi>Self-love</hi> had <note place="margin">3.</note> quite frozen up: For here is One who in <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> most heartily every where denying himself, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to doe any thing for the good of Mankind, and at last gives up his life for the same pupose; and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good will and pleasure of that Eternal love which <hi>so loved the World, that he gave</hi> this belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and <hi>his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas every <hi>Penitent</hi> Sinner carries <hi>a sense of Guilt</hi> upon his own Conscience, is apt to <hi>shrink</hi> with <note place="margin">4.</note> cold chill fears of offended Majesty, and to <hi>dread</hi> the thoughts of violated Justice: He is assured that Christ hath laid down his life, and thereby made propitiation &amp; atonement for sin; That He hath laid down his life for


<pb n="345" facs="tcp:66374:201"/>
the Redemption of him; and so in <hi>Christ we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his bloud, even the forgiveness of sins.</hi> Thus may the Hearts of all Penitents, troubled at first with sense of their own guilt, be <hi>quieted,</hi> and fully establisht in a living Faith and Hope in an Eternal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; seeing how their Sins are remitted through the bloud of Jesus that came to die for them and save them, and through his bloud they may have free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess unto God.</p>
                  <p>Seeing <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Guilt</hi> are apt continually to beget a <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>jealousie</hi> of God's Majesty and Greatness, from whom the Sinner finds himself at a vast distance, he is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a <hi>Mediator</hi> through whom he may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress himself to God without this <hi>jealousie</hi> or <hi>doubting;</hi> for that this <hi>Mediator</hi> likewise is <hi>one of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that is highly beloved and accepted of God, he having so highly pleased God by performing his Will in all things. Certainly it is very decorous and much <hi>for the Ease of a Penitent's mind,</hi> (as it makes also <hi>for the disparagement of Sin)</hi> that our Addresses to God should be through a Mediator. The <hi>Platonists</hi> wisely observ'd that between the Pure Divinity and Impure Sinners as there is no Union, so no Communion: it is very agreeable every way and upon all accounts, that they who in themselves are altogether unworthy and under demerit, should come to God by a Mediator.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Scripture every where seems to represent and hold forth Christ in the forenamed Particulars, (without descending into Niceties and Subtilties, such as the School-men and others from them have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the World with) in a very full and ample manner, that so the Minds of true Believers (that are willing to comply with the Purpose of God for their own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal peace) might in all Cases find something in


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:66374:202"/>
Christ for their <hi>relief,</hi> and make use of him as much as may be to encourage and help on Godliness: for by this whole Undertaking of Christ manifested in the Gospel God would have to be understood <hi>Full relief of Mind and Ease of Conscience,</hi> as also <hi>all Encouragement to Godliness,</hi> and <hi>Disparagement of Sin.</hi> And indeed the whole business of Christ is <hi>the greatest Blow to Sin</hi> that may be; For the World is taught hereby, that there is no Sinning upon cheap and easie terms: men may see that God will not return so easily into favour with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but he will have his Righteousness acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and likewise their own Demerit. And this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment he is once indeed pleased to accept of in the person of our Saviour: yet if men will not now turn to him, and accept his favour, they must know that there is no other Sacrifice for Sin.</p>
                  <p>By these Particulars we have briefly touch'd upon (to name no more) it may appear, That when we look into the Gospel, we are taught to believe that Christ hath done, according to the good pleasure of God, every thing for us that <hi>may truly relieve our Minds,</hi> and <hi>encourage us to Godliness,</hi> a God-like Righteousness far exceeding the righteousness of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees.</p>

fill both the scales of the Divine ballance; I have no Evil deeds to weigh against them: what therefore can I want of the end and scope of the Divine Law, which is to make men perfect, seeing I have guided my whole life from my youth up by the Precepts of it? To which our Saviour replies; <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</hi> Which words I can neither think to be spoken as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silium perfectionis</hi> in the Papal sense, nor yet only as a <hi>particular and special Precept;</hi> but rather by way of Conviction: So that the full sense and importance of our Saviours speech seems to be this, viz. A mere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the <hi>Outward</hi> man to the Law of God is not sufficient to bring a man to Eternal life; but the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> man also must deeply receive in the stamp and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Divine Law, so as to be made <hi>like to God.</hi> True Perfection is not consistent with any Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene loves or Worldly affections: This Mundane life and spirit which acts so strongly and impetuously in this lower world, must be crucified: The Soul must be wholly dissolved from this Earthy body which it is so deeply immerst in, while it endeavours to enlarge its sorry Tabernacle upon this material Globe, and by a holy abstraction from all things that pinion it to Mortality, withdraw it self and retire into a Divine so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.

that God justified him as much as he did himself.</p>
                  <p>It was a vulgar Rule given by the Jewish Doctors, which I fear too many live by, <hi>That men should single out some one Commandement out of Gods law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in especially exercise themselves, that so they might make God their friend by that, lest in others they should too much displease him.</hi> Thus men are content <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, to pay God their <hi>Decimae,</hi> and <hi>Septimae</hi> of their lives too, if need be, so that they may without fear of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, or purloining, as they suppose, from him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the rest to themselves: But they are not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to consecrate their <hi>whole lives</hi> to him, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid lest Religion should incroach too much upon them, and too busily invade their own rights and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, as their Selfish Spirit calls them.</p>
                  <p>There are such that it may be think themselves will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God should have his due, so be it he will also let them enjoy their own without any lett or molestation; but they are very jealous lest he should incroach too much upon them, and are carefull to maintain a <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> with Heaven it self, and to set bounds to God's prerogative over them, lest it should swell too much, and grow too mighty for them to maintain their own Priviledges under it. They would fain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand themselves to be <hi>free-born</hi> under the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God himself, and therefore ought not to be compelled to yield obedience to any such laws of his as their own private seditious Lusts and Passions will not suffer them to give their consent unto.</p>
                  <p>There be such who perswade themselves they are well-affected to God, and willing to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, but yet think they must not be uncivil to the World; nor so base and cowardly as not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own credit and reputation, with a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge

upon those that seem to impair it; or so much forget themselves, as not to comply with the guise and fashion of this world so far as it may make for their own emolument or preferment. Such as these, that are no fast friends to Religion, can easily find some Postern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore to slip out by into this World: and while they either doe some constant homage to Heaven in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and performance of some Duties of Religion, or abstain from such Vices as the common opinions of men brand with infamie, or can fansie themselves to be marked out with some of those Characters which they have learned from Books or Pulpit-discourses to be the <hi>Notes of God's Children</hi> and justified persons; they grow big with <hi>Self-conceit,</hi> and can easily find out some handsome piece of Sophistry and cunning Topick to delude themselves by, in indulging some beloved Lust or other: They can sometimes beat down the price of other mens religion, to inhance the value of their own; or it may be by a burning and fiery zeal against the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and deportments of others that are not of their own Sect, they may loose the sense of all their own guiltiness. The Disciples themselves had almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten <hi>the mild and gentle Spirit of Religion,</hi> in an over-hasty heat calling for Fire down from heaven upon those whom they deemed their Master's enemies.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a <hi>Partial</hi> spirit in Religion, that spends it self only in some Particulars, mistakes the fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of Good nature for the true face of Vertue; and a good Bodily temperament will serve it, as a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering glass, to bestow beauty upon a deformed and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen Mind, that it may seem vertuous. But it is not a true Spirit of Religion, whatsoever those wanton wits may call it, that is thus <hi>Particular</hi> and <hi>confin'd.</hi> No, that is of a subtile and working nature, it will be search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Sin and Grace cannot lodge together, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not divide and share out between them two several Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in one Soul.</p>
                  <p>What is commonly said of <hi>Truth</hi> in general, we may say more especially of true Goodness, <hi>magna est, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valebit:</hi> it will lodge in the Souls of men, like that mighty, though gentle, Heat which is entertained in the Heart, that alwaies dispenseth warm Bloud and Spirits to all the members in the Body: it will not suffer any other Interest to grow by it: it will be so absolute as to swallow up all our carnal freedom, and crush down all our fleshly liberty: as <hi>Moses</hi> his Serpent did eate up all the Serpents of the Egyptian Magicians, so will it devour all that viperous brood of iniquity, which our Magical Self-will by her witchcraft and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments begets within us: like a strong and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Flame within us, it will not only singe the hair, or scorch and blister the skin, but it will go on to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume this whole Body of death: it is compared by our Saviour to <hi>Leaven</hi> that will ferment the whole mass in which it is wrap'd up: it will enter into us like the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finer's fire,</hi> and the <hi>Fuller's Soape:</hi> like the Angel of God's presence that he promised to send along with the Israelites in their journy to <hi>Canaan,</hi> it will not pardon our iniquities, nor indulge any darling lust whatsoever: it will narrowly pry into all our actions, and be spying out all those back-waies and dores whereby Sin and Vice may enter.</p>
                  <p>That Religion that runs out only in <hi>Particularities,</hi> and is overswayed by the prevailing power of any Lust, is but only a dead carkass, and not indeed that

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:66374:208"/>
only with the <hi>Circumference</hi> and Outside of men, it only lodges in the suburbs and storms the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, but enters not the main Fort of mens Souls, which is strongly defended by <hi>inward Pride, Self-will, particular and mundane Loves, fretting and self-consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Envy, Popularity and Vain-glory,</hi> and such other <hi>Mental vices,</hi> that when they are beaten out of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble behaviours and conversations of men by Divine threats or promises (which may be too potent to be controll'd) retreat and secure themselves here as in a strong Castle. There may be many who dare not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue <hi>Revenge,</hi> and yet are not willing to <hi>forgive inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> who dare not <hi>murther</hi> their enemy, that yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>love him;</hi> who dare not seek for preferment by <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> who yet are not mortified to these and many other mundane and base-born affections: they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that the Divine prerogative should extend it self beyond the <hi>Outward</hi> man, and that Religion should be too busie with their <hi>Inward</hi> thoughts and passions: if they may not by proud boasting set off their own sorry commodities <hi>upon the publick stage,</hi> and there read out their own Panegyricks; yet they will <hi>inwardly applaud</hi> themselves, and commit wanton dalliance with their own Parts and Perfections; and not feeling the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of any Higher good, they will endeavour to preserve an unhallowed Autaesthesie and feeling sense of themselves; and by a sullen melancholy Stoicisme, when Religion would deprive and bereave them of the sinfull glory and pleasures of this Outward world, they then retire and shrink themselves up into a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> of their own, they collect and contract themselves into themselves. Thus when this <hi>low life</hi> of mens Souls is chased out of the <hi>External</hi> vices and vanities of this World by the chastisements of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,


<pb n="359" facs="tcp:66374:208"/>
or many times by bodily oppressions, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently retires into it self, and by a <hi>Self-feeling</hi> begins more to grasp and dearly embrace it self. When these External loves begin to be starved and cooled, yet men may then fall into love with and courting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by <hi>Arrogancy, Self-confidence and dependence, Self-applause and gratulations, Admiration of their own perfections;</hi> and so feed that <hi>dying life</hi> of theirs with this <hi>Speculative wantonness,</hi> that it may as strongly express it self <hi>within</hi> them, as before it did <hi>without</hi> themselves. Men may by inward braving of themselves sacrilegiously steal God's glory from him, and erect a Self-supremacy within, exerting it self in Self-will and particular loves, and so become Corrivals with God for the Crown of Blessedness and Self-sufficiency, as I doubt many of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> endeavoured with a Giant-like ambition to doe.</p>
                  <p>But alas, I doubt we generally arrive not to this pitch of Religion, to deny the world, and all the pomp and glory of this largely-extended train of Vanity; but we easily content our selves with some <hi>External</hi> forms of Religion. We are too apt to look at a garish dress and attire of Religion, or to be enamoured rather with some more specious and seemingly-spiritual Forms, then with the true Spirit &amp; Power of Godliness &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it self. We are more taken commonly with the several new fashions that the luxuriant Fancies of men are apt to contrive for it, then with the real power and simplicity thereof: and while we think our selves to be growing in our knowledge, and moving on towards a state of <hi>Perfection,</hi> we do but turn up and down from one kind of <hi>Form</hi> to another; we are as apt still to draw it down into as low, worldly and mundane Rites and Ordinances, as ever it was before our Saviour made

that glorious Reformation therein, which took away these Material crutches made up of carnal Observances which Earthly minds lean so much upon, and are fain to underprop their Religion with, which else would tumble down and fall to nothing: except we can cast it into such a certain <hi>Set of duties</hi> and <hi>System of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that we may see it altogether from one end to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we are afraid lest it should become too abstruse a thing and vanish away from us.</p>
                  <p>I would not be misunderstood to speak against those <hi>Duties</hi> &amp; <hi>Ordinances</hi> which are necessary means appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to promote us in the waies of Piety: But I fear we are too apt to sink all our Religion into these, and so to embody it, that we may as it were touch and feel it, because we are so little acquainted with the high and spiritual nature of it, which is too subtile for gross and carnal minds to converse with. I fear our vulgar sort of Christians are wont so to look upon such kind of <hi>Models</hi> of Divinity and Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, which were intended to help our dul minds to a more lively sense of God and true Goodness, as those things that claim the whole of their Religion: and therefore are too apt to think themselves absolved from it, except at some solemn times of more especial addresses to God; and that this wedding garment of holy Thoughts and divine Affections is not for every days wearing, but only then to be put on when we come to the Marriage-feast and Festivals of Heaven; as if Religion were fast lock'd and bound up in some sacred Solemnities, and so incarcerated and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into some divine Mysteries, as the superstitious Heathen of old thought, that it might not stir abroad and wander too far out of these hallowed Cloisters, and grow too busie with us in our Secular imploiments.

We have learned to distinguish too subtily I doubt in our lives and conversations <hi>inter sacrum &amp; profanum,</hi> our <hi>Religious</hi> approaches to God and our <hi>Worldly</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. I know our conversation and demeanour in this world is not, nor can well be, all of a piece, and there will be several degrees of Sanctity in the lives of the best men, as there were once in the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but yet I think a Good man should alwaies find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon <hi>Holy ground,</hi> and never depart so far into the affairs of this life, as to be without either the call or compass of Religion; he should alwaies think where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he is, <hi>etiam ibi Dii sunt,</hi> that God and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Angels are there, with whom he should converse in a way of Puritie. We must not think that Religion serves to paint our Faces, to reform our Looks, or only to inform our Heads, or instruct and tune our Tongues; no, nor only to tie our Hands, and make our <hi>Outward</hi> man more demure, and bring our Bodies and bodily actions into a better <hi>decorum:</hi> But its main business is to purge and reform our <hi>Hearts</hi> and all the Elicit actions and motions thereof.

having no inward sense of his <hi>Loveliness,</hi> yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but <hi>serve</hi> him so far as these rigorous apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lie upon them; though notwithstanding such as these are very apt to perswade themselves that they may pacifie him and purchase his favour with some <hi>cheap services,</hi> as if Heaven it self could become guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Bribery,</hi> and an <hi>Immutable Justice</hi> be flattered into <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Respect of persons.</hi> Because they are not acquainted with God, and know him not as he is in himself, therefore they are ready to paint him forth to themselves in their own shape: and because they themselves are full of <hi>Peevishness</hi> and <hi>Self-will,</hi> arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily imposing and prescribing to others without suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence of Reason, and are easily inticed by <hi>Flatteries;</hi> they are apt to represent the Divinity also to themselves in the same form, and think they view the true pourtraiture and draught of their own Genius in it; and therefore that they might please this angry Deity of their own making, they care not sometimes to be <hi>lavish</hi> in such a kind of <hi>Service</hi> of him as doth <hi>not much pinch</hi> their own <hi>corruptions;</hi> nay and it may be too, will seem to part with them sometimes, and give them a weeping farewel, if God and their own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened Consciences seem to frown upon them; though all their <hi>Obedience</hi> arise from nothing else but the <hi>Compulsions</hi> and necessities which their own <hi>sowre and dreadfull apprehensions</hi> of God lay upon them: and therefore in those things which <hi>more nearly touch</hi> their own beloved <hi>Lusts,</hi> they will be as <hi>scant</hi> and <hi>sparing</hi> as may be; here they will be as <hi>strict</hi> with God as may be, that he may have no more then his due, as they think, like that <hi>Unprofitable servant</hi> in the Gospel, that, because his Master was <hi>an austere man,</hi> reaping where he had not sown, and gathering where he had


<pb n="364" facs="tcp:66374:211"/>
not scattered, was content and willing he should have his own again, but would not suffer him to have any more.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Servile spirit</hi> in Religion is alwaies <hi>illiberal</hi> and <hi>needy</hi> in the <hi>Magnalia Legis,</hi> the great and weightier matters of Religion, and here weighs out <hi>Obedience</hi> by drams and scruples: it never finds it self more shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd and shrunk up, then when it is to converse with God; like those creatures that are generated of slime and mud, the more the Summer-sun shines upon them, and the nearer it comes to them, the more is all their vital strength dried up and spent away: their <hi>dreadfull thoughts of God,</hi> like a cold Eastern wind, blasts all their blossoming affections, and nips them in the bud: these exhaust their native vigour, and make them weak and sluggish in all their motions toward God. Their Religion is rather <hi>a Prison</hi> or <hi>a piece of Penance</hi> to them, then any <hi>voluntary and free compliance</hi> of their Souls with the Divine will: and yet because they bear the burden and heat of the day, they think, when the evening comes, they ought to be more liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; such <hi>slavish spirits</hi> being ever apt inwardly to conceit that Heaven receives some emolument or other by their hard labours, and so becomes indebted to them, because they see no true gain and comfort accruing from them to their own Souls; and so because they doe God's work and not their own, they think they may reasonably expect a fair compensation, as having been profitable to him. And this I doubt was the first and vulgar foundation of <hi>Merit:</hi> though now the world is ashamed to own it.</p>
                  <p>But alas, such an ungodlike Religion as this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be owned by God: the Bond-woman and her son must be cast out. The Spirit of true Religion is of


<pb n="365" facs="tcp:66374:211"/>
a more <hi>free, noble, ingenuous</hi> and <hi>generous nature,</hi> arising out of the warm beams of the Divine love which first hatch'd it and brought it forth, and therefore is it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards perpetually bathing it self in that sweetest love that first begot it, and is alwaies refresh'd and nourish'd by it. This <hi>Love casteth out fear, fear which hath torment in it,</hi> and is therefore more apt to chase away Souls once wounded with it from God, rather then to allure them to God. <hi>Such fear</hi> of God alwaies carries in it a secret <hi>Antipathy</hi> against him, as being <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaks, one that is so troublesome that there is no quiet or peaceable living with him. Whereas <hi>Love</hi> by a strong <hi>Sympathy</hi> draws the Souls of men, when it hath once laid hold upon them by its powerfull insinuation, into the nearest conjunction that may be with the Divinity; it <hi>thaws</hi> all those <hi>frozen</hi> affections which a <hi>Slavish fear</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed and lock'd up, and makes the Soul most chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, free, and nobly resolved in all its motions after God. It was well observed of old by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>we are never so well as when we approach to God;</hi> when in a way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion we make our addresses to God, then are our Souls most chearfull. True Religion and an Inward acquaintance with God discovers nothing in him but <hi>pure and sincere Goodness,</hi> nothing that might breed the least distaste or disaffection, or carry in it any sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of <hi>displeasingness;</hi> and therefore the Souls of good men are never <hi>pinching</hi> and <hi>sparing</hi> in their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: then the Torrent is most full and swells high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, when it empties it self into this unbounded Ocean of the Divine Being. This makes all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God light and easie and far from being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. There needs no <note n="*" place="margin">Quis legem det amantibus? Major Lex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor est sibi. <hi>Boetius l. 3. de Consol. Philos.</hi>

the true spirit of <hi>divine love</hi> to serve God or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his Will. It is the choice of such a Soul to endeavour to conform it self to him, and draw from him as much as may be an Imitation of that Goodness and Perfection which it finds in him. Such a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an does not therefore obey his Commands only because it is God's Will he should doe so, but because he sees the <hi>Law</hi> of God to be truly <hi>perfect,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> speaks: his nature being reconciled to God finds it all <hi>holy, just and good,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, and such a thing as his Soul loves, <hi>sweeter then the honey or the honey-combe;</hi> and he makes it <hi>his meat and drink to doe the Will of God,</hi> as our Lord and Saviour did.

                  <p>THE Fourth and last Particular wherein men mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge <note place="margin">4.</note> themselves, is, <hi>When a mere Mechanical and Artificial Religion is taken for that which is a true Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Heaven upon the Souls of men, and which moves like an Inward nature.</hi> True Religion will not stoop to Rules of <hi>Art,</hi> nor be confin'd within the narrow compass thereof: No, where it is, we may cry out with the Greek Philosopher, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> God hath there kindled as it were his own Life which will move and act only according to the Laws of Heaven. But there are some <hi>Mechanical</hi> Christians that can frame and fashion out Religion so cunningly in their own Souls by that <hi>Book-skill</hi> they have got of it, that it may many times deceive themselves, as if it were <hi>a true living thing.</hi> We often hear that mere Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Religion may go as far in all the <hi>External</hi> acts of it as those that are best acquainted with it: I doubt not also but many times there may be <hi>Artificial imitations</hi> drawn of that which only lives in the Souls of good Men, by the powerful and wily Magick of exalted <hi>Fancies;</hi> as we read of some Artificers that have made such Images of living creatures, wherein they have not only drawn forth <hi>the outward shape,</hi> but seem almost to have copied out <hi>the life</hi> too in them. Men may make an <hi>Imitation</hi> as well of those things which we call the <hi>Internals</hi> of Religion, as of the <hi>Externals.</hi> There may be a <hi>Semblance</hi> of <hi>inward Joy</hi> in God, of <hi>Love</hi> to him and his Precepts, of <hi>Dependance</hi> upon him, and a <hi>filial Reverence</hi> of him; which by the contrivance and power of <hi>Fancie</hi> may be represented in a Masque


<pb n="368" facs="tcp:66374:213"/>
upon the Stage of the Animal part of a mans Soul. Those Christians that fetch all their Religion from pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Books and Discourses, hearing of such and such <hi>Signs of Grace</hi> and Evidences of Salvation, and being taught to believe they must get those, that so they may go to Heaven; may presently begin to set themselves on work, and in an Apish imitation cause their <hi>Animal Powers</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> to represent all these; and <hi>Fancie</hi> being well acquainted with all those several <hi>Affections</hi> in the Soul that at any time express themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Outward things, may, by the power it hath over the <hi>Passions,</hi> call them all forth in the same Mode and fashion, &amp; then conjoin with them some Thoughts of God and Divine things, which may serve thus put together for a handsome Artifice of Religion wherein these Mechanicks may much applaud themselves.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but there may be such who to gain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with themselves, and that <hi>glorious name</hi> of being <hi>the Children of God</hi> (though they know nothing more of it but that it is a Title that sounds well) would use their best skill to appear such to themselves, so qualified and molded as they are told they must be. And as many times <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> among men may make them pare off the <hi>Ruggedness</hi> of their <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> man, and <hi>polish</hi> that; so to gain their own good opinion, and a reputation with their own Consciences which look more inwardly, they may also endeavour to make their <hi>Inward</hi> man look at some times more <hi>smooth</hi> and comely: and it is no hard matter for such <hi>Chamaeleon-</hi>like Christians to turn even their insides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whatsoever hue and colour shall best please them, and then <hi>Narcissus-</hi>like to fall in love with themselves: a strong and nimble <hi>Fancie</hi> having such command over the <hi>Animal spirits,</hi> that it can send them forth in full


<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66374:213"/>
troops which way soever it pleaseth, and by their aide call forth and raise any kind of <hi>Passion</hi> it listeth, and when it listeth allay it again, as the Poets say <hi>Aeolus</hi> can doe with the Winds. As they say of the force of <hi>Imagination,</hi> that <hi>Vis Imaginativa signat foetum;</hi> so <hi>Imagination</hi> may stamp any Idea that it finds within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the <hi>Passions,</hi> and turn them as it pleases to what Seal it will set upon them, and mold them into any likeness; and a man looking down and taking a view of the Plot as it is acted upon the Stage of the Animal powers, may like and approve it as a true Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Religion. Thus may they easily deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and think their Religion to be some Mighty thing <hi>within</hi> them, that runs quite through them and makes all these transformations within them; whereas the <hi>Rise</hi> and Motion of it may be all in the <hi>Animal</hi> and Sensitive powers of the Soul; and a wise observer of it may see whence it comes and whither it goes: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed a thing which is <hi>from the earth, earthy,</hi> and not like that true Spirit of Regeneration which comes from Heaven, and begets a Divine life in the Souls of good men, and is not under the command of any such Charms as these are, neither will it move according to those Laws, and Times, and Measures that we please to set to it: but we shall find it manifesting its mighty su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy over the Highest powers of our Souls. Whereas we may truly say of all <hi>Mechanicks</hi> in Religion, and our <hi>Mimical</hi> Christians, that <hi>they are not so much actuated and informed by their Religion, as they inform that;</hi> the power of their own <hi>Imagination</hi> deriving that <hi>Force</hi> to it which bears it up and guides all its motions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And therefore they themselves having the power over it, can new mold it as themselves, please, according to any new Pattern which shall like them


<pb n="370" facs="tcp:66374:214"/>
better then the former: they can furnish this dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Scene of theirs with any kind of matter which the history of other mens religion may afford them; and if need be, act over all the Experiences of that sect of men to which they most addict themselves so to the life, that they may seem to themselves as well experienc'd Christians as any others; and so, it may be, soar so aloft in <hi>Self-conceit,</hi> as if they had already made their nests amongst the stars, and had viewed their own mansion in Heaven. What was observed by the <hi>Stoick</hi> concerning the vulgar sort of men, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, may as truly be said of this sort of Christians, their life is nothing else but a strong Energy of Fancy and Opinion.</p>
                  <p>But besides, lest their Religion might too grosly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it self to be nothing else but <hi>a piece of Art,</hi> there may be sometimes such Extraordinary motions stirred up within them which may prevent all their own Thoughts, that they may seem to be a true operation of the Divine life; when yet all this is nothing else but the Energy of their own <hi>Self-love</hi> touch'd with some Fleshly apprehensions of Divine things, and excited by them. There are such things in our Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, when a Carnal and unhallowed mind takes the Chair and gets the expounding of them, may seem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delicious to the fleshly appetites of men: Some do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and notions of Free-Grace and Justification; the magnificent Titles of <hi>Sons of God</hi> and Heirs of Heaven; ever-flowing streams of Joy and Pleasure that blessed Souls shall swim in to all eternity; a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Paradise in the world to come, alway springing up with well-sented and fragrant Beauties; a New <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> paved with Gold and bespangled with Stars, comprehending in its vast circuit such numberless vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,


<pb n="371" facs="tcp:66374:214"/>
that a busie curiosity may spend it self about to all eternity. I doubt not but that sometimes the most flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; earthly men, that fly their ambition to the pomp of this world, may be so ravish'd with the conceits of such things as these, that they may seem to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of <hi>the powers of the world to come;</hi> I doubt not but that they may be as much exalted with them, as the Souls of crazed and distracted persons seem to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when their <hi>Fancies</hi> play with those quick and nimble Spirits which a distempered frame of Body and unnatural heat in their Heads beget within them. Thus may these blazing Comets rise up above the Moon, and climbe higher then the Sun; which yet, because they have no solid consistencie of their own, and are of a base and earthly allay, will soon vanish and fall down again, being only born up by an External force. They may seem to themselves to have attain'd higher then those <hi>noble Christians</hi> that are <hi>gently mov'd</hi> by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force of true Goodness; they may seem to be <hi>ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niores Deo</hi> then those that are really inform'd and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the Divine Spirit, and do move on steddily and constantly in the way towards Heaven; as the <hi>Seed</hi> that was sown in <hi>the thorny</hi> ground, grew up and lengthened out its blade faster then that which was sown in <hi>the good</hi> and fruitfull soil. And as the Motions of our <hi>Sense, Fancy</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> while our Souls are in this mortal condition sunk down deeply into the Body, are many times more vigorous and make stronger impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions upon us then those of the <hi>Higher powers</hi> of the Soul, which are more subtile and remote from these mixt and Animal perceptions; that Devotion which is there seated may seem to have more Energy and life in it then that which gently and with a more delicate kind of touch spreads it self upon the <hi>Understanding,</hi> and


<pb n="372" facs="tcp:66374:215"/>
from thence mildly derives it self through our <hi>Wills</hi> &amp; <hi>Affections.</hi> But howsoever the <hi>Former</hi> may be <hi>more boisterous</hi> for a time, yet <hi>This</hi> is of a <hi>more consistent, sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and thriving nature:</hi> For that proceeding indeed from nothing else but a Sensual and Fleshly apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God and true Happiness, is but of a flitting and fading nature; and as the Sensible powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties grow more languid, or the Sun of Divine light shines more brightly upon us, these earthly devotions like our Culinary fires will abate their heat and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But a true Celestial warmth will never be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd, because it is of an Immortal nature; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once seated vitally in the Souls of men, it will regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and order all the motions of it in a due manner, as the natural Heat radicated in the Hearts of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hath the dominion and Oeconomy of the whole Body under it, and sends forth warm Bloud and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Vital nourishment to every part and member of it. True Religion is <hi>no piece of artifice;</hi> it is no boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up of our <hi>Imaginative</hi> powers nor the glowing heats of <hi>Passion;</hi> though these are too often mistaken for it, when in our juglings in Religion we cast a mist before our own eyes: But it is <hi>a new Nature</hi> informing the Souls of men; it is <hi>a God-like frame of Spirit,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it self most of all <hi>in Serene and Clear minds, in deep Humility, Meekness, Self-denial, Universal love of God and all true Goodness, without Partiality and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hypocrisie;</hi> whereby we are taught to <hi>know</hi> God, and knowing him to <hi>love</hi> him, and <hi>conform</hi> our selves as much as may be to all that Perfection which shines forth in him.</p>

But when Wisdom once displays its own excellencies and glories in a purified Soul, it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained there with the greatest love and delight, and receives its own image reflected back to it self in sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est returns of Love and Praise.

Which method of delivering Divine doctrine (not to mention the Writings of the ancient Philosophers) we find frequently pursued in the Holy Scripture, thereby <hi>both opening and hiding</hi> at once the Truth which is offered to us. A <hi>Proverb</hi> or <hi>Parable</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once unfolded, by reason of its <hi>affinity</hi> with the <hi>Phancy,</hi> the more sweetly insinuates it self into that, and is from thence with the greater advantage transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Understanding.</hi> In this state we are not able to behold <hi>Truth</hi> in its own Native beauty and lustre; but while we are <hi>vail'd</hi> with mortality, <hi>Truth</hi> must <hi>vail</hi> it self too, that it may the more freely converse with us.

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Nobleness of Religion in regard of its Original and Fountain:</hi> it comes from Heaven and moves towards Heaven again. God the First Excellency and Primitive Perfection. All Perfections and Excellencies in any kind are to be measured by their approach to, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of, the First Perfection. Religion the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Participation of God: none capable of this Divine Communication but the Highest of created Beings: and consequently Religion is the greatest Excellency. A twofold Fountain in God whence Religion flowes, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. His Nature. 2. His Will. Of Truth Natural and Revealed. Of an Outward and Inward Revelation of God's Will.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE begin with the First, viz. <hi>True Religion is a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>Noble thing in its Rise and Original, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its Descent.</hi> True Religion derives its pedigree from Heaven, is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> it comes from Heaven, and constantly moves toward Heaven again: it's a Beam from God, as <hi>every good and perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning,</hi> as S. <hi>James</hi> speaks. God is the <hi>First Truth</hi> and <hi>Primitive Goodness:</hi> True <hi>Religion</hi> is a vigorous <hi>Efflux</hi> and <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of <hi>Both</hi> upon the Spirits of men, and therefore is called <note n="*" place="margin">2 Peter 1.</note> 
                     <hi>a participation of the divine Nature.</hi> Indeed God hath copyed out himself in all created Being, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other Pattern to frame any thing by but his own Essence; so that all created Being is <hi>umbratilis similitudo entis increati,</hi> and is, by some stamp or other


<pb n="381" facs="tcp:66374:219"/>
of God upon it, at least remotely allied to him: But <hi>True Religion</hi> is such a Communication of the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as none but the Highest of created Beings are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. On the other side <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi> is of the <hi>basest and lowest Original,</hi> as being nothing else but a perfect degeneration from God and those <hi>Eternal Rules of Goodness</hi> which are derived from him. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is an <hi>Heaven-born</hi> thing, <hi>the Seed of God</hi> in the Spirits of men, whereby they are formed to a similitude &amp; likeness of himself. A true Christian is every way of a most noble Extraction, of an heavenly and divine pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree, being born <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>from above,</hi> as it is express'd <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. The line of all earthly Nobility, if it were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the beginning, would lead to <hi>Adam,</hi> where all the lines of descent meet in One; and the Root of all Extractions would be found planted in nothing else but <note n="*" place="margin">Genesis 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Adamah,</hi> red Earth: But a Christian derives his line from Christ, who is the Only-begotten Son of God, <hi>the shining forth of his glory, and the Character of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> as he is stiled <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. We may truly say of Christ and Christians, as <hi>Zebah</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi> said of <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s brethren, <hi>As he is, so are they</hi> (according to their <note place="margin">Judges 8.</note> capacity,) <hi>each one resembling the children of a king.</hi> Titles of Worldly honour in Heavens heraldry are but only <hi>Tituli nominales;</hi> but Titles of Divine dignity signify some Real thing, some Real and Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications to the Spirits and Minds of men. All Perfections and Excellencies in any kind are to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by their approach to that Primitive Perfection of all, God himself; and therefore Participation of the Divine nature cannot but entitle a Christian to the highest degree of dignity: <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sons of God,</hi> 1 Jo. 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:66374:220"/>
Thus much for a more <hi>general</hi> discovery of <hi>the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of Religion</hi> as to its Fountain and Original; We may further and more <hi>particularly</hi> take notice of this in reference to that <hi>Twofold fountain</hi> in God, from whence all true Religion flows and issues forth, viz. 1. <hi>His Immutable Nature. 2. His Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Immutable Nature of God.</hi> From thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise all those <hi>Eternal Rules of Truth and Goodness</hi> which are the Foundation of all Religion, and which God at the first Creation folded up in the Soul of man. These we may call the <hi>Truths of Natural inscription;</hi> understanding hereby either those <hi>Fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of Truth which Reason by a naked intuition may behold in God, or those necessary <hi>Corollaries</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi> that may be drawn from thence. I cannot think it so proper to say, That God ought infinitely to be loved because he <hi>commands</hi> it, as because he is indeed an <hi>Infinite and Unchangeable Goodness.</hi> God hath stamp'd a Copy of his own Archetypal Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon the Soul, that man by reflecting into himself might behold there the glory of God, <hi>intra se videre De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> see within his Soul all those Ideas of Truth which concern the Nature and Essence of God, by reason of its own resemblance of God; and so beget within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the most free and generous motions of Love to God. Reason in man being <hi>Lumen de Lumine,</hi> a Light flowing from the Fountain and Father of Lights, and being, as <hi>Tully</hi> phraseth it, <hi>participata similitudo Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis aternae</hi> (as the Law of Nature, the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the Law written in mans Heart, is <hi>participatio Legis aternae in Rationali creatura)</hi> it was to enable Man to work out of himself all those Notions of God which are the true Ground-work of Love and Obedience to God, and conformity to him: and in modling the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                     </gap>, <hi>None,</hi> neither Angel nor Man, could know the Mind of God, could unlock the Breast of God, or search out the Counsels of his Will. But God out of the infinite riches of his Compassions toward mankind is pleas'd to unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som his Secrets, and most clearly to manifest <hi>the way</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hebrews 9. 2 Timothy 1.</note> 
                     <hi>into the Holiest of all,</hi> and <hi>bring to light life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> and in these last ages to send his Son, who lay in his bosom from all Eternity, to teach us his Will and declare his Mind to us.

darkness and the shadow of death, <hi>to guide our feet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But besides this <hi>Outward revelation of God's will to men,</hi> there is also an <hi>Inward impression</hi> of it on their Minds and Spirits, which is in a more special manner attributed to God. We cannot see divine things but in a divine light: God only, who is the true light, and in whom there is no darkness at all, can so shine out of himself upon our glassy Understandings, as to beget in them a picture of himself, his own Will and Pleasure, and turn the Soul (as the phrase is in <hi>Job</hi> 38.) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have done with the first Head, and come now <note place="margin">2.</note> to discourse with the like brevity on another (our purpose being to insist most upon the third Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, viz. <hi>The Nobleness of Religion in its Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> after we have handled the Second) which is <hi>The Excellency and Nobleness of Religion in regard of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> whether it be taken <hi>in abstracto</hi> or <hi>in concreto;</hi> which we shall treat of promiscuously, without any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid tying of our selves to exact Rules of Art: and so we shall glance at it in these following Notions, rising as it were step by step.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A Good man, that is actuated by Religion, lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the World and all Mundane delights and excellencies.</hi> The Soul is a more vigorous and puissant thing, when it is once restored to the possession of its own Being, then to be bounded within the narrow Sphere of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,


<pb n="386" facs="tcp:66374:222"/>
or to be streightned within the narrow prison of Sensual and Corporeal delights; but it will break forth with the greatest vehemency, and ascend upwards towards Immortality: and when it converses more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately with Religion, it can scarce look back upon its own converses (though in a lawfull way) with Earthly things, without a being touch'd with an <hi>holy Shame fac'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> &amp; a <hi>modest Blushing;</hi> and, as <hi>Porphyry</hi> speaks of <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi>

It is only True Religion that teaches and enables men to dye to this world and to all Earthly things, and to rise above that vaporous Sphere of Sensual and Earthly pleasures, which darken the Mind and hinder it from enjoying the brightness of Divine light; the proper motion of Religion is still upwards to its first Original. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary the Souls of wicked men <gap reason="foreign">

Wicked men bury their Souls in their Bodies: all their projects and designes are bounded within the compass of this Earth which they tread upon. The Fleshly mind never minds any thing but Flesh, and never rises above the Outward Matter, but alwaies creeps up and down like Shadows upon the Surface of the Earth: and if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at any time to make any faint assays upwards, it presently finds it self laden with a weight of Sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which draws it down again. It was the Opinion of the <hi>Academicks</hi> that the Souls of wicked men after their death could not of a long season depart from the Graves and Sepulchers where their Mates were buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but there wandred up and down in a desolate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

It is better resolved by some Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers in this point, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. But by <hi>Self-denial</hi> I mean, the Soul's quitting all its own interest in it self, and an entire Resignation of it self to him as to all points of service and duty: and thus the Soul loves it self in God, and lives in the possession not so much of its own Being as of the Divinity; desiring only to be great in God, to glory in his Light, and spread it self in his Fulness; to be fill'd alwaies by him, and to empty it self again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; to receive all from him, and to expend all for him; and so to live not as its own, but as God's. The


<pb n="390" facs="tcp:66374:224"/>
highest ambition of a Good man is to serve the Will of God: he takes no pleasure in himself nor in any thing within himself further then he sees a stamp of God upon it. Whereas wicked men are imprisoned within the narrow circumference of their own Beings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually frozen into a cold <hi>Self-love</hi> which binds up all the Innate vigour of their Souls, that it cannot break forth or express it self in any noble way. The Soul in which Religion rules, saies as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>I live; and yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</hi> On the contrary, a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man swells in his own thoughts, and pleaseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more or less with the imagination of a <hi>Self-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</hi> The <hi>Stoicks,</hi> seeing they could not raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to God, endeavour to bring down God to their own Model, imagining the Deity to be nothing else but some greater kind of <hi>Animal,</hi> and a Wise man to be almost one of his <note n="*" place="margin">Sapiens cum Diis ex pari vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, Deorum so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, non sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, <hi>Sen. in Ep. 52, &amp;</hi> 31.</note> Peers. And this is more or less the Genius of Wicked men, they will be something in themselves, they wrap up themselves in their own Being, move up and down in a Sphere of <hi>Self-love,</hi> live a professed Independency upon God, and maintain a <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum</hi> between God and themselves. It's the Character only of a Good man to be able to deny and disown himself, and to make a full surrender of himself unto God; forgetting himself, and minding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Will of his Creator; triumphing in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then in his own <hi>Nothingness,</hi> and in the <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the Divinity. But indeed this his being No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is the only way to be all things; this his having nothing the truest way of possessing all things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a Good man lives <hi>above himself</hi> in a way of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> so he lives also above himself as he lives in <hi>the Enjoyment of God:</hi> and this is the very Soul and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of True Religion, to unite the Soul in the nearest

                     </gap>, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaks. Then indeed the Soul lives <hi>most nobly,</hi> when it feels it self to live and move and have its Being in God; which though the Law of Nature makes the Common condition of all created Being, yet it is only True Religion that can give us a more feeling and comfortable sense of it. God is not present to Wicked men, when his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Essence supports them and maintains them in Being; <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Religion is Life and Spirit, which flowing out from God who is that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that hath life in himself, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to him again as into its own Original, carrying the Souls of Good men up with it. The Spirit of Religion is alwaies ascending upwards, and spreading it self through the whole Essence of the Soul, loosens it from a Self-confinement and narrowness, and so renders it more capacious of Divine Enjoyment. God envies not his people any good, but being infinitely bountifull is pleased to impart himself to them in this life, so far as they are capable of his Communications: they stay not for all their happiness till they come to heaven. Religion alwaies carries its reward along with it, and when it acts most vigorously upon the Mind and Spirit of man, it then most of all fills it with an inward sense of Divine sweetness. To conclude, <hi>To walk with God</hi> is in Scripture made the Character of a Good man, and it's the highest perfection and privilege of Created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to converse with the Divinity. Whereas on the contrary Wicked men converse with nothing but their

But true Goodness brings in a constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of solid and substantial Satisfaction to the Spirit of a good man, delighting alwaies to sit by those Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Springs that feed and maintain it: the Spirit of a Good man (as it is well express'd by the Philosopher) <gap reason="foreign">

ample manner upon that <hi>First, Universal</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded</hi> Essence which is God himself. The most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Freedom can never be took in its full and just dimensions and proportion, but then when all the Powers of the Soul exercise and spend themselves in the most large and ample manner upon the Infinite and Essential Goodness, as upon their own most proper Object. If we should ask a Good man, when he finds himself best at ease, when he finds himself most free; his answer would be, When he is under the most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull constraints of divine Love. There are a sort of <hi>Mechanical</hi> Christians in the world, that not finding <hi>Religion</hi> acting like <hi>a living form</hi> within them, satisfie themselves only to make an <hi>Art</hi> of it, and rather <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> and actuate <hi>it,</hi> then are <hi>informed by it;</hi> and setting it such bounds and limits as may not exceed the short and scant measures of their own home born Principles, then they endeavour to fit the Notions of their own Minds as so many <hi>Examples</hi> to it: and it being a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of their own making, they can either ampliateor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it accordingly as they can force their own Minds and Dispositions to agree and suit with it.

A Good man finds not his Religion <hi>without</hi> him, but as a living Principle <hi>within</hi> him; and all his Faculties are still endeavouring to unite themselves more and more in the nearest intimacy with it as with their proper Perfection. There is that amiableness in Religion, that strong Sympathy between the Soul and it, that it needs carry no Testimonials or Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions along with it. If it could be supposed that God should plant a Religion in the Soul that had no affinity or alliance with it, it would grow there but as a strange


<pb n="396" facs="tcp:66374:227"/>
slip. But God when he gives his Laws to men, does not by virtue of his <hi>Absolute dominion</hi> dictate any thing at randome, and in such an arbitrarious way as some imagine; but he measures all by his own Eternal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Had God himself been any thing else then the <hi>First and Greatest Good</hi> of man, then to have loved him with the full strength of all our Faculties should not have been <hi>the First and Greatest Commandment,</hi> as our Saviour tells us it is. Some are apt to look upon God as some <hi>Peevish</hi> and <hi>Self-will'd</hi> thing, because them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are such: and seeing that their own <hi>Absolute</hi> and naked <hi>Wills</hi> are for the most part the <hi>Rules</hi> of all their actions and the impositions which they lay upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they think that Heaven's Monarchy is such an <hi>arbitrary</hi> thing too, as being govern'd by nothing else but by an <hi>Almighty Absolute Will.</hi> But the Soul that is acquainted most intimately with the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> would more certainly resolve us, That God's <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Goodness</hi> (which makes the Divinity an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thing and to settle together upon its own Centre, as I may speak with reverence) is also <hi>the Unchangeable Rule of his Will;</hi> neither can he any more swerve from it, then he can swerve from himself. Nor does he charge any Duty upon man without consulting first of all with his <hi>Goodness:</hi> which being the Original and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate Object of a Good man's Will and affections, it must needs be that all the issues and effluxes of it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd with an answerable complacency &amp; chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This is the hinge upon which all true Religion turns, the proper Centre about which it moves; which taking a fast &amp; sure hold of an innate and correspondent Principle in the Soul of man, raiseth it up above the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Mortality, and in the day of its mighty power makes it become a free-will-Offering unto God.</p>

This is the Seed of the Evil Spirit which is perpetually at enmity with the Seed of God and the Heaven-born Nature: It's design and scope is with a Giant-like pride to climb up into the Throne of the Almighty, and to establish an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Tyranny in contradiction to the Will of God, which is nothing else but the Issue and Efflux of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Unbounded Goodness. This is the very Heart of the old <hi>Adam</hi> that is within men. This is the Hellish Spirit of <hi>Self-will:</hi> it would solely prescribe

To worship a graven Image, or to make cakes &amp; burn incense to the Queen of heaven, is not a worse Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry then it is for a man to set up <hi>Self-will,</hi> to devote himself to the serving of it, and to give up himself to a complyance with his own will as contrary to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Eternal Will. When God made the World, he did not make it merely for the exercise of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, and then throw it out of his hands, and leave it alone to subsist by it self as a thing that had no further relation to him: But he derived himself through the whole Creation, so gathering and knitting up all the several pieces of it again; that as the first produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the continued Subsistence of all things is from himself, so the ultimate resolution and tendency of all things might be to him. Now that which first endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured a Divorce between God and his Creation, and to make a Conquest of it, was that Diabolical <hi>Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy</hi> and <hi>Self-will</hi> that crept up and wound it self Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent-like into apostate Minds and Spirits.

He can look about him, and with an even and indifferent Mind behold the World either to smile or frown upon him; neither will he abate of the least of his <hi>Contentment,</hi> for all the ill and unkind usage he meets withall in this life. He that hath got the Mastery over his own Will, feels no violence from without, finds no contests within; and like a strong man, keeping his house, he preserves all his Goods in safety: and when God calls for him out of this state of Mortality, he finds in himself a power to lay down his own life; neither is it so much taken from him, as quietly and freely surrendred up by him. This is the highest piece of prowess, the noblest atchievement, by which a man becomes Lord over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the Master of his own Thoughts, Motions and Purposes. This is the Royal prerogative, the high dignity conferred upon Good men by our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, whereby they overcoming this both His and their Enemy, their <hi>Self-will</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> are enabled to sit down with him in his Throne, as he overcoming in another way, is set down with his Father in his Throne; as the phrase is <hi>Revelat.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Religion begets the most <hi>Heroick, Free and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous motions</hi> in the Minds of Good men.

Who can tell the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life and vigour that the Soul may be fill'd with, when once it is in conjunction with an Almighty Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence? There is a latent and hidden virtue in the Soul of man which then begins to discover it self when the Divine Spirit spreads forth its influences upon it.

That we are not nicely to distinguish between the Glory of God and our own Salvation. That Salvation is nothing else for the main but a true Participation of the Divine Nature. To love God above our selves, is not to love him above the Salvation of our Souls; but above our particular Beings and above our sinfull affections, &amp;c.

Philosopher, the true <hi>Nobleness</hi> and <hi>Freedome</hi> of it is then <hi>most disputable,</hi> and the Title it holds to true <hi>Liberty</hi> becomes most litigious.

                  <p>Every thing is most properly such as the <hi>End</hi> is which is aim'd at: the Mind of man is alwaies shaping it self into a conformity as much as may be to that which is his <hi>End;</hi> and the nearer it draws to it in the atchievement thereof, the greater likeness it bears to it.

On the contrary, the Spirit of true Religion steering and directing the Mind and Life to God, makes it an Uniform, Stable and quiet thing, as God himself is: it is only true Goodness in the Soul of man guiding it steddily and uniformly towards God, directing it and all its actions to the one Last End and Chief Good, that can give it a true consistency and composedness within it self.</p>

                  <p>This was the life of Christ, and is in some degree the life of every one that partakes of the Spirit of Christ. Such Christians seek not their own glory, but the glory of him that sent them into this world:

                  <p>I should now pass from this to another Particular; but because many are apt to misapprehend the Notion of <hi>God's glory,</hi> and flatter themselves with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and imaginary <hi>aiming at the Glory of God,</hi> I think it may be of good use, a little further and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly to unfold <hi>the Designe</hi> that a Religious mind drives on <hi>in directing it self and all its actions to God.</hi> We are therefore to consider, that this doth not consist in some <hi>Transient</hi> thoughts of God and his <hi>Glory</hi> as the <hi>End</hi> we propound to our selves in any Undertakings: a man does not direct all his actions to <hi>the Glory of God</hi> by forming a Conception in his Mind, or stirring up a strong Imagination upon any Action, That that must be <hi>for the Glory of God:</hi> it is not the thinking of God's glory that is <hi>glorifying</hi> of him.

doth more and more reduce all the Faculties of the Soul into a perfect Subjection and Subordination to it self.

God only is such an <hi>Almighty Goodness</hi> as can <hi>attract</hi> all the Powers in man's Soul to it self, as being an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject transcendently adequate to the largest capacities of any created Being, and so unite man perfectly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the true enjoyment of <hi>one Uniform and Simple Good.</hi>

A wicked man's life is so distracted by <hi>a Multiplicity</hi> of <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Objects,</hi> that it never is nor can be consistent to it self, nor continue in any composed, settled frame: it is the most intricate, irregular and confused thing in the world, no one part of it agreeing with another, because the whole is not firmly knit together by the power of some <hi>One Last End</hi> running through all. Whereas the life of a Good man is under the sweet command of <hi>one Supreme Goodness and Last End.</hi> This alone is that living Form and Soul, which running through all the Powers of the Mind and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Life, collects all together into one fair and beautifull System, making all that Variety conspire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfect Unity; whereas else all would fall asunder

like the Members of a dead Body when once the Soul is gone, every little particle flitting each from other. It was a good Maxim of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> quoted by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi>

It is not one and the same Goodness that alwaies acts the Faculties of a Wicked man; but as many several images and pictures of Goodness as a quick and working Fancy can represent to him; which so divide his affections, that he is no <hi>One thing</hi> within himself, but tossed hither and thither by the most independent Principles &amp; Imaginations that may be. But a Good man hath singled out the Supreme Goodness, which by an Omnipotent sweetness draws all his affections after it, and so makes them all with the greatest complacency conspire together in the pursuit and embraces of it. Were there not some <hi>Infinite and Self-sufficient Goodness,</hi> and that <hi>perfectly One,</hi>

                     </gap>, (as <hi>Simplicius</hi> doth phrase it) Man would be a most miserably-distracted creature. As the restless ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite within Man after some Infinite and Soveraign Good (without the enjoyment of which it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be satisfied) does commend unto us the Notion of a Deity: so the perpetnal distractions and divisions


<pb n="415" facs="tcp:66374:236"/>
that would arise in the Soul upon a Plurality of Deities, may seem no less to evince <hi>the Unity</hi> of that Deity. Were not this Chief Good perfectly <hi>One,</hi> were there any other equal to it; man's Soul would hang <hi>in ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrio,</hi> equally poised, equally desiring the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both, but moving to neither; like a piece of Iron between two Loadstones of equal virtue. But when Religion enters into the Soul, it charms all its restless rage and violent appetite, by discovering to it the Universal Fountain-fulness of One Supreme Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Goodness; and leading it out of it self into a conjunction therewith, it lulls it into the most undistur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed rest and quietness in the lap of Divine enjoyment; where it meets with full contentment, and rests ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately satisfied in the fruition of the Infinite, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and Essential Goodness and Loveliness, the true <gap reason="foreign">

The Spirit of a Good man is a more pure and refined thing then to delight it self in the thick mire of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Sensual pleasures, which Carnal men rowle and tumble themselves in with so much greediness: <hi>Non admittit ad volatum Accipitrem suum in terra pulveru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenta,</hi> as the Arabick Proverb hath it.

But a Soul puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied


<pb n="416" facs="tcp:66374:237"/>
Religion from all Earthly dreggs, delights to mingle it self only with things that are most Divine and Spiritual. There is nothing that can beget any pleasure or sweetness but in some harmonical Faculty which hath some kindred and acquaintance with it. As it is in the <hi>Senses,</hi> so in every other Faculty there is such <hi>a Natural kind of Science</hi> as whereby it can sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out its own proper Object from every thing else, and is better able to define it to it self then the exactest Artist in the world can; and when once it hath found it out, it presently feels it self so perfectly fitted and matched by it, that it dissolves into secret joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the entertainment of it. True <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> is begotten by the conjunction of some discerning Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty with its proper Object. The proper Object. for a Mind and Spirit are <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Immaterial</hi> things, with which it hath the greatest affinity, and therefore triumphs most in its converse with them; as it is well observed by <note n="*" place="margin">In Praefat. ad l. 1.

A Good man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to be beholding to the Wit or Art or Industry of any Creature to find him out and bring him in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant revenue and maintenance for his Joy and Pleasure: the language of his Heart is that of the Psalmist, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me.</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion alwaies carries a sufficient Provision of <hi>Joy and Sweetness</hi> along with it to maintain it self withall: <hi>All the ways of Wisdom are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</hi> Religion is no sullen <hi>Stoicisme</hi> or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing

                     <hi>Melancholie,</hi> it is no enthralling tyranny exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over those noble and vivacious affections of Love and Delight, as those men that were never acquainted with the life of it may imagine; but it is full of a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and masculine delight and joy, &amp; such as advanceth and ennobles the Soul, and does not weaken or dispirit the life and power of it, as Sensual and Earthly joys doe, when the Soul, unacquainted with Religion, is enforc'd to give entertainment to these gross &amp; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, for the want of enjoyment of some better Good. The Spirit of a Good man may justly behave it self with a noble disdain to all Terrene pleasures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it knows where to mend its fare; it is the same Almighty and Eternal Goodness which is the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God and of all Good men. The truly-religious Soul affects nothing primarily and fundamentally but God himself; his contentment even in the midst of his Worldly employments is in the Sun of the Divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that shines upon him: this is as the <hi>Manna</hi> that lies upon the top of all outward blessings which his Spirit gathers up and feeds upon with delight. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion consists not in a toilesome drudgery about some Bodily exercises and External performances; nor is it onely the spending of our selves in such attendances upon God and services to him as are onely accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this life, (though every employment for God is both amiable and honourable:) But there is something of our Religion that interests us in a present possession of that <hi>joy which is unspeakable and glorious;</hi> which leads us into the Porch of heaven, and to the confines of Eternity. It sometimes carries up the Soul into a mount of Transfiguration, or to the top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> where it may take a prospect of the promised land; and gives it a Map or Scheme of its future inheritance: it


<pb n="418" facs="tcp:66374:238"/>
gives it sometimes some anticipations of Blessedness, some foretasts of those joys, those rivers of pleasure which run at God's right hand for evermore.</p>
                  <p>I might further add as a <hi>Mantissa</hi> to this present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>the Tranquillity</hi> and <hi>Composedness</hi> of a Good man's spirit in reference to all <hi>External</hi> molestations. Religion having made a through-pacification of the Soul within it self, renders it impregnable to all outward assaults: So that it is at rest and lives securely in the midst of all those boysterous Storms and Tempests that make such violent impressions upon the spirits of wicked men. Here the <hi>Stoicks</hi> have stated the case aright, That all <hi>Perturbations of the Mind</hi> arise not properly from an <hi>Outward</hi> but an <hi>Inward</hi> cause: it is not any <hi>outward</hi> Evil but an <hi>inward imagination</hi> bred in the womb of the Soul it self, that molests and grieves it. The more that the Soul is restored to it self, and lives at the height of it's own Being, the more easily may it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and despise any design or combination against it by the most blustering Giants in the world. A Christian that enjoys himself in God, will not be beholding to the worlds fair and gentle usage for the <hi>composedness</hi> of his mind; No, he enjoys that <hi>Peace and Tranquillity within himself</hi> which no creature can bestow upon him, or take from him.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Stoicks</hi> were not so happy in their notions about <hi>the way to true Rest and Composedness of Spirit.</hi> It is not (by their leave) the Souls collecting and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up it self within the Circumference of it's own Essence, nor is it a rigid restraining and keeping in its own issues and motions within the confines of its own natural endowments, which is able to conferre upon it that <gap reason="foreign">

But herein they mistof the true method of finding Rest to themselves, it being the Union of the Soul with God, that Uniform, Simple and unbounded Good, which is the sole Original of all true inward Peace. Neither were it an Happiness worth the having, for a Mind, like an Hermite sequestred from all things else, by a recession into it self, to spend an Eternity in self-converse and the enjoyment of such a Diminutive superficial Nothing as it self is and must necessarily be to it self. It is onely peculiar to God to be happy in himself alone; and God who has been more liberal in his provisions for man, hath created in man such a spring of restless motion, that with the greatest impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency forceth him out of himself, and violently tosseth him to and fro, till he come to fix himself upon some solid and Self-subsistent Goodness. Could a man find himself withdrawn from all terrene and Material things, and perfectly retired into himself; were the whole World so quiet and calme about him, as not to offer to make the least attempt upon the composedness and constancy of his Mind; might he be so well enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at his own home, as to find no frowns, no sour looks from his own Conscience; might he have that security from Heaven, that God would not disquiet his

fancied Tranquillity by embittering his thoughts with any dreadful apprehensions; yet he should find something within him that would not let him be at rest, but would rend him from himself, &amp; toss him from his own founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; consistency. There is an insatiable appetite in the Soul of man, like a greedy Lion hunting after his prey, that would render him impatient of his own pinching penury, &amp; could never satisfy it self with such a thin and spare diet as he finds at home. There are Two principall faculties in the Soul which, like the two daughters of the Horsleach, are always crying, <hi>Give, Give:</hi> these are those hungry Vultures which, if they cannot find their prey abroad, return and gnaw the Soul it self: where the carkasse is, there will the Eagles be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By this we may see how unavailable to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of true Rest and Peace that conceit of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> was, who supposed the onely way and method hereto was this, To confine the Soul thus Monastical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to its own home. We read in the Gospel of such a Question of our Saviour's, <hi>What went you out into the wilderness to see?</hi> we may invert it, What do you return within, to see? A Soul confined within the private and narrow cell of its own particular Being? Such a Soul deprives it self of all that Almighty and Essential Glory and Goodness which shines round about it, which spreads it self through the whole universe; I say it deprives it self of all this, for the enjoying of such a poor petty and diminutive thing as it self is, which yet it can never enjoy truly in such a retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

The minds of wicked men are like those disconsolate and desolate spirits which our Saviour speaks of <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. which being cast out of their habitation, wander up and down through dry and desert places, seeking rest but finding none. The Soul that finds not some solid and self-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Good to centre it self upon, is a boisterous and restless thing: and being without God, it wanders up and down the world, destitute, afflicted, tormented with vehement hunger and thirst after some satisfying Good: and as any one shall bring it tidings, <hi>Lo here,</hi> or <hi>Lo there is Good,</hi> it presently goes out towards it, and with a swift and speedy flight hastens after it. The sense of an <hi>inward</hi> indigency doth stimulate and enforce it to seek its contentment <hi>without</hi> it self, and so it wanders up and down from one creature to another; and thus becomes distracted by <hi>a multiplicity of Objects.</hi> And while it cannot find some One and Onely object upon which, as being perfectly adequate to its capacities, it may wholly bestow it self; while it is tossed with rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and vehement motions of <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> through

Whereas in all Good men Vertue and Goodness is one Form and Soul to them all, that unites them together, and there is the One, Simple and Uniform Good, that guides and governs them all.

But while the Soul lies benighted in a thick Ignorance (as it is with wicked men,) and beholds not some <hi>Stable</hi> and <hi>Eternal Good</hi> to move toward; though it may, by the strength of that Principle of <hi>Activeness</hi> within it self, spend it self per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually with swift and giddy motions; yet it will be always contesting with secret disturbances, and cannot act but with many reluctancies, as not finding an object equall to the force and strength of its vast affections to act upon.</p>

Every Particular Good is a Blossom of the First Goodness; every cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Excellency is a Beam descending from the Father of lights: and should we separate all these <hi>Particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi> from God, all affection spent upon them would be unchast, and their embraces adulterous. We should love all things in God, and God in all things, because he is All in all, the Beginning and Original of Being, the perfect Idea of their Goodness, and the End of their Motion. It is nothing but a thick mist of Pride and Self-love that hinders mens eyes from beholding that Sun which both enlightens them and all things else: But when true Religion begins once to dawn upon mens Souls, and with its shining light chases away their black Night of Ignorance; then they behold themselves and all things else enlightned (though in a different way) by one and the same Sun, and all the Powers of their Souls fall down before God and ascribe all glory to him. Now it is that a Good man is no more solicitous whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> good thing be <hi>Mine,</hi> or whether <hi>My</hi> perfections exceed the measure of <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

                  <p>Thus may a Good man walk up and down the World as in a Garden of Spices, and suck a Divine Sweetness out of every flower.

Whereas true Religion never finds it self out of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Sphere of the Divinity, and whereever it finds <hi>Beauty, Harmony, Goodness, Love, Ingenuity, Wisdome, Holiness, Justice,</hi> and the like, it is ready to say, <hi>Here,</hi> and <hi>There is God:</hi> wheresoever any such Perfections

                  <p>And seeing God hath never thrown the World from himself, but runs through all created Essence, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Archetypal Ideas of all things in himself, and from thence deriving and imparting several prints of Beauty and Excellency all the world over; a Soul that is truly <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>As this Consideration quiets the Spirit of a Good man who is no idle Spectator of <hi>Providence,</hi> and keeps him in a calm and sober temper in the midst of all Storms and Tempests; so it makes him most freely to engage himself in the service of <hi>Providence,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inward reluctancy or disturbance. He cannot be content that <hi>Providence</hi> should serve it self of him as it doth even of those things that understand it least; but it is his holy ambition to serve it. 'Tis nothing else but Hellish pride and Self-love that makes men serve themselves, and so set up themselves as Idols against God: But it is indeed an argument of true Nobleness of Spirit for a man to view himself (not in the narrow Point of his own Being, but) in the unbounded Essence of the First Cause, so as to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To a Good man <hi>to serve the Will of God,</hi> it is in the truest and best sense <hi>to serve himself,</hi> who knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be nothing without or in opposition to God; <hi>Quò minùs quid sibi arrogat homo, eò evadit nobilior, clarior, divinior.</hi> This is the most divine life that can be, for a man to act in the world upon Eternal designes, and to be so wholy devoted to the Will of God, as to serve it most faithfully and entirely.

sorry Monument of any Exploit, which yet may well enough become the highest of the worlds bravery. But Good men, while they work with God and endeavour to bring themselves and all their actions to a unity with God, his Ends and Designs, enroll themselves in Eternity. This is the proper Character of holy Souls; Their Wills are so fully resolv'd into the Divine Will, that they in all things subscribe to it without any murmurings or debates: they rest well satisfied with, and take complacency in, any passages of Divine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, * <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The best way for a man rightly to enjoy himself, is to maintain an universal, ready and chearfull comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Divine and Uncreated Will in all things; as knowing that nothing can issue and flow forth from the fountain of <hi>Goodness</hi> but that which is good: and therefore a Good man is never offended with any piece of Divine dispensation, nor hath he any reluctancy against that Will that dictates and determines all things by an Eternal rule of <hi>Goodness;</hi> as knowing, That there is an unbounded and Almighty <hi>Love,</hi> that without any disdain or envy freely communicates it self to every thing he made; that feeds even the young Ravens that call upon him; that makes his Sun to shine, and his Rain to fall, both upon the just and unjust; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enfolds those in his everlasting armes who are made partakers of his own Image, perpetually nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cherishing them with the fresh and vital influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Grace; as knowing also, That there is an All-seeing Eye, an unbounded Mind and Understanding, that derives it self through the whole Universe, and sitting in all the wheels of motion, guides them all and

powerfully governs the most excentrical motions of Creatures, and carries them all most harmoniously in their several orbes to one Last End.

                  <p>But a Good man, whose Soul is restored to that frame and constitution it should be in, has better apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the ways and works of God, and is better af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected under the various disposalls of <hi>Providence.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to a superficial observer of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> many things there are that seem to be nothing else but <hi>Digressions</hi> from the main End of all, and to come to pass by a fortuitous concourse of Circumstances; that come in so abruptly and without any concatenation or dependance one upon another, as if they were without any Mind or Understanding to guide them.

                     </gap>, <hi>we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</hi> Indeed the best way to get a discovery of it, is to endeavour as much as may be to be <hi>Godlike,</hi> to live in a feeling converse with God and in a powerful exercise and expression of all Godlike dispositions: So shall our inner man be best enabled <hi>to know the breadth and length, the depth and height</hi> of that Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>which</hi> yet <hi>passeth all knowledg.</hi> There is <hi>a State of Perfection</hi> in the life to come so far transcendent to any in this life, as that we are not able from hence to take the just proportions of it, or to form a full and comprehensive notion of it. We are unable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the vastness and fullness of that Happiness which the most purifyed Souls may be raised to, or to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how far the mighty power and strength of the Divinity deriving it self into created Being, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a more Transcendent life and blessedness to it. We know not what latent powers our Souls may here contain within themselves, which then may begin to open and dilate themselves to let in the full streams of the Divine Goodness when they come nearly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately to converse with it; or how <hi>Blessedness</hi> may act


<pb n="445" facs="tcp:66374:251"/>
upon those Faculties of our Minds which we now have. We know not what illapses and irradiations there may be from God upon Souls in Glory, that may raise them into a state of Perfection surpassing all our imaginations.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Corporeal</hi> Happiness, there cannot be any thing further added to the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of our <hi>Bodies</hi> or Animal part, then a restoring it from disturbing Passion and Pain to its just and natural constitution; and therefore some Philosophers have well disputed against the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> that make <hi>Happiness</hi> to consist in <hi>Bodily pleasure,</hi>

                     </gap> and when <hi>the molestation</hi> is gone, and the just constitution of Nature recovered, <hi>Pleasure</hi> ceaseth. But the highest <hi>Pleasure</hi> of <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> does not onely consist in the relieving of them from any antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent pains or grief, or in a relaxation from some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer molesting Passion: neither is their Happiness a mere Stoical <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as the Happiness of the Deity is not a mere <hi>Negative</hi> thing, rendring it free from all disturbance or molestation, so that it may eternally rest quiet within it self; it does not so much consist <hi>in Quiete,</hi> as <hi>in Actu &amp; vigore.</hi> A Mind and Spirit is too full of activity and energy, is too quick and potent a thing to enjoy a full and complete Happiness in <hi>a mere Cessation;</hi> this were to make <hi>Happiness</hi> an heavy Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less thing. The Philosopher hath well observ'd, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, there is infinite power and strength in Divine joy, pleasure and happiness commensurate to that Almighty Being and Goodness which is the Eternal source of it.</p>
                  <p>As Created Beings, that are capable of conversing with God, stand nearer to God or further off from him, and as they partake more or less of his <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> so they partake more or less of that <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>


                     <pb n="446" facs="tcp:66374:252"/>
which flows forth from him, and God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himself in different degrees to them. There may be as many degrees of <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> as there are of States and Conditions of Creatures: and that is properly <hi>Sanctity</hi> which guides and orders all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Actions of any Creature in a way suitable and correspondent to that rank and state which God hath placed it in: and while it doth so, it admits no sin or defilement to it self, though yet it may be elevated and advanced higher; and accordingly true Positive <hi>Sanctity</hi> comes to be advanced higher and higher, as any Creature comes more to partake of the life of God, and to be brought into a nearer conjunction with God: and so the <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> of Innocency it self might have been perfected.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see how True Religion carries up the Souls of Good men above the black regions of <hi>Hell</hi> and Death. This indeed is the great <gap reason="foreign">

All that <hi>Happiness</hi> which Good men shall be made partakers of, as it cannot be born up upon any other foundation then <hi>true Goodness and a Godlike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> within them; so neither is it distinct from it. <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> are so twined and twisted up together, that if the power of <hi>Sin</hi> be once dissolv'd, the bonds of Death and Hell will also fall asunder. <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> are of the same kind, of the same linage and descent: as on the other side True <hi>Holiness</hi> or Religion and True <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> are but two severall Notions of one thing, rather then distinct in themselves. <hi>Religion</hi> delivers us from <hi>Hell</hi> by instating us in a possession of True Life and Blisse. <hi>Hell</hi> is <hi>rather a Nature</hi> then <hi>a Place:</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> cannot be so truly defined by any thing

<pb n="448" facs="tcp:66374:253"/>
upon Life and Immortality, in doing nothing, or else pursuing Hell and Death. Let us awake out of our vain dreams; Wisedome calls upon us, and offers us the hidden treasures of Life and Blessedness: Let us not perpetually deliver over our selves to laziness and slumbering. Say not, <hi>There is a lion in the way;</hi> say not, Though Religion be good, yet it is unattainable: No, but let us intend all our Powers in a serious resolv'd pursuance of it, and depend upon the assistance of Heaven which never fails those that soberly seek for it. It is indeed the Levity of mens spirits, their heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesseness and regardlesseness of their own lives, that betrays them to Sin and Death. It is the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of men <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>extempore vivere,</hi> as the Satyrist speaks; they ordinarily ponderate and deliberate upon every thing more then how it becomes them to live, they so live as if their Bodies had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up their Souls: their lives are but a kind of Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: the Principles by which they are guided are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a confused multitude of Fancies rudely jumbled together. Such is the life of most men, it is but a meer <hi>Casual</hi> thing acted over at peradventure, without any fair and calm debates held either with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or with Reason which in it self, as it is not distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and depraved by corrupt men, is a true Friend to Religion, and directs men to God and to things good and just, pure, lovely and praise-worthy; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of this Inward guide we are not to neglect. Unreasonableness or the smothering and extinguishing <hi>the Candle of the Lord</hi> within us is no piece of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor advantageous to it: That certainly will not raise men up to God, which sinks them below men. There had never been such an <hi>Apostasy from Religion,</hi> nor had such a Mystery of iniquity (full of deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness


<pb n="449" facs="tcp:66374:253"/>
and imposture) been revealed and wrought so powerfully in the Souls of some men, had there not first come an <hi>Apostasy from sober Reason,</hi> had there not first been a falling away and departure from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Truth.</p>
                  <p>It is to be feared our nice speculations about a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in Theology have tended more to exercise mens Wits then to reform their lives, and that they have too much descended into their practice, and have tended rather to take men off from minding Religion, then to quicken them up to a diligent seeking after it. Though the Powers of Nature may now be weakned, and though we cannot produce a living form of Religion in our own Souls; yet we are not surely resolved so into a sluggish <hi>Passiveness,</hi> as that we cannot, or were not in any kind or manner of way to seek after it. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man may as well read <hi>the Scriptures</hi> as study a piece of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or of Natural Philosophy or Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. He that can observe any thing comely and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, or unworthy and base, in another man, may also reflect upon himself, and see how <hi>face answers to face,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks <hi>Proverbs</hi> 27. 19. If men would seriously commune with their hearts, their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences would tell them plainly, that they might avoid and omit more evil then they doe, and that they might doe more good then they doe: and that they doe not put forth that power which God hath given them, nor faithfully use those Talents nor improve the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and means afforded them.</p>
                  <p>I fear the ground of most mens Misery will prove to be <hi>a Second fall, and a Lapse upon a Lapse.</hi> I doubt God will not allow that Proverb, <hi>The Fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge,</hi> as not in respect of <hi>Temporal misery,</hi> much less will he


<pb n="450" facs="tcp:66374:254"/>
allow it in respect of <hi>Eternal.</hi> It will not be so much because our First parents incurred God's displeasure, as because we have neglected what might have been done by us afterwards in order to the seeking of God, his face and favour, while he might be found.</p>
                  <p>Up then and be doing; and the Lord will be with us. He will not leave us nor forsake us, if we seriously set our selves about the work. Let us endeavour to acquaint our selves with our own lives, and the true Rules of life, with this which <hi>Solomon</hi> here calls <hi>the Way of Life:</hi> let us inform our Minds as much as may be in the Excellency and Loveliness of Practical Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that beholding it in its own beauty and amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we may the more sincerely close with it. As there would need nothing else to deterr and affright men from <hi>Sin</hi> but its own ugliness and deformity, were it presented to a naked view and seen as it is: so nothing would more effectually commend Religion to the Minds of men, then the displaying and unfolding the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of its Nature, then the true Native beauty and inward lustre of Religion it self: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> neither the Evening nor the Morning-Star could so sensibly commend themselves to our bodily Eyes, and delight them with their shining beauties, as True Religion, which is an undefiled Beam of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created light, would to a mind capable of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>versing with it. <hi>Religion,</hi> which is the true <hi>Wisedome,</hi> is (as <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book of Wisedome speaks of <hi>Wisedome,) a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty, the brightness of the Everlasting light, the unspotted mirrour of the power of God, and the image of his Goodness: She is more beautiful then the Sun, &amp; above all the order of Stars; being compared with the light, she is found before it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Religion is no such austere, sour &amp; rigid thing, as to


<pb n="451" facs="tcp:66374:254"/>
affright men away from it: No, but those that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the power of it, find it to be altogether sweet and amiable. An holy Soul sees so much of the glory of Religion in the lively impressions which it bears upon it self, as both wooes and winns it. We may truly say concerning Religion to such Souls as S. <hi>Paul</hi> spake to the Corinthians, <hi>Needs it any Epistles of Commendation to you?</hi> Needs it any thing to court <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> your affections? <hi>Ye are indeed its Epistle, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Religion is not like the Prophet's roll, sweet as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney when it was in his mouth, but as bitter as gall in his belly. Religion is no sullen <hi>Stoicisme,</hi> no sour <hi>Pharisaisme;</hi> it does not consist in a few Melancholy passions, in some dejected looks or depressions of Mind: but it consists in <hi>Freedom, Love, Peace, Life</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> the more it comes to be digested into our lives, the more sweet and lovely we shall find it to be. Those spots and wrinkles which corrupt Minds think they see in the face of Religion, are indeed nowhere else but in their own deformed and misshapen apprehensions. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when a defiled Fancy comes to be the Glass, if you have an unlovely reflection. Let us therefore labour to purge our own Souls from all worldly pollutions; let us breath after the aid and assistance of the Divine Spirit, that it may irradiate and inlighten our Minds, that we may be able to see Divine things in a Divine light: let us endeavour to live more in a real practice of those Rules of Religious and Holy living commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us by our ever-Blessed Lord and Saviour: So shall we know Religion better, and knowing it love it, and loving it be still more and more ambitiously pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it, till we come to a full attainment of it, and therein of our own Perfection and Everlasting Bliss.</p>

That Wicked men by destroying what there is from God within them, and devesting themselves of all that which hath any alliance to God or true Goodness, and transforming themselves into the Diabolical image, fit themselves for correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and converse with the Devil. The Fears and Horrors which infest both the Apostate Spirits and Wicked men. The weakness of the Devil's kingdom; Christ's success against it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T Hath been an antient Tradition received by the Gentile Philosophers, That there are <hi>Two main Principles</hi> that spend and spread their influence through the whole Universe: The one they call'd <hi>The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Good,</hi> the other they call'd <hi>The Principle of Evil:</hi>


                     <pb n="456" facs="tcp:66374:257"/>
and that these Two <hi>maintain a continual contest</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity the one with the other. <hi>The Principle of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which is nothing else but <hi>God</hi> himself, who deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself in clear and lovely stamps and impressions of Beauty and Goodness through the whole Creation, endeavours still to assimilate and unite it to himself. And on the other side <hi>The Principle of Evil,</hi> the Prince of darkness, having once stained the Original beauty and glory of the Divine workmanship, is continually striving to mold and shape it more and more into his own likeness. And as there is such a perpetual and active Enmity between God and the Evil Spirit: so whatsoever is from God is perpetually opposing and warring against that which arises from the Devil. The Divine Goodness hath put enmity between whatsoever is born of him or flowes forth from it self, and the Seed of the Serpent. As at the beginning he divided between the Night and the Day, between Light and Darkness, so that they can never intermingle or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply one with another, or be reconciled one to the other: so neither can those Beams of Divine light and love which descend from God upon the Souls of men be ever reconciled to those foul and filthy Mists of Sin and Darkness which ascend out of the bottomless pit of Hell and Death. That Spirit is not from God, who is the Father of lights and in whom there is no darkness, as the Apostle speaks, which endeavours to compound with Hell, and to accommodate between God and the Devil. God himself hath set the bounds to darkness and the shadow of death. Divine Truth and Goodness cannot contract themselves with any thing that is from Hell, or espouse themselves to any Brat of darkness: as it was set forth in the Emblem under the Old Law, where none of the Holy seed


<pb n="457" facs="tcp:66374:257"/>
might marry with the people of any strange God. Though that Rule, <hi>Touch not, tast not, handle not,</hi> be abolished in the Symbolical rites, yet it hath an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Mystery in it not subject to the laws or changes of Time.</p>
                  <p>He that will entertain any correspondence with the Devil, or receive upon his Soul his <hi>Image</hi> or the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his name,</hi> must first devest and strip himself of all that which hath any alliance to God or true Goodness within him: He must transform his Mind into the true likeness and similitude of those foul Fiends of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and abandon all relation to the Highest and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premest Good. And yet though some men endeavour to doe this, and to smother all those Impressions of Light and Reason which God hath folded up in every mans Being, and destroy all that which is from God within them, that so they may reconcile themselves to Sin and Hell; yet can they never make any just peace with them: <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, but they are like the troubled Sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</hi> Those Evil spirits are alwaies turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and <hi>restless;</hi> and though they maintain continually a War with God and his kingdom, yet are they alwaies making disquietings and disturbances in their own kingdom; and the more they contest with God and are deprived of him, the more full are they of horror and tumultuous commotions within. Nothing can stand firm and sure, nothing can have any true and quiet esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, that hath not the Everlasting arms of true Goodness under it to support it. And as those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver over themselves most to the Devil's pleasure, and devote themselves to his service, cannot doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a secret inward Antipathy against him or dreadful thoughts of him: so neither can those impure spirits


<pb n="458" facs="tcp:66374:258"/>
stand before the Divine glory; but being filled with trembling and horror continually endeavour to hide themselves from it, and flee away before it as the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness flies away before the Light. And according as God hath in any Places in any Ages of the world made any manifestations of himself to men, so have those Evil spirits been vanquished, and forced to quit their former Territories; as is especially very observable in the ceasing of all the <hi>Graecian Oracles</hi> soon after the Gospel was promulged in those parts, when those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate spirits with horrid and dismal groans resigned up their habitations, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath recorded of them.</p>

                  <p>IN these words <hi>[Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you]</hi> we shall take notice First of what is evidently <note place="margin">1.</note> implied, <hi>viz. That the Devil is continually busy with us.</hi> This may be considered under a double notion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>the Devil</hi> we are to understand that Apostate Spirit which fell from God, and is always designing to hale down others from God also. The old <hi>Dragon</hi> (mentioned in the Revelation) with his tail drew down the third part of the Stars of heaven and cast them to the Earth. As true Goodness is not content to be happy alone; so neither can Sin and Wickedness be content to be miserable alone. The Evil Spirit told God himself what his imployment was, viz. <hi>To goe to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>and fro in the earth, and to walk up and down in it:</hi> he is always walking up and down <hi>through dry places</hi> (where no Divine influences fall to water it) as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour speaks, <hi>seeking rest,</hi> though always restlesse. The Philosophy of the Antients hath observed That every man that comes into this world hath a good and an evil <hi>Genius</hi> attending upon him. It were perhaps a vain curiosity to inquire whether the number of <hi>Evil spirits</hi> exceed the number of <hi>Men:</hi> but this is too too certain, that we never want the secret and latent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them. The <hi>Devil</hi> is not onely <hi>a word</hi> or <hi>a name</hi> made to affright and scare timorous men with; neither are we then onely in danger of him, when he presents himself to us in some <hi>Corporeal form:</hi> it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a superstitious weakness to be afraid of


<pb n="460" facs="tcp:66374:259"/>
him onely then when he appears <hi>embodyed,</hi> and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that <hi>unseen</hi> and insensible influence which his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual converse with us as an <hi>unbodyed</hi> spirit may have upon us. Those Evil spirits are not yet cast out of the world into outer darkness, though it be prepared for them: the bottomless pit hath not yet shut its mouth upon them. They fell from God not so much by a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal descent,</hi> as by a <hi>Mental apostasy and dissimilitude to God:</hi> and they are now <hi>in libera custodia,</hi> having all this habitable world for their Rendezvous, and are stiled by the Apostle <hi>Spiritual wickednesses in high places.</hi> Wheresoever there are any in a disposition to sin against <note place="margin">Ephes. 6.</note> God, wheresoever there are any capable of a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Diabolical impression, here and there are they. A man needs not dig into the chambers of death, or search among the shadows of darknesse to find them; he needs not goe down into hell to seek them, or use any <hi>Magical charms</hi> to raise them up from thence: No, those wicked and impure spirits are always wandring up and down amongst us, seeking whom they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. As there is <hi>a Good Spirit</hi> conversant in the world, inviting and alluring men to Vertue and Goodness; so there is <hi>an Evil spirit,</hi> perpetually tempting and intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to Sin and Vice. Uncloathed and unbodyed natures may converse with us by secret illapses, while we are not aware of them. I doubt not but there are many more Divine impressions made upon the Minds of men, both Good and Bad, from <hi>the Good Spirit</hi> of God, then are ordinarily observed; there are many soft and silent impulses, gentle motions, like our Saviour's <hi>putting in his hand by the hole of the door,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> solliciting and exciting men to Religion and <note place="margin">ch 5.</note> Holiness; which they many times regard not, and take little notice of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="461" facs="tcp:66374:259"/>
There are such secret messages often brought from Heaven to the Souls of men by an unknown and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen hand, as the Psalmist speaks; <hi>Once, yea twice have I heard it, that power belongeth unto God.</hi> And as there are such <hi>divine irradiations</hi> sliding into the Souls of men from <hi>God:</hi> so there are no question many &amp; frequent <hi>sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions</hi> to the Fancies and Imaginations of men arising from <hi>the Evil Spirit;</hi> and a watchfull observer of his own heart and life shall often hear the voice of <hi>Wisdome</hi> &amp; the voice of <hi>Folly</hi> speaking to him: he that hath his eyes ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may see both the visions of God falling upon him, and discern the false and foolish fires of Satan that would draw away his mind from God. This is our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, that the Devil is so near us and we see him not; he is conversant with us, and yet we are not aware of him. Those are the most desperate designs &amp; likeliest to take effect, that are carried on by an unseen and unappearing enemy: and if we will provide our selves against the Devil, who never misseth any opportunity that lies in his way to tempt us, nor is ever failing in any plot, we must then have our <hi>Senses exercised to discern both good and evil;</hi> we must get our Minds awakened with clear and evident Principles of Light; we must get our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Consciences well informed with sober and practical Truth, such as tends to make us most like to God, and to reconcile our natures more perfectly to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodness. Then shall we know and discover that Apostate Spirit in all his Stratagems whereby he seeks to bereave us of our happiness: we shall know him as well when he cloaths himself like an <hi>Angel of light,</hi> as when he appears in his own nakedness and deformity. It is observed by some, That God never suffered the Devil to assume any humane shape, but with some Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter whereby his Body might be distinguished from


<pb n="462" facs="tcp:66374:260"/>
the true Body of a man: and surely the Devil cannot so exactly counterfeit an Angel of light, but that by a discerning mind he may be distinguished from him; as they say <hi>a Beggar</hi> can never act <hi>a Prince</hi> so cunningly, but that his behaviour sometime sliding into the course way and principles of his Education, will betray the meannesse of his pedigree to one of a true noble extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. A bare <hi>Imitation</hi> will always fall short of <hi>the Copy</hi> from whence it is taken; and though <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> may take up the mantle of <hi>Truth</hi> and cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with it, yet he that is inwardly acquainted with <hi>Truth,</hi> and an ingenuous lover and pursuer of it, will be able to find out the Imposture, he will be able to see through the vail into the naked deformity of them.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Of the activity of the Devil consider'd as a Spirit of Apostasy and as a Degenerate nature in men. That the Devil is not onely the name of one Particular thing, but a Nature. The Difference between the Devil and Wicked men is rather the Difference of a Name then of Natures. The Kingdome and Tyranny of the Devil and Hell is chiefly within, in the Qualities and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of mens Minds. Men are apt to quarrell with the Devil in the name and notion, and defy him with their Tongues, while they entertain him in their Hearts, and comply with all that which the Devil is. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their pretended Love to God, and Hatred of the Devil. That there is nothing Better then God himself, for which we should love him; and to love him for his own Beauty and Excellency is the best way of loving

him. That there is nothing worse then Sin it self, for which we should hate it; and to hate it for its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity is the truest way of hating it. How Hell and Misery arises from within men. Why Wicked men are so insensible of their Misery in this life.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="2">2. WHen we say, <hi>The Devil is continually busy with us,</hi> I mean not onely <hi>some Apostate spirit</hi> as one particular Being, but that <hi>spirit of Apostasy</hi> which is lodged in all mens natures; and this may seem particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to be aimed at in this place, if we observe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text: as the Scripture speaks of Christ not onely as a Particular person, but as a Divine Principle in holy Souls.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the <hi>Devil</hi> is not onely <hi>the name of one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing, but a nature:</hi> He is not so much one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Being designed to torment Wicked men in the world to come, as a hellish and diabolical nature seated in the minds of men. He is not onely one Apostate Spirit fallen down from heaven out of the lap of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness; but also a Spirit of Apostasy, a degenerate and depraved nature. Could the Devil <hi>change his</hi> foul and impure <hi>nature,</hi> he would neither be a <hi>Devil</hi> nor <hi>misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> and so long as any man carries about him a sinfull and corrupt nature, he can neither be in perfect favour with God, nor blessed. Wickedness is the Form and <hi>Entelech</hi> of all the wicked spirits: it is the <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>a name</hi> rather then any proper difference of <hi>natures</hi> that is between the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Wicked men.</hi> Wheresoever we see <hi>Malice, Revenge, Pride, Envy, Hatred, Self-will and Self-love,</hi> we may say <hi>Here,</hi> and <hi>There is that Evil spirit.</hi> This indeed is that <hi>Venenum Serpentis,</hi> the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and sting too of that Diabolical nature. As the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven</hi> is not so much <hi>without</hi> men as


<pb n="464" facs="tcp:66374:261"/>
                     <hi>within,</hi> as our Saviour tells us: so the <hi>Tyranny of the Devil and Hell</hi> is not so much in some <hi>External things,</hi> as in the <hi>Qualities and Dispositions of mens Minds.</hi> And as the enjoying of God and conversing with him consists not so much in <hi>a change of place, as in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Divine nature, and in our assimilation unto God:</hi> so our conversing with the Devil is not so much by a mutual local presence, as by an imitation of a wicked and sinful nature derived upon mens own Souls. Therefore the Jews were wont to stile that Original pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity that is lodged in mens spirits. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of death</hi> and fiend of darkness. Those filthy Lusts and Corruptions which men foment and entertain in their Minds, they are the noisome Vapours that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend out of the bottomless pit; they are the thick Mists and fogs of Hellish darkness arising in their Souls, as a Preface and Introduction of Hell and Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Where we find <hi>Uncleanness, Intemperance, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,</hi> or any such impure or unhallowed behaviour, we may say, <hi>Here Satan's throne is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This sinfull and corrupt nature being the true issue of Hell it self, is continually dragging down mens Souls thither. All Sin and Wickedness in man's Spirit hath the <hi>Central</hi> force and Energy of Hell in it, and is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually pressing down towards it as towards its own place. There needs no <hi>Fatal necessity</hi> or <hi>Astral impulses</hi> to tumble wicked men down forcibly into Hell: No, for Sin it self, hastned by the mighty weight of its own nature, carries them down thither with the most swift and headlong motion. As they say of true Holiness and Christianity, <hi>Christi sacrina pennas habet,</hi> Christ's burden, which is nothing else but true Godliness, is a winged thing, and bravely bears it self upwards upon its own wings soaring aloft towards God: so we may


<pb n="465" facs="tcp:66374:261"/>
say of all Impiety, <hi>Diaboli sarcina pondus habet;</hi> the Devilish nature is alwaies within the Central attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Hell, and its own weight instigates and accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates its motion thither. He that allows himself in any sin, or useth an unnatural dalliance with any vice, does nothing else in reality then entertain an <hi>incubus Damon;</hi> he prostitutes a wanton Soul, and forceth it to commit lewdness with the Devil himself. Sin is nothing better then a Brat of darkness and deformitie; it hath no other extraction or pedigree then may be derived from those unclean spirits that are nestled in Hell. All men in reality converse either with God or with the Devil, and walk in the Confines either of Heaven or of Hell: They have their fellowship either with the Father and the Son, as <hi>S. John</hi> speaks; or else with the Apostate and evil Angels.</p>
                  <p>I know these Expressions will seem to some very harsh and unwelcome: But I would beseech them to consider what they will call that spirit of <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> that spirit of <hi>Pride, Ambition, Vain-glory, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, Injustice, Uncleanness,</hi> &amp;c. that commonly reigns so much, and acts so violently in the Minds and Lives of men. Let us speak the truth, and call things by their own Names; let us not flatter our selves, or paint our filthy sores: so much as there is of <hi>Sin</hi> in any man, so much there is of <hi>the old man,</hi> so much there is of the <hi>Diabolical</hi> nature. Why do we defie the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil so much with our Tongues, while we entertain him in our Hearts? But indeed men do but quarrel with him in the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>notion</hi> of him, while yet their Hearts can readily comply with <hi>all that which the Devil is:</hi> that Antipathy which is ordinarily expressed against him, like those natural Antipathies which the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers speak of, being nothing else but Occult qualities,


<pb n="466" facs="tcp:66374:262"/>
or Natural instincts, which as they arise not from any principle of Reason or Understanding, so neither are they guided or governed by it. As mens <hi>Love to God</hi> is ordinarily nothing else but the mere tendencie of their Natures to something that hath <hi>the notion or name of God put upon it,</hi> without any clear or distinct appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of him; so their <hi>Hatred of the Devil</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly nothing else but an inward displicency of nature against <hi>something entitled by the Devil's name.</hi> Or else at best, Corrupt minds do nothing else but fashion out a <hi>God</hi> and a <hi>Devil,</hi> a <hi>Heaven</hi> and a <hi>Hell,</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by the power of their own Fancies: and so they are to them nothing else but <hi>their own Creatures,</hi> sustained and supported by the force of their own <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> which first raised them. And as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make <hi>a God like to themselves,</hi> such a one as they can best <hi>comply with and love;</hi> so they make <hi>a Devil most unlike to themselves,</hi> which may be any thing but what they themselves are, that so they may most freely spend their <hi>Anger and Hatred</hi> upon him: just as they say of some of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> who use to paint the Devil <hi>white,</hi> because they themselves are <hi>black.</hi> This is a strange merry kind of Madness, whereby men spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly bereave themselves of the Supremest Good, and insure themselves as much as may be to Hell and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: They may thus cheat themselves for awhile, but the Eternal foundation of the Divine Being is immutable and unchangeable. God is but <hi>One, and his Name One,</hi> as the <note n="*" place="margin">Zech. 14.</note> Prophet speaks, (howsoever the several Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of men may shape him out diversly;) and where we find <hi>Wisdome, Justice, Loveliness, Goodness, Love and Glory,</hi> in their <hi>highest</hi> elevations and most <hi>unbounded</hi> dimensions, That is He: and where we find any true participations of these, there is a true Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="467" facs="tcp:66374:262"/>
of God; and a defection from these is the Essence of Sin and the Foundation of Hell.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be rightly considered, I hope there will an Argument strong enough appear from <hi>the Thing it self,</hi> to enforce S. <hi>James</hi> his Exhortation, <hi>Resist the Devil:</hi> endeavour to mortifie and crucifie the Old man with all the corrupt lusts and affections of the Flesh.</p>
                  <p>We never so truly <hi>hate Sin,</hi> as when we <hi>hate it</hi> for its own <hi>Ugliness and deformity:</hi> as we never <hi>love</hi> God so tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as when we <hi>love</hi> him for his own <hi>beauty and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> If we calculate aright, as we shall find <hi>nothing Better then God</hi> himself, for which we should <hi>love</hi> him; so neither shall we find any thing <hi>Worse then Sin</hi> it self, for which we should <hi>hate</hi> it. Our <hi>assimilation</hi> to God and <hi>conformity</hi> to him, instates us in a firm possession of true <hi>Happiness,</hi> which is nothing else but God himself, who is all Being and Blessedness; and our <hi>dissimilitude</hi> to God and <hi>Apostasy</hi> from him, involves us in our own <hi>Miserie,</hi> and sets us at the greatest enmity to what our unsatiable desires most of all crave for, which is the enjoyment of True and Satisfying Good. Sins are those fiery Snakes which will eternally lash and torment all damned spirits. Every mans Hell arises from the bottom of his own Soul; as those stinking Mists and tempestuous Exhalations that infest the Earth, have their first original from the Earth it self. Those streams of fire and brimstone ordained for the torment of all damned spirits, are rather the exsudations of their own filthy and corrupt nature then any external thing. Hell is not so much <hi>induced,</hi> as <hi>educed</hi> out of mens filthy Lusts and Passions. I will not here dispute what external Appendixes there may be of <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell;</hi> but methinks I no where find a more <hi>Graphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> description of the true Properties and Operations


<pb n="468" facs="tcp:66374:263"/>
of them, though under other names, then in those Characters of the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> in <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. ver. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Eternal death</hi> is begotten and brought forth out of the wombe of <hi>lust,</hi> and is little else but Sin consummated and in its full growth, as S. <hi>James</hi> intimates chap. 1.</p>
                  <p>Would wicked men dwell a little more at home, and descend into the bottome of their own Hearts, they should soon find <hi>Hell</hi> opening her mouth wide upon them, and those secret fires of inward fury and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure breaking out upon them, which might fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of the estate of true <hi>Misery,</hi> as being a short anticipation of it. But in this life wicked men for the most part <hi>elude</hi> their own Misery for a time, and seek to avoid the dreadfull sentence of their own Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by a tergiversation and flying from themselves into a converse with other things, <hi>Ut nemo in sese tentat descendere;</hi> else they would soon find their own home too hot for them. But while mens Minds are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually rambling all the world over in a pursuit of worldly designes, they are unacquainted with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of their own Souls; and know not how deeply a Self-converse and reflection upon their own prodigious deformities would pierce their Souls with anguish: how vastly would they swell with <hi>Fury, Rage, Horrour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation</hi> and whatsoever is contrary to that ineffable <hi>Light and Love and Peace</hi> which is in Heaven, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fully reconciled and united to true Goodness? As <hi>true Goodness</hi> cannot borrow <hi>Beauty</hi> from any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thing to recommend it self to the Minds and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Good men, seeing it self is the very <hi>Idea</hi> and true life of all Beauty and Perfection, the source of Bliss and Peace to all that partake of her: so neither can <hi>Sin</hi> and Wickedness to an enlightned Soul appear more

That it is transacted upon the inner Stage of mens Souls, and managed without Noise or pompous Observation; and without any hindrance or prejudice to the most peaceful, sedate and composed temper of a religious Soul. This further illustrated from the consideration of the false and pretended Zeal for God and his Kingdome against the Devil; which though it be impetuous, and makes a great noise and a fair shew in the world, is yet both impotent and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>

A Good man doth not only then move, when there is some powerfull <hi>impression and impulse upon him;</hi> but he hath a Spring of perpetual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within. When God restores men to a new and divine life, he doth not make them like so many <hi>dead Instruments,</hi> stringing and fitting them, which yet are able to yield no sound of themselves; but he puts a <hi>living Harmony within them.</hi> That is but <hi>a Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal religion</hi> which moves no longer then some <hi>External weights and Impulses</hi> are upon it, whether those be (I think I may safely say) from some Worldly thing or from God himself, while he acts upon men from <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> them, and not from <hi>within</hi> them. It is not a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi> kind of <hi>sitting still,</hi> and sloathfull waiting, that speaks men enlivened by the Spirit and power of God. It is not Religion to stifle and smother those Active

powers and principles which are within us, or to dry up the Fountain of inward life and virtue. How say some amongst us, That there is no resurrection from the dead? no spirit or life within; but all our motions in Religion are merely from some assisting Form with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? Good men do not walk up and down the world merely like <hi>Ghosts and Shadows,</hi> or like dead Bodies assumed by some Spirit, which are taken up and laid down again by him at his pleasure: But they are indeed <hi>living men,</hi> by a real participation from him who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a quickning Spirit. Were our <hi>Religion</hi> so much <hi>a Thing without us</hi> as some men would seem to fansy it, were we so dead and liveless as that we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver move but from an External <hi>impetus;</hi> as <hi>our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> could never indeed be called <hi>Ours,</hi> so neither could we ever have <hi>the inward sense</hi> of that Bliss and Peace which goes along with it; but must be like so many heavy loggs or dul pieces of Earth in Heaven and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. That is a very earthly and flat Spirit in <hi>Religion</hi> which sinks like the lees to the bottome; or rather it is like that <hi>Terra damnata</hi> which the Chymists speak of, having no vigour, life or activity left in it, is truly dead to God, and is reprobate to any thing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. We know the Pedigree of those Exhalations that arise no higher then a mere external force from the Sun's heat weigheth them up, to be but base and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and therefore having no natural warmth or ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy within themselves imparted to them, they sink down again to the Earth from whence they came. The Spirit which is from Heaven is alwaies, out of an in-bred Nobleness which bears it up, carried upwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain towards Heaven from whence it came, powerfully resisting all things that would deprive it of God or hinder it from returning to its Original: it is alwaies


<pb n="472" facs="tcp:66374:265"/>
moving upwards in an even and steady way towards God from whence it came, leaving the dark Regions of Hell and Death under it: it resists <hi>Hell and Darkness</hi> by <hi>assimilating</hi> and conforming it self <hi>to God;</hi> it resists <hi>Darkness</hi> in the <hi>armour of light;</hi> it resists Death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction by the power of <hi>Divine love.</hi> It must be something of <hi>Heaven</hi> in the Minds of men, which must resist the Devil and Hell.</p>
                  <p>We do not alwaies <hi>resist the Devil</hi> then when we <hi>bid defiance</hi> to him, or when we <hi>declame most zealously</hi> against him; neither does our <hi>Resisting</hi> and <hi>Opposing of Sin</hi> and Wickedness consist in the <hi>violence</hi> of some Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine passions which may sometimes be raised by the power of Fancy in the Minds of men against it: But it consists rather in <hi>a mature and sedate resolution</hi> against it in our own Souls, arising from a clear judgment of the foul and hatefull nature of Sin it self, and him who is the Patron of it; in a constant and serious endeavour of setling the government of our own Souls, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the principality of Grace and Peace within our selves. There is <hi>a pompous and popular kind of tumult</hi> in the world, which sometimes goes for <hi>Zeal to God</hi> and his kingdome against the Devil; whenas mens own <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> disguise themselves under the notions of <hi>a Religious fervencie.</hi> Some men think themselves the greatest Champions for God and his Cause, when they can take the greatest liberty to quarrel with every thing abroad, and without themselves, which is not shaped according to the mould of their own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their own Self-will, Humour and Interest: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed this <hi>Spiritual warfare</hi> is not so much maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against a <hi>forrein</hi> enemy, as against those <hi>domestick</hi> rebellions that are within: neither is it then carried on most successfully, when men make the greatest

noise and most of all raise the dust. That impetuous violence and tempestuousness with which men are acted in pretensions of Religion arises ordinarily, I doubt, from unquiet and disturbed Minds within: whereas it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the inward conflicts and commotions, sin and vice, and not a holy zeal for God, which discompose the Minds of men. Sin, where it is entertained, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed breed disturbance, and break the peace of a mans own spirit; but a true <hi>resisting and opposing</hi> of it is the restoring of the Soul to its just <hi>Consistency, Freedome and Serenity again.</hi> As God's kingdome is set up, so the Devil's kingdome may be pulled down, without the noise of axes and hammers. We may then attain to the greatest atchievements against the gates of Hell and Death, when we most of all possesse our own Souls in patience, &amp; collect our Minds into the most <hi>peacefull, composed and united temper.</hi> The motions of true Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Religion are most like that of the Heavens, which though most <hi>swift,</hi> is yet most <hi>silent.</hi> As Grace and true Religion is no lazy or sluggish thing, but in perpetual motion; so all the <hi>motions</hi> of it are <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>gentle:</hi> While it acts most <hi>powerfully</hi> within, it also acts most <hi>peacefully.</hi> The kingdome of heaven <hi>comes not with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,</hi> that men may say, <hi>Loe here,</hi> or <hi>Loe there;</hi> it is not with the <hi>devouring fire</hi> coming after it, or <hi>a whirlwind</hi> going before it. This fight and contest with Sin and Satan is not to be known by the ratling of the Chariots, or the sound of an alarm: it is indeed alone transacted upon the inner stage of mens souls and spirits; and is rather a pacifying and quieting of all those riots and tumults raised there by Sin and Satan; it is rather a reconciling the minds of men to Truth, Justice and Holiness; it is a captivating and subjecting all our Powers and Faculties to God and true Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

For First of all, <hi>The Devil and Sin in themselves</hi>

                     <hi>considered are but weak and impotent;</hi> they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over that Soul which <hi>yields</hi> not to them: the Evil spirit then onely prevails over us, when we our selves <hi>consent</hi> to his suggestions; all his strength lies in our treachery and falseness to our own Souls. Though those wicked spirits be perpetually so near us, yet they cannot bow or bend our Wills: there is a place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in the Souls of men into which they cannot enter: they may stand at a distance, allure and intice them; but they cannot prevail over them, except they wilfully and shamefully deliver over their strength into the Enemies hand. It is indeed nothing else but Hell it self in the Souls of men that gives the Devil such free entertainment there: the Wills of men stamped with a Diabolicall form, and bearing the Devil's image and inscription upon them, declare his right over them. Men are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so much captivated by him because they volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily take his yoke upon them. Could we, or would we, resist <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> they could not hurt us. Every thing is weak and impotent according to the distance it stands from God who is the onely Fountain of life and power: and therefore it was well resolved by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Sin in it self is a weak and impotent thing, and proceeds from weakness; it consists not properly in any native power and strength which it hath within it self, but in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and privation of all true Being and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore wheresoever any thing of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, it will destroy it. He that is born of God, shall overcome the World, the Devil and Sin; for <hi>the seed of God remaineth in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us endeavour to get our Minds enlightned with Divine Truth, clear and Practical Truth, let us earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="476" facs="tcp:66374:267"/>
endeavour after a true participation of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and then shall we find Hell and Death to slee alway before us. Let us not impute the fruits of our own <hi>sluggishness</hi> to the <hi>power</hi> of the Evil spirit without, or to God's neglecting of us: Say not, Who shall stand against those mighty Giants? No; <hi>arme thy self with the mind of Christ,</hi> a fixt resolution to serve the will and pleasure of the Almighty; and then fear not what <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> can doe against thee. Open thy windows, thou Sluggard, and let in the beams of Divine light that are there waiting upon thee till thou awake out of thy Slothfulness; then shalt thou find the shadows of the night dispell'd and scattered, and the warm beams of Light and Love enfolding of thee, which the higher they arise upon the Horizon of thy Soul, the more fully they will display their native strength and beauty upon thee, transforming thee more &amp; more from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to light, from the similitude of Satan into a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Divine image. The Devil is not to be kept off from us by setting any <hi>Spell</hi> about us, or driven away from us by any <hi>Magical charms.</hi> We need not goe and beat the air to drive away those Evil spirits from about us, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports the <hi>Caunians</hi> once to have beaten out the strange Gods from amongst them: but let us turn within our selves, and beat down that Pride and Passion, those Holds of Satan there, which are therefore <hi>strong,</hi> because we oppose them <hi>weakly.</hi> Sin is nothing else but a degeneration from true Goodness, conceived by a dark and cloudy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and brought forth by a corrupt Will; it hath no consistency in it self, or foundation of its own to support it. What the Jews have observed of <hi>Errour</hi> is true of all Sin, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:66374:267"/>
and rest it self upon. Let us withdraw our Will and Affections from it, and it will soon fall into nothing. It was the fond Errour of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> That there was some solid <hi>Principium mali,</hi> which having an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal existence of its own, had also a mighty and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable power from within it self, whereby it could forcibly enter and penetrate into the Souls of men; and seating it self there, by some hidden influences irresistablie incline and inforce them to evil: which <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> I wish were as well confuted by the <hi>lives and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices</hi> of men, as it hath been by the <hi>Writings</hi> both of Fathers and Philosophers. But it's too apparent that men maintain that Lie by a compliance with the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical powers: We ourselves uphold that kingdome of darkness, which else would tumble down and slide into that nothing from whence it came. All Truth and Goodness are of an <hi>Eternal</hi> nature, they are One, and Unchangeable, subsisting upon the strength of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: But all <hi>Sin and Vice</hi> is our own creature; we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give <hi>life</hi> to them which indeed are our death, and would soon wither and fade away did we substract our concurrence from them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have a further Ground for our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">2.</note> of <hi>Victory</hi> in all contests with <hi>Sin and Satan, from the powerful assistance of God himself,</hi> who is never wanting to those that seek after him, and never fails those that engage in his quarrels. While we strive against Sin, we may safely expect that the Divinity it self will strive with us, and derive that strength and power into us that shall at last make us <hi>more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</hi> God hath not forsaken the earth: but as his. Almightyessence runs through all things, sustaining and upholding the frame of the whole Universe; so more especially does it bear up in its Almighty armes those


<pb n="478" facs="tcp:66374:268"/>
things that are more nearly related to himself, always cherishing them with his own Goodness. Whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God beholds any breathings after himself, he gives life to them, as those which are his own breath in them. As he who projects wickedness, shall be sure to find Satan standing at his right hand ready to assist him in it: so he that pursues after God and Holiness, shall find God nearer to him then he is to himself, in the free and liberal communications of himself to him. He that goes out in God's battels, fighting under our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's banner, may look upwards, and opening his eyes may see the mountains full of horses and chariots of fire round about him. God hath not so much delight in the death and destruction of men, as to see them strugling and contending for life, and himself stand by as a looker on. No, but with the most tender and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly compassions his bowels yern over them, and his Almighty arme is stretched forth for them; and in his strength they shall prevail: they shall be born up, as upon Eagles wings; they shall walk in the might of his strength who is able to save, and not faint. Where there is any serious and sober <hi>Resolution</hi> against Sin, any reall motion towards God, there is the blessing of Heaven in it; he that planted it, will also water it, and make it to bud and blossome and bring forth fruit.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to shut up this Discourse by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, Let us make use of this as a further Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to enforce the Apostles Exhortation upon our selves, Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, and, as the Psalmist speaks of his Enemies, so let us say of our spiritual Enemies, <hi>They compass me about, they compass me in on every side; but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them.</hi> Let us set our selves with


<pb n="479" facs="tcp:66374:268"/>
all our might to mortify the old man, &amp; to crucify all the affections of the Flesh: <hi>Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily besets us, and run with patience the race that is set before us; Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who is set down at the right hand of the throne of God,</hi> as a great and mighty Conquerour, who will declare the perfection of his own power in our weakness, if we lay hold of his strength. Though we are not able to change our own natures, or to rise above the source of our Animall and Selfish Beings, by our own power; yet let us endeavour to subdue all those External vices of Luxury and Wantonnesse, of Injustice, Revenge and the like; let us withdraw the fewel of Pride, Malice, Vain-glory and whatsoever else holds us in captivity to Hell, and with confidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our selves to him who is an Almighty Saviour; and when he joyns his Almighty strength with us, we need not fear any thing: <hi>He shall tread down Satan under our feet,</hi> and we shall one day <hi>tread upon the Lion and Adder, the young Lion and the Dragon shall we trample under our feet:</hi> we shall break the Serpent's head, though he may bruise our heel. Though God may suffer him so far to serve his own rage and the hellish malice of such as are in league with him, as to pull down with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence our earthly Tabernacles; yet while we so suffer by him, we are conquerors over him.</p>
                  <p>I should now conclude all, and leave you with this General application, but that the present Occasion hath drawn it down for me to a particular case. Did we not live in a world of professed wickedness, wherein so many mens Sins goe in open view before them to judgement, it might be thought needless to perswade men <hi>to resist the Devil,</hi> when he appears in his own colours to make merchandise of them, and comes in a formal way to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

with them for their Souls; that which humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (however enthrall'd to Sin and Satan in a more my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious way) abhors, and none admit but those who are quite degenerated from humane kind. That which I shall further adde, shall be by way of Caution onely to suggest two things which are the forerunners to such Diabolical contracts, and put temptations into the hands of the Tempter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those Hellish passions of <hi>Malice, Envy</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> which are the black Form and Image of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himself; these when they are once ripened, fit men for the most <hi>Formal</hi> converse with the Devil that may be: That nature cannot easily abhorr him, which is so perfectly conformed to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The use of any <hi>Arts, Rites</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,</hi> of which we can give no Rational or Divine account; this indeed is nothing else but a kind of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> which the Devil himself owns, and gives life to, though he may not be corporeally present, or require presently any further Covenant from the users of them. The Devil no question is present to all his own Rites and Ceremonies, though men discern him not; and may upon the use of them secretly produce those <hi>Effects</hi> which may gain credit to them. Among these <hi>Rites</hi> we may reckon <hi>Insignificant forms of words,</hi> with their several modes and manner of pronunciation, <hi>Astre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical arts,</hi> and whatsoever else pretends to any <hi>strange Effects</hi> which we cannot with good reason either ascribe to God or Nature. As God will onely be convers'd withall in a way of Light and Understanding; so the Devil loves to be convers'd with in a way of Darkness and Obscurity.</p>

here bedewing his cheeks with tears, and hear these words sob'd and sighed out of his Heart, having lost his dear Father, one that took such special care of him whilst he was in the world. Methinks I see his Heart rent as well as his Garments, and there I see <hi>Elijah</hi> graven in letters as great as was his Love. How could he look on himself and not lament to think that he had lost his Head? how could he behold Israel unguarded, and not throw off his own clothes as a token of his <hi>Sorrow?</hi> It is said of <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> Jer. 22. 18. That <hi>they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my Brother, or ah my Sister; they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah Lord, or ah his Glory:</hi> which both shews that this is a Form of speech to denote <hi>sorrow;</hi> and that it is an <hi>Honour</hi> wicked men shall want, that none shall bemoan their Departure. But the Just shall be had in everlasting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, they shall die desired; and those who can value them, will not let them pass away in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and with dry eyes. No Tears are spent so well as for the want of God and a good Friend, or a Good man, especially such a one as i before described. And indeed who can think of his gracious lipps, his profitable and delightful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, his cordial love, without a sigh and a tear, without saying, <hi>Ah my Father, Ah his Glory?</hi>

No man will be sooner miss'd then such an one as he: Ten thousand others may steal out of the world, and no body scarce mind or inquire after them; but let <hi>Elijah</hi> goe away, and you shall have fifty men goe three days to seek him, that if it be possible they may enjoy his company a while longer. We find that <hi>Jesus</hi> himself wept for his friend <hi>Lazarus</hi> Joh. 11. 35. at which the Jews said, <hi>Behold how he loved him.</hi> Two Souls joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together in cordial love cannot part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a groan, especially a Son and his Father, a Scholar and his Master. The Child cannot hold it self from crying when it wants the Breast that used to feed it; nor can a Soul thirsty of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg but be pained, when the Fountain is stop'd that used to quench it. There are not so many of these men in the world but their loss will be as soon felt as the want of a stake in a rotten hedg, or of a Buttress against a bowing wall. He who knows one to have been a Light in the world and a Lamp unto him, will surely be melancholy and sad, when he sees that Light goe out and himself left in the dark, without that <gap reason="foreign">

3. We may further take notice <hi>of the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts he had of</hi> Elijah, <hi>of the Reverence, Worship and Respect which he gave unto him.</hi> For so we may look upon these Words as an Expression of <hi>the high Esteem</hi> he had of him, and <hi>Regard</hi> he bare to him, even after he was gone from this Earth, and could do no more kindnesses for him. <hi>Elisha,</hi> who had been a minister to him when he was below, and used to powre water upon his hands, could not but have very reverend thoughts toward him now that the Angels came to wait upon him, and in Flames of fire to carry him up above. He could not but honour him as his Elder and Father, as his Leader and Commander, as the General of the Sons of the Prophets, as the very Host and Army of Israel.

It had not been lawful I know to have worshipped <hi>Elijah,</hi> though he had been an Angel; but yet methinks I see <hi>Elisha</hi> bowing down with

some respect to the very <hi>Mantle</hi> which fel from his Master, and taking it up as a precious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of so holy a man. And I could very well pass some Civility upon the Gown in which this Holy man departed used for to walk, out of the great honour which I bear to him. There was so much of Divinity enshrined in this Excellent man's Soul, that it made every thing about him to have a kind of Sacredness in it, and will make his name to be alwaies as a sweet odour unto us.

                  <hi>one and the same measure of divine love.</hi> Suffer me then to use some of his words concerning him of whom we are now to speak. <q>None will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of humane nature to imitate <hi>Elijah</hi> in his shutting and opening of heaven, in his fasting so many daies, and going up to God in a fiery chariot; but in other things we will be bold to compare him with that great man, in his zealous faith, in his Cordial love to God, in his earnest desire and thirst <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as he speaks) after that which truly is, in an exact and exquisite life, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a look that was not one key below his intent and eager and sprightly Mind.

<pb n="503" facs="tcp:66374:280"/>
of <hi>Elijah.</hi> But if any man will needs urge us to strain a little higher, and compare some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him to his fasting fourty daies; then what say you to an every-days temperance? And if there must be something answerable to his going up to Heaven in a fiery Chariot; then look upon the other way of ascending thither, which is the best, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by an high transcendent conversation in this world, whereby he made a Chariot of his Vertues that he might ascend up unto God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But that I may proceed in this Argument ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our former Method,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us first look upon him in <hi>his Eminency, Dignity and Worth.</hi> A very glorious Star he was, &amp; shone brighter in our eyes then any that he ever look'd upon when he took his view of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies: and now he shines as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever, being wise and having turned many (I believe) unto Righteousness.</p>
               <p>I shall speak nothing of his <hi>Earthly</hi> parentage save only this, That herein he was like to <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, the last <hi>Elias,</hi> in that he was born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Parents had been long childless and were grown aged. Some have observed that such


<pb n="504" facs="tcp:66374:281"/>
have proved very famous; for they seem to be sent on purpose by God into the world to doe good, and to be scarce begotten by their Parents. Such are something like <hi>Isaac,</hi> who had a great blessing in him, and seem to be intended by God for some great service and work in the world.</p>
               <p>But let us look only at his <hi>Heavenly</hi> descent, and see how he was allied to God himself; for, as the Poet saies of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Contingit sanguine Coelum.</l>
                  </q>
I may say of him as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> saies of his Sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>His Country was Heaven, his Town or City was the Jerusalem which is above, his fellow-Citizens were the Saints, his Nobility was</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the retaining of the Divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and stamps upon his Soul, and being like to God the Archetype and First pattern of all Goodness.</hi> And indeed the preserving of the Heavenly Symbols that are in our Souls, and especially the purging and scowring of them from the corruption of Nature, he often spake of; and his endeavour was that the Divine image might be fairly reflected in him, and that it might shine brightly in the face of others.</p>
               <p>If I should speak much of <hi>the Vastness of his Learning</hi> (a thing not to be passed by,) it would seem to say that I knew all he was; which I am


<pb n="505" facs="tcp:66374:281"/>
not so arrogant as to assume unto my self: This I will say, That he could doe what he would. He had such a huge, wide capacity of Soul, such a sharp and piercing Understanding, such a deep reaching Mind, that he set himself about nothing but he soon grasped it and made himself a full possessour of it. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <hi>his great Industry and indefatigable pains,</hi> his <hi>Herculean</hi> labours day and night from his * First <note place="margin">April 5. 1636.</note> coming to the University till the time of his long sickness, joined with <hi>his large Parts,</hi> &amp; <hi>his frequent Meditation,</hi> Contemplation and Abstraction of his Mind from Sensible things; it must needs be concluded that he was a Comprehensour of more then I can say or think of; &amp; if I could, it would be too tedious to give you an account of all.</p>

this world. In this House our beloved Friend deceased staid between four and five and thirty years, and I am sure drank most large draughts from the hand of the former; for he was a <hi>Man,</hi> he was a <hi>Mind,</hi> he had nothing of that <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in him, and never in the least was known to sipp of her cups. He was a most laborious searcher after <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and never gave his Flesh the leisure to please it self in those entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and therefore we may be confident with that <hi>Charidemus,</hi> that God hath taken him to be his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <note place="margin">In vita Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrii.</note> as <hi>Eunapius</hi> speaks of <hi>Longinus,</hi> A <hi>living Library,</hi> better then that which he hath given to our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, <hi>and a walking Study,</hi> that carried his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about with him. I never got so much good among all my Books by a whole days plodding in a Study, as by an Houres discourse I have got with him. For he was not a Library lock'd up, nor a Book clasped, but stood open for any to converse withall that had a mind to learn. Yea he was a Fountain running over, labouring to doe good to those who perhaps had no mind to receive it. None more free and communicative then he was to such as desired to discourse with


<pb n="507" facs="tcp:66374:282"/>
him; nor would he grudge to be taken off from his studies upon such an occasion. It may be truely said of him, That a man might alwaies come Better from him; and his mouth could drop <hi>Sentences</hi> as easily as an ordinary man's could speak <hi>Sense.</hi> And he was no less happy in <hi>expressing</hi> his Mind, then in <hi>conceiving;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he seems to have excelled the famous Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher <hi>Plotin,</hi> of whom <hi>Porphyry</hi> tells us, that he was something careless of his words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but was wholy taken up into his Mind. He of whom we now speak had such a <hi>copia verborum,</hi> a plenty of words, and those so full, pregnant and significant, join'd with such an <hi>active Phansy,</hi> as is very rarely to be found in the company of such a <hi>deep Understanding</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> as dwelt in him.</p>
               <p>I have done with his <hi>Learning,</hi> when I have told you, That as he look'd upon Honours, Riches, and the eagerly-pursued things of this world, as Vanities; so did he look upon this also as a piece, though a more excellent piece, of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (as he was wont to phrase it) if compared with the higher and more divine accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Soul. For he did not care to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue himself by any of those things which were of a perishing nature, which should fail and


<pb n="508" facs="tcp:66374:283"/>
cease and vanish away, but only by those things which were more solid and substantial, of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Immortal nature, which he might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of the world with him; to which my Discourse shall not be long before it descend.</p>
               <p>He was of very singular <hi>Wisdom</hi> and great <hi>Prudence,</hi> of admirable skill and readiness in the managery of affairs, which I make an account is an Imitation of that Providence of God that governs the World. His <hi>Learning</hi> was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, that it lay not as an Idle notion in his Head, but made him fit for any imploiment. He was very full and clear in all his Resolutions at any debates, a most wise Counseller in any difficulties and streights, dextrous in untying any knot, of great judgment in satisfying any scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or doubt even in matters of Religion. He was one that soon saw into the depth of any busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that was before him, and look'd it quite through; that would presently turn it over and over in his Mind and see it on all sides; and he understood things so well at the First sight, that he did not often need any second thoughts, but usually stood to the present resolution and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his Mind.</p>
               <p>And adde to this his known <hi>Integrity, Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Faithfulness;</hi> his strong and lively, his

               <p>He had <hi>incorporated,</hi> shall I say, or <hi>insoul'd</hi> all Principles of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and made them one with himself. So that I may say of him in <hi>Antoninus</hi> his phrase, he was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, dip'd into <hi>Justice</hi> as it were <note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> over head and eares; he had not a slight super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial tincture, but was dyed and coloured quite through with it; so that wheresoever he had a Soul, there was <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Righteousness.</hi> They who knew him, very well know the truth of all this. And I am perswaded he did as heartily and cordially, as eagerly and earnestly doe what appeared to be <hi>Just and Right,</hi> without any Self-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or particular reflections, as any man living.</p>

Methinks I see how earnest he would be in a good matter which appeared to be Reasonable and Just, as though <hi>Justice</hi> her self had been in him, looking out at his Eyes, and speaking at his Mouth. It was a Vertue indeed that he had a great affection unto, and which he was very zealous to maintain; in whose quarrel he was in danger to be angry, and sometimes to break forth into a short passion.</p>
               <p>But he was alwaies very urgent upon us that by the Grace of God and the help of the mighty Spirit of Jesus Christ working in us, we would endeavour to purge out the corruption of our Natures, and to crucifie the Flesh with all the affections and lusts thereof: yea to subdue as much as it is possible even the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>His <hi>Patience</hi> was no less admirable then his <hi>Love,</hi> under a lingering and tedious disease, wherein he never murmured nor complained, but rested quietly satisfied in the Infinite Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Goodness and Tenderness of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Commiserations of Jesus Christ our merciful High Priest <hi>who can be touched with a feeling of our infirmities.</hi> He still resolved with <hi>Job, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him.</hi>

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:66374:285"/>
in thy sickness and sufferings; who canst not only <hi>talk</hi> but <hi>doe,</hi> not only <hi>doe</hi> but <hi>suffer!</hi> And he told me in his sickness that he hoped he had learned that for which God sent it, and that he thought God kept him so long in such a case, under such burdens and pressures, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience might have its perfect work in him.</hi> His sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness undoubtedly was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> speaks) a learned disease and full of true Philosophy, which taught him more of real Christianity, and made his Soul of a more strong, able, Athletick habit and temper. For, as S. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>if Patience have its perfect work,</hi> then is a Soul <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>entire, wanting nothing.</hi> And <note place="margin">Chap. 1. 4.</note> really in his Sickness he shewed what Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and True Religion is able to doe; what Might, Power and Virtue there is in it to bear up a Soul under the greatest loads; and that he could through Christ strengthening him doe all that which he so admirably discoursed of in his life.</p>
               <p>But for his <hi>Humility,</hi> it was that which was most apparent and conspicuous. You might have beheld in him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (as the same Father speaks) true humility in a most eminent degree, and the more eminent, considering how much there was within him


<pb n="513" facs="tcp:66374:285"/>
which would have swelled and puffed up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But from his first admission into the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie (as I am informed by those that knew him) he sought not great things for himself, but was contented in the condition wherein he was. He made not hast to rise and climb, as youths are apt to doe (which we in these late times too much experience, wherein Youths scarce fledg'd have soared to the highest prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) but proceeded leisurely by orderly steps not to what he could get, but to what he was fit to undertake. He stai'd God's time of advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with all industry and pains following his studies; as if he rather desired to deserve honour, then to be honoured. He shook off all Idleness and Sloth, the bane of youth, and so had the Blessing of God upon his endeavours, who gave him great encouragement from divers persons of worth, and at last brought him unto this place. And I challenge any one that is impartial to say, if since he came hither, they ever beheld in him any <hi>Pride, Vain-glory, Boasting, Self-conceit, Desire of honour and being famous in the world.</hi> No, there is not the man living that had the eyes ever to discern any thing of this <hi>swoln</hi> nature: but on the contrary it was easie to take notice of most profound <hi>Humility</hi> and Lowliness of mind,


<pb n="514" facs="tcp:66374:286"/>
which made him a true Disciple of Jesus Christ, who took upon him the form of a servant, and made himself of no reputation. And I dare say our dear friend was as true, as humble a servant (without any complement) to the good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as any person that this day lives. This was his designe in his studies, and if it had pleased the Lord of life to have prolonged his daies, it would have been more of his work: For he was resolved (as he once told me) very much to lay aside other studies, and to travel in the salvation of mens Souls, after whose good he most ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thirsted.</p>

It is likely that it did not busie it self about many fine Notions, Subtilties and Curiosities, or believing whole Volumes; but be sure it was that which was firmly set and fixed in the Mercy and Goodness of God through Christ; that also which brought down Christ into his Soul; which draw'd down Heaven into his Heart; which suck'd in life and strength continually from our Saviour; which made him hearty, serious and constant in all those forenamed Christian Vertues. His <hi>Faith</hi>


                  <pb n="515" facs="tcp:66374:286"/>

                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:66374:287"/>
I have transgressed too much my bounds, now it is so late; and trespassed perhaps too much upon your patience: Yet I hope I should not weary you, if I should discourse upon his <hi>Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> his <hi>Courtesie,</hi> his <hi>Gentleness and Sweetness,</hi> with many other things of the like nature. And let me say thus much, that he was far from that Spirit of <hi>devouting zeal</hi> that now too much rages. He would rather have been consumed in the service of men, then have called for fire down from heaven, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did, to consume them. And therefore though <hi>Elijah</hi> excelled him in this, that he ascended up to Heaven in a fiery chariot; yet herein I may say he was above the spirit of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that he called for no fire to descend from heaven upon men, but the fire of Divine love that might burn up all their Hatreds, Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Cruelty to each other. But as for <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity</hi> of Mind and Christian kindness, every body that knew him will remember that he ever had their names in his mouth, and I assure them they were no less in his heart and life; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that without these Truth it self is in a facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Christ is drawn into a party. And this Graciousness of Spirit was the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in him, because he was of a temper natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Hot and Cholerick, as the greatest Minds


<pb n="517" facs="tcp:66374:287"/>
most commonly are. He was wiser then to let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Anger rest in his bosom; much less did he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to burn and boil til it was turned into gall and bitterness; and least of all would he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that any Passion should lodge in him, till it was become a cankered Malice and black Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, which men in these days can scarce hide, but let it appear in their countenance and in their carriage towards others.</p>
               <p>If he was at any time moved unto Anger, it was but a sudden flushing in his face, and it did as soon vanish as arise; and it used to arise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no such occasions as I now speak of. No, whensoever he look'd upon the fierce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming Fires that were in mens Souls, it made him <hi>sad,</hi> not <hi>angry;</hi> and it was his constant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inspire mens Souls with more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne and kindly heats, that they might warm but not scorch their Brethren.</p>
               <p>And from this Spirit, together with the rest of Christian Graces that were in him, there did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult a great Serenity, Quiet and Tranquillity in his Soul, which dwelt so much above, that it was not shaken with any of those Tempests and Storms which use to unsettle more low and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Minds. He lived in a continued sweet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, and so was not disquieted with


<pb n="518" facs="tcp:66374:288"/>
scruples or doubts of his Salvation. There was alwaies discernable in him a chearful sense of God's goodness, which ceased not in the time of sickness. But we most longed for to see the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Soul, when he drew near to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of his rest. He that had such a constant fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God within him, we might conclude would have the most strong and powerful sense when he came nearer to a close conjunction with him. But God was pleased to deny this to us, and by a Lethargick distemper which seized on his Spirits, he passed the six last daies of his life (if I may call it <hi>a life)</hi> in a kind of Sleep, and without taking much notice of any thing he slept in the Lord.</p>
               <p>And now have I not described a Person of Worth and Eminency? Have we not reason to be so sad, as you see our Faces tell you that we are? But alas! half of that is not told you which your Eyes might have seen, had you been acquainted with him. I want thoughts and Words to make a lively pourtraiture of him: my young Experience hath not yet seen to the height or the depth of these things which I have here given you a rude draught of; and so my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts and Expressions must needs fall far below that excellent degree of beauty wherein they


<pb n="519" facs="tcp:66374:288"/>
dwelt in him. Let it suffice therefore to say (that I may keep to the word in the Text) That he was truly a <hi>Father,</hi> that he wanted Ages only to make him <hi>Reverend;</hi> and that if he had lived many Generations ago, &amp; left us the children of his Mind to posterity, he might by this time have been numbred among the Fathers of the Church.</p>
               <p>I have almost prevented my self already in the Two latter Particulars, <hi>His singular Care, and his great Usefulness;</hi> both which must needs be concluded from the former: <hi>His Care</hi> I say of others as a <hi>Tutor,</hi> his <hi>Usefullness</hi> as a <hi>Fellow</hi> of this now mournful Society. Let me speak a word or two of either.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All his Pupils (who are now truly <hi>Pupilli,</hi> Fatherless children) began to know in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness what it was to have and to want a loving Father, a faithful Tutor; and now they will know it more fully. He was one that did so constantly mind their good, that instilled such excellent pious Notions into their Minds, &amp; gave such light in everything a man could desire to know; that I could have been content, though in this gown, to have been his Pupil. His <hi>Life</hi> taught them continual lessons of <hi>Justice, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,


<pb n="520" facs="tcp:66374:289"/>
Prudence, Fortitude</hi> and Masculine vertue; and above all he taught them <hi>true Dependance upon God,</hi> and reference of themselves and all their Studies unto him; with <hi>true Faith in, and Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ:</hi> for which end he often expounded to them out of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. And for <hi>Humane learning,</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Scholars that came from under his hand do witness how dextrous he was at the training up of Youth in all good Literature. <hi>Porphyry</hi> tells us of <hi>Plotin,</hi> that he was such a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full person, that sundry Noble men and women with divers others, when they died, committed both their sons and daughters to his Tuition, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as unto some Tutelar Angel, or a sacred and divine Guardian. Truly those that come hither, are in a manner without Father and Mother; but they could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a more loving Tutor, a more holy and faithful Guardian, that would bring them up in all true Learning and Piety. If any think that he was too severe, let me tell them that they are such as find fault with the Lion <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="521" facs="tcp:66374:289"/>
solid, high and generous Principles, as few men are acquainted with, which made him very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous not only for Righteousness, Integrity and Holiness, but for a <hi>Decorum</hi> in all things. He had a great regard for all those things which are mentioned by the Apostle, Philip. 4. 8. for <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things were true, honest,</hi> (or rather, <hi>comely</hi> and <hi>grave, seemly</hi> and <hi>venerable,</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">

both my safe-guard and my ornament! who wast a Society by thy self, a College in brief, what a loss have we sustained by thy departure? That must not be resolved by me, nor by any one single person of us, but we must all lay our heads together to tell our loss. To which of us was not he dear? who is there that was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to him? who can think himself as wise as he was when we had him?</p>
               <p>And this our high and dear Esteem of him when he was with us, leads me to speak of that <hi>Honour and Reverence</hi> which we all express to his <hi>Name,</hi> that <hi>Affection</hi> which is in our Hearts to his <hi>Memory,</hi> the <hi>sense</hi> that is in us <hi>of our</hi> great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable <hi>loss;</hi> in Answer to those three forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Considerations about <hi>Elisha.</hi> But here I must be very brief, and put all together. There is none that knew his <hi>Worth,</hi> but honour his very dust. And for my part I honour him so much, that I wish we might doe as the Virgins of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el did for <hi>Jephtah's</hi> daughter, come once a year hither and lament his death; and so at once we might express all these Three, <hi>our Respect, Affection and Sense of our loss.</hi> His name is most worthy to be had in a more especial remembrance, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserves to be rank'd among our <hi>Benefactors,</hi> he having indowed our Library with all the


<pb n="523" facs="tcp:66374:290"/>
Books that he had, and we wanted; and I have reason to believe that if he had not been so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly surprised by those forgetful Lethargick fits, he intended to bestow more upon us then his Books, which yet were both many and choise ones, being above six hundred for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and many of them large and costly; and for the matter of them, many Hebrew Books, (besides some Arabick) many Mathematick Books, many Books of History both Ancient and Modern, as also of Philosophy and Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy both Sacred and Profane.</p>
               <p>And whensoever we commemorate his Love unto us, let it be with some <hi>Encomium:</hi> let us mourn <hi>quòd talem amiserimus,</hi> that we are deprived of such a person; but let us rejoice and give thanks to God <hi>quòd talem habuerimus,</hi> that we ever had such an one who hath done us so much good: they are the words of <hi>S. Hierom</hi> to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potian,</hi> with a little alteration.</p>
               <p>But let me tell you in conclusion of all, that herein would be shown <hi>our greatest Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> which we bare to him, this would be <hi>the greatest Honour</hi> of him, if we would but express his life in ours; that others might say when they behold us, There walks at least a shadow of Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi> And O that I might beg with <hi>Elisha</hi> a
