            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Humble Petition of <hi>Nathaniel Iones</hi> of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> in the County
of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> Clerk.</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat your Petitioner was moſt illegally ſequeſtred in the Year, 1648. without
any Charge of Delinquency, or the leaſt Teſtimony againſt him.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioner appealed to <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> Hall for relief, but they
being not impowred to give any in ſuch Caſes, your Petitioners name was
inſerted into the Act of Parliament for ſale, bearing date the 18. of <hi>Nov.</hi>
1652. whereby he was forced to proſecute his Complaints before the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Committee for Petitions, in the laſt Parliament, who ſent ſeverall
Orders to the Committee of the County of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> Commanding them
to Certifie how your Petitioners Caſe ſtood, and the grounds of his Sequeſtration.</p>
            <p>That the Committee of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> accordingly Certified, That you Petitioner was clear from
any matter of Fact againſt the State, and was onely ſequeſtred as a Scandalous Miniſter, not as a
Delinquent, there being never any ſuch Charge againſt him; Whereupon the Committee of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
ordered your Petitioners Caſe to be reported to the Parliament for his relief; but
they diſſolving before his Caſe was reported, your Petitioner petitioned his Highneſs for relief,
who granted your Petitioner a Reference to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> Hall, for them
to certifie the grounds of your Petitioners ſequeſtration; and they have likewiſe certified, That
your Petitioner had never any Delinquency charged upon Record againſt him; but this preſent
Parliament ſoon after aſſembling, His Highneſs pleaſure was not known thereupon.</p>
            <p>In tender conſideration of the Premiſes, And for that your Petitioner never Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the leaſt Act of Delinquency againſt the State; Nevertheleſs hath been deprived,
not onely of his Spiritual eſtate, and his own temporal means ſold from him, but had
lately a Copyhold Eſtate, held onely by the life of his wife, ſequeſtred and ſold alſo, to
the utter ruin of your poor Petitioner, his wife and family.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner moſt humbly beſeecheth this High and Honourable Court to do
him Juſtice, and reſtore unto him his Temporal Eſtate, ſo unjuſtly ſold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from him; And the Lord will not only bleſs your immediate proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but you will highly engage the oppreſſed ſoul of your Petitioner to bleſs
the Lord alſo on your behalf.</p>
