            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>So that there be twelve perſons in the caſe,
which ſtrive for this Church, and every one of
their parts hath been taken, ether by one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
or by another, which have argued the
ſame before me. So that now (I am ſure) there
is ſome expectation of the Gentlemen Auditors,
(which be many) which part I ſhall take in this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48304:5"/>
caſe: but before I ſhall tell you, with whom I
meane to take part, I ſhall expound unto you, the
pretty tale of a merry hoſt. For when once I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
over the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Owſe</hi> from
<hi>Lincolne</hi> towards <hi>York,</hi> I lodg'd at the houſe of a
merry hoſt, and being many of us gueſts at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
our hoſt told us of divers men of their Town
had been fiſhing in the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> where
were good ſtore of <hi>Salmons,</hi> and he asked his
gueſts how many <hi>Salmons</hi> we thought they had
got that day, where-upon ſome of us ſaid twenty,
others fifteen, others ten, &amp; ſome more, ſome leſs,
every one according to his own conceit and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
and when every gueſt, had ſaid by gueſſe
how many <hi>Salmons</hi> were caught, we were all of
us deſirous to know of him, how many they had
got, who very wittily, and unexpectedly told us,
that they had got, never a one. So I may apply
this jeaſt to our caſe. Here be twelve perſons in
the caſe pretend right to the avoydance of this
Church, and every one of the Gentlemen by
great and ſtrang chance, have taken ſeverall cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and alſo have held with a ſeverall party; ſo
that now (I am aſſured) it is much expected,
which of the parties I ſhall hold to have right to
the ſaid avodyance, whereupon (with the merry
hoſt) I do hold, that never a one of the parties in
the caſe; hath right to the Church for this time,
but that there is a perſon no named in the cauſe,
hath right to the preſentment, whoſe name I mean
to conceale till I grow towards the end of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
and therefore now I meane to diſtinguiſh
and divide my caſe into theſe ſeverall points, which

               <item>6. Whether the <hi>Jure Patronatus</hi> be well awarded
by the Biſhop elect or not, and whether the verdict of
the Jury nas according to Law or no.</item>
               <item>7. If the refuſall of the Clarkes was done upon a iuſt
ground or no, and whether notice was neceſſary or
not.</item>
               <item>8. If it be ſuch a Simony committed by and between
Sir <hi>Simon</hi> and his Clark, as that thereby the Clark

<hi>Plowden</hi> in <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Graunges</hi> caſe defineth a
Mannor to be <hi>quoddam Compoſitum</hi> of demeſnes
and ſervices: and I doe hold that a Mannor iss
a little Common-Wealth, and is compounded of
neceſſity, as things and cauſes without the which
it cannot be nor have perfect eſſence.</p>
            <list>
               <head>which three things be,</head>
               <item>1. Scitum pro habitatione Domini

               </item>
               <item>2. Services to be done by the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants

            </list>
            <p>And theſe be all the things which be of neceſſity
required in the eſſence of a perfect Mannor.
For if any of theſe be wanting, there is but an
Nuncupative Mannor as it is tearmed in Sir
<hi>Moyle Finches</hi> caſe in the Lord <hi>Cooks</hi> rep:<note place="margin">Cook. rep. 6.</note> or
rather (as I may more fitly terme it) And ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary

            </p>
            <p>There be divers things which be not required, <hi>ex
rei neceſſitate</hi> to the making of a Mannor, &amp; yet for
divers reſpects and conſiderations they be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to appertaine thereunto, as warrens of <hi>Counyes,</hi>

hath wrought the opinion of men to be, that
it is parcell of the Mannor, becauſe Livery and
ſeiſin might have bene made of it, but the Law
in that caſe being altered, I ſee no reaſon but that
may ſtand in equipage and equall termes with a

            <p>It is fit in the handling of this point, to diſpute

not, &amp; <hi>I</hi> hold it cannot, the reaſons whereof are fit
to be ſet forth and declared. I confeſſe that the
Law is taken in 33. H. 8. in <hi>Brookes</hi> Caſes, pl.

cannot be made at this day, Although a man gives
divers parcells of Land, <hi>Seperaliter in taile Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandum</hi>
of his chiefe Manſion-houſe, and ſome
men have been of opinion that Mannors might
have been made untill the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> the
third of <hi>Quia Emplores terrarum</hi> did take place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that Statute took away the Feſans of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures,
<hi>Iator veray ſeigniour, &amp; veray tenants,</hi>
which muſt be, and concurre where there ſhall be
a Mannor; but I do hold [for mine owne part]
that there be two materiall cauſes, wherefore a
Mannor cannot be made <hi>De novo</hi> at this day; The
firſt, becauſe all this Realme ſoon after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
theroof by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror,
was devided into Mannors: So that al lands, &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Land was put within one Mannor or other, &amp;
therefore the Law was ſo ſatisfied in that, as there
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48304:8"/>
was an end of making of Mannors when the
cauſe ceaſed. 2ly. This word Mannor implieth
in it ſelfe, A being time out of memory, which
we call preſcription, and this appeareth to be ſo
by the ſaid books of 33. H. &amp; 35. H. 8. which
are, That a Mannor muſt be <hi>De tempore cuius
memoria hominum non exiſtit in contrarium:</hi>
               <note place="margin">33. and 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> H. 8.</note> So
that for theſe two reaſons, I am of opinion, That
neither a Subject nor the King can make a new
Mannor at this day, Alſo, for the abſurdity, It
were unfitting that every petty Free-holder by
giving ſeverall parcells of his Grounds to diverſe
ſeverall perſons, ſhould make himſelfe Lord of a
Mannor at this day.</p>
            <p>But the queſtion and point in my caſe is not
whether one might make a Mannor <hi>de novo</hi> at this
day, But whether, of one old and perfect Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
two Mannors may be made, and whether one
Mannor may be devided into two or not?</p>
            <p>It is true that our Law loves entierties, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
fraction, <hi>Quar union fait unity &amp; fraction

<hi>Lex non patitur fractiones,</hi> So in E. 4. The

               <hi>Sed hoc per ſtatutum:</hi> So by 3. E. 4.
and <hi>Dyer</hi> fol. Two Joyn-tennants cannot make
partition without a Deed, becauſe it is contrary
to the nature of Joyn-tennancy, to have a diviſion
or partition, So that we may collect, that where
the Law hath made an union, it diſlikes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and ſo it may be well held in argumentt
that one Mannor cannot be divided into two: yet,
in 9.<note place="margin">9. E. 4.</note> E. 4. fol. 17. If the Mannor of Dale be
held of the Mannor of Sale and Eſcheat, that is
parcell of the Mannor of Sale; So here is two
Mannors made into one, which proves the one
derived out of the other <hi>in principio, ſed non licet

ſo is 26.<note place="margin">26. H. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4</note> H. 8. fol. 4. that if a Mannor deſcend to

to come to one Mannor to do their ſuit and

tennants to that Mannor, they did their ſuit unto,
neither did it make both the ſaid mannor one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Mannor:<note place="margin">9 E 4.</note> In 9. E. 4 fol. 17. It is ſaid by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesby</hi>
that if I have a Mannor which lyeth in <hi>Dale,</hi>
and Sale, and I grant my Mannor in <hi>Dale,</hi> the
Grauntee hath a Mannor, and yet it ſhall extend
but only into <hi>Dale;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Finches.</note> And in Sir <hi>Moyle Finches</hi>
caſe, it is ſaid for Law, That if I have a Mannor
and grant part of the demeſnes and ſervices to <hi>I.
S.</hi> yet by this grant the Grauntee ſhall not have
a Mannor. Out of which two books I gather this
conceit; That if I have a Mannor, which doth
extend into Dale, and Sale, and there be demeſnes
and ſervices in either Town, and I grant my Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
in <hi>Dale,</hi> that the Grauntee hath a Mannor
there, and that which remaineth in Sale, ſhall be
but as things in groſſe and no Mannor; <hi>Sic e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſo,</hi>
If I grant all my Lands, Tenements, and
Hereditaments in Sale, the Grauntee ſhall not
have a Mannor, but the demeſnes and ſervices as
things in groſſe, and the Mannor ſhall remaine
with me in Dale.</p>
            <p>So I may conclude that Sir <hi>Symon</hi>
the Grauntee, hath a Mannor in

recover the moety of the Advowſon; and the reaſon
thereof (as <hi>I</hi> conceive) is, becauſe the <hi>Feme</hi> in the firſt
caſe, comes in upon the beſt poſſeſſion of her Husband,
and in her caſe, and in the caſe of the Recoveror they both
come in upon an ancient right, which is as well to the
advowſon as to the Land. And theſe be the reaſons (as
<hi>I</hi> conceive) wherefore the part of the Advowſon was to
come to them by vertue of the ſaid words, <hi>Cum pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iiis,</hi>
but without the ſaid words, (as <hi>I</hi> conceive by the
ſaid caſes) no part of the advowſon had come to them.
There is one other pretty caſe in 17.<note place="margin">17. E 3. 2. H. 7.</note> 
               <hi>E</hi> 3. Fol. 38. and in

a Mannour, and of an Advowſon appendant, and they
make partition of the Mannour and ſay nothing of the
Advowſon, the Advowſon remaineth in common undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
as it did before; and the reaſon (as <hi>I</hi> conceive) is
this, becauſe it ſtands as a thing indifferent, whether
partition be made of it or not, and there is neither profit
nor prejudice comes by the not dividing of it, more then
if it had been divided in the intendment of the Law: But
Maſter <hi>Stamford</hi> in his prerogative Fol.<note place="margin">4. Stamfords prerog. 43</note> 43. 8 hath the

which there is an Advowſon appendent, and <hi>I. S.</hi> graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the moity of the ſaid Mannour <hi>Cum pertinentijs,</hi> that
doth not paſſe the moity of the Advowſon without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

the caſe) is, becauſe by way of graunt, the part of the
Advowſon will not paſſe being the only act of the party,
and it will rather remaine then paſſe in a caſe indifferent,
<hi>quia poteſt facilius remanere quam removeri.</hi> Yet all theſe
caſes differ from my caſe in words, for that the Mannour
in Law is transferred to Sir <hi>Symon</hi> the grauntee, and that
which remained in <hi>Monſieur Avidus</hi> was but demeſnes
and ſervices in groſſe, (if the Law be as <hi>I</hi> have taken it to

               <head>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</head>
               <item>1. That ſome things the Wife, after the death
of her Husband, without doubt ſhall have.</item>

               <item>3. Other things ſhe ſhall have, <hi>Sub modo.</hi>

debts as were made to her before coverture, and which
be not recovered or received by the husband in his life

had <hi>poteſtatem alienandi, relaxandi, vel aliter diſponendi,</hi>

            <p>2dly; It is clear that all Chattells perſonall, as ready
Mony, Plate, Jewels, Apparell, Horſes, Kine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
goods of like nature, which a woman brings with
her in marriage, or which ſhe hath given to her during
coverture, the abſolute property therof is veſted in the
Baron, &amp; though he dye they ſhal go to his Executors and
Adminiſtrators, as appeareth by <hi>Fitzh. Nat.</hi> br: fol. 69.
and many other books.</p>
            <p>3dly; If a treſpaſſe be made upon he Lands of the
Wife, in the life of her Husband, as by breaking of his
cloſe, deſtroying of the Graſs and Corne, the wife, after
the death of her husband, ſhall have no action for the
puniſhing of theſe torts, for theſe were treſpaſses done
to ſuch things as the Baron ſole ſhould or might take the
profit of during coverture; but ſuch torts, treſpaſses and
injuries which extend to the hurt and dammage of the
wives inheritance, as pulling down of her houſes, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up and deſtroying the Trees, of theſe, the wife ſhall
joyne in the action with her husband in his life time, and
ſhall and may maintaine an action therof, after the death
of her husband. And this diverſity <hi>I</hi> collect out of the
bookes of 50.<note place="margin">50. H. 3</note>

briefe,<note place="margin">43. E. 3.</note> 933. But in this part another matter ariſeth,
which is,<note place="margin">21. R. 2.</note> whether the wife ſhall have the avoydance, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48304:12"/>
the preſentment to a Church which voydeth in the life
time of her husband, being her inheritance, and he dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he have preſented: And <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe ſhe ſhal; and ſo of
a Ward which hapneth in the life time of the husband, by
reaſon of the death of a free-tenant of the wife, for theſe
be Chattells reall. And yet if the Ward be ſeized by the
husband in his life time, or if he hath preſented to the
<hi>Church</hi> before his death, theſe acts do ſo veſt the ſame in
the husband, as that they do wholly deprive the wife therof.
I grant that the husband &amp; wife may joyn in the preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or joyn in the <hi>quare impedit,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if they do ſo, then
that will reſerve the ſame unto the wife after the death
of the husband. And <hi>I</hi> find by 15. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 9. that they may
joyn in the <hi>quare impedit,</hi> or the Baron may, if he will,
bring it alone; but in our caſe, becauſe the Baron hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Church, ſole without his wife, that thereby
ſuch an intereſt of the preſent avoydance is veſted in the
Baron; as, though the Biſhop after refuſe his Clark, yet
the preſentment ſhall goe to his Executors, and not to
the wife; And herewithall <hi>I</hi> intend to diſmiſs Miſtris
<hi>Parcella,</hi> and her Clarke, from the preferment of this
Church, at this time.</p>
            <p>4thly But to make good the fourth part of my diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which between the Executors of the Husband and
the wife, is a plaine <hi>Capiat qui capere poſſit,</hi> I find by 3.

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>fore I ſtiled the Univerſities Clark, by the name
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48304:12"/>
of Sir <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> For it is to be conceived that he had
commenced Batchelour of Art in ignorance; and the late
skirmiſh he made with <hi>Ignoramus</hi> of the Innes of Court
(being both of one bloud and kindred) may put us all in
perfect remembrance of him; yet both theſe kinſmen in
ignorance wanted not their favouring friends to help the
one of them into practiſe, and the other of them to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice,
when many a Learned and a ſtudious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(wanting help of friends) might ſit without both:
So much is this froward age, we live in, to be condemned,
the more we ſee ignorance preferred before learning and
vertuous qualities; and dull-pated Jobber-noles unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
advanced to places of profit and dignity, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a learned Muſe ſits in his Study, deſtitute of either;
Herein <hi>I</hi> taxed only the Time of partiality, that preferr'd
an ignorant Aſse, before a Learned Schoolman, a fault
too common in the Univerſity, and not without blame in
the Inns of Court and Chancery.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing we have Sir <hi>Ignoramus</hi> amongſt us in the
Schools of Law, let us now ſee if we can toſſe him like
a dogge in a blanket, and make him vomit out his Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and rid him of his ignorance; But ſhall we ſtrive
with an impoſſibility? <hi>Quia ignorantia ſua hoeret in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
in capite, &amp; in cute?</hi> Yes, and thruſt him into the
ſaid Litigious Rectory; a fit Chapleine for ſuch a
Church; Beſides, it may well be found out in the caſe,
that I intended not to ſpend much labour to reform Sir
<hi>Ignoramus,</hi> (counting the labour as endleſs as the Maides

to make him white:) But to vent our ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

from covetouſneſs, as that he ſold the Advowſon to Sir

mony for it, and yet according to the text of <hi>Fallere fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentem

            <p>The <hi>Seditious Schiſmatique</hi> woman, though her effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy

            <p>And ſeeing I had framed my caſe upon ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<hi>Chaos</hi> of non-conformities, I thought Maſter
<hi>Plurality,</hi> the ingroſſing Beneficer, ſhould be one of the

when he made the grant (though he was not convicted til
after) for after the conviction the forfeiture of the ſtatute had a
reach back to the Commencement of his offence, which was, when
he firſt became a Recuſant: But now I ſhall put you a ſhort caſe,
which falls between the Lord <hi>Cookes</hi> caſe and mine, and that is; If
one become a Recuſant, and then grant the next avoydance to a

queſtion whether the grant of the avoydance ſhould be avoyded;
And I think it ſhall, and the Univerſity ſhould have the preſentment
in that caſe: but the forfeiture of xxl. a moneth were cleer (in the
caſe) out of the Statute; For admitting he were a Recuſant foure

The caſe of Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> might be ſtrongly urged againſt
me, which is, that Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> became Officer to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
in <hi>Anno xx.</hi> of her Raign, (and he owed nothing) <hi>quo anno,</hi>
he purchaſed land, and then conveyed the land away, <hi>bona fide,</hi> when
he ſtood cleare and unindebted; and long after, in the 32. yeare
of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> he became indebted, and not before, yet that
land or Leaſe conveyed away, ſtood chargable with the debt; which
caſe I grant, becauſe he became accomptant when he firſt became Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer;
and although the grew not indebted till after, yet the cauſe
the Land was bound, was when he firſt became an Officer; but if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he became an Officer, he had paſſed away any Lands, or made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
any Leaſes, thoſe Lands or Leaſes ſhould not be charged; And
ſo is the Law and Reaſon in my caſe, that becauſe the Church fell
voyd when the Patron was not any Recuſant, and the preſentment
was then alſo made, that is the cauſe the Statute never could take
hold of this preſentment: but if (as in the Lord <hi>Cookes</hi> ſaid caſe)
he had been a Recuſant when the Church became firſt voyd, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had preſented, then (I think) it would have veſted in the

            <p>But ſeeing the preſentment which <hi>Monſieur Avidus</hi> made, ſaved

            <p>If the Patron Recuſant could have repealed his preſentment, then
the queſtion will ariſe, whether the ſame ſhall be trasferred over to

            <p>And as I have formerly ſaid, ſo I hold ſtill that the Patron could
not repeale or call back his preſentation; For it is more then a meer
power that he gives to the Clarke; for it is an intereſt for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,

and after, the Chauntry was given to the King by 1. <hi>E.</hi> 6. of Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
And whether the King might avoyd the ſaid Leaſe, and that
ſuch title of avoyding the ſame be transferred over to the King by
the ſaid Statute of Chaunteries or not, was the point: And it was
holden that it was; but becauſe there was a Fine with Proclamation
after ſhewne forth, which did barre the ſaid entaile, It therfore was
holden that the King was barred, as the iſſue of the Tenant in tayle,
the confirmer, was: which comes directly to my purpoſe; For<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

which is the act of the whole Realm, may and will ſet the party,
to whom the thing is aſſigned, in as good plight as the party was in
from whom the ſame was taken: So in our caſe, when as <hi>Monſieur
Avidus</hi> had preſented to the Church, and that he could not repeale
his preſentation, but that he was bound thereby, The revocation and
repeale of this preſentation could never by the act of 3. the King, be
transferred over to the Univerſity, becauſe the Act of Parliament

doth ſettle the ſame no otherwiſe in them then it was in the party

was dead, It could not veſt in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but
rather in the Executors of <hi>Monſieur Avidus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo, for theſe cauſes, I take it, that the Univerſity have no
right to the ſaid avoydance, and that they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the ſame upon their Clark, Sir <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> if ſo be
there had been no defect in the Clark himſelfe, which after
ſhall be found to be manifeſt againſt him, notwithſtanding

            <p>And ſo I will now paſſe over to the other points in the caſe which

            <p>The next thing to be handled in my caſe is,<note place="margin">6. Point.</note> whether the awarding

            <p>1. Before, as where diverſe and ſundry Clarks be preſented by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
and ſeverall Patrons (as it is in my caſe) there the Church is
litigious.</p>
            <p>2. So is it, if two Commiſſions be awarded at the ſuite of two
ſeverall Patrons, and in the one it is found for the one party, and
in the other for the other party, here the Church reſteth litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by this uncertaine verdict, and by theſe ſeverall preſentments.</p>
            <p>3. Alſo, if in a <hi>jure patronatus,</hi> it be found for one, and before the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48304:15"/>
Biſhop be requeſted by the Clark for whom it is found to admit
him, another doth preſent, here the Church is litigious after the
<hi>jure patronatus</hi> awarded.</p>
            <p>And I collect by the book of 21. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 44. That if <hi>I. S.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
his Clarke to the Biſhop, that if the Biſhop doubt of his
title, he may award a Commiſſion of <hi>jure patronatus,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that, not any other Patron doth preſent; And this I
collect by the ſaid books, for that it is there ſaid, That if two
Patrons preſent ſeverally, the Biſhop ſhall award two Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of <hi>jure patronatus,</hi> that is, one for either party; And it is
ſaid in the ſaid bookes, that the Biſhop is bound to admit the
Clark of him, for whom it is found; If the Clark ſo require him,
which he muſt doe or otherwiſe the Biſhop is not bound to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him, but may ſuffer the laps to incurre and take advantage
of it: But howſoever, I hold it plainely, the Church in my caſe
was litigious, and a <hi>jure patronatus</hi> was to be awarded: Now
then to declare the nature of a <hi>jure patronatus,</hi> and the points
of it, come juſtly into our conſideration. It is therefore to be
underſtood that a <hi>jure patronatus,</hi> is a Commiſſion awarded by
the Biſhop, and under his ſeale directed to ſome expert in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Law to ſummon a Jury, to enquire of theſe five points.</p>

               </note>

and the one findes for the one party, and the other for
the other party, here the Church remaines litigious ſtill, ſo that
the Biſhop may wel refuſe them both: but before the <hi>jure patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>
awarded, if it had bin his chance to have taken the wrong
clark, and have refuſed the other which had right the Biſhop
had then been a diſturber, <hi>quod nota pro different.</hi> But here is a
ſpeciall verdict which in judgment of the Law, is found for him
that hath right; Then, whether the Biſhop (at his perill) ought
to take notice of the Law in this caſe, I hold it very diſputable:
But yet, becauſe he is Judge in that caſe, I doe think it is at his
perill to know the Law, and to preſent a right perſon upon the
penalty of being a diſturber: And I have obſerved it in all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
of office, a verdict at large might be given by the Jury
<hi>ſuper veritatem facti,</hi> as in a <hi>Mandamus, &amp; Diem clauſit extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi>
and ſo in this caſe; For, here be no iſſues joyned as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Tryalls be, for there the verdict muſt be according to the
point of the iſſue; but in commiſſions awarded <hi>ex officio,</hi> the
enquiry may be, and ought to be, as large and ſpeciall as the
commiſſion is.</p>
            <p>But whether the particular finding of the diſabilities of the
Clarkes by the Jury, be within the ſaid five points of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
is now to be handled; And therefore firſt concerning
the clark of <hi>Monſieur Avidus,</hi> where the Jury findes he had a
former Benefice, whether that be a ſufficient cauſe to diſable the
Clark,<note place="margin">14 H. 7</note> or not, I find by 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. fol. 28. that it is no ſufficient
cauſe for the Biſhop to refuſe the clark becauſe he had a former
Benefice,<note place="margin">Hollands caſe. Co. 4. 10. E. 3.</note> yet it appeares in <hi>Hollands</hi> caſe, and in 10. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 1.

reſolved, that in all caſes which be ſufficient cauſes to deprive a

that <hi>ex conſequenti,</hi> It followes, that if it be a ſufficient cauſe of
deprivation, becauſe the clark had a former Benefice, then by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48304:16"/>
               <hi>Specots</hi> caſe, it a good cauſe of refuſall: And this is within the
5th Article <hi>de idonitate perſonarum,</hi> inquiorable by the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:
But for my own opinion, if that <hi>Monſieur Avidus</hi>
had right to the preſentment, I ſhould have held the having of a
former Benefice, to be a ſufficient cauſe to refuſe his clark, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(at the leaſt) the clark is deprivable for it, for the laſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice,
if not for the firſt alſo and even as one which hath a wife

            <p>But to paſſe this matter over, I muſt now enter into the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which be, and be not, in Law ſufficient to refuſe a clark pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>

Sir <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in that caſe, to make it queſtionable whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could have his clergy, becauſe (as I have heard) the

for that he was a haunter of Tavernes, and unlawfull games:
and was taken for a diſturber; yet I ſhall never commend that
Patron that ſhall make choice of a drunken clark.</p>
            <p>I hold it a ſufficient cauſe to refuſe a clark, which hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Simony,<note place="margin">8 Acts.</note> becauſe the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

offender therein. So that my opinion concerning <hi>B.</hi> and Sir <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus</hi>
two of the conformed clarks doth appeare.</p>
            <p>But now the matter of greater difficulty is, whether the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in the woman Patroneſſe, becauſe ſhe was a Schiſmaticke
were a good cauſe to refuſe her clark or not For although ſhe
was to be cenſured an ill member of the church, yet if her clark
were a competent perſon as he was (for ought that appeareth
to the contrary) in my caſe, I then doe think, that the Biſhop
could in no ſort juſtly refuſe him: But I am of opinion, that in
ſome caſes the offence of the Patron ſhall be a cauſe ſufficient
to refuſe his clark,<note place="margin">15 H. 7.</note> as in 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7. where the Biſhop refuſed the
clark, becauſe the Patron was excommunicate, and had ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
forty dayes: For there (by the Law) no man under
paine of Excommunication could communicate with him: But
I am of opinion that in caſes where the Patron is diſabled in the
point of Patronage,<note place="margin">3 H. 5. 3.</note> that there his clarke may be refuſed; As,
if he be outlawed,<note place="margin">14 H. 6. 56</note> for then the King ought to have the Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So where three joyntenants be, and they vary in preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48304:17"/>
here the parties have not preſented according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and therefore the Biſhop may refuſe their clarkes. So (I
take it) if <hi>I. S.</hi> preſent, and it appeare to the Biſhop that he
have no right to the preſentment; The Biſhop may refuſe his
clark; And becauſe this kind of Learning comes oft in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and yet is difficult; <hi>I</hi> ſhall therefore ſet down two or
three caſes to inſtruct a Biſhop now and then how to get a laps
by a ſtraine of wit; For I am of opinion (at this time) that if
the Preſentor have no right, the Biſhop may refuſe his Clarke,
and in a <hi>quare impedit</hi> he may well excuſe himſelfe, and may
(in ſome ſort) plead in chiefe to the right of the patronage:
And this opinion I doe both gather and maintaine by the caſes
enſuing, and that is by 5. <hi>H.</hi> 7. fol. 34. where in a <hi>quare impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi>
brought againſt the Biſhop,<note place="margin">5. H. 7.</note> the plaintiffe declared that he
was ſeized of the advowſon in Fee, and preſented on <hi>E.</hi> who
was received, inſtituted and inducted: and that after, the church
became voyd by the death of <hi>E.</hi> and remained voyd by the
ſpace of 6. moneths, and the defendant collated <hi>C.</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
thereunto, and after, the ſaid church became voyd by
the death of <hi>C.</hi> And that therefore now it appertaines to him
to preſent, and the defendant did diſturb him: The defendant
pleaded, that one <hi>I. S.</hi> did preſent the ſaid <hi>C.</hi> unto him as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and he did admit him, and he was inſtituted and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into the church at the preſentment of the ſame, <hi>I. S.</hi> and
traverſed, <hi>Abſque hoc,</hi> that <hi>C.</hi> was collated by him. And this
plea by the better opinion of the booke was good, and yet it
doth entitle <hi>I. S.</hi> by the preſentment which was by diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
and did diſable the Plaintiffe thereby: And thus the
plaintiffe is diſabled by the plea of the Biſhop in point of
right.</p>
            <p>And,<note place="margin">22. H. 6.</note> In 22. <hi>H.</hi> 6 fol. 28. Sir <hi>Iohn Denhams</hi> caſe, which is,
that one brought a <hi>Quare imp.</hi> againſt the Biſhop and one R.
<hi>Chanon</hi> of St. <hi>Needs</hi> and declared that W. his Father was
ſeiſed in fee of the Mannor of <hi>Hatland,</hi> to the which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon
of the <hi>Abbathy</hi> of St. <hi>Needs</hi> was appendent, and that
the Abby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> voyded by the death of <hi>A.</hi> and his Father preſented
<hi>B.</hi> who was admitted, inſtituted and inducted at his preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that his Father dyed, whereby the mannour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48304:18"/>
deſcended to the Plaintiffe as next Heire, and that the
Abbey became void by the death of <hi>B.</hi> and ſo it belongs to him
to preſent, and he preſented his covenable Clark to the Biſhop
defendent, and he refuſed him.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop pleaded that the Abby of Saint <hi>Needs,</hi> time out
of memory, had been a Houſe of Abbot <hi>Prior</hi> and covent,
and that the <hi>Prior</hi> and <hi>covent</hi> have uſed, when the Abbey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
void, to elect one to be Abbot, and to preſent him to the
Biſhop, and if he found him a covenable clark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, and cauſed him to be inſtalled: And he ſaid, that the
Abbey became void, and the <hi>Prior</hi> and Covent did elect the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defendant and preſented him to the Defendant the Biſhop,
and he found him covenable, by reaſon whereof, he admitted of
him and cauſed him to be inſtalled, and ſo claimeth nothing but
as Ordinary: and by the direction of the Court he traverſed the
appendancy, which is an excellent caſe for my purpoſe: For
hereby it appeares that the Biſhop pleaded an Iſſuable plea to
the <hi>Droit</hi> of the church.</p>
            <p>And there is another caſe in 13.<note place="margin">13. H. 7.</note> H. 7. fol the 18. where the
Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife, brought a <hi>quare
Imp.</hi> againſt Sir <hi>Walter Hungerford,</hi> and declared how <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſſon</hi>
and others were ſeized of the advowſon in groſſe to the
uſe of the Plaintiffs, and they being ſo thereof ſeized, graunted
the Adowſon to <hi>R.</hi> who regraunted the ſame to them, and
ſhewes a preſentment, and that the church became void &amp;c. now
apperteineth for them to preſent, and they preſented their
<hi>Clark,</hi> And the Biſhop one of the Defendants, refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receive
him: The patron, the Biſhop, and the Incumbent, joyned
in a plea, and pleaded and ſet forth, that <hi>Mompeſſon,</hi> and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
co-Feoffees were, and ſtood ſeized of the Advowſon to the
uſe of Sir <hi>Walter Hungerford</hi> one of the Defendants, and of
his Heires Males of his bodie, and he preſented, <hi>Abſque hoc,</hi>
that the ſaid <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> and other his Co-feoffees were ſeized
to the uſe of the Plaintiffs: which Plea (no doubt) was a good
Plea for the Patron, and alſo for the inducted incumbent, ſince
the ſtatute of 25.<note place="margin">25. E. 3</note> E. 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. And I ſuppoſe that the Ordinary
hath ſuch an intereſt in the Church, as that he may alſo plead
thereunto, For, (as it appeares) the Patron and Ordinary in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48304:18"/>
the vacancy may actually charge the church, with a perpetuall
rent-charg, but not with annuity (as I take it.) And although<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
have held before me, that he ſhall be but in caſe as a diſſei
for which can plead no plea to the tenancy,<note place="margin">26. Aſs.</note> as 26. <hi>Aſsiſ.</hi> 49.
and 35 H.<note place="margin">35. H. 6.</note> 6. 13. is The reaſon there is, becauſe he is taken in the
Law to have no intereſt in the tennancy: but an Ordinary ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath ſome intereſt in the Church, conſidering he and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
may charg the Church in the time of Uacation, and he ſhall
ſet Clark therein if a lapſs come: yet I am of opinion, that if
<hi>I. S.</hi> diſſeiſe <hi>I. D.</hi> of a Mannour, to the which the Advowſon
of <hi>L.</hi> is belonging, that if <hi>I. S.</hi> preſent to that Church, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
cannot (upon penalty to be taken a diſturber) refuſe the
Clarke of <hi>I. S.</hi> unleſſe that <hi>I D.</hi> doe alſo preſent. for then he
ought to receive his Clarke; and my reaſon is, becauſe <hi>I. S.</hi>
had right to the Advowſon againſt all others but againſt the
Diſſeiſee, by reaſon of the poſſeſſion, which is ſufficient to cloſe
the hands of the Ordinary.</p>
            <p>Theſe caſes I have put purpoſely to maintain the title of the
Biſhop, becauſe I hold, that the refuſall of the Clarke of the
<hi>Feme</hi> Schiſmatique, is not any ſufficient cauſe, but that ſhe fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in point of right, which by theſe caſes, is proved, that, the
Ordinary might plead and juſtifie againſt her.</p>
            <p>But, to proceed a little further in this learning, It is requiſite
for me to declare, how and in what manner theſe cauſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſals
ought to be ſhewen by the Biſhop, and how and before
whom they ſhalbe tryed,<note place="margin">Specots <hi>caſc.</hi>
               </note> It is plaine by <hi>Specotts</hi> caſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
that, for the Biſhop to excuſe himſelf in a <hi>quare imp:</hi> for
refuſing of a Clarke, <hi>quia fuit Schiſmaticus inveteratus</hi> was
no ſufficient cauſe, but he ought to have ſhewen <hi>in q' o &amp;

               <note place="margin">9. Eliz Dyer.</note> and ſo by 9. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Dyer</hi> aforeſaid, that the

            <p>Let theſe caſes ſuffice for this matter, becauſe I would not be
more tedious then my caſe doth afford me occaſion.</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe, ſome of the Gentlemen of the Bench, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe of <hi>Lincolnes-Inne,</hi> have argued much againſt the
Biſhops Title, becauſe he refuſed <hi>B.</hi> the Clark of <hi>Monſieur A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidus,</hi>
by reaſon he had a former benefice, &amp; Sir <hi>Ignoramus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was illiterate; and gave no notice thereof to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
which preſented them: But I ſhall give them a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
thereunto; which is, Firſt by the book of That if
the Biſhop refuſe a Clark for nonability of literature, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
be a ſpirituall man which preſented him, the Biſhop need
not to give him notice thereof: contrary; if the Patron there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
be a Layman: And the Vniverſity is a learned Corporation
which can of themſelves, as well take notice of the learning of
the Clark, as of his perſon, which I take to be a ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to Sir <hi>Ignoramus</hi> and his Patron: And the next reaſon
ſhall extend to all the Clarks and Patrons alſo in my caſe (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the King and his Clark) and that I ground upon the ſaid
books of 22:<note place="margin">22. H. 6.</note> 
               <hi>H. 6. 8. 34. H.</hi> 6. which is, that where divers perſons
do preſent ſeverally their Clarks to the Biſhop,<note place="margin">34. H. 6.</note> and he awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a <hi>Iure patronatus</hi> which is not determined, but by reaſon
thereof, the 6. moneths paſſe, (as in our caſe,) yet in a <hi>quare
impedit,</hi> it ſhall be a ſufficient plea, for him, to plead that the
Church was litigious by reaſon of the ſeverall clarks preſented
and ſo remained untill the 6 moneths were paſſed, whereby he
collated his clark: And this ſhall be a good plea without ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth the proceedings in the <hi>Iure patronatus,</hi> and the ſpes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciall
verdict thereupon given.</p>
            <p>So that I hope thoſe Gentlemen which have argued for
<hi>Monſieur plurality,</hi> and for Sir <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> will reſt ſatisfied
with this anſwer, till I come neere the end of my caſe, and then
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48304:19"/>
I hope I ſhall more fully reſolve them, that the Law is againſt
their Clyents, howſoever the exceptions were wittily and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
taken; and ſo, now I intend to proceed to the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the 8 point of my caſe.</p>
            <p>The eight point of my caſe,<note place="margin">8 Point.</note> is, whether the contract which
<hi>E.</hi> made with Sir <hi>Symon Magus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to further his inſtitution be
ſuch a ſimony as ſhall cauſe <hi>E.</hi> if he had come in upon a good
title to forfeit the Church as alſo to cauſe the ſaid Sir <hi>Symon</hi>
to looſe his, preſentation <hi>hac vice,</hi> and to forfeit the ſame to
the crowne or not,<note place="margin">31. Eliz.</note> which is grounded upon the Statute of 31.
<hi>Eliz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Statute ſeemeth plainly to diſtinguiſh betwixt Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
given; or contracted for, for and concerning the preſentment
and where it is concerning the Inſtitution and Induction, for
where the Patron contracteth to have or take for the preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
he loſeth his preſentment, and it is forfeit to the
crowne: But if the Clark contract, or give any thing for to
further his Inſtitution, he doth only looſe the preferment of
that Church, and the Patron is to have the preſentation, and
doth not forfeit it for the abuſe of his Clark: I grant, that Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicall
contracts are deteſtable, before God and man, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo penall an offence; It is fit it ſhould be well proved, ere
the offendor be puniſhed: And I cannot perceive but that the
preſentment ſtood cleare without any touch of Simony.</p>
            <p>And although Sir <hi>Symon</hi> was <hi>particeps criminis,</hi> yet the
<hi>crimen</hi> was only in the contracting for, and concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
and not concerning the preſentation, and if it were
agreed colourably before the preſentation that Sir <hi>Symon</hi>
ſhould have nor take any thing for the preſentation, but only
to further the Inſtitution, then I ſhould take this concerning a
Simony againſt Sir <hi>Symon</hi> upon this ſtatute, for many of the
Gentlemen which argued the caſe, doubted, Sir <hi>Symon</hi> intended
to defraud the Statute, fearing (becauſe he was a branch ſprung
from ſo bad a Tree) he could bring forth no better fruit.</p>
            <p>Therefore I will defend his act no further, but judging
upon matters no otherwiſe then I ſee, I cannot find any
juſt cauſe, in Law to entitle the King to the preſentation,
nor to excuſe Sir <hi>Symon</hi> of his unlawfull contract con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48304:20"/>
the inſtitution, whereby the Clark did forfeit his
preferment to the benefice; If ſo be that the party, with
whom the Clark did contract, had had power in the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as Sir <hi>Symon</hi> had not, yet to further it with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon
may be Simony.</p>
            <p>But now all this ſerveth well for the <hi>Eſlie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">9. Point.</note> to maintaine his
title by the lapſe: for ſeeing the Advowſon paſſed from the
Grauntor, by his graunt, and then the Vniverſity could not
have it by his recuſancy, nor the woman, becauſe if it had not
paſſed, yet it was ſetled in the Husband, and if it were well
transferred away by him, then it veſted in the Grauntee, and
that the multitude of preſentments made the Church litigious,
even againſt him that had the very right; and that there was no
ſuch ſimony in the caſe as might forfeit the preſentment to the
King, then were the Biſhops title, by lapſe the beſt; but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I intend to bid them all to one ſelfe banquet, I meane
they ſhall all taſt of the like cheere; And therefore I plainely
doe hold, the <hi>Eſlie,</hi> which is the Biſhop Elect, to have no right
nor title to collate by lapſe; and the reaſon is, becauſe he is not
ſacred, and ſo wants that perfection which a Biſhop ought to
have, that is, to collate to a Benefice.</p>
            <p>And in the handling of this point, I muſt ground my argument
upon the ſtatute of 25. H. 8. cap 20. Whereby I doe gather
that five things are requiſite to the perfection of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt is a <hi>Conge de Eſlier,</hi> directed from the King to the
Deane and Chapter by Letters patents, giving them leave there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
to proceed to the Election of a Biſhop.</p>
            <p>2ly, The Election of the deane and chapter, which is <hi>pro for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
tantum,</hi> for they are directed, whom they muſt
chooſe.</p>
            <p>3ly Then The certifying of their Election, and the mandate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to the Arch-Biſhop and two other Biſhops, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to conſecration.</p>
            <p>4ly The conſecration, by the which he received the <hi>pall, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction,</hi>
and <hi>Church ceremonies,</hi> which enabled him in <hi>rebus
ſpirituabitus,</hi> and made him capable thereof.</p>
            <p>5ly Inſtaltation and inthronization, by the which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48304:20"/>
to the temporalties of his Biſhoprick, and thereby was
enabled to ſue the ſame out of the Kings hands; by the which it
appeareth, that, till conſecration, he is not capable of the
ſpiritualities, and then, <hi>Ex conſequenti,</hi> it followes, that all
the ſaid patrons were miſtaken, to preſent their clarks to the
wrong Ordinary; and the Biſhop Elect was ſomewhat too haſty
to take upon him power in thoſe caſes, to play the part of a
perfect Ordinary before he was a conſecrated Biſhop. And for
the caſe put in <hi>Fitzh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">F. N. B. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Nat. Br.</hi> Fol. 2. E. which is, That if in
temps of vacation, and after ſuch time as there is a Biſhop
elect, a man have cauſe to ſue a writ of right, he may have it
directed to the bailiffs of the elect Biſhop; which I doe not
think to be law, under favour of that Book, becauſe, till he be
inſtalled, he hath no poſſeſſion of his temporalties, nor then
neither till he have ſued the ſame out of the Kings hands, as by
common experience is manifeſt. And the ſuing of a writ of
right concernes his temporall eſtate, and it appeares in <hi>Fitzh.
Nat. Br.</hi> Fol. 169 that till a Biſhop be ſacred he cannot have a
writ,<note place="margin">F. N. B. 169.</note> 
               <hi>De reſtitutione temporalium.</hi> And therefore before
then I ſuppoſe he hath not any power in his temporalities, nor
in the ſpiritualities till his conſecration be finiſhed. And by 21
E.<note place="margin">21. E. 3.</note> 3. 39. and 40. That from the conſecration the Biſhop ſhall
have his temporalities and not before, and from thence he ſhal
in writs and commiſsions be named Biſhop; and before he ſhal
only be named the Elect Biſhop, Notwithſtanding, In</p>
            <p>caſe in Co. 8. <hi>Trollopps</hi> caſe 69. it is ſaid, that a
Biſhop Elect, before he be ſacred, may certify an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication;
which may be law, becauſe the certification is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a miniſteriall act; but I ſuppoſe he cannot pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of excommunication. which is a juditiall act: For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is requiſite, he ſhould be a Biſhop ſacred though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized.</p>
            <p>So that now that I have deſtroyed the title of <hi>Monſieur A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidus</hi>
becauſe I hold the advowſon paſſed away to the graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
Sir <hi>Symon Magus;</hi> and hereby alſo the pretended title
of the Univerſity falls to the ground, becauſe the Graunt was
made before the Grauntor became a Recuſant, when he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48304:21"/>
ſtood <hi>Rectus in Eccleſia,</hi> and the title of the <hi>Feme</hi> was not
ſufficient to veſt this avoydance in her, becauſe it fell in the
life time of her husband and ſo was lawfully paſſed away to
the Grauntee, and the title of the King failes in point of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
and that Sir <hi>Symon</hi> preſented to a wrong perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Biſhop was not ſacred, and if it were made to a
right Biſhop, yet the church was litigious and ſo remained
6 moneths and that the lapſe could not apperteine to the
Biſhop elect, for the cauſes and reaſons aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it appeares, that not any of the perſons in
the caſe have right to the ſaid preſentment:</p>
            <p>Then,<note place="margin">10 point.</note> Now for the concluſion of my laſt point; It comes
moſt fitly to be ſhewen, what perſon hath the beſt right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>And that (I hold) is the garden of the ſpiritualities, which
moſt commonly is the Dean and Chapter, during the vacancy
of the Biſhoprick, becauſe the Biſhop is to preſent by Lapſs,
<hi>ratione Spiritualium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, If a Biſhop have an Advowſon belonging to a Mannour,
or to his temporalities, which voydeth during the vacancy, there
the King ſhall have the preſentation, for that comes to him,
