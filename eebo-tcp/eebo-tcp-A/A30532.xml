            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOW long shall it be ere the wickednesse of the wicked come to an end, and the measure of this generations iniquity be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, who rush into iniquity as a Horse into the battel, and who hastens to fill up the largest measure of iniquity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generation that ever went before? Is it not plain and manifest to all people that have but an eye to see? How doth the wicked run on gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, drinking up iniquity as an Oxe drinks water? How doth the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of <hi>Babylon</hi> shoot at the innocent, and makes the harmless their prey? But this is but fot a moment, the end thereof is nigh, and because the Devils time is but short, therefore he is come down in rage, and hath filled the hearts of many people with raving envie and despite against the Lord and his people, whom the Lord is a gathering out of the mouths of all their enemies; and the Serpents seed it bruiseth the heele, but its head is deadly wounded by the seed of God.</p>
            <p>And whereas many hath set themselves in opposition against the Lord, and their work is become a stinck and a proverb to be laughed at in generations to come, yet must not the wicked cease their wickedness til their measure be perfectly accomplished. And whereas <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> a professed <hi>Minister</hi> in <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> known to many by his fruits to be a corrupt Tree which brings not forth good fruit, who sends out of his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy lyes and false reports, and vain arguments to blind the eyes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they may not see the truth, and hath written once and again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52856:3"/>
the people of God, which he in scorn calls <hi>Quakers,</hi> some of which writings hath been sufficiently answered, and his shame and folly seen openly by all people; yet he (as a man not weary of wickednesse) hath sent forth a Paper, which he calls, <hi>A Sheet against the Quakers</hi>; wherein what was wanting of wickednesse in his former, is now fully brought forth out of his vessel, (a malicious heart) which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain within it self its rage, and fury, and madness against the innocent: but needs must his folly break forth openly, that all men may see it: And in this his foolish paper he hath twenty four reasons, which he saith, <hi>Moves him to conceive that no Christian or reasonable man should be a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or approve of, or excuse their way;</hi> now his Reasons we shall try. But first of all I say, It had been more honest for him to have made a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Reply to have defended his former works, and cleared himself of his former lyes and slanders truly charged against him, then to have past that slightly, and begin a-new to revile; for that Book which he often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and boasts of, callled, <hi>The Quakers Catechism,</hi> was sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and his folly laid open, by a friend to the truth, in a Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>An Answer to the Quakers Catechism,</hi> to which Book he never equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replyed to this day, which had been more honest to have cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from what is truly charged against him in that answer, then to have begun afresh to reproach and speak wickednesse; and this all people may consider of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His first Reason which he brings forth against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is, <hi>That they deny and revile the Churches and Ministers of Christ;</hi> and yet saith he <hi>cannot tel indeed of any Church or Ministry which is to be preferred before those that they do despise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To this I answer, That is utterly false; for we do not deny the Church and Ministers of Christ, nor do revile them, or any others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, but speaks the truth in nakedness to all people: The Church of Christ we own, and are of it, which are gathered out of the world through the preaching of the Gospel, and seperated from the world and all its works and wayes, which are evil, and are joined to Christ the Head, in the Spirit, and one to another as members of Christ; and these are born again, and are redeemed out of the world, and are of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, and of his Church, and members of his body, and this we own to be a Church, and are of it, who hath no fellowship with darknesse, nor no part with the practice of the workes of darknesse. And the Ministers of Christ we own, who have received the gift of the Ministry by the Holy Ghost, and exerciseth that gift by the Holy Ghost, whose call is from God, and their work of God, and their end alone his glory, such we own to be Ministers of Christ, and doth not revile or deny (as he falsly saith) such a Church, and such Ministers of Christ; but this we do, and without offence to God too, we do deny and bear our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against such a people who professeth themselves to be a Church,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52856:3"/>
and yet are in the pride, in the wickedness, and in the evil of this world, and not redeemed, clensed, and seperated from the works and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, such we do reprove for their hypocrisie, even all them that owns a title to a Church because they were sprinkled when they were Infants, and hath not another ground; and such who professeth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Ministers of Christ, who hath not received their Ministry by the gift of the Holy Ghost, neither are lead by the Spirit of Christ, but are such as Christ and the Apostles declared against, such we cannot own to be Ministers of Jesus Christ, but doth reprove them, and deny them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven such who preacheth for hire, and hath gifts and rewardt for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and set-places for so much a yeer, these we disown, and yet doth not offend God herein: And this in honesty I do shew to all people what that professed Church and professed Ministry is which we do deny, and what that Church and Ministry is which we do set up to be preferred, which is a right Ministry, and a right Church: And thus his reasonless reason is overturned and confounded, and is found to be no sufficient reason wherefore a man should not be a <hi>Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His second reason is, <hi>No wise man can be a Quaker</hi> (saith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Religion is an uncertain thing, and so is not the Religion that must save us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I answer, This again is utterly false, and no man that hath Gods wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would speak it; for our Religion which we professe is a certain thing, and we have openly declared it once and again, and this is it, <hi>To believe in Christ, and to receive Christ, and to be lead by the spirit of Christ, and caught in all things to love God with all the heart, and a mans neighbor as himself, and through the power of Christ dwelling in man, to do all good, and to be kept from all evil</hi>: This in very short is our Religion, and it is a very certain and established Religion, and this Religion we all agree in: And this in short is the substance of our faith, <hi>Even Christ in us, believed on, and received by us</hi>: This is the truth, and his lyes is judged; and if he say this is an uncertain Religion, let him give it under his hand, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to it, and he shall have a further Reply.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His third Reason is, <hi>No man of reason <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hould be a Quaker, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that amongst those scraps of their Religion which is made known, there is so much notorious falshood and ungodlinesse,</hi> saith he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Let all Christian people mark this his Reason, they are even lyes heaped one upon another: What secret slanders are these behinde our backs, who never would clear himself of what is truly charged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him in answer to his <hi>Catechism</hi>? his words are turned by as utter lyes: for that which we profess and practice for Religion, which we have made known by word and writing, is, uprightness, godliness, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth, and neither notorious falshood, nor ungodliness, as he wickedly saith: And why did not he make it appear what this notorious falshood and ungodliness had been? that had been more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52856:4"/>
then to cast his charges and prove nothing. And whereas he saith, <hi>The very person of Christ Iesus many of them doth blaspheme,</hi> &amp;c. this is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly false, for Jesus Christ have we owned and believed in onely, and for his sake we do, and suffer hard things.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His fourth Reason is, saith he, <hi>Because their false pernicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, their practical Religion doth much consist in most notorious wicked inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and uncharitableness, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Here is lye upon lye uttered, and wickedness joyned to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and drunk up as an Oxe drinks up water, and no conscience made thereof by <hi>Richard Baxter</hi>; it had been just to have mentioned these pernicious Doctrines, their practical Religion, injustice, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness, and not to have slandered in the dark: but we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Lord from all pernicious Doctrines and notorious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness whatsoever, and we find this false Reproacher guilty himself and his people, of what he accuseth the innocent: And so his words are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unto himself, and upon his own head I turn them.</p>

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His fifth Reason is, <hi>The worst of all,</hi> saith he, <hi>is, That they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves like malignant enemies to the very Church, and Gospel, and Servants of Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This man speaks as if he had sold himself wholly to lye: but my answer to his first Reason is sufficient to answer this also, and doth say, <hi>That the Cause, and the Church, and the Gospel and Servants of Iesus Christ we do fully and freely own, and are daylie exercised therein as the very Servants of Iesus, and are friends thereof in our hearts, and doth not behave our selves in any way as enemies thereunto:</hi> God will judge every lying tongue, and shall condemn our false Accusers guilty of that which they charge the guiltless, to reprove and bear witness against the wild, wicked, and rude conversations, and against such as have gotten the Saints words, and by art frame an hours discourse thereupon for so much a Sermon, or so much a yeer, to deny such to be a Church of Christ, and Ministers of Christ, this we do, and doth not behave our selves like enemies to the Church, or Gospel, or Ministers and servants of Christ, as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary wickedly saith.</p>
            <p n="6">6. His sixth Reason, saith he, <hi>That part of the Quakers peculiar Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which consists not in error and malignant impudency, is made up very much of it of childish and unreasonable foppery, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As I have said, No part of our Religion consists in error and malignant impudency, and as for that which he calls childish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable foppery, we stand not to mans judgement, for it is a small thing with us for to be judged of any man; for we do acknowledge that we are become fools for Christs sake, and herein we have cause to glory, though he upbraid us with it; and it was such as he who called <hi>Paul</hi> a Babler, and that his Doctrine was madness, as he saith ours in foppery; and let him know, that which is foolishnesse with man, is wisdom with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52856:4"/>
God; and we know God will confound the wisest of men by that which they may judge to be foolish, &amp; unreasonable, &amp; foppery; for to such who are lost our Gospel is hid, where the god of this world hath blinded their eye, as it is plain he hath done this our Adversaries, and that is the reason wherefore he hath sent forth such lying Scribbles from his study of wicked inventions; and let him make the best use of his wisdom he can, he can but serve the Devil with it, while his wisdom is sensual and divillish: And let him leave us to our childishnesse and folly, and let the issue prove whether is the safer guide.</p>
            <p n="7">7. His seventh Reason is, saith he, <hi>Their malignancy doth blinde them to make that the principal cause of their rage and reviling the Ministry which is plainly agreeable to the will of God, and necessary to the Churches good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is false also; we are not blinded, but doth see <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> and all such, to be out of the way of truth and peace: And as for <hi>rage, and reviling against the Ministers,</hi> that is false also, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we do openly reprove deceivers; and we know it is not agreeable to the will of God, and necessary to the Churches good, though he saith it is, for Ministers of Christ to take tythes, or to have a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; for never none of the Ministers of Christ that we read of in Scripture, either took tythes to maintain them, or had a set-mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but all that Christ allows to his Ministers, is to eat such things as were set before them. And in that he saith, <hi>We liken them to covetous Priests among the Iews,</hi> that is true; to whom should we liken them but to them that practised the same things as they do? And I am sure there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was priests in any generation that were more covetous then these of <hi>England</hi> are, as in many particulars might be shewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as the false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in <hi>Israel</hi> did, so do these in many things; and what the Ministers of Christ did, these do not: And whereas he pleads for tythes, never Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Christ did in the Gospel-administration claim the tenth of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples labours, nor none of the Ministers of Christ were maintained by tythes, but lived of the Gospel which they preached, which lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was not great sums of money, and compelling some of it too from the people by a Law; but the Churches ministered to the Apostles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, whom the Apostles had begotten to the faith, and planted them as a Vinyard, and kept them as a Flock: But the maintenance of the Priests of <hi>England</hi> is another case, they must have so much a yeer, and people is bound to pay them, and sometimes so much a Sermon; and they maintain themselves in idlenesse, and fulnesse, and pride, and spend the Creation more then upon their necessities: But he saith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning tythes, That tythes are the <hi>Churches, and not the peoples, and by the Law of the Land too.</hi> What the Law of the Land requires, which is just, we do own, and do not resist it, but obey it; but what the Law of the Land commands, which is contrary to the Law of God, as the Law
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52856:5"/>
is which commands to pay tythes; we cannot be obedient to it; for we read in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that Law which commanded to pay tythes, &amp; take tythes in the old Covenant, is put to an end, and Christ the second Priesthood established, and the priesthood being changed, there was a necessity of change of the Law also which upheld the priesthood: Then whence is that Law of the Land which commands tythes of God, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otherwise? judge ye, seeing the Scripture saith, <hi>The Commandment going before (viz.</hi> that gave tythes) <hi>is disannulled.</hi>

            <p n="8">8. His eighth Reason, <hi>The Quakers way is too cruel and uncharitable to be the way of God, they damn</hi> (saith he) <hi>the most humble, holy, faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, to whom God hath promised life, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is not the least of his lyes, our way is Christ, and is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruel nor uncharitable, but pure, and holy, and zealous against all sin, and cannot bear and suffer iniquity, but reproves it; neither do we damn any, but warns all to repent, to be humble and lowly, that they may have the promise of life; and we sharply reprove sin, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and deceit, and this makes the men of this generation mad, and calls it cruel and uncharitable, whenas we do but warn them of their sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shewing them if they live in sin they perish, and if they repent and turn to God, they shall be saved; and God hath given us the spirit of discerning, and by their fruits we do know a child of God from a child of the devil, and herein do establish the Gospel, and not <hi>repeal it,</hi> though he falsly saith so; neither do we condem any who fear the Lord, in any thing they do, or speake in his fear, but with such we have unity, who walks in uprightness in the midst of a malicious world, and perverse generation, as this is.</p>
            <p n="9">9. His nineth Reason, saith he, <hi>After all their sins they most impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Ans.</hi> What such as are in darknesse doth conceive of us, and so ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it matters not; but many of us do witnesse that Christ hath done away our sins, and in him we are compleat through faith, in which we are perfect without sin, and it is not of our selves; and that perfection we exhort all to presse after, that they may be perfect in Christ Jesus without sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And he saith, <hi>They themselves desire a sinlesse perfection,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

hath bent his tongue for lyes, and made them his refuge and strong Reasons.</p>
            <p n="10">10. His tenth Reason, <hi>That we do in many Doctrines so openly comply with the Papist, that people may see plainly that the Iesuits and Fryars are our Leaders</hi>; and he saith, <hi>this hath been proved by many Confessions, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Papist we utterly deny, their Doctrines, their wayes, and whatsoever savours of popery, and are not lead by any other but by Jesus Christ, as our lives and Doctrines doth make appear to all that have an eye to see; it's true we may be falsly slandered and accused by <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> and by the Priests and the wicked people of the world, for it is enough for us to be as our Master Christ, who was called a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and as was he, so are we slandered and accused in this and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: But that ever it was proved that we are led by Jesuits and Fryars, this is one of our Adversaries slanders he hath once and again accused us, but he never proved it, though now he saith, <hi>The Papists make the Scriptures a dead Letter, and no Rule of faith, and so do we: The Papist cryes down our Church and Ministers,</hi> (saith he) <hi>The Iesuites cryes up free-will and sufficient grace to all, and a common sufficient light to all, and so do we</hi> (saith he:) <hi>The Papist extenuate imputed righteousnesse in setting up inherent righteousnesse: and the Papist place most in external abstenances and observances, and so do we,</hi> saith he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To all this I answer, What is truth we hold and maintain in the power of God, and may not deny it, though the Papists may hold the same in words, which seldom they do; for we hold the truth for the truths sake, and dare not deny the truth, though the devil confesse it in words; but he hath falsly compared us with the Papists and Jesuites, for we do not hold free-will in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither do we extenuate imputed righteousnesse, neither do we place most in external abstenances and observances, herein <hi>Richard Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> hath belyed us: But what if I should measure him by his own rule, and should say that the Jesuites and Fryars are his Leaders? Why, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the papists say Christ was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> and did many miracles, &amp; dyed, being crucified of the Jews, &amp; was buryed, and rose again, and so doth <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> say, and all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may we conjecture, they <hi>do but prepare people to be papists, or open In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> as he saith concerning us. But further, the papists say that sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Infants is baptizing into the faith of Christ, and they say none must be free from sin while they are upon earth, and they cry against heresie and error, and thus doth <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> and his company, and therefore by his own Arguments he may be judged that the Jesuites and Fryars are his Leaders, and that he prepares people to be papists; but I will not be so uncharitable to judge him <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by this rule, as he hath falsly done us, though I do know in the sight of God there is a greater concurrence in Doctrine, and practice, and conversation, between many of our Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers and the <hi>Papists,</hi> then there is between the <hi>Papists</hi> and us, and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52856:6"/>
light of Christ in all consciences shall answer me in the day of Gods righteous judgements, and the papists and him we do deny, and see them to be of one spirit, though differing in appearances; and what we are it is by grace, and not of our selves; and what we do it is through Christ, and not by our selves, and to God we appeal for judgement, and tramples upon all mens vain conceivings, false judgements, lyes and slanders, and turns them back to them again where they were hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
            <p n="11">11. His eleventh Reason: He saith, <hi>Our Doctrines are self-contradictory, and therefore they cannot be of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I answer, This is false, our Doctrines do agree in one, and are not self-contradictory, though falsly he may judge of this, as he may judge of other things; if he had been in Christs time, likely he would have judged his words self-contradictory, who said, <hi>Except you eat my flesh, and drink my blood, you have no life in you</hi>; and yet at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of time said, <hi>The flesh profiteth nothing</hi>; with many other such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as might be brought. Why, but <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> tells you, <hi>We say all men have a sufficient light within them, and goes up and down, preaching it with great zeal.</hi> This is no more than the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> did, who told the Saints they needed no man to teach them, but as the Anointing in them, and yet preached unto them, and wrote Epistles to them, but did <hi>Iohn</hi> contradict himself? let wise men judge. And <hi>Iohn</hi> said <hi>Christ ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth every man that comes into the world with the true light</hi>; and no more then he did, do we contradict our seves herein, for we follow the same example, &amp; we say the Saints have the Annointing in them, and needs no man to teach them, and yet we do exhort them as the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> did. And he asks, what do we preach, <hi>If darknesse, who would have such Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers? if light, what needlesse labour is this, when all men have sufficient light already, &amp;c.</hi> To all this I answer, We preach light that all should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in it, and thereby should be lead out of darknesse, and the light is sufficient, being believed in by the creature, but all are not lead by it sufficiently, neither doth receive Christ: And we may ask him now, and say, <hi>If he preach darknesse</hi> (as it is likely he doth, rather then the light, because he smites at preaching the light that hath lighted every man that cometh into the world, and so in effect denies the Lord that bought him) <hi>then who would have such a Preacher? but if he preach the light, and not that light which doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world, which is Christ, and is sufficient,</hi> (as it seems by his own words he doth not, because he condemns us for it) <hi>then is he a Minister of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, according to his own confession.</hi> But whatever he judge, we are sent to <hi>turn people from darknesse to light, and from the power of Satan to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God</hi>; and herein we do as the Ministers of Christ did; but that wee revile the Ministers of Christ as blind guides, as saith he, this is false a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but such we bear witnesse against who preacheth for hire, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52856:6"/>
the Common-wealth, and are in the steps of the proud <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi> and all people that follows them are in darknesse as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were, and in the way of damnation, because they are not in the truth who follows not Christ, and yet such people are lightened with the light of Christ, and that is their condemnation because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in it, and it is sufficient to the condemnation of all such.</p>
            <p n="12">12. His twelfth Reason: Saith he, <hi>Consider also how sutable their Doctrine is to the interest and pleasure both of the Papist and the Devil, why,</hi> saith he, <hi>they damn all the Ministers and Churches of CHRIST, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, A lying tongue is but for a moment; though he makes lyes his refuge, yet shall they be swept away. Of the Ministers and Churches of Christ are we, and such as are so, they we own, and are one with them, though this man saith otherwise; and it doth little appear that our Doctrine is sutable to the interest and pleasure of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, for we finde them our enemies, and Gods enemies, and bears our witnesse against them, as against the devil, and do say that they are his off-spring, and that the Priests of <hi>England</hi> are their off-spring, such as are open lyars especially: But if we should reckon, we should find their Doctrine more agreeable to the papists in many things, then ours are, as I have instanced concerning sprinkling of Infants, and other things; but doth it follow that the papists and we agree because the papists declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them out of cruelty and wickednesse, and out of a murderous mind to divert people into idolatry and wicked superstition; and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against them out of love to peoples souls, that they should not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be deceived, and alwayes learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; and hath no other end to ourselves, God is our witnesse, but that people may be converted to the knowledge of God; &amp; as I said before, though the <hi>papists</hi> may hold some truth in words, and cry against some sort of people out of a wicked end, yet may not we therefore deny the truth as it is in Jesus, neither must be silent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring against sin and wickednesse; and let him say what he will concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any advantage the Devil reaps by us, it will but be the overthrow of his very kingdom: Why, but saith he, <hi>If we do but unchurch all the reformed Churches, the Papists will give us a fee</hi>: I say, it is a hard thing to unchurch them that never were truly churched; and that we seeke to unchurch such as are the Churches of Christ, this is utterly false, and the papists fee and his reproach, we trample upon them both together; and let him take the papists fee, as he pleads for it, for it was they first that took tythes for a see, and it is he now that strongly pleads for them, to be maintained in his Ministry by them.</p>
            <p n="13">13. His thirteenth Reason: Saith he, <hi>The Doctrine and practice of the Quakers is contrary to the experience and holy nature of the Saints; why,</hi> saith
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52856:7"/>
he, <hi>they have found a renewed light and life by the Scriptures and Ministry which the Quakers make so light of, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, This is as false as the rest, for with all the Saints that ever was upon earth, both in doctrine and practice we agree with them; and as for the peoples sakes of <hi>England,</hi> I wish his words were true, and that they had indeed found a renewing light and life by this Ministry; but though he may boast of it now, in the day of Gods righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it shall be found otherwise, when it shall be tryed, that the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath been but in form and appearance, from one likenesse to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not a renewing from death to life; and though there hath been something of God sometime appearing, a zeal and a desire after him in the Ministry of <hi>England</hi> in times past, yet from this day hath the Lord forsaken them, and such as were sober and sincere in what was made manifest, are now become revilers and reproachers, slanderers and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of the people of God, and from henceforth shall they not boast of many being converted by them from sin unto the way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But further he saith, <hi>We tell the people that their Ministry doth the people no good, and none are the better for it</hi>: If we do, we tell them true: And though he saith, <hi>The experiences of many thousands doth confute this,</hi> yet say I, the experiences of ten thousand times so many more shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it: It is true, there may be thousands like himself which will not stumble to belye their own souls, as he hath done of us; yet betwixt him and I in this matter God shall be our Judge, who hath not sent this Ministry, and yet it hath run, therefore it doth not, nor shall not profit the people at all: He saith, <hi>It is quite contrary to the nature of Saints to damn and reproach the Saints, and call them the children of the Devil</hi>: This is true; but it is not contrary to the nature of the Saints to reprove Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, such as professe that which they do not enjoy, and speak that which they have not received from the Lord, but steal from other mens words, such are many of the <hi>Teachers</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; and it was the way of Christ and his Apostles soundly to reprove such: And this is our way, and we do not reproach the Saints, nor damn them, and yet to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are not Saints, we dare not cry peace, but do say, <hi>The wicked, and such who forget God, shall be turned into Hell</hi>: And for this, <hi>David</hi> is our example.</p>
            <p n="14">14. His fourteenth Reason: He saith, <hi>The Quakers are unlikely to be better then other men seeing they are so notoriously proud</hi>; and thus this pride doth appeare: Saith he, <hi>It is the supposed spirit as God, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary holiness, and inspiration, and abilities, that they are proud of,</hi> and saith he, <hi>They proclaim themselves perfect without sin. And this is the pride he chargeth us with, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, We say that in Christ we are compleat, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles said to the Churches, and do not boast of it, neither are proud of it more then the Churches were, <hi>but in the Lord we will golry, and in him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52856:7"/>
again and again</hi>; and it is that which we presse after, and exhort all to presse after, <hi>to be perfect in him who takes away our sins, and gives pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the temptations of the Devil.</hi> And he saith, <hi>We pretend to know mens hearts</hi>: Yea, we do know <hi>that the heart of man is desparately wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things</hi>; and by mens words and works, we do know their hearts to be evil that acts and speakes wickednesse, <hi>For out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart the mouth speaketh:</hi> And if we should say we do not know mens hearts that acts and speaks wickednesse, we should be lyars: but as I said, <hi>What we are it is by grace in Christ, and we boast not of it in the flesh, but our glorying is onely in the Lord in spirit, that our names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of life.</hi> And as for our crying against deceivers, which he so much stumbles at, it is but the practice of Christ and his Apostles, as may be read thorow the Scriptures, and yet we do it not, no more then they did in <hi>self-exaltation,</hi> though he would charge us with it.</p>
            <p n="15">15. His fifteenth Reason: Saith he, <hi>They plainly discover a persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting spirit: Why (saith he) what man can in reason think but that they run up and down the world to bring Ministry into hatred, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, Little of this doth appear that our spirits are perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting spirits, for we pray for our enemies, and doth forgive them that doth evil intreat us, and renders to no man evil for evil; for if we had sought vengeance, or prosecuted the good Laws of <hi>England</hi> against those that had wronged and robbed us, and unjustly caused us to be put in prison, many might have deeply suffered by true Justice before this day, if we had not forgiven our enemies, and blessed them that hated us: Such hath been the cruelty acted upon us, that many might have been arraigned for felony if we had sought the prosecution of the good Laws and not forgiven our enemies.</p>
            <p>Why, but the main thing is, <hi>because we are moved to go up and down the world and declare against the false Ministers, and holding forth that Ministry, and truly applying it to many of the Teachers of England:</hi> But let all the world know, this is not from a persecuting spirit, no more then <hi>Isaiah</hi> did it, and <hi>Micha,</hi> and the rest of the Prophets and Apostles, who did zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously give their testimony against such as went for gifts and rewards, as the Teachers of <hi>England</hi> do; but this is that which he is offended at, and calls it <hi>a persecuting spirit,</hi> which is not so, but in love to peoples souls, that they may deny the evil, and follow the good: And <hi>that our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors have persecuted to death,</hi> as he saith, This is also a lye, and of the Devil, for our Ancestors were the Saints, who were called of God, and were not of the world, even as we are not of the world, and we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, but seeks not to persecute any, and gives our witnesse faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against this generation, and against the sinnes both of Teachers and people; and this I suppose is it, even our zeal for the Name of the Lord against unrighteousnesse, which he falsly calls <hi>a persecuting spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52856:8"/>16. His sixteenth Reason is, <hi>Some Interrogatories,</hi> (saith he) <hi>What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man should turn Quaker that sees the common fruit of their Doctrine? what good do they do whereever they come, but</hi> (saith he) <hi>hate both godly. Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and people, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I answer, The fruit of our Doctrine is begetting people to the knowledge of God, and a converting them from sin and death, and from the wayes and works of unrighteousnesse, to be the servants of the Lord; and every spiritual man doth see this to be the fruit of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: It doth condemn unrighteousnesse, and bring war and a sword upon earth, as Christs Doctrine did. And this is the good where wee come, Many are changed from wickednesse, rudenesse, and ungodlinesse, to live soberly, righteously, and purely in this present world, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence towards God and men. For to say, <hi>We make people both to hate god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Teachers and people,</hi> this is utterly false, for we endeavor to bring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the true Teacher, Christ Jesus, and to have fellowship with the Saints: It's true, in the world our Doctrine doth make division, and doth set a man at varience, and doth set Father against Son, and Son a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Father, even as Christ did, and his Doctrine, so he saith we do. But again he belyes us, in saying, <hi>We bring people into confusion and abominable error, or that we cast people into a malicious mood, or tincture of bitterness,</hi> this is also false, and this is my Answer, <hi>He that doth the will of our Father, knows of our Doctrine, whether we be of God, or of our selves, and to all the world besides we are unknown, and desires to be manifest to every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in the sight of God, and not to that wisdom which is of this world: And though he scorn at such who are made to cast off their</hi> Points <hi>and</hi> Lace, <hi>yet is not this more then any fruit that his Doctrine hath brought forth? for as we do, so did the Apostle exhort against all superfluity of naughtiness, as Points and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are; and it seems that such as depart from iniquity become a prey to such wicked mens slandering and scornful tongues, and a maner to make Bookes of, to send into the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. His seventeenth Reason: Saith he, <hi>It is no great encouragement to us to turn Quakers, when we consider who are their followers, very few expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced sober Christians turn to them, (saith he) but such who are ignorant, and ungrounded, and raw professors, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I answer, Let no man take encouragement from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, to turn <hi>Quaker,</hi> or to own the way of Gods salvation, but let every one feel a measure of God in his own heart, converting him from sinne unto righteousnesse, and drawing his mind from the vanity and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie of this world, to the truth and singlenesse of heart: And he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be of the spirit of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who said, <hi>None but a company of poor people which were accursed, followed Christ;</hi> and so saith he, in effect, None but such as are ignorant, and such like: But what if there were not any other but <hi>such</hi> who owned the way of the Lord? this is a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, rather then a cause of objecting against it, when such who

are ignorant are brought to the knowledge of God: But yet his words are false, for it is known, that very many honest, humble, sober men and people, who have all their dayes been sincere towards God in what they have known of him, have and do own us; and indeed, all that ever owns God and Salvation, shall own us, <hi>for we are of God, and he that is of God heareth us, and the whole world lyes in wickednesse</hi>: And such as are self-conceited, and in pride, and wise in their own eyes, and in the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the world, such are his followers, and not ours, though he false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say it; for such as follow Christ have we fellowship with, and not with such as walk in darkness.</p>
            <p n="18">18. His eighteenth Reason: Saith he, <hi>It is an evident judgement of God upon these people that turn Quakers, and a punishment for their former sins, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I answer, The Lord God, his Angels, and all his Saints and Servants I call to record against thee, and they all shall witnesse that it is mercy, and not judgement, upon them that owns the way of the Lord: And them that owned the Quakers in truth and sincerity, have and do witness a remission of their former sins, and forgiveness of them by Jesus Christ, and not a punishment for them: And <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> may please himself and some others with his reasonless Reasons, as these are, yet they are not worthy of the name of Reason, they be so senseless and utterly false. And though he railes against the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> as well as against us, yet any man whose eye is open, sees his folly, &amp; turns it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own head: And he may conceit himself in these things for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the day of the Lord will declare it otherwise, and that upon us mercy and peace shall be, and not judgement nor wrath.</p>
            <p n="19">19. His nineteenth Reason: Saith he, <hi>They are already in division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, as the contention between</hi> Nayler <hi>and</hi> Fox, <hi>and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doth shew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, Though an occasion may come and be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth, yet wo unto him by whom it comes, and to them who doth receive it, for the testimony of truth abides for ever. But as about that division he speakes of, it hath been answered by writings several times, and now I say, It happened but as a tryal to the Lords people, and not to destroy them; though the enemy boasts himself because of it, yet the Lord knows how to preserve his in the midst of temptation: But these things are now at an end, though a temptation presented it self, yet it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame not, and truth is the same, and the testimony thereof doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change: and all these refuges which the wicked flyes unto shall not cover them when the Lord appears.</p>
            <p n="20">20. His twentieth Reason: And saith he, <hi>To make all their delusions more odious wickednesse, they father it upon the Holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> His words are utterly false: yet we say we have received the Holy Ghost, which teacheth us, and leadeth us into all truth, and by it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52856:9"/>
are we lead out of all wickedness and delusion, and all wicked speeches which he brands us withall, and these things are his own, for he is seen to be in delusion, and odious wickedness, and wicked speeches. And saith he, <hi>They speak against the DOCTRINE of the SPIRIT, and cryes down the love of the Saints, and against the Ordinances of the Ministers of Christ.</hi> To this I have answered, In the love &amp; union with all the Saints we are, and Ministers of Christ, but against Hypocrisie we declare, such who profess what they are not, and use their tongues, and saith the Lord saith, when the Lord hath not spoken to them; and sprinkle Infants, and saith it is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n ordinance of Christ; and singing <hi>Davids</hi> Experiences in Rime and Meeter, with many other things which the Priests hath in their practice, such things we deny to be Ordinances of Christ, and them to be Ministers of Christ which do practice them; and this we do say by the spirit of truth: But that <hi>we prenounce damnation against Gods Church and holy Servants,</hi> this is false again, and is but the fulfilling the number of his lyes; and though he charge us secretly with preaching another Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel then that which <hi>Paul</hi> preached, is false; and if we duly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, it will be he that wil be sound preaching another Gospel, whose practice is found in many things contrary to them who were Ministers of the true Gospel, and so the curse pronounced by the Apostle will fall upon him, and not upon us in the day of judgement.</p>
            <p n="21">21. His one and twentieth Reason: Saith he, <hi>The Quakers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves renounce in words the Ranters and Papists as a deluded sort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To which I answer and say, Yea, not onely in words, but in lives also we utterly abhor the Ranters and Papists both in profession and practice, and do know that <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> is of the same spirit, though differing in words. But saith he, <hi>The Ranters and Drunkards cryes out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same Ministers and same exercise and godly people as the Quakers do.</hi> To which I answer, What the Ranters and Drunkards may do in their wickedness and unclean spirits, is one thing, and what we do in the fear of God and tender love to peoples souls, is another thing; but how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable is this man in his judgement? Let us try him, as if I should say, The Ranters, and drunkards, and prophane, and all ungodly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are our enemies, and doth oppose &amp; gain say the way of God, and the people called Quakers, and they beat them, and reproach them, and slander them, and doth much cruelty unto them; and thus doth <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Baxter</hi> of <hi>Kedderminster,</hi> he reviles them, and reproaches them, and belyes them, and therefore he is one with the Ranters, and drunkards, and prophane people, and he holds part of the Papists, Ranters, and drunkards doctrine and practice: And thus he is judged with his own Rule, according as he hath judged us, by the same Rule; and now say I as well as he of us, Let any man judge that hath not for sworn all wit and reason, whether it is likely the Holy Ghost will inspire <hi>Richard Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and a company of Priests of <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint them with the same
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52856:9"/>
Points, Doctrines, and Practices, which the Papists, Ranters, Drunkards, and all prophane people exercise themselves in; for as all they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> so is he and his company. And farther I ask him, Whether the same things be heavenly in <hi>Rich. Baxter</hi> and his company, which be hellish in the Ranters and Drunkards? And whether <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> hath not condemned himself and the Priests of <hi>England</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Papists, and Ranters, and Drunkards, and prophane peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in acting the very same things, to wit, speaking against, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reviling, and slandering, and backbiting an innocent people of God, called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22. His two and twentieth Reason: And saith he, <hi>If I have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be weary of the Christian Catholike reformed Religion, what reason have I to turn Quaker more then to any other Sect? Why (saith he) how do they prove they are more in the right then any other, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To all this I answer, This is according to his knowledge, who sees no difference between good and evil, between such as serveth God, and such as serves him not; and how can this man be a Teacher of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that is so blind himself? The true Christian Religion he is out of, and in a Sect, whose fruits are as bad as the <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Familists,</hi> or any others; for I believe not the worst of Sects could have brought forth more lyes and slanders, and scoffing words in one sheet of paper, then he hath done in this which now I deal withall. And as for our proof that we are in the right way, to every man that hath an eye to see, &amp; an ear to hear, and an heart to conceive, it's easie to be proved, and such are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; but as for unbelievers and persecutors, such as himself, they must hear, and see, and not perceive and understand.</p>
            <p n="23">23. His three and twentieth Reason: Saith he, <hi>The way by which they prevail is not producing any evidence, for they renounce that, and offers all from the Authority of the spirit within them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The way by which we prevail is by the spirit of the Lord which is within us, and that was the way whereby all the Ministers of Christ ever prevailed, by the authority of that. But yet this is false, we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to produce <hi>Evidences,</hi> but is sufficiently able, and hath done it, to produce <hi>Evidences</hi> out of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to prove all things which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse or practice for Religion. But saith he, <hi>They must prove their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission by Divine miracles before any reasonable man can believe it, &amp;c.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that fear God, and are in the purest Reason, hath believed us alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and doth see the mighty wonders of God brought to passe, and it cannot be believed by <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> no more then Christ was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> in whom the mighty power of God was made manifest, for though he did miracles, yet that generation could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. And he tells of some that said <hi>he was blind</hi>; so might they well do, and not lye, his blindnesse is made manifest at large. And saith he, <hi>But can I see the Witnesse in them that saith they have the witnesse in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52856:10"/>
Nay, because thou art an unbeliever thou canst not; but if thou wert a believer in Christ, thou wouldst feele the same testimony in the Brethren; but by thee we are not known, and therefore by thee are falsly judged; for no other testimony do we give or hold forth, but the same which the Apostles did, which we have received from Christ as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did, &amp; not by any Authority of our own, though he falsly say it, but by the Authority of the power of God; &amp; we shall not much seek or beg our Adversaries belief, for to God are we known, and one to another in the spirit, and not to the wisdom of the world, which is devillish, and knows not, nor receives not the things which be eternal.</p>
            <p>His last Reason: <hi>They teach but such like Doctrines, and takes the like course as many of the Hereticks did</hi>; and saith he, <hi>Shall we run our selves into the fire which hath consumed such Heresie through former Ages, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I answer, The Doctrines of the Gospel we hold forth and teach to all people, and in that way which is called Heresie, worship we indeed the God of our fathers; but it is but such as this man with whom I deal, who is a false witnesse-bearer, and a reproacher, and the company of Hireling-Teachers, and such like, that doth call the way of God Heresie. And though he say, presently after the Apostles dayes such Hereticks arose and troubled the Church. To which I answer, Nay it is just such like as himself, who appeared in the Apostles dayes, who taught for filthy lucre, and for gain made merchandize of souls; and it was such lying Prophets which <hi>Iohn</hi> saw the whole world run after in his dayes, and they were them that troubled the Church, even such as were heady, and high minded, and proud, and covetous men, and such as are false Accusers, and fierce men; and his shame and folly is made manifest, and so his lyes and slanders are turned upon his own head. And in his Conclusion he doth beseech Professors to consider impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of these 24. Reasons; to which I say, The most of them are so reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, that they will rather turn to his own confusion, then to his praise, to any man of understanding: And he bids all bethink themselves, first, <hi>What a doleful thing it is that professors should be so loose and unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Doleful it is indeed that after so much preaching of the Priests of <hi>England,</hi> people should be so ignorant, loose, and unstable as indeed they are, and this is a very shame to the Teachers, and shews that they were not sent of God, because that the people are not profited at all, but continues ignorant, loose, and unstable, and wicked, according to their own confession; and indeed, people are to be pittyed that are under their Ministry, who by it can never come to the knowledge of God, but must be ever learning fifty or sixty years, and ignorant, loose, and unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at their very end, and yet these are members of this Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so called, which the very Pastors thereof confesseth to be loose, and unstable, and wicked, and brands us to be denyers of this Church,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52856:10"/>
as indeed we have good reason, to see the members thereof so wicked, loose, and unstable, as is confessed by their own <hi>Teachers,</hi> therefore we cannot be condemned for denying such a <hi>Church.</hi> Secondly, He bids consider what <hi>a heavy judgement it is to professors themselves, to be self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and self-divided from the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, A heavy judgement indeed, that such as are of the <hi>Church</hi> should be self-condemned, and self-divided from it; but yet it is a blessed thing that any that have been deceived with false likenesse, now should come to see the error thereof, &amp; be turned to the true <hi>Church</hi> which is in God, and to be drawn away from all windy Doctrines of <hi>Englands Teachers,</hi> and this many doth witnesse. Then he exhorts <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> to be serious, and be true to the light which they have received: To which I say, All that are true to the light which they have received from <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> will deny this man I now deal withall, and all his lyes and slanders. Then he bids stick close to the Word of God; and I say, All that do so will finde it as a Fire &amp; a Hammer, and will be gathered from under the dead Doctrines of men in this Age. And he exhorts them to stick close to a faithful Ministry: To which I say, Then must they deny all <hi>Hirelings,</hi> and <hi>such as preacheth for hire,</hi> for such are not of the <hi>faithful Ministry,</hi> but deceivers of people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus in few words return is sent in the pursute of a Sheet of Lyes and Slanders put forth into the world, and all sober-minded people by this may come to a good understanding between Truth and error. And though he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urse to spread his Books as Ballads and Fables, by having them cryed up and down the streets, which is not for his advantage altogether, but doth shew his Work ridiculous to all wise men. And so hereby it may be seen that all his Strong Reasons are confounded and overturned, that would hinder a man from being a</hi> QUAKER.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52856:11"/>THe main and chief things I have spoken of, and by what is written in short, men of understanding may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what his whole matter can be: But in the beginning of his Book he falls a complaining of <hi>the lamentable Ignorance and ungodliness of common People; and of the pride, and self-conceitedness of Professors of godliness, and of the weaknes, and giddiness, and unstableness of others</hi>: To this I Answer; It is true, abundance are ignorant, and abundance are proud and self-conceited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and abundance unstable and giddy in their minds; and substract these from the whole Company of the Hearers of the Teachers of <hi>England,</hi> and there is but a few left (if any at all) that are truly righteous in the sight of God; and so to the shame of all the Teachers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> hath he confessed the truth in this particular; and sheweth that indeed the People is not profited by them: and this is a strong Argument that they were never sent of God, but hath ran and were never sent: But presently after that he cryes out of Hereticks and Deceivers, even like as the Pope doth; but what is he afraid of, That they that are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and ungodly, and proud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and self-conceited, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, and giddy, should be deceived, they that are in those iniquities are deceived already, and cannot possibly fall into greater deceit, or delusion. But it appears, That many of the Priests of <hi>England</hi> cares not how little their Hearers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by them, so if they can get their wages, their Hire, their great sums of money; for one of them said (I mean a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Minister of <hi>England</hi>) in <hi>Cambr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dge</hi>-shire, <hi>That he mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not if all his Hearers went to the Devil, so they would but give him his dues</hi>; to wit, <hi>Tythes and Maintenance.</hi> So that by this instance, you may judge what stock they are of, and what their endeavours are; and we desire that people may be undeceived of that wherein they are deceived, and that they may turn from such a generation of covetous Teachers, who care so little for their souls. And whereas he saith, The Quakers <hi>are but of a few years standing, and that they arose from among the Papists but a few years ago, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52856:11"/>To this I Answer, The People of God received that name but a few years ago, but the Saints were <hi>Quakers,</hi> I am able to prove, long before; for <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk; Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the rest were <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> though they were not called so; and though our name is new, yet our Religion is old; for it is the good old way, even the way the Apostles walked in, though it hath been over-clouded for many years in the dark night or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie, which hath been over the whole world; and the Beast hath reigned and made War against the Saints and killed them, and this hath been for many ages as you may read: Yet there was a Seed which God preserved for himself in the midst of darkness, but now is the way of the Lord made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest again, and the same power and life of God which was in the Apostles dayes, and Truth shall spring forth, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry shall be rooted out by little and little, and Antichrist and his kingdom shall fall, and even Christ the Son of God the same as ever was, for no other we own, but him who was and is, and is to come; he shall rule, and his people shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. And though he saith, The <hi>Quakers be an upstart Sect</hi>: using such scornful words, not beseeming a Minister of Jesus Christ; but we are willing to bear all his reproaches for Christs sake. And he speaks most foolishly, and saith as if we knew not the contents of our Religion; yea, we know the contents and foundation of it, which is Christ that good old foundation, and him we are zealous for, and him we Preach and no other. And though he say, <hi>The Christians Faith hath been known for sixteen hundred years ago</hi>: I say it was so, but the night hath been over all, wherein no man can work, since it hath been first revealed; and Traditions, and Superstitions hath the World been exercised in, and led into; and the true Faith of the Gospel hath been departed from, and many knows it not at this day. And he saith, <hi>He ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors any Gospel, or Religion, that was not made sixteen hundred years ago, &amp;c.</hi> To this I <hi>Answer,</hi> Then must he abhor his own Practice; for sprinkling or Infants, telling people it is a Baptizing into the Faith of Christ, was not so long since,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52856:12"/>
nor singing <hi>Davids</hi> experiences in Rime and Meeter for a part of Gods Worship; and many other things which the Priests of <hi>England</hi> practise for Religion and Gospel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but are not so; but an invention came in many years since the Faith was revealed to the Apostles; and thus he hath abhorred his ovvn practise, and is condemned out of his ovvn mouth. And vvhereas he speaks of <hi>one that lately spoke to another</hi> in these vords, <hi>He denied the God that he Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped.</hi> That might be true: for thousands in <hi>England</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships the god of this World; and that god the Saints deny: And he counts it a thing very abominable to trust to that vvhich is vvithin the Saints; though it be according to the Scriptures; for Christ is in the Saints, and God dvvels in the Saints; and God and Christ is only to be trusted to. There is also another piece put forth by him, called, <hi>A Sheet for the Ministry</hi>: in vvhich also (according to his usual manner) he Rails and Lyes against the <hi>Quakers</hi> in many things; also I might instance in many more things vvherein he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed us, as a man vithout fear or honesty: and much ado he makes about Tythes: And he commends his Reader to the <hi>Quakers Catechisme,</hi> for better satisfaction. And I do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend all sober people to the Ansvver of the same, vvherein his folly and vveakness is laid open, as in them particulars. But he saith, The Tenths are theirs as fully as the rest are ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this is denyed; for the Tythes are not paid out of the Lands, but out of mens labours and industrious exercises upon the Land: for if any man let his Land lye untilled, there is no Tythes claimed; so that it is manifest it's paid out of mens labours, and not out of the Land: and many other things vve have against Tythes, and against the unjustnesse of them, and the oppression grovving thereby. And vve do knovv, That never any Minister of Christ vvas maintained in such a vvay: nay, they vvere so far off being maintained by a Lavv, that they vvould not make use of their povver vvhich they had in Christ in those things as of outvvard mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But much need not be said, for thousands begins to see the grievous burden and unlavvfulness of Tythes, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52856:12"/>
that in the Gospel administration, these things are no vvay commanded by the lavv of God, but as they came in by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and vvere established by the Pope, and are novv the chief maintenance of <hi>Englands</hi> Teachers. Indeed grievous and sad to be considered it is, hovv many hundreds in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of honest men are made havock on in their Persons and Estates in relation to Tythes, because for Conscience sake they cannot pay to the upholding of an Antichristian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, vvhich denies Christ come in the flesh, by upholding Tythes, vvhich only belonged to the first Priesthood under the Lavv, and vvas never practised (either paid or received by any) of them that vvere Witnesses of Christ come, or after his death, vvho did thereby fulfil that part of the old Covenant, and put an end to that Covenant, and the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood vvas changed that took Tythes, and a necessity there vvas also of the change of the Lavv as it is vvritten. So this is an Ansvver in part to <hi>Richard Baxters</hi> many Lyes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and his vvhole Work is turned by as our spoyled prey of <hi>Babylons</hi> treasure; and no more to be recokned in the Records of Truth, but shall stand upon an account, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the corrupted and poluted commodity, of the grovvth of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi>
