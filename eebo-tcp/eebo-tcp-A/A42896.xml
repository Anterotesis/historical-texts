            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough I never deſign'd to trouble Thee
with any thing in <hi>Print,</hi> eſpecially in a
Contentious way (from which thoſe who know
me, think me to be naturally averſe) yet now, I
am forc'd to appear publickly in defence of a
little Paper, which Another hath Printed for
me. <hi>Three Years</hi> were almost elapſed, and the
ſubject of that Paper quite worn out of my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
when a <hi>Particular Meſſenger</hi> from Dr.
<hi>Stillingfleet</hi> delivers me in Anſwer to it, a large
Book intitled, <hi>A Diſcourſe concerning the
Idolatry practiſed in the Church of
Rome, &amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Civility</hi> oblig'd me to,
return <hi>thanks</hi> for ſuch a <hi>Preſent,</hi> to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to whom I thought I had been <hi>unknown;</hi>
ſo it had been great <hi>dulneſs</hi> not to <hi>look</hi> upon
<hi>it</hi> with the ſame regard, that Men look upon a
<hi>Glove,</hi> when ſent by a Perſon, with whom they
have happened formerly to have ſome <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
Hereupon my thoughts preſently began
<pb facs="tcp:48446:6"/>
to incline me to meditate a return both to his
<hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Challenge,</hi> at leaſt as to the
Principal Heads contain'd in his Book; but
finding in his <hi>Preface,</hi> the <hi>performances</hi> of
thoſe, who had (as occaſion ſerv'd) replied to
ſome Paſsages of his <hi>Rational Account,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by Him to <hi>the way that Rats anſwer
Books, by gnawing ſome of the Leaves of
them,</hi> and that He proclaimed a general defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to All <hi>to come into the Open Field,
from which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>they had of late ſo
wiſely with-drawn themſelves,</hi> I eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
he would not want many abler Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
who would take themſelves to be concern'd
to ſtand up for the Publick cauſe of <hi>GOD's
Church,</hi> and his <hi>Saints.</hi> Nor was I deceived
in my expectation, as thoſe <hi>Learned Treatiſes</hi>
witneſs, which have been written againſt Him
upon this occaſion: Some of them in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Devotion</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
and of the <hi>ſanctity</hi> of thoſe Perſons whom he
traduces: Others against his <hi>Principles; One</hi>
to ſhow how he <hi>contradicts</hi> himſelf; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
compendiouſly <hi>refuting</hi> his whole <hi>Book:</hi>
All which I ſuppoſed would cost him a larger
time to anſwer, than he tells us he ſpent in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and pointing the Book it ſelf, which he ſaith,
was but from about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> to <hi>Midſumer,</hi>
at what time it came forth. This made me wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a while, after I had applyed my thoughts
to the Confutation of what <hi>firſt</hi> occurr'd in his
<pb facs="tcp:48446:6"/>
Title and Book, viz. <hi>The Charge of Idolatry,</hi>
which he moſt unjuſtly fixes upon the <hi>Church
of Rome;</hi> whether I ſhould expoſe them to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
view or no. But then conſidering the <hi>Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of the <hi>Charge,</hi> the particularneſs of the
<hi>Challenge,</hi> and the <hi>General Expectation</hi> to
ſee him traced ſtep by ſtep, (which was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
I had undertaken) I thought my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to commit them to the Preſs. And that
the Reader may know what he is to expect from
me, it is that I have endeavoured to make my
ſelf <hi>ſuch</hi> an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> as the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

and then tell him how his Conſequence

of the words and ſenſe of Authors,
which can be no great pleaſure nor content of
heart to my Adverſary to ſee diſcover'd. I was
in good hope to have been freed from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
task of laying open faults of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(which cannot be treated of without being
named, nor named without offence) by the fair
promiſe he makes <hi>to repreſent the matters in

and argue cloſely:</hi> And this Hope made
me for a good while not exact that ſeverity of
quoting Authors, which is required and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the managing of Controverſy; But ſince
the neceſſity he hath drawn upon himſelf, by
defending ſo <hi>Extravagant</hi> a <hi>Charge,</hi> as that
of <hi>Idolatry</hi> upon the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> hath
made him too often forget ſo good a purpoſe, I
muſt begg his pardon, if at length I take the
freedome to make the Reader a little ſenſible of
it, with that Plainneſs which the <hi>Merits</hi> of the
<hi>Cauſe</hi> will not only <hi>bear,</hi> but <hi>require:</hi> Of
which the Reader must be Judge.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Laurels</hi> he fancies he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
from his Adverſaries, by their <hi>declining,</hi>

ſome Satisfaction to the Reader in the peruſing
of this <hi>Rejoinder,</hi> to recur ſometimes to the
<hi>firſt Papers;</hi> at leaſt that he may clearly ſee,
that the <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> was no way <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
to the <hi>Reſolution</hi> of the <hi>Queſtions,</hi>
(as I ſhall ſhew more at large in the Firſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,)

            <p>
               <hi>The Account Himſelf gives of reviving a</hi>
Charge, <hi>which for many Years had lain buried
under the ruins of its own</hi> Infamy, <hi>was, as he
pretends, to]</hi> Juſtify <hi>more clearly the</hi> Separation
<hi>of the</hi> Church of England, <hi>from the</hi> Guilt
<hi>of</hi> Schiſm. <hi>For</hi> this, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> lies open to
the Conſcience of every Man, if the Church
of Rome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> guilty of Idolatry, our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be no Schiſm either before God or
Man, becauſe our Communion would be a
<pb facs="tcp:48446:8"/>
Sin. <hi>This is what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Just Weights, c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>And</hi> this Cauſe
<hi>indeed, (as Mr.</hi> Thorndike
<hi>well obſerves)</hi> would be more than ſufficient
to Juſtify the ſeparation, did it appear to be
true: <hi>but then</hi> on the other ſide, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> it
charges the miſchiefs of the Schiſm upon
thoſe who proceed upon it, before it be as
Evident as the Miſchiefs are, which they run
into upon it. So that ſhould the Church
of England declare, that the change which
we call Reformation, is grounded upon this
ſuppoſition, I muſt then acknowledg, <hi>ſaith
he,</hi> that we are Schiſmaticks. For the cauſe
not appearing to me (as hitherto it hath not,
and I think will never be made to appear to
me) the ſeparation and the miſchief of it,
muſt be imputed to them that make the
change.—In plain terms, We <hi>(of the Church
of England)</hi> make our ſelves Schiſmaticks
by grounding our Reformation upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
<hi>Thus Mr.</hi> Thorndike, <hi>whoſe</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>abetted by divers of the moſt</hi> learned
<hi>and most</hi> Judicious <hi>Perſons of the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>(and this is thought to be the reaſon
why the Doctor's Book came forth without the
publick ſtamp of an</hi> Imprimatur <hi>from any of
its Biſhops) will ſtand as a convincing Prejudice
againſt him, till he can make it</hi> as evident <hi>that
the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>is guilty of</hi> Idolatry, <hi>as
the</hi> miſchiefs <hi>are that have enſu'd upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48446:9"/>
This He ſaw was not poſſible to be done, and
therefore laying thoſe <hi>Divines</hi> aſide for Men of
<hi>more charity, than Judgment,</hi> leaſt he ſhould
be thought in ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> a <hi>Cenſure,</hi> to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>his Church</hi> (which, he ſaith,
<hi>he hath ſo great a regard to) he undertakes
to ſhow that this charge of Idolatry hath
been managed againſt the Church of Rome,
by the greateſt and moſt learned Defenders
of it ever ſince the Reformation.</hi> But if he
have ſuch a <hi>regard,</hi> as he ſaith, for the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> Why did he not appeal to her 39.
Articles? For as himſelf ſaith <hi>(p. 209.)</hi> of
the ſenſe of the Church of Rome, that we are to
appeal for it, not to the Writings of particular
Doctors, but to the Decrees of her Councils;
ſo in like manner for the ſenſe of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> He ought to have appealed to Her
Publickly-Authorized Articles? But in them
the Church of England declares no ſuch thing.
For we ſee it hotly diſputed between her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
whether any of the three Points inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Doctor, viz. <hi>Veneration of Images,
Adoration of the B. Sacrament, and Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints,</hi> be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or no: and thoſe
who ſide leaſt with that Party, which are called
Non-conformiſts, are for the Negative, <hi>Viz.</hi>
that it is not Idolatry: whereas, if it had been
the ſenſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in thoſe
Articles, that it were <hi>Idolatry</hi> to do any of thoſe
things, they had by maintaining the contrary as
<pb facs="tcp:48446:9"/>
               <hi>erroneous,</hi> incurr'd Excommunication, <hi>ipſ.
facto.</hi> as appears by the Canons Printed before
the 39 Articles, ſet forth by Mr. <hi>Rogers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here therefore the Doctor to maintain his
<hi>charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be (as he calls it) <hi>the
receiv'd Doctrin and practice of the Church
of England,</hi> is forc'd to have recourſe to the
<hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Homilies;</hi> and to the <hi>Sentiments</hi>
of <hi>Particular</hi> Perſons, of which he cites no leſs
than <hi>Seventeen:</hi> the greateſt part of whom I
ſhall ſhow to be incompetent Witneſſes in the
caſe, and the <hi>reſt,</hi> to ſpeak nothing to his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt then for the</hi> Book <hi>of</hi> Homilies, <hi>which
he ſaith is</hi> not barely allow'd, but
ſubſcribed to as containing godly
and wholſome Doctrine,<note place="margin">Art. 35.</note> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for theſe times: <hi>I anſwer, this doth
not Evince that every particular Doctrin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it, is ſuch. And therefore Mr.</hi> Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike

               <hi>here urged by Dr.</hi> St. <hi>ſaith, that</hi>
in this particular he muſt have
leave to think it fails, as it evidently doth in
others. <hi>And Biſh.</hi> Mountague <hi>ſaith,</hi> The
Book of Homilies contains a general Godly
doctrin, yet it is not in every
part the publick dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
doctrin of the Church.<note place="margin">Appeal, c. 23.</note>
               <hi>And Dr.</hi> Heylin <hi>in his</hi> neceſſary Introduction
<pb facs="tcp:48446:10"/>
to Cyprianus Anglicus, <hi>p. 14. tells us, that</hi>
the vehemence uſed in thoſe Homilies, was
not againſt Images as Intolerable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but as they might be made in thoſe
broken and unſetled times an occaſion of
falling. But that People being well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the right uſe of them, Images may be
ſtill kept for good uſes in Churches, and for
ſtirring up of devotion, in which reſpect
they were called, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> by Pope Gregory,
and not unfitly, the Lay-men's Books.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the particular Doctors he cites, I
except againſt little leſs than two parts of three
of them, as Incompetent Witneſses in the Caſe.
And in Order to this I ſhall take the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
the Doctor himſelf puts into my hand, when
to ſhow the Teſtimony of Arch biſhop</hi> Whitgift
<hi>to be valid in his cauſe, he premiſes that</hi> none
could be leſs ſuſpected to be Puritanically
inclined than He; <hi>that is, I ſhall caſt out of
the Liſt all thoſe, who ſhall be found to have
been</hi> Puritans, <hi>or</hi> Puritanically <hi>inclin'd. And
first for his two Arch-biſhops</hi> Whitgift <hi>and</hi>
Abbot, <hi>the</hi> Former <hi>(though otherwiſe a stiff
Aſſerter of the Diſciplin
of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)

<hi>and the</hi> latter <hi>was ſo great a Favourer and

Calviniſtical Opinions, of which the ſaid</hi>
Primate <hi>was the Contriver in</hi> Ireland, <hi>Dr.
Heylin ſaith,</hi> he refuſed to receive the whole
Body of the Canons made in the year, 1603,
becauſe he was afraid of bowing at the name
of Jeſus, and ſome other Reverences, which
<pb facs="tcp:48446:11"/>
he neither practiſed, nor approved: <hi>and</hi>
(p. 216.) <hi>that his Book called</hi> Gotteſcalchus,

<hi>By all which it appears, that of</hi> Seventeen <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
He cites, to maintain his unjuſt</hi> charge

Puritans, <hi>or</hi> Puritanically <hi>affected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Six</hi> which remain, viz. Dr. <hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Field, Iſaac Caſaubon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
Arch biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi>
whoever compares what the Doctor cites out of
them, with what they write in other places;
nay, whoever attentively conſiders but the very
places cited by my Adverſary, ſhall find, that
they do not impugn the <hi>Doctrin</hi> it ſelf of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>practice conformable</hi>
to that <hi>Doctrin;</hi> but ſuch things as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be great <hi>abuſes</hi> in the <hi>Practice</hi> of it.
For Dr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> as cited by the Doctor, doth
not ſay, that to give a honourary <hi>Veneration</hi>
to <hi>Images,</hi> is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but <hi>to give divine
honour to them, which</hi> he ſaith, <hi>the Papiſts
do;</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves deny. Biſhop
<hi>Andrews</hi> in like manner, giveth for the reaſon
of his charge, that <hi>the Papiſts, do not meerly
pray to the Saints to pray for them, but to
<pb facs="tcp:48446:11"/>
give what they pray for, themſelves;</hi> and the
Papiſts profeſs they do no ſuch things. Dr.
<hi>Field</hi> doth not charge the <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi>
with <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> but ſpeaks
only of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch
he thought, but not truly, <hi>was committed in
it.</hi> Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> alſo (as his own words
declare) ſpeaks of <hi>the practice of Adoration
of</hi> Images in the Modern Church of Rome,
which he erroneouſly affirmeth to be <hi>too like to
Paganiſm.</hi> And ſo K. <hi>James,</hi> in the place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Doctor (had He not ſo ſoon forgot
his promiſe of <hi>reporting faithfully)</hi> ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
that what He condemns, is <hi>Adoring of
Images</hi> (viz. with Divine Worſhip) <hi>praying
to them, and imagining a kind of ſanctity
to be in them,</hi> all which are deteſted by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</hi>
And all that he cites out of <hi>Iſaac
Caſaubon,</hi> when He was employed by the King
to deliver His Opinion to Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> in
the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> was that the Church
of <hi>England</hi> did affirm, <hi>that ſome Particular
Practices were joyned with great impiety.</hi>
So that it is not the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> if rightly practic'd, which theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
condemn of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but the <hi>abuſes</hi>
they conceiv'd to be committed in the <hi>practice</hi>
of it; as to give the Worſhip <hi>due</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to
an <hi>Image;</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to it; or imagin any <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
or <hi>Divinity</hi> to be in it; or to <hi>pray</hi> to the
<hi>Saints,</hi> as to thoſe who are to <hi>give</hi> us what we
<pb facs="tcp:48446:12"/>
pray for, <hi>themſelves;</hi> All which are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the 2d. <hi>Nicen Council,</hi> and that of
<hi>Trent:</hi> and for other practices which the Dr.
occaſionally objects, they ſhall be diſcuſs'd in the
following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>This being ſo as I have ſhewn, and the
Judgment of theſe <hi>Divines</hi> differing only as
<hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſs</hi> in the ſame kind, from what
Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and other learned Protestants
pretend, when they reprove ſome <hi>practices</hi> as
<hi>Idolatrous,</hi> or at leaſt in danger to be <hi>ſuch:</hi>
Theſe laſt <hi>Six Authors</hi> cited by the Doctor,
ought to have been alledged for the contrary
poſition of what He affirms, viz. That <hi>the
Church of Rome neither in her Doctrine,
nor Practice, (conformable to her Doctrin)
is guilty of Idolatry.</hi> For whilst they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
only ſome <hi>Practices,</hi> which they judge
different from the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 'tis manifeſt, they
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ply the <hi>Doctrine</hi> it ſelf, and <hi>Practice,</hi> if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to it, <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>Idolatrous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then let the Reader judge, whether Dr.
<hi>St,</hi> being (as He ſaith) <hi>by command pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
engag'd in the defence of ſo excellent
a cauſe, as that of the Church of England
againſt the Church of Rome,</hi> have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
his <hi>truſt,</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> too (if it be
<hi>his)</hi> in advancing ſuch a <hi>Medium</hi> to juſtifie
Her ſeparation, as contradicts the ſenſe of <hi>that
Church,</hi> if it be to be taken from the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thoſe who are eſteem'd Her <hi>true</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:48446:12"/>
               <hi>Genuin</hi> Sons; and in the Judgment of ſome
of them, makes it in <hi>plain terms</hi> to be <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical:</hi>
Which yet will appear more clearly,
if we conſider how this <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi>
ſubverts the very foundation of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
Authority</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For
it being a received <hi>Maxime,</hi> and not denyable
by any one of common ſenſe, that <hi>no Man can
give to another that, which he hath not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
it lies open to the Conſcience of every man,
that if the Church of Rome be guilty of <hi>Hereſy,</hi>
much more if Guilty of Idolatry, it falls under
the Apoſtles <hi>Excommunication</hi> (Gal. 1. 8.)
and ſo remains depriv'd of the <hi>lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
to uſe and exerciſe the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Orders;</hi>
and conſequently the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Governing,
Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtring Sacraments,</hi>
which thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to themſelves, as deriv'd from the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be no <hi>true</hi> and <hi>lawful Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
but <hi>uſurped</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> This
is what follows againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
from the <hi>charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> upon the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſo much the more as

after the Re-ſettlement of <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>

a <hi>Catholick,</hi> which one
bred and born, and well grounded in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion,</hi> hath to remain in it, may not

            <p>2. Whether it be ſufficient to be a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
in the <hi>abſtract,</hi> or in the <hi>whole latitude;</hi>
or there be a neceſſity of being a member of
ſome diſtinct <hi>Church,</hi> or Congregation of
<hi>Chriſtians?</hi>

            <div type="answer">
               <head>His Anſwer to the aforeſaid
Queſtions.</head>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Queſtion</hi> being ſuppoſed to be put
concerning a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> yet continuing ſo doth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48446:18"/>
imply a contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> That a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
continuing ſo, ſhould have the ſame Motives
to become a <hi>Catholick</hi> (taking that term here,
only as ſignifying one of the communion of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome)</hi> which thoſe have who have
been horn or bred in that communion. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the meaning of the Question to be this,
Whether a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> leaving the communion
of our <hi>Church,</hi> upon the Motives uſed by thoſe
of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> may not be equally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with thoſe who are bred in it? I anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. That an equal capacity of ſalvation of
thoſe perſons being ſuppoſed, can be no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to leave the communion of a Church,
wherein ſalvation of a perſon may be much
more ſafe, than of either of them. No more,
than it is, for a Man to leap from the plain
Ground into a Ship, that is in danger of being
wrackt, becauſe he may equally hope to be ſaved
with thoſe who are in it. Nay, ſuppoſing an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
capacity of Salvation in two ſeveral
<hi>Churches,</hi> there can be no reaſon to forſake
the communion of the one for the other. So
that to perſwade any one to leave our <hi>Church</hi>
to embrace that of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is by no means
ſufficient to ask whether ſuch a one may not as
well be ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, as they that are in it already:
but it is neceſsary, that they prove, that it is of
neceſſity to ſalvation to leave our Church, and
become a Member of theirs: And when they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48446:18"/>
do this, I intend to be one of their number.</p>
               <p>2. We aſſert, that all thoſe who are in the
communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> do run ſo
great a hazard of their Salvation, that none
who have a care of their Souls, ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, or continue in it. And that upon
theſe Grounds.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe they muſt by the terms of
communion with that Church, be guilty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Hypocriſie or Idolatry, <hi>either of
which are ſins inconſiſtent with Salvation;
Which I thus prove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Church</hi> which requires the giving the
<hi>Creature</hi> the Worſhip due only to the <hi>Creator,</hi>
makes the Members of it guilty of Hypocriſie
or Idolatry; for if they do it, they are guilty
of the latter, if they do it not, of the former;
but the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in the Worſhip of
God by Images, the Adoration of the
Bread in the Euchariſt, and the formal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints,</hi> doth require the giving
to the Creature the Worſhip due only to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator;
therefore it makes the Members of it
guilty of Hypocriſie or Idolatry.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars

1. Where the Worſhip of <hi>God</hi> is terminated
upon a Creature, there by their own confeſſion,
the Worſhip due only to <hi>God</hi> is given to the
Creature; but <hi>in the Worſhip of God by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi>
the Worſhip due to God is terminated
wholly on the Creature; which is thus proved:
The Worſhip which <hi>God</hi> himſelf denies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
must be terminated on the Creature: but
God himſelf in the <hi>ſecond Commandment</hi>
not only denies to receive it, but threatens ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
to puniſh them that give it. Therefore it
cannot be terminated on <hi>God,</hi> but only on the
Image.</p>
               <p>2. The ſame Argument which would make

are very apt to hinder a good life: <hi>Such are,</hi>
the <hi>deſtroying the neceſſity of a good life,</hi> by

taking off the care of it,</hi> by ſuppoſing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
of ſin (by the prayers of the living)
after death; <hi>and the ſincerity of devotion is
much obſtructed in it,</hi> by prayers in a language
which many underſtand not; by making the
efficacy of Sacraments depend upon the bare
adminiſtration, whether our minds be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

reading the Scripture, which is our moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rule of faith and life; by the multitude
of ſuperſtitious obſervations never uſed in

the Laity, contrary to the practice of the
Church in the ſolemn Celebration of the
Euchariſt for a thouſand years after Chriſt;
by making it in the power of any perſon to

<hi>All which, and ſeveral other things which my

               <p>3. I anſwer, <hi>That a Proteſtant leaving the
Communion of our Church, doth incur a
greater guilt, than one who was bred up in
the communion of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and
continues therein by invincible ignorance,</hi>
and therefore cannot equally be ſaved with ſuch
a one. For a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is ſuppoſed, to have
ſufficient convictions of the Errors of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church,</hi> or is guilty of wilful ignorance,
if he hath not; but although we know not what
allowances God will make for invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
we are ſure that wilful ignorance, or choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a worſe Church before a better, is a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

being a thing I never heard or read of before;
and therefore may have ſome meaning in it,
which I cannot underſtand. 2. But if the

a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> by vertue of his being ſo, be bound
to joyn in ſome <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Congregation</hi> of

one, though called never ſo <hi>Catholick.</hi>

ſent me is fraught with; But ſince the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer
hath been pleas'd to take this Method,
(for what end himſelf beſt knows) I ſhall
not refuſe to give a fair and plain return, to
the ſeveral Points he inſiſts upon, and that
with as much brevity as the matter and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
will bear.</p>
            <p>The Queſtions propoſed were: 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Proteſtant having the ſame Motives to
become a Catholick, which one bred and
born, and well grounded in Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hath to remain in it, may not equally
be ſaved in the profeſſion of it?</p>
            <p>The <hi>2d.</hi> Whether it be ſufficient to be a
Chriſtian in the abſtract, or in the whole la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
or there be a neceſſity of being a
Member of ſome diſtinct Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>being ſuppoſed to be put
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48446:22"/>
concerning a Protestant continuing ſo, implyes
a contradiction;</hi> but where it lyes I cannot
ſee, for a Proteſtant may have the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and yet out of wilfulneſs or paſſion
not acquieſce to them. He ſaw no doubt
this ſuppoſition to be impertinent to the
Queſtion, and therefore in the ſecond part of
the 1. §. ſtates it thus: <hi>Whether a Proteſtant
leaving the Communion of the Proteſtant
Church, upon the Motives uſed by thoſe of the</hi>
Roman <hi>Church, may not be equally ſaved with
thoſe who were bred in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queſtion thus ſtated in its true ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
he anſwers firſt, §. 2. <hi>That an equal
capacity of ſalvation of thoſe perſons being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
can be no argument to leave the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a Church, wherein the ſalvation of a
perſon may be much more ſafe than of either of
them.</hi> But before I reply, I muſt do both
him and my ſelf right in matter of fact; and
it is, <hi>Madam,</hi> that when you firſt addreſſed
to me, you profeſſed your ſelf much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
that he had told you, a perſon leaving
the Proteſtant communion, and embracing
the Catholick, could not be ſaved. That
we ſhould deny ſalvation to any out of the
Catholick Church, you lookt upon as uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
and this aſſertion of his had ſtartled
you in the opinion you had before of the

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
you to embrace the Catholick Communion.
This premiſed, I reply, that the Anſwer he
gives, is altogether forrain to the matter in
hand, the Controverſie not being between a
Bred and a Converted Catholick on the one
ſide, and a perſon ſuppoſed to be in a ſafer
Church than either of them on the other:
nor yet between two ſeveral Churches ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to have in them an equal Capacity of
ſalvation, but between a perſon bred in the
Catholick Religion on the one ſide, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
converted to it from Proteſtantiſm on
the other, whether the latter may not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſaved with the former? Nor is it to the
purpoſe of the preſent Queſtion, to prove
<hi>that it is of neceſſity to Salvation to leave the
Proteſtant Church, and become a Member of
the Catholick,</hi> becauſe the Queſtion is only of
the poſſibility, not of the neceſſity of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I ſay it is not neceſſary to the preſent
Queſtion to prove this, but rather belongs to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48446:23"/>
the ſecond, (where I ſhall ſpeak to it.) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a neceſſity of being a Member
of ſome diſtinct Church? Which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
affirmatively by both parts, it follows
then in order to enquire which this true
Church is. As for the Example of <hi>a Man
leaping from the plain ground into a Ship that
is in danger of being Wrackt,</hi> meaning by that
Ship (as I ſuppoſe he does) the Catholick
Church. Some will be apt to think he had
come neerer the Mark, if he had compared
the Proteſtant to a Ship, which by often
knocking againſt the Rock on which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church is built, had ſplit it ſelf into
innumerable Sects, and was now in danger of
ſinking: his compariſon was grounded only
on his own ſuppoſition, but this is grounded
on the truth it ſelf of too ſad an experience.
But to leave words, and come to the matter.
His ſecond Anſwer is, §. 3. that <hi>all thoſe who
are in the communion of the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>do run ſo great a hazard of their Salvation,
that none who have a care of their Souls ought
to embrace or continue in it.</hi> The firſt anſwer
as I have ſhewed, was nothing pertinent to
the preſent Queſtion, nor comes this ſecond
any nearer the matter, for though it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that none ought to embrace or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the Catholick Church by reaſon of
the great hazard, he ſaith, they run of their
ſalvation, yet if they do embrace or continue
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48446:23"/>
in it, why may they not be equally ſaved, that
is, with equal hazard; but this aſſertion,
however beſide the Queſtion, he makes it his
main buſineſs to prove, Firſt, §. 4. <hi>Becauſe
thoſe who embrace or continue in the Catholick
Church are guilty either of Hypocriſie or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
either of which are ſins inconſiſtent with
ſalvation.</hi> And here he muſt give me leave
to return upon him a more palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
than that he ſuppoſed to have found
in the Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> to aſſert only, that thoſe
of the Catholick Communion run a great
hazard of their Salvation, and yet affirm at
the ſame time that they are guilty either of
Hypocriſie or Idolatry, ſins inconſiſtent with
Salvation: which reduced into plain terms,
is no other, but that they may be ſaved,
though hardly, and yet cannot be ſaved. But
to the Argument, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>by the
Worſhip of God by Images, by the Adoration of
Bread in the Eucharist, and the formal Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Saints, doth require the giving to the
Creature the Worſhip due only to the Creator;
Therefore it makes the Members of it guilty of
Hypocriſie or Idolatry.</hi> The charge is great,
but what are the proofs?</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt he ſaith, § 5. that <hi>in
the Worſhip of God by Images, the Worſhip due
to God is terminated wholly on the Creature.</hi>
And ſurely this implies another contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it ſhould be the Worſhip of God
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48446:24"/>
by Images, and yet be terminated wholly on
the Creature; Nevertheleſs he proves it
thus; <hi>The Worſhip which God himſelf denies
to receive, must be terminated upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but God himſelf in the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not only denies to receive it, but threatens
ſeverely to puniſh them that give it,</hi> that is, that
Worſhip him by an Image. <hi>Therefore it
cannot be terminated on God, but only on the
Image.</hi> To this Argument, which to be juſt to
the <hi>Author,</hi> I confeſs I have not ſeen anywhere
propoſed in theſe terms, I anſwer, that the
firſt Propoſition is built on a great miſtake
of the Nature of humane acts; which though
they ought to be govern'd by the Law of <hi>God,</hi>
yet when they ſwerve from it, ceaſe not to
tend to their own proper objects. Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of ſuch or ſuch a kind of Worſhip,
may make it to be unlawful, but hinders not
the act from tending, whither it is intended;
and conſequently if it be intended or direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the underſtanding to God, though after
an unlawful manner, it will not fail to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
upon God: Thus when a Thief or
a Murderer prays to God to give him good
ſucceſs in the Theft or Murder he intends,
though God denies to hear any ſuch Prayer,
yet is the Prayer truly directed to him: and
thus when the Jews offered to God in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
the blind and the lame, though he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
it, yet was the oblation terminated
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48446:24"/>
on him, and therefore he reproves them for
having <hi>polluted him, Mal</hi> 1. 8. and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them the more of their evil doings:
<hi>Offer it now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to thy Governour,</hi> will
he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
Though the Governor deny to accept
what is preſented to him, yet it is truly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to him by the Preſenter; and ſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
God deny to accept ſuch or ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
yet it is truly offered to him, though
the offering of it after a forbidden manner
make it to be ſin: Did not God <hi>refuſe</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Sacrifice of <hi>Cain,</hi> and yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 3. ſays expreſly, that he brought
an offering to the <hi>Lord?</hi> God had not reſpect
to <hi>Cain</hi> nor his offering, but this did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but that <hi>Cain</hi>'s offering had reſpect to
God, &amp; was terminated on him. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
though God deny ſuch or ſuch a kind of
Worſhip; if it be offered though unlawfully
by the Creature, yet is it terminated on him.
The Propoſition therefore which aſſerts, <hi>that
the Worſhip which God denies muſt be termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the Creature,</hi> I deny as abſolutely falſe,
and ſo will you too, <hi>Madam,</hi> when you ſhall
ſee the ſenſe of it to be no other, but that a
wicked Man cannot Pray to God, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him in an unlawful or forbidden man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who is therefore a wicked Man becauſe
he does ſo. What follows from hence is, that
though God ſhould have forbidden Men to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48446:25"/>
Worſhip him by Images, yet it does not
follow but the Worſhip ſo given, would be
terminated on him. But now to ſpeak to
his ſecond Propoſition, in which the main
force of this Argument conſiſts.</p>
            <p>We utterly deny that God in the ſecond
Commandment, forbids himſelf to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
by a Crucifix, for example, or ſuch
like Sacred Image; for ſuch only are the
ſubject of the preſent controverſie. What he
forbids there, is to give his Worſhip to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols:
and this is clear from the circumſtances
of the Text: Firſt, Becauſe this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Judgment be to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
is but a Part or Explication of the
firſt, Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before
me: Secondly, becauſe the Hebrew word
<hi>Peſcl,</hi> in Latin <hi>Sculptile,</hi> is uſed in Scripture
to ſignifie an Idol: Let them be confounded
who adore <hi>Sculptilia,</hi> that is, Idols, ſaith the
Pſalmiſt, and ſo the Septuagint tranſlate it in
this very place <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Idol, Thou ſhalt
not make to thy ſelf an Idol; So that it was
an artifice of the Proteſtants to make their
aſſertion ſeem plauſible, to tranſlate <hi>Image</hi>
inſtead of <hi>Idol;</hi> and not a certain kind of
Image neither, but any whatſoever. Thou
ſhalt not make to thy ſelf <hi>any</hi> graven Image.
Now what is all this to Catholicks, who
neither make to themſelves, nor adore Idols,
nor yield Soveraign honour, or acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48446:25"/>
of Deity to any but God? We give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a veneration to Images, but the Image
of God is not another God beſides him, nor
is the Worſhip of it the Worſhip of another
God, but of him who is repreſented by it:
for St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, The Worſhip of an Image
ſtays not there, but is referred or carried to
the prototype, or thing repreſented.</p>
            <p>We give therefore an inſetior, or relative
honour only to the Sacred Images of Chriſt,
and his bleſſed Mother, and Saints, not <hi>latri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
the Worſhip due to God, but <hi>Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam
adorationem,</hi> a certain honorary Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
expreſſed by kiſſing them, or putting off
our Hats, or kneeling before them, much like
the Worſhip given to the Chair of State, or
the Kings Picture, or his Garment by the like
actions or to come nearer to the ſubject, ſuch
as was commanded to be given by <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Joſhua</hi> to the ground whereon they ſtood, by
putting off their Shoos, becauſe it was holy;
and by the Jews, in adoring the foot-ſtool of
God, or falling down before it,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. 5.<note place="margin">Ep. 17. ad Marcellam.</note> and in Worſhipping
(as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> teſtifies they did)
that part of the Temple called
the Holy of Holies, becauſe there were the
Cherubims (ſacred Images ordered by God
himſelf to be placed there) the propitiatory
(repreſenting Gods Throne) and the Ark, (his
foot-ſtool) In a word, ſuch as the Proteſtants
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48446:26"/>
themſelves give to the Name of Jeſus when
they hear it ſpoken, by putting off their
Hats, and bowing at it, or to the Elements
of Bread and Wine in the Supper, by kneeling
before them, as figures repreſenting the death
of Chriſt; if condeſcendence to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of weaker Brethren, will permit them to
own they have any honour or veneration for
them, or for the Altar before which they bow.
To conclude this point, the <hi>Objector</hi> brings a
Text, which forbids us to give the Soveraign
honor due to God, to an Idol: but let us hear
out of Scripture an expreſs Text that it is
not lawful to give to holy Images, and other
things relating to God, an inferiour or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Worſhip, ſuch as we have declared, and
that will be to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>§. 6. He aims to conclude the Catholick
Church guilty of Idolatry, from the adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Bread</hi> (as he believes it) in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.
Now to do this, he ought to prove,
that what we adore in the Euchariſt, is bread
indeed. But inſtead of that, he brings a
compariſon between <hi>our</hi> adoration of Chriſt
in the Euchariſt, and the Heathens adoration
of the Sun: <hi>viz. That the Papiſts by the ſame
Argument, make the Worſhip of the bread in
the Eucharist not to be Idolatry, which would
excuſe the Heathens Worſhip of the Sun and of
their Statutes from Idolatry; For if it be not
therefore Idolatry,</hi> ſays he, <hi>becauſe they ſuppoſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48446:26"/>
the bread to be God, then the Worſhip of the Sun
was not Idolatry in them, who ſuppoſed the Sun
to be God.</hi> I ſhall not complain here of the
unhandſomneſs of the expreſſion, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
ſuppoſe the <hi>Bread</hi> to be <hi>God,</hi> juſt as
the Heathens ſuppoſed the Sun to be God:
whereas he knows, that Catholicks believe,
that the ſubſtance of the bread is changed
into Chriſts body; but ſhall anſwer to the
Argument, That the Worſhip of Chriſt in
the Euchariſt is not Idolatry, becauſe we
only ſuppoſe him to be really preſent under
the form of bread; but becauſe we know and
believe this upon the ſame grounds and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
upon which we believe (and thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
ſtronger than any Proteſtant hath (if he
have no other than the Catholick, to believe)
that Chriſt is God, and conſequently to be
adored. And therefore that you may the
better ſee the inefficaciouſneſs of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuppoſe it dropt from the Pen of an
<hi>Arrian</hi> againſt the adoration of Chriſt as
God, and it will be of as much force to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
that to be Idolatry, as it is from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector's
to prove the adoration of him in the
Euchariſt to be ſo. See there how an <hi>Arrian</hi>
might argue in the ſame form. The ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
which would make the groſſeſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Idolatry lawful, cannot excuſe any act
from Idolatry: but the ſame Argument,
whereby the Proteſtants make the Worſhip
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48446:27"/>
of Chriſt (a pure Man, ſays the <hi>Arrian)</hi> not
to be Idolatry, would make the groſſeſt
Heathen Idolatry not to be ſo: For if it be
not therefore Idolatry, becauſe they ſuppoſe
Chriſt to be God, then the Worſhip of the
Sun was not Idolatry, by them who ſuppoſed
the Sun to be God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
which ſolves the <hi>Arrians</hi> argument
againſt the adoration of Chriſt as God,
ſerves no leſs to ſolve the Objectors Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the adoration of him in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,
ſince we have a like Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for his real preſence under the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Signs, as we have for his being true God
and Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what if Catholicks ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in their belief? Would it then follow,
that they were Idolaters? Dr.</hi> Taylor <hi>an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
and leading Man amongſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
denies the conſequence. His words
are theſe, in the Liberty of</hi> Prophecying, <hi>Sect.
20. Numb.</hi> 26. Idolatry, <hi>ſays he,</hi> is a forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the true God, and giving Divine Worſhip
to a Creature, or to an Idol, that is, to an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
God, who hath no foundation in Eſſence
or Exiſtence: And this is that kind of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
which by Divines is called the ſupersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an undue object: Now it is evident,
that the object of their (that is, the Catholicks)
adoration (that which is repreſented to them in
their minds, their thoughts and purpoſes and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48446:27"/>
by which God principally, if not ſolely, takes
eſtimate of humane actions) in the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
is the only true and Eternal God, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatically
joyned with his Holy Humanity,
which Humanity they believe actually preſent
under the Veil of the Sacramental Signs; and
if they thought him not preſent, they are ſo far
from worſhipping the bread in this caſe, that
themſelves profeſs it Idolatry to do ſo; which
is a demonſtration <hi>(mark that)</hi> that their Soul
hath nothing in it, that is Idolatrical. If their
confidence and fanciful Opinion <hi>(ſo he terms
the faith of Catholicks)</hi> hath engaged them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo great a miſtake (as without doubt, <hi>he ſays</hi>
it hath) yet the will hath nothing in it, but what
is a great enemy to Idolatry. <hi>Et nihil ardet in
inferno niſi propria voluntas;</hi> that is, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
burns in Hell, but proper Will. <hi>Thus Dr.</hi>
Taylor; <hi>and I think it will be a task worthy
the Objectors pains, to ſolve his Argument,
if he will not abſolve us from being Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. He proceeds to prove, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
are guilty of Idolatry, by their Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints: And his Argument is this;
<hi>If the ſuppoſition of a middle excellency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us, be a ſufficient ground for
formal Invocation, then the Heathens Worſhip
of their inferiour De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ities, could be no Idolatry,
for the Heathens ſtill pretended that they did
not give to them the Worſhip proper to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48446:28"/>
God, which is as much as is pretended by
the devouteſt Papiſts in juſtification of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints.</hi> To anſwer this Argument,
I ſhall need little more than to explicate
the hard words in it; which thus I do. By
perſons of a middle excellency, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
perſons endowed with ſupernatural
gifts of Grace in this life, and Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
whoſe prayers by conſequence are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and available with God: what at he means
by formal Invocation, I underſtand not well:
but what we underſtand by it, is deſiring or
praying thoſe juſt perſons to pray for us.
The ſupream Deity of the Heathens is known
to be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and their inferiour Deities, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Mars, Bacchus, Vulcan,</hi> and the like
rabble of Devils, as the Scripture calls them,
The gods of the Heathens are Devils. The
terms thus explicated, 'tis eaſie to ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence
of the Argument, that becauſe
the Heathens were Idolaters in worſhipping
<hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> their in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eriour Deities, or
rather Devils, though they pretended not to
give them the Worſhip proper to <hi>Jupiter</hi>
their Supream God: Therefore the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
muſt be guilty of Idolatry, in deſiring
the ſervants of the true God, to pray for them
to him. Upon this account we muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the prayer of a juſt Man, even in this life,
becauſe this formal Invocation will be to
make him an inferiour Deity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48446:28"/>
               <hi>But if ſome Sect of Heathens, as the</hi> Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
<hi>did attain to the knowledge of the true
God, yet St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſays, they did not glorifie
him as God; but changed his glory into an
Image made like to corruptible man, adoring
and offering Sacrifice due to God alone, to
the Statues themſelves, or the inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they ſuppoſed to dwell or aſſiſt in them.
Which inferiour Deities St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>upon the
Ninety ſixth Pſalm, proves to be Devils or
evil Angels, becauſe they required Sacrifice
to be offered to them, and would be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
as Gods. Now what compariſon
there is between this worſhip of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
inferiour Deities, and Chriſtians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Saints and Angels, let the ſame St.</hi>
Auſtin <hi>declare in his twentieth Book againſt</hi>

<hi>there calumniates the Catholicks (the word
is St.</hi> Auſtins) <hi>becauſe they honoured the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
or Shrines of Martyrs, charging them
to have turned the Idols into Martyrs, whom
they worſhip (ſaid he) with like Vows. The
Objection you ſee is not new, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
make inferiour Deities of their Saints.</hi>
Fauſtus <hi>long ago made it, and St.</hi> Auſtin'<hi>s
anſwer will ſerve as well now as then.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
People, <hi>ſays he,</hi> do with Religious Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
celebrate the Memory of Martyrs, both to
excite to the imitation of them, and to become
partakers of their Merits, and be holpen by their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48446:29"/>
Prayers, but ſo that we erect Altars, not to any
of the Martyrs: but to the God of Martyrs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in Memory of the ſaid Martyrs; For
what Biſhop efficiating at the Altar, in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where their holy Bodies are depoſited: does
ſay at any time we offer to thee <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi>
or <hi>Cyprian?</hi> but what is offered, is offered to
God, who crown'd the Martyrs, at the Memories
of thoſe whom he crowned; that being put in
mind by the very places, a greater affection may
be raiſed in us to quicken our love, both to thoſe
whom we may imitate, and towards him by whoſe
aſſiſtance we can do it. We worſhip therefore the
Martyrs with that Worſhip of love and ſociety;
with which even in this life alſo Holy Men of
God are worſhipped, whoſe heart we judge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to ſuffer the like Martyrdom for the truth
of the Goſpel. But we worſhip <hi>them</hi> ſo much
the more devoutly, becauſe more ſecurely, after
they have overcome all the Incertainties of this
World; as alſo we praiſe them more confidently
now reigning Conquerors, in a more happy life,
than whilſt they were fighting in this; but with
that Worſhip, which in Greek is called <hi>Latria,</hi>
(and cannot be expreſsed by one word in Latin)
for as much as it is a certain ſervice properly
due to the Divinity, we neither worſhip them,
nor teach them to be worſhipped, but God alone.
Now whereas the offering of Sacrifice belongs to
this Worſhip (of <hi>Latria)</hi> from whence they are
called Idolaters, who gave it alſo to Idols, by no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48446:29"/>
means do we ſuffer any ſuch thing, or command
it to be offered, to any Martyr, or any holy ſoul,
or any Angel: And whoſoever declines into this
Error, we reprove him by ſound Dectrine, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that he may be corrected, or avoided.—
<hi>And a little after.</hi> It is a much leſs ſin, for a
Man to be derided by the Martyrs for drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs,
then even faſting to offer Sacrifice to
them. I ſay to ſacrifice to Martyrs, I ſay not to
ſacrifice to God in the Memories (or Churches)
of the Martyrs, which we do moſt frequently, by
that <hi>rite</hi> alone, by which in the manifeſtation of
the New Teſtament he hath commanded Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to be offered to him, which belongs to that
Worſhip, which is called <hi>Latria,</hi> and is due only
to God. <hi>This was the Doctrine and practice
of Chriſtian People in St.</hi> Auguſtine'<hi>s time,
and that he himſelf held formal Invocations
a part of the Worſhip due to Saints, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the Prayer he made to St.</hi> Cyprian
<hi>after his Martyrdom.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juvet

Let Bleſſed <hi>Cyprian</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
help us <hi>(who are ſtill encompaſſed with
this mortal fleſh, and labour as in a dark
Cloud)</hi> with his Prayers, <hi>that by Gods grace
we may, as far as we are able, imitate his
good works. Thus St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>where you
ſee he directs his Prayer to St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>which
I take to be formal invocation, and for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48446:30"/>
confirmation of it, we have the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
confeſſion of</hi> Calvin himſelf, <hi>Inſtit. li. 3.
ch. 20. n. 22. where ſpeaking of the third
Council of</hi> Carthage, <hi>in which St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>was
preſent, he acknowledged it was the cuſtom
at that time to ſay,</hi> Sancta Maria, aut Sancte
Petre Ora pro nobis; <hi>Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>or Holy</hi>
Peter <hi>pray for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now <hi>Madam,</hi> what if after all this,
he himſelf ſhall deny, that any of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Tenets are Articles of his faith, viz. <hi>That
honour is not to be given to the Images of Chriſt
and his Saints; that what appears to be bread
in the Euchariſt, is not the Body of Chriſt:
That it is not lawful to invocate the Saints to
pray for us.</hi> Preſs him cloſe, and I believe
you ſhall find him deny, that he believes any
one of theſe Negative points to be Divine
truths; and if ſo, you will eaſily ſee his
charge of Idolatry againſt us, to be vain
and groundleſs.</p>
            <p>Having thus given a direct and punctual
anſwer to his argument, I muſt now expect
<hi>as much charity from him, as is conſiſtent with
Scripture and Reaſon.</hi> How much that is,
you will ſee in his third Anſwer to the firſt
Queſtion. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>§. 8. He brings a Miſcellany of <hi>ſuch Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
and <hi>practices</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>which
are very apt to hinder a good life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
none who have a care of their Salvation,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48446:30"/>
can venture their Souls in the communion of
ſuch a Church, which either enjoyns, or publickly
allows them.</hi> He reckons up no leſs than Ten.
1. That we <hi>deſtroy the neceſſity of good life,
by making the Sacrament of Penance</hi> (that is,
confeſſion and abſolution) <hi>joyned with contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſufficient for ſalvation.</hi> And do not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
make contrition alone, which is leſs,
ſufficient for Salvation? But perhaps the
joyning of confeſſion and abſolution with
contrition, makes it of a malignant nature:
If ſo, certainly when the Book of Common
Prayer in the Viſitation of the Sick, enjoyns
the ſick Man, if he find his conſcience trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with any weighty matter, to make a
ſpecial confeſſion, and receive abſolution
from the Prieſt in the ſame words the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church uſes, it preſcribes him that
as a means to prepare himſelf for a holy
death, which in the judgment of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
deſtroys the neceſſity of good life.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Catholicks,</hi> he ſays, <hi>take off the care of
good life, by ſuppoſing an expiation of ſin (by
the Prayer of the living) after death:</hi> But
certainly the belief of temporal pains to be
ſuſtained after death, if there be not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
expiation of ſin in this life, by works
of penance, is rather apt to make a Man
careful not to commit the leaſt ſin, than to
take off the care of a good life. And though
he be aſcertained by faith, that he may be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48446:31"/>
holpen by the charitable ſuffrages of the
faithful living, yet this is no more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to him to ſin, than it would be to a
Spendthrift to run into debt, and be caſt into
Priſon, becauſe he knows he may be relieved
by the charity of his Friends. If he were ſure
there were no Priſon for him, that would be
an encouragement indeed to play the Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift.
And this is the caſe of the Proteſtants
in their denyal of Purgatory.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The ſincerity of Devotion,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is
much obstructed by Prayers in a Language
which many underſtand not.</hi> If he ſpeak of
private Prayers, all Catholicks are taught to
ſay them in their Mother Tongue: If of the
publick Prayers of the Church, I underſtand
not why it may not be done with as much
ſincerity of devotion, the People joyning
their intention and particular Prayers with
the Prieſt, as their Embaſſador to God, as if
they underſtood him: I am ſure the effects
of a ſincere devotion, for nine hundred years
together, which this manner of Worſhip
produced in this Nation, were much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from thoſe we have ſeen ſince the reducing
of the publick Liturgie into Engliſh, as is
manifeſt from thoſe Monuments, which yet
remain of Churches, Colledges, Religious
Houſes, &amp;c. with their endowments, and in
the converſion of many Nations from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm
to Chriſtianity, effected by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48446:31"/>
and zeal of Engliſh Miſſionaries in
thoſe times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is a matter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and ſo not to be regulated by the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of private Men, but the judgment of the
Church; and ſo univerſal hath this practice
been both in the Primitive Greek and Latine
Churches, and is ſtill (by the confeſſion of
the (Proteſtant) Authors themſelves of the
Bible of many Languages, Printed at <hi>London,
Anno 1655.)</hi> in moſt of the Sects of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
to have not only the Scriptures, but
alſo the Liturgies and Rituals in a Tongue
unknown, but to the Learned among them:
that who will diſpute againſt it, muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himſelf to hear the cenſure of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,
Ep.</hi> 118. where he ſaith, <hi>That it is a
point of moſt inſolent madneſs, to diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that be to be obſerved, which is frequented
by the whole Church through the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>He ſays,</hi> The ſincerity of Devotion is
much obſtructed, by making the efficacy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
depend upon the bare adminiſtration,
whether our minds be prepared for them or not.
<hi>In what Council this Doctrine was defined,
I never read; but as for the Sacrament of
Penance, which I ſuppoſe he chiefly aims at,
I read in the Council of</hi> Trent, Seſs. 14. <hi>Falſo
quidam calumniantur,</hi> That ſome do falſly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate
Catholick Writers, as if they taught
the Sacrament of Penance did confer Grace
without the good motion of the receiver, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48446:32"/>
the Church of God never taught nor thought.
<hi>But I am rather inclined to look upon this
as a miſtake, than a calumny in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. He ſays, <hi>The ſincerity of Devotion is
much obſtructed by diſcouraging the reading
of Scriptures, which is our moſt certain Rule of
Faith and Life.</hi> Here he calls the Churches
prudential diſpenſing the reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to perſons, whom ſhe judges fit and
diſpoſed for it, and not to ſuch whom ſhe
judges in a condition to receive, or do harm
by it, a diſcouraging the reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
which is no other than whereas St.
<hi>Paul, Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 21. enjoyns Fathers not to
provoke their Children, leſt they be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged;
one ſhould reprove a Father for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
his Child, becauſe he will not put
a Knife or Sword into his hands, when he
foreſees he wil do miſchief with it to himſelf
or others; the Scriptures in the hands of a
meek and humble Soul, who ſubmits its
judgment in the interpretation of it to that
of the Church, is a Sword to defend it: but
in the hands of an arrogant and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Spirit, that hath no Guide to interpret it,
but its own fancy or paſſion, it is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Weapon, with which he will wound
both himſelf and others. The firſt that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
promiſcuous reading of Scripture in
our Nation, was King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48446:32"/>
many years were not paſſed, but he found
the ill conſequences of it; for in a Book ſet
forth by Him, in the Year 1542. he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
in the Preface, <hi>That he found entred
into ſome of his Peoples hearts an inclination to
ſiniſter underſtanding of it, preſumption, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,
carnal liberty, and contention: which
he compares to the ſeven worſe Spirits in the
Goſpel, with which the Devil entred into the
Houſe that was purged and cleanſed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he declares, that for that part of the
Church ordained to be taught, (that is, the Lay
People) it ought not to be denyed certainly,
that the reading of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not ſo neceſsary for all thoſe folks, that
of duty they ought, and be bound to read it;
but as the Prince and Policy of the Realm ſhall
think convenient, ſo to be tolerated or taken
from it. Conſonant whereunto,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the
Politick Law of our Realm, hath now reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it from a great many.</hi> This was the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him, who firſt took upon him the
Title of Head of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
and if that ought not to have been followed
in after times, let the dire effects of ſo many
new Sects and Fanaticiſms, as have riſen in
<hi>England</hi> from the reading of it, bear witneſs.
For as St. <hi>Austin</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Tract. 18. in To.</note>
               <hi>Neque enim natae ſunt Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſes;
Hereſies have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Origen but hence, that the Scriptures which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48446:33"/>
in themſelves are good, are not well understood,
and what is underſtood amiſs in them, is raſhly
and boldly aſserted,</hi> viz. <hi>to be the ſenſe of them.</hi>
And now whether the Scriptures left to the
private interpretation of every fanciful ſpirit,
as it is among Proteſtants, be a moſt certain
Rule of Faith and Life, I leave to your ſelf
to judge.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>He ſays,</hi> The ſincerity of Devotion is
much obſtructed by the multitude of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
obſervations never uſed in the Primitive
Church, as he is ready to defend. <hi>he ſhould
have ſaid to prove; for we deny any ſuch to
be uſed in the Church.</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
as an eye-witneſs, the great devotion cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the wholſome uſe of Indulgences in
Catholick Countreys: there being no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
ordinarily granted, but enjoyns him
that will avail himſelf of it, to confeſs his
ſins, to receive the Sacraments, to pray, faſt,
and give alms, all which duties are with
great devotion performed by Catholick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which without the incitement of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
had poſſibly been left undone.</p>
            <p>8. He ſays, <hi>The ſincerity of Devotion is
much obſtructed, by denying the Cup to the
Laity, contrary to the practice of the Church
in the ſolemn celebration of the Euchariſt for
a Thouſand Years after Chriſt.</hi> This thouſand
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48446:33"/>
years after Chriſt makes a great noiſe, as if
it were not as much in the power of the
Church a thouſand years after Chriſt, as
well as in the firſt or ſecond Century to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and change things of their own nature
indifferent, ſuch as the communicating under
one or both kinds, was ever held to be by
Catholicks. But although the Cup were not
then denyed to the Laity, yet that the cuſtom
of receiving but under one kind was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
even in the Primitive Church, in private
Communions, the Objector ſeems to grant,
becauſe he ſpeaks only of the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it in the ſolemn Celebration: and that
it was alſo in uſe in publick Communions,
is evident from Examples of that time, both
in the Greek Church in the time of St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sozomen. li. 8. Hiſt. c. 5. &amp; Niceph. li. 13. c. 11. S. Leo Ser. 4. de Quad.</note> and of the Latin, in
the time of St. <hi>Leo</hi> the great.
As for the pretended obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Devotion, you muſt
know Catholicks believe that
under either ſpecies or kind,
whole Chriſt true God and Man is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and received; and if it be accounted an
hindrance to devotion to receive the total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of our ſoul, though but under one
kind, what muſt it be to believe that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him under neither, but inſtead of him
have Elements of Bread and Wine? Surely
nothing can be more efficacious to ſtir up
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48446:34"/>
Reverence and Devotion in us, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that God himſelf will perſonally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under our Roof.</p>
            <p>The Ninth <hi>Hinderance of the ſincerity of
devotion is, that we make it in the power of a
perſon to diſpenſe in Oaths and Marriages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Law of God.</hi> To this I anſwer,
That ſome kind of Oaths, the condition of
the Perſon and other Circumſtances conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
may be judged to be hurtful, and not
fit to be kept, and the diſpenſation in them
is, no more than to judg or determine them
to be ſo: and conſequently to do this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a hinderance, but a furtherance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
nor is it contrary to the Law of God
which commands nothing that's hurtful to
be done. As for Marriages we acknowledge
the Church may diſpenſe in ſome degrees
of Conſanguinity and Affinity, but in nothing
contrary to the Law of God.</p>
            <p>His Tenth pretended <hi>Obſtruction of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, that we make diſobedience to the Church
in Diſputable matters, more hainous than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to Chriſt in unquestionable things, as
Marriage,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>in a Prieſt to be a greater
crime than Fornication.</hi> I anſwer, That whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Prieſt may Marry or no (ſuppoſing the
Law of the Church forbidding it) is not a
diſputable matter; but 'tis out of Queſtion,
even by the Law of God, that Obedience is
to be given to the Commands or Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48446:34"/>
of the Church: The Antitheſis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
between diſobedience to the Church,
in diſputable matters, and diſobedience to
the Laws of Chriſt in unqueſtionable things,
is not only impertinent to the Marriage of
Prieſts, which is unqueſtionably forbidden;
but ſuppoſing the matter to remaind ſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
after the Churches Prohibition, deſtroys
all obedience to the Church. But if it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them only diſputable before, then why
may not the Church interpoſe her Judgment
and put them out of diſpute?</p>
            <p>But ſtill it ſeems ſtrange to them, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cannot or will not take the Word of
Chriſt, that is, his Counſel of Chaſtity, <hi>that
Marriage in a Prieſt ſhould be a greater ſin
than Fornication.</hi> But he conſiders not, that
though Marriage in it ſelf be honourable,
yet, if it be prohibited to a certain order of
perſons, by the Church to whom Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
commands us to give obedience, &amp; they
oblige themſelves by a voluntary vow to live
in perpetual chaſtity, the Law of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
us to pay our Vows, it loſes its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in ſuch perſons: and if contracted after
ſuch vow made, is in the language of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
no better than Adultery. In the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Church</hi> it was the cuſtom of ſome young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Widdows to Dedicate themſelves to the
Service of the Church, and in order therunto
to take upon them a peculiar habit, and make
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48446:35"/>
a vow of continency for the future. Now in
caſe they married after this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf.
<hi>1 Tim.</hi> 1. 12. ſaith, That they incurred Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
becauſe by ſo doing, they made void
their firſt faith, that is, as the Fathers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it, the vow they had made. And the
fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in which were
214 Biſhops, and among them St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
gives the Reaſon in theſe words; <hi>If Wives
who commit Adultery are guilty to their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
how much more ſhall ſuch Widdows as
change their Religious State, be noted with the
crime of Adultery?</hi> And if this were ſo in
Widdows, much more in Prieſts, if by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
they ſhall make void their firſt Faith
given to God, when they were conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ated in
a more peculiar manner to his Service.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice for Anſwer to the
Argument, which with its intricate terms
may ſeem to puzzle an unlearned Reader,
let us now ſpeak a word to the true ſtate of
the Controverſy, which is, whether Marriage
or ſingle life in a Prieſt be more apt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
or further devotion. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
himſelf hath determined the queſtion, 1 <hi>Cor.
7.</hi> 32. where he ſaith, He that is unmarried
careth for the things that belong to our Lord,
how he may pleaſe our Lord; But he that is
Married careth for the things that are of the
World, how he may pleaſe his Wife. This
is the difference he putteth between the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48446:35"/>
and Single life, that <hi>this</hi> is apt to make
us care for the things which belong to God;
and <hi>that</hi> to divert our thoughts from him
to the things of the World. Judge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which of theſe ſtates is moſt convenient
for Prieſts, whoſe proper Office it is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
wholly to the things of God?</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared Catholick Doctrines
from being any ways obſtructive to good life
or devotion, I ſhall proceed to his third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
by which he will ſtill prove that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
run a great hazard of their ſouls, in
adhering to the Communion of the Church
of <hi>Rome, Becauſe it expoſeth the Faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to ſo great uncertainty.</hi> This is a ſtrange
charge from the Pen of a Proteſtant, who
hath no other certainty for his faith, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man's interpretation of the Letter of the
Scriptures. But, Firſt he ſaith it doth this,
<hi>By making the Authority of the Scriptures to
depend upon the infallibility of the Church,
when the Churches infallibility muſt be proved
by the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this I Anſwer that the Authority of the
Scripture, not in it ſelf, for ſo it hath its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from God; but in order to us and
our belief of it, depends upon the infallibility
of the Church. And therefore
St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>ſaith of himſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Li. contr. Epist. fund.</note> That
he would not believe the Goſpel,
unleſs the Authority of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48446:36"/>
Catholick Church did move him. <hi>And if you
ask him what moved him to ſubmit to that
Authority; he tells you,</hi> That beſides the
Wiſdom he found in the Tenets of the Church,
there were many other things which most juſtly
held him in it: as the conſent of People and
Nations, an Authority begun by Miracles, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
by Hope, increaſed by Charity, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by Antiquity, the ſucceſſion of Prieſts,
from the very Seat of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom our
Lord commended the feeding of his Sheep, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the preſent Biſhoprick. Lastly, The very
name of Catholick which this Church alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſo many Hereſies hath not without cauſe
obtained ſo particularly to her ſelf; that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all Hereticks would be called Catholicks, yet
if a ſtranger demand where the Catholicks go
to Church, none of theſe Hereticks dares to ſhew
either his own Houſe or Church. Theſe (ſaith
St. <hi>Auſtin)</hi> ſo many and great most dear bonds
of the name of Chriſtian, do juſtly hold a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Man in the Catholick Church. <hi>Theſe
were the grounds which moved that great
Man to ſubmit to her Authority: And when
Catholick Authors prove the infallibility
of the Church from Scriptures, 'tis an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi>
ad hominem <hi>to convince Proteſtants
who will admit nothing but Scripture, and
yet when they are convinced quarrel at them
as illogical Diſputants, becauſe they prove
it from Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48446:36"/>
Next he ſaith we overthrow all foundation
of Faith, becauſe <hi>We will not believe our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the plaineſt Objects of them.</hi> But what
if God have interpoſed his Authority, as he
hath done in the caſe of the Euchariſt, where
he tells us, that <hi>it is his Body,</hi> muſt we believe
our ſences rather than God? or muſt we
not believe them in other things, becauſe in
the particular caſe of the Euchariſt we muſt
believe God, rather than our ſences? Both
theſe conſequences you ſee are abſurd: Now
for the caſe it ſelf, in which he inſtances,
Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> above cited confeſſes, that they
<hi>(viz.</hi> Catholicks) <hi>have a divine Revelation
(viz.</hi> Chriſt's word, This is my Body) <hi>whoſe
Litteral and Grammatical ſence, if that ſence
were intended, would warrant them to do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to all the Sciences, in the Circle;</hi> but, I
add, it would be no precedent to them not
to believe their ſences in other the plaineſt
Objects of them, as in the matter of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Chriſts Body after the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>3. He ſaith that <hi>We expoſe Faith to great
uncertainty, by denying to Men the uſe of their
Judgment and Reaſon as to matters of Faith
propoſed by a Church,</hi> that is, we deny parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Mens Judgment, as to matters of faith,
to be as good, if not better than the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and to infer from hence, that we make
Faith uncertain, is juſt as if on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one ſhould ſay, that Proteſtants make faith
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48446:37"/>
certain by expoſing matter of faith determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Church, to be diſcuſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
by the Judgment and Reaſon (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fancy) of every private Man. We have
good ſtore of this kind of certainty in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
But as for the uſe of our Judgment
and Reaſon, as to the matters themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the Church, it is the daily buſineſs
of Divines and Preachers, not only to ſhew
them not to be repugnant to any natural
truth, but alſo to illuſtrate them with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
drawn from reaſon. But the uſe, he
would have of reaſon, is I ſuppoſe, to believe
nothing, but what his <hi>reaſon</hi> can comprehend,
and this is not only irrational in its ſelf, but
contrary to the Doctrin of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he
commands us to captivate our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to the Obedience of Faith.</p>
            <p>4. He adds, <hi>We expoſe faith to uncertainty
by making the Church, power extend to making
new Articles of Faith.</hi> And this, if it were
true, were ſomething indeed to his purpoſe.
But the Church never yet owned any ſuch
power, in her General Councils, but only to
manifeſt and eſtabliſh the Doctrin received
from her Fore-fathers; as is to be ſeen in the
prooems of all the Seſſions of the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> where the Fathers before they declare
what is to be believed, ever premiſe that
what they declare, is the ſame they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by Tradition from the Apoſtles. And
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48446:37"/>
becauſe it may happen that ſome particular
Doctrine was not ſo plainly delivered to each
part of the Church, as it happened in St.
<hi>Cyprian</hi>'s caſe, concerning the non-rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
of Hereticks, we acknowledg it is in
her power, <hi>to make that neceſsary to be believed
which was not ſo before,</hi> not by inventing new
Articles, but by declaring more explicitly the
Truths contained in Scripture and Tradition.</p>
            <p>Laſtly he ſaith, <hi>We expoſe Faith to great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
becauſe the Church pretending to
infallibility, does not determine Controverſies
on foot among our ſelves.</hi> As if faith could
not be certain, unleſs all Controverſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
particular Men be determined, what
then becomes of the certainty of Proteſtants
faith, who could yet never find out a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
means to determin any one Controverſie
among them? for if that means be plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
what one Judgeth plain, another Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not ſo, and they acknowledg no Judg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them to decide the Controverſie. As
for the Catholick Church, if any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
ariſe concerning the Doctrin deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s caſe) ſhe determines
the controverſy by declaring what is of faith.
And for other Controverſies which belong
not to faith, ſhe permits, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one to abound in his own ſence. And
thus much in Anſwer to his third Argument,
by which, and what hath been ſaid to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48446:38"/>
objections, it appears that he hath not at
all proved what he aſſerted in his ſecond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the firſt Queſtion, viz. <hi>That all thoſe
who are in the Communion of the Church of</hi>
Rome <hi>do run ſo great a hazard of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that none who have a care of their ſouls
ought to embrace or continue in it.</hi> But he hath
a third Anſwer for us, in caſe the former
fail; and it is,</p>
            <p>§ 10. That <hi>a Proteſtant leaving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Proteſtant Church doth incur a
greater guilt, than one who was bred up in
the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and continues therein by
invincible ignorance.</hi> This is the directeſt
Anſwer he gives to the Queſtion, and what it
imports is this, That invincible Ignorance
(and <hi>he doth not know what allowance God will
make for that neither)</hi> is the only Anchor
which a Catholick hath to ſave himſelf by.
If by diſcourſing with Proteſtants, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Books, he be not ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
whereas he ought in the ſuppoſition
of the Anſwerer, to be ſo, that the Letter of
the Scripture as interpretable by every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Mans reaſon, is a moſt certain Rule of
Faith and Life; but is ſtill over-ruled by his
own Motives (the ſame which held St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
in the boſome of the Catholick Church) he
is guilty of wilful Ignorance, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a loſt Man; there is no hope of Salvation
for him. Much leſs for a Proteſtant who ſhall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48446:38"/>
embrace the Catholick Communion, becauſe
<hi>he is ſuppoſed</hi> (doubtleſs from the ſame Rule)
<hi>to have ſufficient conviction of the Errours of
the Roman Church, or is guilty of wilful Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
if he have it not, which is a damnable ſin,
and unrepented of deſtroys ſalvation.</hi> So that
now the upſhot of the Anſwer to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Whether a Proteſtant embracing Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion upon the ſame motives, which
one bred and well grounded in it, hath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in it, may be equally ſaved with him,
comes to this, that they ſhall both be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
though unequally, becauſe the converted
Catholick more deeply, than he that was bred
ſo. And now who can out lament the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of that great Doctor and Father of the
Church, and hitherto reputed St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who
rejecting the <hi>Manichees</hi> pretended rule of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
upon the aforeſaid grounds, left their
Communion to embrace the Communion of
the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And what is become
now of their diſtinction of points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
from not fundamental, which heretofore
they thought ſufficient to ſecure both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
and Proteſtants Salvation, and to charge
us with unconſcionable uncharitableneſs in
not allowing them to be ſharers with us? The
abſurdneſs of theſe conſequences may ſerve
for a ſufficient conviction of the nullity of his
third and laſt anſwer to the firſt Queſtion.</p>
            <p>As for what he ſaith to the ſecond, I agree
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48446:39"/>
ſo far with him, that every Chriſtian is bound
to chooſe the Communion of the pureſt
Church, but which that Church is, muſt be
ſeen by the grounds it brings to prove the
Doctrines it teaches, to have been delivered
by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. That Church is
to be judged pureſt which hath the beſt
grounds: and conſequently it is of neceſſity
to ſalvation to embrace the <hi>communion</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What then you are bound to do in reaſon
and conſcience is, to ſee which Religion of the
two, hath the ſtrongeſt Motives for it, and to
embrace that as you will anſwer the contrary
to God and your own ſoul. To help you to
do this, and that the Anſwerer may have the
leſs exception againſt them, I will give you a
Catalogue of Catholick Motives (though not
all neither) in the words of the fore-cited
Dr.</hi> Taylor, <hi>advertiſing only for brevity ſake,
I leave out ſome mention'd by him, and that

Antiquity of many of their Doctrines, (he ſhould

of Minor Biſhops (he means in acknowledging the
Pope head of the Church) which by being old
records, have obtained credibility; the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

            <p>Thus Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> an eminent and leading
Man amongſt the Proteſtants; and if <hi>he</hi>
confeſs that theſe Motives were ſufficient for
a Catholick to retain his Religion, they muſt
be of like force to perſwade a diſ-intereſſed
Proteſtant to embrace it, unleſs the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
can produce Motives for their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of greater, or at leaſt equal force, with
theſe, which ſo great a Man among them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
that Catholicks have for theirs. Here
therfore you muſt call upon the Author of
the Paper you ſent me to produce a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of grounds, or at leaſt ſome one ground
for the Proteſtant Religion of greater or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
force with all theſe: And as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>
ſaith, divers others which he omitted, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Scripture interpreted by the conſent of
Fathers, the determination of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
the known Maxime of Catholicks, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48446:40"/>
nothing is to be believed of Faith, but what
was received from their Fore-fathers as han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
down from the Apoſtles; The teſtimony
of the preſent Church, of no leſs Authority
now, than in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time, both for the
Letter and the ſence of the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do
this, and the Controverſie will quickly be at
an end. Particular diſputes are endleſs, and
above the underſtanding of ſuch, as are not
learned; but in grounds and principles, 'tis
not ſo hard for Reaſon and common ſence to
Judge. That you may the better do it in
your caſe, I ſhall deſire you to take theſe
two Cautions along with you:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Subject of the preſent
Controverſie, are not thoſe Articles in which
the Proteſtants agree with us, and for which
they may pretend to produce the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
we do: But in thoſe in which they
diſſent from us, ſuch as are <hi>no Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
no Purgatory, no honour due to Images,
no Invocation to Saints, and the like,</hi> in which
the very Eſſence of Proteſtant, as diſtinct
from Catholick, conſiſts. What Motives
they can or will produce for theſe. I do not
fore-ſee: The pretence of Scriptures being
ſufficiently plain, hath no place here, becauſe
then the foreſaid Negatives would be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be believed as divine Truths. And
for their own Reaſon and Learning, it will
be found too light when put into the Scale
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48446:41"/>
againſt that of the Catholick Church for ſo
many Ages.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Caution is, That you be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to diſtinguiſh between Proteſtants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
grounds for their own Religion, and
finding fault with ours. An Atheiſt can ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and find fault with the grounds which
learned Men bring to prove a Deity, ſuch as
are the Order of this viſible World, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
conſent of Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt
thinks he doth ſomewhat: But can
he produce as good or better grounds for his
own Opinion? No, you ſee then 'tis one
thing to produce grounds for what we hold,
and another to find fault with thoſe which
are produced by the contrary part. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath made Controverſie ſo long, and the
former will make it as ſhort; let the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer
therefore inſtead of finding fault with
our Motives produce his own for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in Controverſie, and I am confident
you will quickly diſcern which carry the
moſt weight, and conſequently which are to
be preferred.</p>

To the Firſt, by ſhewing that the
<hi>Motives</hi> which are <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſecure the
Salvation of <hi>one</hi> bred up and well-grounded
in <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, are <hi>not</hi> ſufficient to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

<hi>that</hi> to be neceſſarily embraced before

to put an end to the Diſpute, and give Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the Reader; and this had been
ſufficient; our Aſſent to the Articles in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
depending upon the ſtrength of
the Motives: But to multiply Diſputes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48446:42"/>
without cauſe, without end, and without
bringing them to Grounds and Principles,
as it is no good Argument to prove a man
not to be <hi>fond of Controverſie,</hi> ſo all the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi>
the Reader is likely to gather from
it, is a <hi>deſpair</hi> of being ever ſatisfied. When

much like, as if a <hi>Mother,</hi> to deter her Son
from travelling into other Countries, ſhould
tell him there was a great Sea between, full
of Rocks and Pirates, and no Veſſel ſtrong
enough to venture over: Beſides, that the
Countrey whither he was going ſwarmed
with Bears and Lions. This is one way to
<hi>let him ſee there could be no reaſon</hi> to think
of leaving his Native Countrey; and this
is the Method generally purſued by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
for want of ſound Principles, to
retain their Adherents in <hi>their</hi> Communion,
to make the <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>difficulties</hi> they are

inſuperable, and therefore beſt for them to

§ 2. <hi>His firſt Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion,
was, that</hi> an equal capacity of Salvation of thoſe
perſons ſuppoſed, not onely in order to a ſafer
Church, but in two ſeveral Churches ſuppoſed
equally ſafe, can be no argument to forſake the
Communion of the one for the other. <hi>To this,
I reply'd, that the</hi> Anſwer <hi>was altogether</hi>
impertinent <hi>to the</hi> Queſtion, <hi>the</hi> Controverſie
not being between two perſons compared with a
third in a ſafer Church; nor yet between two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Churches ſuppoſed to have in them an
equal capacity of Salvation, but between a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
bred ſo, and a Protestant converted to be
ſo, whether the later, having the ſame Motives
with the former, may not equally be ſaved with
him? <hi>To what purpoſe then was it to talk
of an</hi> equal capacity ſuppoſed in two perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with a third in a much ſafer condition, or
in two ſeveral Churches compared to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>unleſs it were to make his Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that a ſuppoſed</hi> poſſibility of Salvation <hi>in
the Catholick Church, was uſed by me as
a</hi> ſufficient Argument <hi>to embrace its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?
Whereas his own telling the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
concerned, that however Catholicks who
were bred ſo, might be ſaved; yet a Perſon
leaving the Proteſtant Communion for the
Catholick, could Not be Saved in it,
was that which occaſion'd the Queſtion.</hi>
A weak <hi>but common</hi> Artifice <hi>of the Doctor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48446:43"/>
and his Party, to deter Perſons from embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Catholick Communion; when yet
the more genuine Sons of the Church of</hi>
England <hi>are not ſo cruel as to damn all thoſe
who embrace it. The</hi> Anſwer <hi>then was</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>to the</hi> purpoſe <hi>of the</hi> Queſtion; <hi>and this
himſelf ſeems to acknowledge, when he adds</hi>
Whether it were to the Question or no, he is ſure
it was very much to the purpoſe, for which this
Controverſie was firſt ſtarted. <hi>And then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten this loop-hole, he</hi> beſeeches <hi>the
Perſon who had propoſed the Queſtion, to
propoſe another, and</hi> if not for her own ſake,
yet for his to inſiſt upon, that he may know one
reaſon at leaſt, why the Believing all the Ancient
Creeds, and leading a Good Life, may not be
ſufficient to ſalvation, unleſs one be of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church of Rome. And this, <hi>he
ſays,</hi> he cannot yet procure, though he have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
requeſted it. <hi>Here himſelf is afraid he
may be</hi> thought to digreſs; <hi>but ſo earneſt a
requeſt muſt not be denied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 3. I remember I promiſed to ſpeak
to this Point when it ſhould be <hi>proper,</hi>
(viz. in handling the ſecond Queſtion <hi>[Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be neceſſary to be a Member of ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Church?]</hi> where it came in order)
and I did ſo, (though my Adverſary takes
no notice of it here) as far as was pertinent to
the preſent purpoſe; when upon his Grant,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48446:44"/>
that <hi>A Chriſtian by vertue of his being ſo,
is bound to joyn in ſome Church, and to chuſe
the Communion of the pureſt;</hi> I ſubjoyned,
that <hi>that Church was to be judged the pureſt,
which had the ſtrongeſt Motives for it:</hi> and
then laid down a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of ſuch <hi>weighty
Motives</hi> for the Roman Catholick, allowed
by Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>

neither himſelf in his <hi>Defence,</hi> nor Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>
when he had a mind to invalidate them,
produced any thing to weigh againſt them,
but a few <hi>Tinſel-words,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 550.</note> and <hi>one Scripture-Teſtimony,</hi>
interpreted by and according to
their own <hi>Fancy.</hi> Having done this, they
ſing <hi>Io Triumphe,</hi> that [Thou ſhalt not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
any graven Image] <hi>will out-weigh all the
beſt and fairest Imaginations of the Roman
Church.</hi> And now let the Reader judge
whether he had any reaſon to ſay, that <hi>he
could not procure an Anſwer to this Queſtion,
though he had often requeſted it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 4. But becauſe he ſeems ſo little ſatisfied
with this Anſwer, as to take no notice of it,
I ſhall now enforce it farther with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<hi>ad hominem.</hi> There was in the
World before <hi>Luther,</hi> a diſtinct Church,
whoſe Communion was <hi>neceſsary</hi> to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
But this was not the <hi>Protestant:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was the <hi>Roman.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from his own Conceſſion; that <hi>a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
by virtue of his being ſo, is bound to joyn
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48446:44"/>
in ſome diſtinct Church;</hi> which is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if there be not ſuch a diſtinct Church
to joyn with. The <hi>Minor</hi> alſo, that <hi>this was
not the Proteſtant,</hi> is manifeſt, becauſe before
<hi>Luther</hi> there was no ſuch Church in the
World diſtinct from the <hi>Roman.</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
therefore (the Queſtion between him
and us being of the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of Communion
either with the <hi>Roman,</hi> or with the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant)</hi>
that of the two, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
was, and ſtill is, (as remaining ſtill the
ſame) that Church whoſe Communion is
neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. Again, taking the term <hi>Roman-Church,</hi>
not onely for the particular <hi>Dioceſs of Rome,</hi>
but for the Churches alſo in Communion
with it, as the Head, as we generally take
it in this Controverſie; nothing can render
her <hi>Communion</hi> not neceſſary to Salvation,
but either <hi>Hereſie,</hi> that is, an adheſion to
ſome private or ſingular Opinion or <hi>Errour</hi>
in <hi>Faith;</hi> or <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that is a <hi>Separation</hi> from
former <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Unity.</hi> For the firſt,
my Adverſary himſelf <hi>(Rat. Account, p. 54.)</hi>
acknowledges (as I ſhall ſhew before I end
this Chapter) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>all the ſame Articles of Faith with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi>
and that the Points in which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
differs from the <hi>Roman,</hi> are <hi>not Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith;</hi> conſequently, the Oppoſite
Tenets to them, can be no Errours in <hi>Faith</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48446:45"/>
with him. And for the ſecond, if he will
make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of <hi>Schiſm,</hi>
he muſt aſſign ſome other diſtinct <hi>Church</hi>
(then at leaſt in being) from whoſe Unity
ſhe departed; which I think was never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
I am ſure can never be performed.
As for the Charge of <hi>Cauſal Schiſm,</hi> that
is, the <hi>Churches</hi> having given juſt cauſe for
<hi>Separation</hi> (the common plea of all <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts)</hi>
by <hi>Impoſing,</hi> as is pretended, <hi>New Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith,</hi> and ſome of them <hi>Idolatrous;</hi>
as it implies an acknowledgment of the <hi>Fact</hi>
of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that is, of breaking <hi>Church-Unity,</hi>
to be on the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſide: ſo till the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
be made good, and judged ſo by
ſome other more competent Judge than
themſelves, they ſtand arraigned of the
<hi>Crime</hi> of <hi>Schiſm</hi> alſo, for breaking Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 6. Laſtly, not to ſpend too much time in a
<hi>Digreſſion,</hi> and yet ſatisfie his deſire, (and if
not his, the Readers) <hi>why the Believing all the
Antient Creeds, and leading a Good Life, may
not be ſufficient to Salvation, unleſs one be of the
Communion of the Church of Rome:</hi> I argue
thus: <hi>A Chriſtian by virtue of his being ſo,</hi>
is bound to be of the Communion of <hi>that</hi>
Church which <hi>evidently</hi> was the <hi>true</hi> one,
and the <hi>purest,</hi> until it be <hi>as evidently</hi> at leaſt
(if not <hi>more evidently)</hi> proved not to be ſo:
for otherwiſe he wrongs both his <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48446:45"/>
                     <hi>Conſcience,</hi> if he leave a <hi>greater</hi> evidence,
and adhere to a <hi>leſſer.</hi> But the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
as comprehending all thoſe in Communion
with her, by the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> not only of S. <hi>Paul
(Rom.</hi> c. 1. and c. 16.) but of the <hi>whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World of all Ages,</hi> was <hi>evidently</hi> once
the <hi>onely true Church of Chriſt,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qently
the <hi>Pureſt;</hi> and neither hath nor can
be <hi>as evidently,</hi> much leſs <hi>more evidently,</hi>
proved not to be ſo ſtill, ſince the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of thoſe who do or will deny it, is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
ſhort of the former. Therefore a
Chriſtian, by virtue of his being ſo, is bound
to be of the Communion of the <hi>Roman
Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 7. Having thus not only given <hi>one</hi> but <hi>more
Reaſons</hi> to his <hi>Demand</hi> (which I heartily pray
may do him good, becauſe he requeſted ſo
earneſtly to know them) I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
how ſpeciouſly ſoever it hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
pretended againſt the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>the believing all the Ancient Creeds,
and leading a Good Life, is all that is neceſſary
to Salvation;</hi> yet now there is <hi>more</hi> required
by him, viz. <hi>to joyn in ſome Church or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Chriſtians, by virtue of a mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Chriſtian, and that he is bound to chuſe
the Communion of the Pureſt Church,</hi> by which
I will ſuppoſe at preſent he means the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> I hope I may without
offence take the ſame liberty with him,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48446:46"/>
which he did with me, and deſire, if not
for my own ſake, at leaſt for the ſatisfaction
of the <hi>Presbyterians, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and other
Separated <hi>Congregations,</hi> to know one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
from him, why the believing all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Creeds, and leading a Good Life, may
not be ſufficient to Salvation, unleſs one be
of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land!</hi>
I confeſs I may be miſtaken to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him to mean by the <hi>pureſt Church,</hi> the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> It is not improbable,
as will appear in the following Diſcourſe,
that he means <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> but
let him mean which he will, it comes all
to the ſame paſs. I leave him to ſatisfie <hi>all</hi>
other Sectaries, why they are bound, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their Chriſtianity, to joyn in <hi>either</hi>
of <hi>thoſe</hi> two Congregations; or if not in
<hi>them,</hi> in any other which he fancies to be the
<hi>pureſt.</hi> Which done, I proceed to his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Anſwer to the Firſt Queſtion, very fitly
called by him the <hi>main buſineſs,</hi> becauſe it
ſerves him as a Foundation to raiſe ſo many
Controverſies upon, as by his manner of
treating them, may frighten any one that
ſhall but look toward the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
into deſpair of ever getting out of ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a Labyrinth.</p>

§ 8. <hi>His ſecond Anſwer to the Frſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
was, That</hi> all thoſe who are in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church of Rome, do run ſo great
a hazard of their Salvation, that none who have
a care of their Souls, ought to embrace it, or
continue in it, becauſe they muſt be guilty either
of Hypocriſie or Idolatry, ſins inconſiſtent with
Salvation. This, <hi>I ſaid,</hi> was as little pertinent
<hi>to the Queſtion, as the former; for,</hi> though
it be ſuppoſed that none ought to embrace or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the Catholick Church, by reaſon of the
great hazard, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> they run of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
yet if they do embrace it, why may they
not be equally ſaved, that is, with equal hazard?
<hi>To this he returns, that he is</hi> amazed I ſhould
ſay this Anſwer of his was not pertinent to the
Question, if the Queſtion were propounded for
any ones ſatisfaction, that doubted, which Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Communion it were beſt to embrace. <hi>And
who can chuſe but be</hi> more amazed <hi>at this
Reply, which gives no ſatisfaction at all to
the</hi> Queſtion? <hi>For the Queſtion, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the ſame Motives, and conſequently an
equal capacity, or hazard (as he will have it)
of Salvation in two perſons, what anſwer is
it to the Queſtion, whether they may not
equally be ſaved, though with hazard, to
ſay the hazard they run is very great? And
yet of 573 pages his Book contains, no leſs
than 544 of them are ſpent upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>

I added farther, That this Anſwer of his
implied a Contradiction, in aſſerting, that
<hi>all thoſe of the Catholick Communion do run</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>a great hazard of their Salvation,</hi> and
then affirming for proof of this Aſſertion,
that <hi>they must be guilty of Hypocriſie or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
ſins inconſiſtent with Salvation:</hi> Which
reduced into plain terms, is no other but to
ſay, they may be ſaved, though with danger,
and yet indeed they cannot be ſaved at all.
To ſalve this Contradiction, he runs to a
pretended ſuppoſition of <hi>wilful embracing or
continuing in Hypocriſie or Idolatry, ſins</hi> (if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented
of) <hi>inconſistent with Salvation:</hi> But
this Salve is not at all proper for the Sore,
ſince if the Motives convince the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and the Perſons be ſincere, as the
Queſtion ſuppoſes, there cannot with any
ſhew of Reaſon be any thing of <hi>wilfulneſs</hi>
ſuppoſed in the Caſe. The Anſwer then was
nothing to the purpoſe of the Queſtion; but
onely that it might ſerve him for an occaſion
to bring the <hi>whole Body of Controverſie</hi> into
the Field, and give a <hi>treble Charge of Idolatry</hi>
againſt the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> viz. <hi>in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Images, Adoration of the Hoſt, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints.</hi> There want not <hi>Learned</hi>
and <hi>Eminent</hi> men of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
who think the Charge to be over great; and
there needs no more than his <hi>own Principles</hi> to
make the <hi>Metal</hi> of his Proofs appear of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48446:47"/>
too inferiour an <hi>Alloy</hi> to bear it. Which
thus I ſhew.</p>
                  <p>§ 9. <hi>In his</hi> Rational Account of the Grounds
of Protestant Religion, <hi>pag. 54. he lays down
the ſtate of the difference between the</hi> Church
<hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>and the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>in theſe
words:</hi> The Church of Rome impoſeth new
Articles of Faith to be believed as neceſsary to
Salvation.—But the Church of England
makes no Articles of Faith but ſuch as have the
Teſtimony and Approbation of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World of all Ages, and are acknowledged
to be ſuch by Rome it ſelf, and in other things
<hi>(as that no Veneration is due to Images, the
Bread is not Tranſubſtantiated into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Chriſt, Saints are not to be invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
&amp;c.) ſhe requires ſubſcription to them,
not as Articles of Faith, but as inferiour
Truths; <hi>or as Dr.</hi> Bramhall, <hi>(Lord Primate
of</hi> Ireland, <hi>alledged by him) calls them,</hi> Pious
Opinions, fitted for the preſervation of Unity;
not, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that we oblige any man to believe
them, but onely not to oppoſe or contradict them.
<hi>This then is the</hi> Baſis <hi>and Foundation he lays
of</hi> his Rational Account of the Grounds of the
Proteſtant Religion, <hi>that no</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi>
Proteſtant <hi>Religion, as it differs from that of
the</hi> Roman, <hi>is an</hi> Article <hi>of</hi> Faith; <hi>that is,
that no</hi> Proteſtant <hi>believes, or if he do, he
ought not to believe, as a matter of Faith,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48446:48"/>
that</hi> the Images <hi>(for example)</hi> of Chriſt and
his Saints are not to be honoured, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Bread is not changed into the Body
of Chriſt, that the Saints in Heaven are not to
be invoked to pray for us: <hi>Nay, all that he is
obliged to by the Church of</hi> England, <hi>is</hi> not
to oppoſe <hi>or</hi> contradict <hi>them. This being ſo,
let us now ſee what follows from this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>It follows that the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>does not erre againſt any Article of Faith,
becauſe</hi> the Church of England <hi>as he ſaith,</hi>
makes no Articles of Faith, but ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be ſuch by Rome it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>2dly, <hi>It follows, that himſelf does not
believe any of theſe Points to be Articles of
Faith,</hi> Viz. <hi>That</hi> Veneration is not to be given
to Holy Images, <hi>that</hi> Adoration is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Euchariſt, <hi>or that</hi> the Saints are not
to be invocated; <hi>becauſe to be Articles of
Faith with him,</hi> they muſt have the Teſtimony
and Approbation of the whole Chriſtian World
of all Ages, and be acknowledged to be ſuch
by Rome it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> It follows, that after all this buſtle
to make the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
in theſe very Points of <hi>Veneration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
&amp;c. For ought any Man knows, himſelf
gives <hi>no interiour aſſent</hi> to any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Tenets, not even as to <hi>Inferiour
Truths,</hi> or <hi>Pious Opinions,</hi> becauſe <hi>the Church
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48446:48"/>
of England,</hi> as he cites out of Dr. <hi>Bramhall,
doth not oblige any Man to believe them, but
only not to oppoſe or contradict them;</hi> and it is
not likely he defers more to the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> than ſhe obliges him too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> and laſtly, It follows, that his charge
of Idolatry againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is
vain and groundleſs, for <hi>Idolatry</hi> being an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
againſt the moſt Fundamental <hi>Point</hi> of
<hi>Faith,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> according to
him, not erring againſt <hi>any</hi> Article of Faith,
'tis evident, that to charge the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> muſt according to <hi>his
own Principles</hi> be the moſt groundleſs, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
and contradictory proceeding in the
World. But it is time now to come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
onely I muſt not omit to deſire
every indifferent Reader to reflect, and judge
whether Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> to render the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the 39. Articles, digeſtible to the
moſt ſqueamiſh ſtomack of the niceſt Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt,
have not done a notable piece
of ſervice to the Church of <hi>England</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading
ſo many of them as are <hi>not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi>
by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (although they
be eſteemed the diſtinctive badg of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church of <hi>England)</hi> from the
dignity of being <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> into a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Claſſe of <hi>Inferiour Truths,</hi> as he calls them,
which neither himſelf nor any Body elſe
know, whether they have a grain of truth in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48446:49"/>
them, or no; and conſequently are not bound
to believe them? Nay, does he not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> both in her <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
and <hi>Government?</hi> In her <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by
freeing her Subjects from any obligation of
<hi>interiour believing</hi> her Articles (in which
ſhe differs from the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> to be
ſo much as <hi>Inferiour Truths;</hi> In her <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
by expoſing her Ordination to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
without ſcruple, by ſuch as in their
hearts judg it <hi>Anti-Christian,</hi> when he tells
them, her <hi>Senſe</hi> is to oblige them no farther,
than not to <hi>oppoſe</hi> or <hi>contradict</hi> it? Was it
not worth the while to rend aſunder the
Peace of Chriſtendom for a Company of
<hi>Opinions,</hi> which (though Dr. <hi>Bramhall</hi> call
them <hi>Pious)</hi> yet the <hi>greater</hi> part of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> for many Ages
have, and do condemn for <hi>Impious</hi> and <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous?</hi>
Is not this a very <hi>Rational,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi> expounds the word) a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Reaſonable</hi> Account of the <hi>Grounds</hi> of
<hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> and a rare way of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
her from the Guilt of Schiſm? Sure
he never thought of charging the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> with Idolatry, when he laid ſuch ſandy
Principles for his Foundation: <hi>Principles</hi> of
ſo <hi>brittle</hi> a <hi>temper,</hi> that it was not poſſible
they ſhould <hi>bear</hi> ſo great a <hi>Charge,</hi> without

and St. <hi>Hierom, (Ep. ad Cteſiphont.)</hi>
ſpeaking of thoſe, who ſet up their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
in oppoſition to the Doctrine of the
Church, that <hi>to lay open what they hold, is to

true, than in the ſubject of the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
concerning the <hi>Veneration</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> the
very <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> teaching, that the <hi>honour</hi>

upon the <hi>Perſon</hi> repreſented by it. This
<hi>Protestants</hi> themſelves confeſs in civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

this Controverſie; and yet the Doctor
will needs ſuſtain, that the <hi>honour</hi> given to

                  <p>§. 2. How vain and groundleſs (to ſay no
more) this Aſſertion of his is, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhewed in the foregoing Chapter, which
may ſerve for a full and juſt Refutation of
all he brings to juſtifie his Charge of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
not onely in this matter of <hi>Veneration</hi> of
<hi>Images,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Adoration</hi> of <hi>the B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
and <hi>Invocation of Saints;</hi> In regard
none of the contrary <hi>Tenets</hi> are with him
<hi>Articles</hi> of Faith; nay he profeſſes himſelf
not obliged to give any interiour Aſſent to
them ſo much as to <hi>inferiour Truths,</hi> or <hi>Pious
Opinions.</hi> But leſt he ſhould take this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
way of Refuting, by bringing things
to <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> for <hi>none at all,</hi> (as

<hi>Letter of Thanks,</hi> and <hi>Faith vindicated)</hi> to
remove, I ſay, the very Temptation of any
ſuch-like vapouring pretence from my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
I ſhall take the pains to examine
and anſwer (with as much brevity as his

his <hi>tottering</hi> becauſe <hi>groundleſs</hi> Charge
of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 3. <hi>In order hereunto, I ſhall firſt ſet
down what it is that the Catholick Church
teaches concerning the Veneration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and thus it ſtands recorded in the laſt
General Council at</hi> Trent, (Conc. Trident.
<hi>Seſſ. 25.) viz.</hi> That the Images of Chriſt, and of
the Bleſſed Virgin Mother of God, and of other
Saints, are to be kept and reſerved eſpecially in
Churches, and due Honour and Veneration to
be given to them; not for that any Divinity or
Virtue is believed to be in them, or that any
thing is to be asked of them, or any confidence to
be placed in them, as was anciently done by the
Heathens, who put their truſt in Idols, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the honour which is exhibited to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
is referr'd to the Prototype, or thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by them: So that by the Images which we
kiſs, and before which we kneel, or put off
our Hats, we adore Chriſt, and reverence his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48446:51"/>
Saints, whom the ſaid Images repreſent. <hi>This
is what the Council teaches, and the import
of it is, that we may lawfully (and therefore
ought upon occaſion) to put off our Hats,
or kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Saints, <hi>with intent thereby to</hi> adore <hi>him, and</hi>
reverence <hi>them; and this is what the</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<hi>calls (moſt conformably to the Light of
Nature and Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gion) the giving of</hi> due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Veneration to Images, <hi>but Dr.</hi> Still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>(moſt repugnantly to both)</hi> Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>§. 4 To maintain this Charge, he lays
down a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>opoſition, which I ſaid imply'd a
Contradiction, viz. that <hi>in the worſhip of God
by Images, the worſhip due to God is terminated
wholly on the Creature.</hi> For what greater
Contradiction, than that it ſhould <hi>be</hi> the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God,</hi> and yet be terminated <hi>wholly</hi> on
the <hi>Creature?</hi> What he brings in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
(p. 57.) is a pretence that God hath
forbidden it under the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and
that <hi>the Worſhip which God calls by the name of
Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>its being terminated wholly on the
Creature,</hi> are but the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me thing in other
words. And what is this in effect, but to
tell us firſt, that it is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> becauſe it is
<hi>wholly terminated on the Creature;</hi> and then
again, that it is <hi>wholly terminated on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
becauſe it is <hi>Idolatry?</hi> A very proper

Propoſitions</hi> is not ſo <hi>deſpicable</hi> and <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi>
as he would make it; but rather the
moſt expedite way for Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to reconcile
the Terms of the greateſt Contradiction.
But to the matter it ſelf I ſhall ſpeak more
anon. Let us now ſee how he proves this
main Propoſition. [viz. <hi>In the worſhip of God
by Images, the worſhip aue to God, is terminated
wholly on the Creature.] The worſhip,</hi> ſath he,
(p. 4.) <hi>which God himſelf denies to receive,
muſt be terminated on the Creature: But God
himſelf in the ſecond Commandment, not onely
denies to receive it, but threatens ſeverely to
puniſh them that give it: Therefore it cannot be
terminated on God, but onely on the Image.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. This is the <hi>terrible Argument,</hi> by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of which he paſſes the Sentence of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Damnation upon <hi>all thoſe who are of the
Communion of the Church of Rome,</hi> if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
not of their <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>doring Chriſt by putting off
their hats, or kneeling before his Image.</hi> And
that the Reader may ſee with what <hi>Justice</hi>
and <hi>Charity</hi> he does it, before I proceed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
particulars, I ſhall <hi>convene</hi> his own
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> to declare to the World, what
<hi>kind</hi> of Argument he judges <hi>this</hi> to be. If
onely <hi>Topical,</hi> or <hi>Probable,</hi> what anſwer will
he give to the Great <hi>Judge</hi> at the dreadful
day of Judgment, for <hi>poſitively</hi> condemning
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48446:52"/>
his <hi>Spouſe</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> for an <hi>Adultereſs,</hi> upon
an account which <hi>himſelf</hi> acknowledges to be
<hi>inevident</hi> and <hi>uncertain?</hi> I believe, himſelf
would condemn that perſon for <hi>unjust</hi> and
<hi>uncharitable,</hi> who ſhould <hi>poſitively</hi> charge
the meaneſt mans Wife of <hi>Adultery</hi> upon
the like account. If he judge it a <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi>
(which I cannot eaſily believe, he
ſeems to have taken ſuch a <hi>Pique</hi> againſt the
<hi>Demonſtrating Way)</hi> then the <hi>Premiſſes</hi> muſt
be <hi>evidently</hi> and <hi>certainly true,</hi> and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi>
in virtue of them, <hi>Impoſſible to be falſe;</hi>
and conſequently he muſt have <hi>greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Idolatrous,</hi>
than he hath (if he be of the ſame mind with
his Friend Dr. <hi>Tillotſon)</hi> of the <hi>Scripture's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word of God,</hi> or of the <hi>Sence of any
Text of it;</hi> for example, that <hi>Chriſt is God;</hi>
for the ſaid <hi>Doctor</hi> lays this down for his
<hi>Fundamental Poſition</hi> in his <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi>
p. 118. (and affirms it expreſly of the Books
of Scripture, in the Preface to his Sermons)
that <hi>we are not infallibly certain either that any
Book is ſo ancient as it pretends to be, or that it
was written by him whoſe name it bears, or that
this is the ſence of ſuch and ſuch paſſages in it:
It is poſſible all this may be otherwiſe.</hi> From
whence I infer yet farther, that if we are <hi>not
ſure of the Sence of any Text of Scripture, but
poſſibly it may be falſe, Himſelf is not ſure that
God hath forbidden the worſhipping himſelf by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48446:52"/>
Images in the ſecond Commandment,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot judge his own <hi>Argument</hi> to be a
<hi>Demonſtration,</hi> nor conſequently <hi>evidence</hi>
ſufficient to make out his Charge of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
But to come now to particulars.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. <hi>The worſhip,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
denies to receive, muſt be terminated on the
Creature,</hi> and that <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>onely on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
as he expreſſes it in the Context of his
Diſcourſe. This is the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition of
his <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> and if this fail, the Charge he
builds upon it, muſt needs fall. I aſſerted it
in my <hi>Reply,</hi> to be <hi>abſolutely falſe,</hi> 
                     <q>as built
upon a miſtake of the nature of humane
Acts, which though they ought to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by the Law of God, yet when they
ſwerve from it, ceaſe not to tend to their
own proper Objects, and that Gods prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of ſuch or ſuch a kind of worſhip,
may make it to be unlawful, but hinders
not the Act from tending whither it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Of this I gave inſtances in the
Prayers which Thieves and Murderers make
to God for good ſucceſs; the Jew's offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God the Blind and the Lame, which
he had forbidden, <hi>Cain</hi>'s bringing a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 3. which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to accept. All which I ſhewed were
notwithſtanding terminated on God; and
from thence inferr'd, that though God (as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48446:53"/>
he falſely ſuppoſes) ſhould have forbidden
men to worſhip him by Images, yet it does
not follow, but the worſhip ſo given would
be terminated on him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 7. To ſhew the <hi>inſufficiency</hi> (as he calls
it) of this Anſwer, he aſſerts, that <hi>where
God hath prohibited any particular way or means
of giving Worſhip to himſelf, that Worſhip ſo
given cannot be ſaid to be terminated on him.</hi>
And to ſhew the Vanity and Impertinency of
this Defence, I anſwer, That this very Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
of his, quite changes the ſtate of the
Queſtion; for his Charge being of real Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and that antecedently to any Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as appears by his contending that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth <hi>require the giving the
Creature the honour due onely to God,</hi> p. 3. and
by his aſſerting, p. 62. that <hi>any Image being
made ſo far the Object of Divine Worſhip, that
men do how down before it, doth thereby become
an Idol, and on that account is forbidden in the
ſecond Commandment:</hi> he now changes his
Peremptory <hi>[cannot be terminated on God]</hi>
into that Dwindling Expreſſion of <hi>[It cannot</hi>
be ſaid <hi>to be terminated on God]</hi> giving his
Reader to underſtand, that his meaning now
is not, that Catholicks are <hi>really</hi> Idolaters,
that is, by the very nature of Worſhip ſo
given by an Image antecedently to any Law
forbidding it; but <hi>denominatively,</hi> and <hi>in name</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48446:53"/>
onely; and that upon account of a Law
(ſuppos'd by him moſt falſely, as I ſhall
make manifeſt in the following Diſcourſe)
to prohibit the giving Worſhip to <hi>God</hi> by
bowing or kneeling before an <hi>Image.</hi> And
leſt we ſhould any way doubt that this was
his meaning, himſelf in the contents of his
Firſt Chapter, puts down the ſtate of the
Controverſie between us, in theſe words:
<hi>The main Queſtion,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is, Whether God
hath forbidden the worſhipping of himſelf by an
Image, under the notion</hi> or (as he explicates
it, pag. 57.) <hi>under the name of Idolatry?</hi> It
were worth the while to ſee the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion</hi> put by <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
with that <hi>Aſſertion</hi> of his above-cited,
pag. 62. that <hi>any Image being made ſo far the
Object of Divine Worſhip, that men do bow down
before it, doth thereby become an Idol, and on
that account is forbidden in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi>
The <hi>former</hi> ſuppoſes it to have
the <hi>notion</hi> or <hi>name</hi> of Idolatry, upon the
account of its being forbidden: The <hi>later</hi>
affirms it to be forbidden upon the account
of its being Idolatry in the very nature of
the thing, antecedently to any Prohibition.
And in which ſence ſoever of the two, he take
the Propoſition in debate, viz. <hi>[The Worſhip
which God denies to receive, cannot be termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on him, but on the Image]</hi> it is evident he
contradicts himself; For if he mean that it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48446:54"/>
cannot be terminated on God, <hi>antecedently
to the Prohibition,</hi> becauſe <hi>any Image being
made ſo far the Object of Divine Worſhip, that
men do bow down before it, doth thereby become
an Idol, and on that account is forbidden in the
ſecond Commandment,</hi> he muſt deny that it
is the <hi>Prohibition</hi> which makes it to be <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi>
on the <hi>Image.</hi> And if he mean that
it <hi>cannot</hi> be terminated on God, becauſe it
is <hi>prohibited</hi> by him to Worſhip Him by a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Image, he muſt <hi>deny</hi> what he aſſerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that <hi>any Image being made ſo far the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Divine Worſhip, that men do bow down
before it, doth</hi> THEREBY <hi>become an Idol,
and</hi> ON THAT ACCOUNT <hi>is forbidden
in the ſecond Commandment.</hi> Let him extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himſelf as well as he can out of this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth.
I return to what he addes in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his Aſſertion, viz. <hi>The Worſhip which
God himſelf denies to receive, muſt be termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 8. To vindicate this Aſſertion from the
Note of Falſhood I had fix'd upon it, he
lays down theſe three Propoſitions: 1. <hi>That
Worſhip is nothing elſe but an external ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Honour and Reſpect.</hi> 2. That <hi>the
ſignification of Honour which is due to God, is
not to be meaſured by the Intentions of Men,
againſt the declared Will of God. 3. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law being the Rule of Worſhip all prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48446:54"/>
ways of Worſhip muſt receive that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which God himſelf gives them: As,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>it would be Treaſon, after the Princes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of it by his Laws, for any man to bow
down to a Sign-Poſt with the Princes Head upon
it. And therefore if God have declared the
Worſhip of himſelf by an Image to be Idolatry,
it cannot be terminated on God, but onely on
the Image.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and what it amounts to, is this, That
if God have forbidden, under the <hi>name</hi> of
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> to bow down before any Image,
though with intention to Worſhip Him by
it, this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> muſt be <hi>called</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
becauſe not mens Intentions, but the
Will of God is the Rule of Worſhip. A
rare Defence indeed! But nothing at all to
the purpoſe, (although we ſhould yield the
Suppoſition to be as true as it is falſe, viz.
that God had forbidden it under that name)
unleſs he can ſhew that words can never be
taken <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> but that the very <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition</hi>
of a thing muſt always neceſſarily go
along with its <hi>name.</hi> What he charges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>us,</hi> is the very <hi>definition of Idolatry,</hi> viz.
That <hi>we give to the Creature the honour due
onely to God.</hi> What he brings to prove it, is
a ſuppoſed <hi>extrinſecal denomination,</hi> that if
God have <hi>called</hi> the Worſhipping him by an
Image <hi>Idolatry,</hi> it muſt receive the <hi>name</hi> of
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> and therefore be terminated on the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48446:55"/>
Image. And if this kind of arguing be good,
he may prove by the ſame Logick, that a
man worſhipping a falſe God, violates his
Neighbours Bed, becauſe God himſelf calls
the Worſhipping a falſe God by the name of
<hi>Adultery:</hi> And that he that wears a Sword
with intention to <hi>defend</hi> his Prince, hath a
real intention againſt his Life, in caſe the
Prince upon ſome occaſion have forbidden to
wear a Sword under the name of <hi>Treaſon.</hi> He
that has but look'd over <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold,
knows, that from the <hi>definition</hi> to the
<hi>name,</hi> the conſequence is good, becauſe the
<hi>Name</hi> is but a <hi>Note</hi> of the <hi>Nature</hi> or Eſſence
of the Thing defined. But nothing more
inconſequent than to argue from the <hi>Name</hi>
to the <hi>Definition,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Name</hi> may be
given upon the ſcore of ſome ſimilitude, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intrinſecal or extrinſecal, and not upon
the account of the <hi>Nature</hi> or Eſſence, which
is properly ſignified by ſuch a <hi>Name.</hi> The
Doctor therefore (to give him his due) in the
beginning of his Charge, argues like a <hi>good
Logician,</hi> when he would conclude the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of <hi>Idolatry, becauſe</hi> (he ſays)
<hi>ſhe requires the giving to the Creature the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due onely to God.</hi> But he plays the <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Sophiſter</hi> in the cloſe, when he would
prove that in worſhipping God by an Image,
ſhe gives to the Image the Honour due onely
to Him; becauſe if God have given it the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48446:55"/>
                     <hi>name</hi> of Idolatry, it muſt receive the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Either he muſt make
it out, that a meer <hi>Extrinſecal Denomination</hi>
has the miraculous power to reflect againſt
Nature, the Honour directed to God, from
Him to the Image, or he muſt confeſs that
Gods Prohibition of ſuch Worſhip (if there
were any) may make it indeed to be <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
but hinders not the Act from tending
whither it was intended: and conſequently
if it be intended or directed by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and Will, to God, though after an
<hi>unlawful</hi> manner, it will not fail to be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<hi>on God.</hi> Nor is this to make the <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men to be the Rule of Divine Worſhip,</hi>
for if God have forbidden himſelf to be
Worſhipped after ſuch a manner, the giving
him ſuch Worſhip will be a <hi>diſhonouring of
Him,</hi> though the Giver intend it never ſo
much for his honour. Diſobedience it will
be, or ſome other ſin, and <hi>denominatively</hi>
Idolatry (if forbidden under that <hi>name)</hi> but
not a <hi>terminating</hi> the honour due to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Image, unleſs the Doctor think it a
good Argument to prove the <hi>Fields</hi> and
<hi>Trees</hi> to be <hi>Merry Companions,</hi> becauſe the
Prophet ſays, <hi>The Fields are joyful, and the
Trees of the Wood rejoyce.</hi> Theſe he will ſay
are <hi>Metaphorical</hi> denominations; and ſo
muſt <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> be, in his ſuppoſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
unleſs he can prove the Worſhip
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48446:56"/>
due to God, to be terminated wholly on the
Image, and ſo the Act it ſelf to have in it the
true nature of Idolatry, <hi>antecedently</hi> to ſuch
a <hi>denomination.</hi>

                  <p>§. 9. As for that <hi>Courtly</hi> Compariſon of
his, that <hi>it would be Treaſon in any man to bow
down to a Sign. Poſt with the Princes Head upon
it,</hi> though with an intention to honour him
by it; (a moſt <hi>ſelf-denying Ordinance</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,

§. 10. To the <hi>Inſtances</hi> I gave in my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi>
of <hi>the Prayers which Thieves and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
make to God for good ſucceſs, of the
Jews offering to God the Blind and Lame, which
he had forbidden, and of Cain's offering a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to God, which he refuſed to accept;</hi> all
which evidently ſhew that God's having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
ſuch a kind of Worſhip, hinders it
not from being terminated on him: All
that he anſwers, is, That theſe <hi>Inſtances do
not ſuppoſe any prohibited Object, or Means of
Worſhip,</hi> as he ſuppoſeth the <hi>Worſhip of God by
an Image</hi> doth. And here again he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame Contradiction as before, viz.
that it is the Worſhip of <hi>God</hi> by an Image,
and yet the <hi>Image</hi> is made the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>ſole</hi>
object of <hi>Worſhip.</hi> But to conclude this point:
'Tis evident, that the Image is not made the
Object of Worſhip by the Intention of him
that gives it; <hi>which</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>Taylor) is that
by which God principally, if not ſolely takes eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of humane actions)</hi> for what he intends,
is, to Worſhip <hi>God</hi> by it; and the Intention
not making it the Object of Worſhip, an
Extrinſecal Denomination from a Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding,
(if there were any ſuch) cannot
make it to <hi>be ſo,</hi> nor hinder the Act from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
terminated on <hi>God,</hi> its intended Object.
'Tis manifeſt then, that the <hi>Major Propoſition</hi>
of the Argument brought by him to prove
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48446:57"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> viz.
That <hi>the Worſhip which God denies to receive,
must be terminated on the Creature,</hi> is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<hi>falſe;</hi> and conſequently all that he
builds upon it, falls to the ground. But
this was but a <hi>Prelude</hi> to uſher in his <hi>Minor,</hi>
viz. That <hi>God not onely denies to receive Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
by an Image, but threatens ſeveraly to puniſh
them that give it.</hi> Upon this it is he lays the
main ſtreſs of his Charge of Idolatry; how
inconſequently (though ſuppoſed to be as he
would have it, a <hi>Prohibition)</hi> I have ſhewed
already, and ſhall make yet more apparent, by
laying open the <hi>nullity</hi> of the <hi>Proofs</hi> he brings
to maintain it.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>1. WHat we are to conſider in
the firſt place here, is,
what it is that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will
undertake to prove; and it is this, That
<hi>God in the ſecond Commandment</hi> (according
to his reckoning) <hi>expreſly prohibited the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Worſhip to himſelf by an Image.</hi> This
is what upon his Second Thoughts (for the
term <hi>expreſly</hi> was not in his FIRST Anſwer)
he undertakes to prove: And I cannot but
wonder to ſee it drop now from <hi>his</hi> Pen,
who on the one ſide aſſerts <hi>Scripture</hi> (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<hi>expreſs</hi> Scripture) <hi>to be his moſt certain
Rule of Faith;</hi> and on the other ſide, <hi>denies</hi>

                     </gap> an <hi>Article of Faith, which is not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48446:58"/>
to be ſuch by Rome it ſelf.</hi> What may the
meaning of this be? If it be <hi>expreſly</hi> revealed
in <hi>Scripture</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>not</hi> to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by an <hi>Image,</hi> it <hi>is</hi> an <hi>Article of Faith.</hi> If
it be <hi>not acknowledged to be ſuch by Rome it
ſelf,</hi> it is <hi>no Article of Faith,</hi> but (as he calls
it) an <hi>Inferiour Truth</hi> or <hi>Pious Opinion,</hi> yet
ſuch as neither himſelf nor any man elſe is
bound to believe there is a jot of Truth in
it. <hi>Is</hi> it then, or is it <hi>not</hi> an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>
that <hi>God is not to be worſhipped by an Image?</hi>
If it be an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> 'tis falſe what
he aſſerts ſo ſtiffly in his <hi>Rational Account,</hi>
p. 54. that the <hi>Church of England makes no
Articles of Faith but what are acknowledged
to be ſuch by Rome it ſelf.</hi> If it be not an
Article of Faith, 'tis falſe what he affirms
ſo poſitively here, that God hath <hi>expreſly
prohibited it in the ſecond Commandment.</hi>
Which ſide ſoever he takes, 'tis manifeſt he
contradicts himſelf.</p>
                  <p>2. But perhaps his meaning is, that <hi>what</hi>
at one time is but an <hi>Inferiour Truth,</hi> muſt
at another be an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> according
as it may ſerve to the different ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
he has deſigned to himſelf. And here
if I miſtake not, lies the <hi>Knack,</hi> or (if you
will give it ſo venerable a name) the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of the buſineſs. When the <hi>Hedge</hi> of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> (viz. Subſcription
to her 39 Articles) muſt be broken down for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48446:58"/>
the good Brethren the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

as are not owned by <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, muſt be a
company of <hi>Inferious Truths,</hi> or <hi>Pious Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not</hi> to be <hi>aſſented to,</hi> but <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
for Unity's ſake. But when the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be charged with Idolatry, (the
Pretence <hi>with which Ignorant Preachers,</hi> ſays
Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> (Juſt Weights, <hi>p. 128.) drive
their Factions)</hi> then they are no more <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricur
Truths,</hi> but <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith, expreſly</hi>
revealed in the Holy Scriptures. Now,
would an Impartial Reader (to uſe Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>'s
expreſſion upon another occaſion) ſay
upon <hi>his conſcience, that this was not kindly
done,</hi> to make uſe of the Authority of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>unhallow</hi> ſo many of the
39 Articles as are not owned by her, and
caſt them down into the Claſs of <hi>Inferiour
Truths,</hi> to ſtitch up the <hi>Rent</hi> made by the
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi>
And then to <hi>conſecrate</hi> them again ſo eaſily
by virtue of this one definitive word [<hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly]</hi>

of it ſelf,</hi> the <hi>pains</hi> and the <hi>ways</hi> he takes

whether it be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>manifest</hi> even <hi>to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
we have cauſe to doubt; becauſe the
Propoſition in debate, [viz. <hi>That God hath
prohibited the worſhipping himſelf by an Image
in the ſecond Commandment]</hi> not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for an
<hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>obliges</hi> no man to <hi>aſsent</hi> to it, but onely
<hi>not</hi> to <hi>oppoſe</hi> it; and yet on the other ſide,
every man is bound to <hi>aſſent</hi> to <hi>that</hi> which he
ſees to be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>manifeſt.</hi> Such frequent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48446:60"/>
                     <hi>ſelf-contradictions</hi> are the natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of a Diſcourſe not grounded upon
Truth; And although the Reader may
think I take a <hi>delight</hi> to diſcover them in my
Adverſary, yet I can aſſure him 'tis a much
greater <hi>Grief</hi> to me to ſee ſo ſubtil a Wit ſo
often entangled in them. The fault is in
the <hi>Couſe,</hi> which cannot be managed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
falling into them. But as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſays, <hi>Quis coegit ers malam cauſam habere?</hi>
Who forced him and his Partizans to engage
in a bad Cauſe? Nothing of <hi>Faith,</hi> if it be
true which he tells us in his <hi>Rational Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:</hi>
Nothing of <hi>Reaſon</hi> as I ſhall ſhew in
the Examination of his Proofs.</p>
                  <p>4. The firſt way he takes to prove that
<hi>God in the ſecond Commandment hath expreſly
prohibited the giving any Worſhip to himſelf by
an Image,</hi> is from <hi>the Terms in which the Law
is expreſſed.</hi> And what are they in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
own Tranſlation <hi>Exod. 20. 4? Thou
ſhalt not make unto thee any graven Image, or
any likeneſs of any thing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt not
bow down thy ſelf to them, nor ſerve them.</hi>
Theſe are the <hi>Terms</hi> in which the <hi>Law</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
and where I pray, is it <hi>expreſſed</hi>
here, that <hi>we may not give any Worſhip to God
himſelf by an Image?</hi> The firſt part touches
not the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> nor of <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<hi>by them;</hi> but onely the <hi>making</hi> them;
and gives matter to Divines to diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48446:60"/>
it be forbidden by this Commandment
to <hi>make</hi> any Image or any Likeneſs at all?
A thing in which <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
are equally concerned. The ſecond for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
indeed in expreſs terms, to <hi>bow</hi> our
ſelves down to the <hi>Images themſelves,</hi> but
ſpeaks not <hi>one word</hi> of the lawfulneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs
of worſhipping <hi>God himſelf</hi> by
them. So that in caſe we have not here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of the Doctors <hi>Identical</hi> Propoſitions,
viz. that <hi>to treat a matter expreſly,</hi> is the ſame
in other words, as <hi>not to ſpeak of it at all,</hi> it
is manifeſt, that to worſhip <hi>God</hi> himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or by an <hi>Image,</hi> is not <hi>expreſly</hi> prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this Commandment. Let the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Reader conſider this well, and not
ſuffer himſelf to be deluded with the ſound
of words. To bow our ſelves down to the
Images themſelves, without any Relation to
God, is by the Conceſſion <hi>of all</hi> to worſhip
<hi>them</hi> inſtead of <hi>God.</hi> And is it all one <hi>to
worſhip an Image inſtead of God,</hi> and <hi>to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God himſelf by bowing before an Image?</hi>
The difference is <hi>too palpable</hi> not to be ſeen
by any one who hath not the <hi>natural</hi> Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of his mind <hi>corrupted</hi> by an over-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
deſire to purſue at any rate ſo unjuſt and
uncharitable a Charge as that of Idolatry.
The <hi>Jews</hi> we know did worſhip God by
bowing down before the <hi>Ark</hi> and the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,</hi>
and yet they did not worſhip <hi>them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48446:61"/>
of God.</hi> And if the Doctor will needs
contend that this was a particular <hi>diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they might lawfully
bow down before the <hi>Ark</hi> and the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,</hi>
to worſhip God; he muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the <hi>Precept</hi> (if it were ſo) as to that
part of <hi>not worſhipping God by bowing before
an Image,</hi> not to have been <hi>Natural,</hi> for then
God had <hi>diſpens'd</hi> with them in committing
<hi>real</hi> Idolatry; but <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not to oblige <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> unleſs he
will engage them alſo in the obſervance of
all the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> part of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
Taking then the Terms of the Law as
tranſlated by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their own Cauſe, 'tis manifeſt that
to <hi>worſhip God by an Image,</hi> is <hi>not expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,</hi>
becauſe <hi>not at all ſpoken of</hi> in that
Commandment.</p>
                  <p>5. What I aſſerted to be the <hi>meaning</hi> of
the <hi>Law,</hi> was, That <hi>God forbad to give his
Worſhip to Idols.</hi> To prove this, I urged
1. The Judgment of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who makes
thoſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf
any graven thing,</hi> &amp;c. to be but an explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the immediately foregoing ones,
<hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me.</hi>
2. That the word <hi>Peſel</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in <hi>Latin
Sculptile,</hi> (a graven thing) was uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſignifie an <hi>Idol,</hi> and particularly was
tranſlated by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> in this very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48446:61"/>
place <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To the Firſt he anſwers (pag. 99,) by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
How <hi>am I ſure this was St. Austin's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Judgment, ſince in his later Writings he
reckons up the Commandments as others of the
Fathers had done before him?</hi> But before I
reply to this Demand, it will be convenient
to lay down what was S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Judgment
in his <hi>former</hi> Writing, concerning the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Commandments.</p>
                  <p>6. In his LXXI Queſtion upon <hi>Exodus,</hi>
he treats this Point expreſly, and at large,
viz. Whether <hi>three</hi> Commandments onely
are to be aſſigned to the <hi>first</hi> Table, and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
to the <hi>ſecond?</hi> Or <hi>four</hi> to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and
<hi>ſix</hi> onely to the <hi>Second?</hi> And he gives his
Reſolution in theſe words. <q>
                        <hi>Thoſe,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>who aſſign</hi> four <hi>to the Firſt Table, will have
thoſe words,</hi> [Thou ſhalt not make to thy
ſelf an Idol; where Idols are forbidden to
to be worſhipped] <hi>to be a diſtinct Precept
from the foregoing words,</hi> Thou ſhalt have
no other Gods beſides me; <hi>and theſe other
words,</hi> Thou ſhalt not covet thy Neighbors
Wife, <hi>and,</hi> Thou ſhalt not covet thy
Neighbors houſe, <hi>with the reſt to the end of
the</hi> ſecond <hi>Table, to be but</hi> One. <hi>Thoſe who
aſſign but</hi> Three <hi>to the</hi> Firſt <hi>Table, make</hi>
whatever is commanded concerning the
Worſhip of One God; that nothing elſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48446:62"/>
be worſhipped for God beſides him; <hi>to be
but</hi> One <hi>Precept: and divide the laſt words
of the</hi> Second <hi>Table into</hi> Two, <hi>ſo that,</hi> Thou
ſhalt not covet thy Neighbors Wife, <hi>is one
Commandment; and,</hi> Thou ſhalt not covet
his houſe, nor any thing that is his, <hi>another.
Yet neither of them doubt of the Commandments
being</hi> Ten, <hi>becauſe this the Scripture it ſelf
witneſſeth. But to me,</hi> ſays He, <hi>it ſeems</hi>
more congruous <hi>to divide them into</hi> Three
<hi>and</hi> Seven, <hi>becauſe thoſe which belong to God
ſeem to inſinuate a</hi> Trinity <hi>of Perſons to ſuch
as more attentively look into them. And in</hi>
reality <hi>the very</hi> ſame <hi>thing is more perfectly
explicated, when</hi> Idols are forbidden to be
worſhipped, <hi>which was ſaid in the forgoing
words,</hi> Thou ſhalt have no other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
me.</q> Thus S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And then
having ſhown the laſt words of the <hi>Second</hi>
Table, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet thy Neighbours
wife, Thou ſhalt not covet thy Neighbours houſe,</hi>
&amp;c. to be two diſtinct Precepts from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Prohibitions, <hi>[Thou ſhalt not,</hi> and <hi>Thou
ſhalt not]</hi> anſwerable to the different nature
of the Sins forbidden he adds, <q>
                        <hi>But as to
that which is forbidden by thoſe words,</hi> Thou
ſhalt have no other Gods beſides me, <hi>it is
apparent that a more diligent execution of this
matter is imported by the words which follow.
For to what does that Prohibition belong,</hi>
Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf and Idol, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48446:62"/>
any ſimilitude of things in Heaven above,
Thou ſhalt not adore them, nor ſerve
them, <hi>but to</hi> that <hi>which was ſaid before,</hi>
Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before
me?</q> Theſe are the Words and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of S. <hi>Austin;</hi> in which the Reader
may note, 1. That he tranſlates, <hi>Thou ſhalt
not make to thy ſelf an Idol,</hi> not an <hi>Image,</hi> as
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> do very <hi>artificially,</hi> to make their
Aſſertion ſeem more plauſible. 2. That he
makes the <hi>ſence</hi> of the Law to be the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to give the Worſhip of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Idols.</hi>
3. That he does not make it a <hi>distinct</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
from the foregoing words, <hi>Thou ſhalt
have no other Gods beſides me,</hi> but onely a
more <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>perfect explication</hi> of
them. So that if the Judgment of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
be to be followed, either for the <hi>meaning</hi> of
the <hi>Law,</hi> or for the <hi>dividing</hi> of the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
it is evident he ſtands on the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick's</hi>
ſide, and not on the <hi>Proteſtant's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. This Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſaw very well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
found no other way to evade the
weight of his Judgment, but to call me to
Account how <hi>I am ſure that this was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Judgment, ſince in his latter Writings</hi>
(upon his bare word you muſt take it, for
there is nothing in the place to prove it) <hi>he
reckons up the Commandments as others of the
Fathers had done before him?</hi> He would ſeem

                     </gap> theſe laſt words to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inuate as if S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48446:63"/>
had changed his Judgment upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of <hi>what other Fathers had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him;</hi> but there is mention of no ſuch
thing in thoſe <hi>later</hi> Writings cited by <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi>
and in the <hi>former</hi> cited by me, 'tis plain
that he had conſidered the Opinion of thoſe
other <hi>Fathers</hi> before him (concerning the
dividing the Commandments as <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
do now) and that notwithſtanding their
Sentiment in the caſe, he rejected it as leſs
congruous to the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Law, and
the <hi>natures</hi> of the things forbidden. This
then was a pretty Artifice to amuze the
Reader, inſtead of ſpeaking to the Point.
But to come to his demand, How I am <hi>ſure</hi>
that S. <hi>Austin</hi> remained conſtant in this
Judgment, Let us firſt ſee what the words
are in the place to which he refers us in his
Margin, <hi>Who will ſay,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin)</hi>
(Contra duas Ep. Pelag. li. 3. c. 4.) <hi>that
Chriſtians are not bound to obſerve, that God
onely is to be ſerved with the ſervice of Religion,
that an Idol is not to be worſhipped, that the
Name of God ought not to be taken in vain, that
Parents are to be honoured, that Adulteries,
Murders, Theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s are not to be committed, that
falſe witneſs is not to be born, that our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Wife, that no other thing which is his, is
not to be coveted.</hi> Theſe are the words of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi>
And his Intention here was no more,
but to recapitulate the <hi>Duties</hi> enjoyned in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48446:63"/>
the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> which <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are bound
to <hi>obſerve,</hi> as is evident, 1. From his firſt
words, <hi>Who will ſay that Chriſtians are not
bound to obſerve,</hi> &amp;c. 2. From the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of them, which was to anſwer the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who accuſed him
for aſſerting. That <hi>the Law was not given to
juſtifie the Obſervers, but to be a greater cauſe
of ſin.</hi> 3. From his leaving out the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> as it was commanded to
be <hi>obſerved</hi> by the <hi>Jews,</hi> which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
excepted. This was his Intention in
the place cited by the Doctor, and not to
meddle at all with the <hi>manner</hi> how the
Commandments are to be divided; for
whether <hi>Four</hi> be aſſigned to the <hi>Firſt</hi> Table,
and <hi>Six</hi> to the <hi>Second;</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> onely to
the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Seven</hi> to the <hi>Second,</hi> the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
which Chriſtians are bound to obſerve,
are ſtill the ſame. So that the Doctor has
no more ground from hence to ſay that St.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> divides them in this place, as <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
do, than he has from the very words
of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> as they are ſet down in
<hi>Exodus,</hi> where although the <hi>Commandments</hi>
are expreſly ſaid to be <hi>Ten;</hi> yet how many
belong to the <hi>Firſt</hi> Table, and how many to
the <hi>Second,</hi> is not ſpecified. Concerning
this, he had delivered his Judgment profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
in the place cited by me, to be the
ſame which <hi>Catholicks</hi> at this day follow;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48446:64"/>
and if the <hi>Doctor</hi> queſtion'd the <hi>Conſtancy</hi>
of his Judgment, any man of Reaſon would
think it had been <hi>his</hi> part to ſhew he had
chang'd it; and not to ask his Adverſary
how <hi>he</hi> is ſure he had <hi>not</hi> done ſo, when he
could bring nothing to prove it, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
matter it ſelf in diſpute. This I confeſs
is a <hi>new</hi> way of anſwering the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the
<hi>readieſt</hi> I ever met with, excepting that of
<hi>denying</hi> them. Whether it be as <hi>Good</hi> as
<hi>New,</hi> let the Reader judge. I am <hi>ſure</hi> if it
be allowed for <hi>good,</hi> there is no more to do,
when an expreſs Teſtimony is alledged out
of any Father for any point in Controverſie,
but to ſtand up and ask the Alledger confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
<hi>How he is ſure</hi> that the Father did
not afterwards change his mind, in his <hi>later</hi>
Writings, although he ſpeak not at all to
that Queſtion in them. As for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
point in debate, viz. Whether thoſe
words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thee a graven
thing,</hi> be to be taken according to S. <hi>Auſtin,
not</hi> as a <hi>distinct</hi> Commandment, but as an
<hi>explication</hi> onely of the fore-going words,
<hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods beſides me?</hi> I
am ſure I have <hi>his</hi> Judgment profeſſedly <hi>for</hi>
me in his <hi>former</hi> Writings, and having <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi>
on my ſide, I am yet farther <hi>ſure,</hi> that
I ought not in juſtice to be deprived of it,
till the <hi>Doctor</hi> can bring ſome better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
out of his <hi>later</hi> Writings, than a bare
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48446:64"/>
                     <hi>recital</hi> of the Commandments; this being
in plain terms no other than to <hi>beg</hi> the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</hi>
The Reader may note here alſo, that
even in <hi>this</hi> place, cited by the <hi>Doctor</hi> for
himſelf, the <hi>ſenſe</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives of the <hi>Law</hi>
(whether it be a <hi>distinct</hi> Precept or no) is
the very <hi>ſame</hi> I gave in my Reply, <hi>ut Idolum
non colatur,</hi> that an <hi>Idol</hi> is not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.
And if I miſtake not, <hi>his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

                  <p>8. The next thing I inſiſted upon to ſhew
the <hi>meaning</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> to be the forbidding
to <hi>give the Worſhip of God to Idols,</hi> was the
uſe of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Peſel</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> to
ſignifie an <hi>Idol,</hi> and particularly its being
tranſlated <hi>ſo</hi> in this very place by the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint.</hi>
To this he returns a double Anſwer.
1. That <hi>ſuppoſing it ſignified onely an Idol, yet
that were not enough, becauſe there is added
another Word of as large a ſignification as may
be to this purpoſe, which is (Themuna) SIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITUDE.</hi>
But this is <hi>nothing</hi> at all to the
<hi>purpoſe,</hi> for how <hi>large</hi> ſoever its ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be, when taken by it ſelf, yet in our
preſent caſe, it is limited by the following
words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor
ſerve them,</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is made to be worſhipped as
<hi>God,</hi> that is, to be an <hi>Idol.</hi> And upon this
account, as Mr. <hi>Thorndike (Epilog. Of the
Laws of the Church,</hi> p. 361.) well obſerves,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48446:65"/>
                     <hi>Tertullian contr. Marcion, li. 2. c. 22. mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
affirms, the making of the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and Cherubins, not to have been againſt the
Law, becauſe not made for Idols, alledging the
words of the Precept,</hi> [Thou ſhalt not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
them, nor ſerve them] <hi>for</hi> a Reſtriction
<hi>limiting the</hi> Generality of a Carved Image.
<hi>And this Opinion,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>I doubt not to be
true.</hi> But <hi>to what purpoſe,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>St. are
words of the largeſt ſignification put into a
Law, if the ſenſe be limited according to the moſt
narrow acceptation of one word mentioned
therein?</hi> Inſtances I doubt not may be
brought of Humane Laws, in which words
of the largeſt ſignification are frequently
put in, (and to purpoſe too) when the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law-maker is, that they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
according to the <hi>narrower</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of ſome other word or words in the
Law. And that the Reader may ſee it was
not done to <hi>no purpoſe,</hi> in the preſent Law
under debate, I muſt deſire him to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the Heathens (as <hi>Origen Hom. 8. in
Exod.</hi> 20. and <hi>Theodoret Q. 38. in Exod.</hi> tell
us, when they expound <hi>this</hi> very Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
had <hi>two</hi> ſorts of <hi>Images; ſome</hi> which
were purely <hi>ſigments</hi> or Fictions of their own
Brain, made to repreſent what had <hi>no</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
but in their own Imaginations, as
<hi>Sphynxes, Tritons, Centaurs,</hi> and the like;
and <hi>others,</hi> which were made to repreſent <hi>ſuch</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48446:65"/>
things as had a <hi>real</hi> and ſubſtantial being in
the World, as the <hi>Sun, Moon, Stars,</hi> and
other like things, which they <hi>eſteemed</hi> and
worſhipped as <hi>Gods.</hi> And although the
word <hi>[Idol]</hi> as it is generally taken, be uſed
to ſignifie any thing that is <hi>falſely</hi> eſteemed
and worſhipped as a <hi>God,</hi> whether <hi>real</hi> or
<hi>imaginary,</hi> yet the <hi>former</hi> onely of thoſe
Images, ſay theſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> are ſignified in
<hi>this</hi> Law by the word <hi>Idol,</hi> and the <hi>latter</hi> by
the word <hi>Similitude.</hi> From whence it
appears that the term <hi>Similitude</hi> in this
place, is neither taken in its <hi>largeſt</hi> extent,
to ſignifie <hi>any</hi> Image or Repreſentation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
though with <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>worſhip</hi>
of the <hi>true God;</hi> nor yet in the <hi>narroweſt</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the word <hi>Idol,</hi> which is ſuch
an Image as is made to repreſent for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
a <hi>Figment</hi> that has no real Being; but
in a <hi>middle</hi> acception, for an <hi>Image</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of ſome <hi>real</hi> thing, but <hi>falſely</hi>
imagined to be a <hi>God.</hi> And it was to the
<hi>purpoſe</hi> that the Law ſhould be <hi>thus</hi> enlarged
for the Inſtruction of a people ſo rude and
prone to all kind of <hi>Idolatry</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi>
were: But ſuppoſing the <hi>Law</hi> to be <hi>Natural,</hi>
and not in part <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> it was nothing
to the purpoſe to put the word <hi>Similitude</hi>
in its <hi>largeſt</hi> meaning, that is, as ſignifying
any <hi>Image what ſoever, though made with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the Worſhip of the true God;</hi> when <hi>God</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:48446:66"/>
himſelf commanded the <hi>Ark</hi> and the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>
to be made for <hi>that reſpect.</hi> What the
<hi>Doctor</hi> ſhould <hi>prove</hi> (and it is <hi>his</hi> part at
preſent to <hi>prove)</hi> againſt theſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> and
the General Senſe of the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> for
ſo many hundred years, is, that the word
<hi>Similitude</hi> is to be taken <hi>ſo</hi> here; that is,
for <hi>any</hi> Image made with reſpect to the
Worſhip of <hi>God.</hi> But all the Proof he
brings, is a confident <hi>I confeſs it cannot enter
into my mind how God ſhould have forbidden
it by more expreſs and emphatical words than he
hath done;</hi> and yet his own words, (p. 60.)
that <hi>God forbids any Image or Similitude to be
made with reſpect to his Worſhip,</hi> I conceive
are much more <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>emphatical</hi> to his
purpoſe, than <hi>thoſe</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> for Thoſe
bear a great diſpute, Theſe none at all. But
to let this paſs; What he endeavours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of proving his own Aſſertion, is, to
render the explication brought by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
<hi>ridiculous,</hi> by a <hi>Compariſon,</hi> much
of the ſame <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Princes making it Treaſon to bow down to a
Sign Poſt with his Head upon it, with Intention
to honour him.</hi> And to do him right, the
Reader ſhall have it as it lies. <hi>If a Prince,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>ſhould under a ſevere penalty</hi> (you
may ſuppoſe it <hi>Treaſon,</hi> as in the other caſe)
<hi>forbid all his Subjects making any Image or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance,
with intent to give honour to him by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48446:66"/>
kneeling before them, would not that man be
thought very ridiculous, who ſhould go about
to interpret the Law thus, that the Prince did
not forbid them making any Picture of Himſelf
or his Son, or any of his Favorites, (for the
Worſhip of theſe could not but redound to his
own honour) but onely that they ſhould not make
the Image of an Ape, or an Aſs, or a Tyger,
thinking to honour their Prince thereby? Much
ſuch an expoſition,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is that here given of
the Law. God forbids any Image or Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to be made with reſpect to his Worſhip, (for
it is ridiculous to imagine the Law means any
thing elſe) but he</hi> (his Adverſary) <hi>ſaith, This
Law muſt not be underſtood to exclude a</hi> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,

to worſhip God by them; but onely they
ſhould not worſhip Apis or Dagen, an Ichneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or a Crocodile, or any the moſt ridiculous
follies of the Heathen.</hi> Behold here a quaint
Compariſon! A product of pure Fancy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that a Prince ſhould be imagin'd to
enact a Law ſo much againſt <hi>Nature,</hi> and his
own <hi>honour.</hi> But to make it run on <hi>all four,</hi>
with the Beaſts mention'd in it, viz. <hi>the Ape,
the Aſs, and the Tyger,</hi> ought not the Doctor
firſt to have prov'd the Senſe of the Law in

                  <p>9. His ſecond Anſwer to my Argument
is, that the word <hi>Peſel</hi> is very properly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
an Image, and <hi>doth not ſignifie barely an
Idol.</hi> And what he offers by way of Proof
is, that <hi>it is no leſs than forty ſeveral times

granting this to be ſo, does it any way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but their Judgment was, it was to be

an <hi>Idol:</hi> from whence the contrary to what
he infers, is plain, that when they tranſlate
it by <hi>graven Image, they mean no more thereby
than an IDOL.</hi> As for that final <hi>Concluſion</hi>
of his, (viz. <hi>By which it appears, that any Image
being made ſo far the Object of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that men do bow down before it, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
become an Idol, and on that account is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
in this Commandment;)</hi> not to ſpend
time in <hi>divining</hi> what <hi>that</hi> is by which <hi>this</hi>
appears (it is ſo very myſtical) the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

<hi>to bow down before any Image, though with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48446:69"/>
to worſhip God, is to make it the Object of
Divine Worſhip, and conſequently an Idol.</hi>
2. It <hi>contradicts</hi> alſo what he ſaid before,
that <hi>to do ſo,</hi> is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> upon the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
account, viz. <hi>becauſe it is forbidden,</hi> as
hath been ſhewn more at large above. Let
him <hi>not</hi> contradict Chriſts holy Spouſe the

much leſs accuſe <hi>her</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
<hi>God</hi> by <hi>bowing</hi> or <hi>kneeling</hi> before a
<hi>Crucifix;</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> were allowed to do
by the like actions before the <hi>Ark</hi> and the
<hi>Cherubins.</hi> When he can prove <hi>this</hi> to be
<hi>Idolatry</hi> from the <hi>Terms</hi> of the Law, or any
thing elſe, he will do ſomething. Hitherto
he hath done nothing, there being <hi>not</hi> any

<hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and the like, is <hi>extreamly diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to God,</hi> and yet not <hi>Idolatry.</hi> As for

is in the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> from whence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. The Propoſition he lays down for
the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the Law, is this; <hi>Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being Infinite and Incomprehenſible, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48446:70"/>
be repreſented to men, but in a way that
must be an infinite diſparagement to it.</hi> And,
if this be ſo, what ſhall we ſay to one that
ſhould repreſent God in Picture, as a <hi>Three-Corner'd
Light</hi> caſting out radiant Beams on
all ſides of it; at a little diſtance a reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Cloud</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> in a Circular form en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing
the Light: <hi>Within</hi> the <hi>Cloud,</hi>
near to the Fountain of Brightneſs, <hi>Angels</hi>
adoring; <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Cloud, Faith</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
praying; and directly under it, an <hi>Altar</hi>
with an inflamed <hi>Heart</hi> offering it ſelf in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?
Would ſuch a viſible Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as this, be an <hi>infinite diſparagement</hi> to
God or no? If my Adverſary <hi>grant</hi> it, (as
he muſt do, if he ſpeak conſequently to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
then what becomes of the <hi>Church of
England?</hi> For in the Frontiſpiece of her
<hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> Printed at <hi>London</hi>
by <hi>Robert Barker</hi> 1642. in octavo, <hi>this very
Picture</hi> is expoſed to the Eyes of all her
People; and to prevent their miſtaking it,
as intended to <hi>repreſent</hi> any thing but <hi>God,</hi>
the incommunicable Name <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> is
written in the midſt of the <hi>Triangular</hi> Light,
and that in <hi>Hebrew Characters,</hi> to ſtrike (no
doubt) a greater reſpect and reverence in the
Beholders? If he <hi>deny</hi> it to be an <hi>infinite
diſparagement,</hi> then what becomes of his
Fundamental <hi>Poſition,</hi> that <hi>God being infinite
and incomprehenſible, cannot be repreſented to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48446:71"/>
men, but in a way that muſt be an infinite diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to his Nature?</hi> Whatever <hi>Calvin</hi>
denies concerning the lawfulneſs of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<hi>God</hi> in Picture, we ſee how far the
Church of <hi>England</hi> allows it in the Front
of her Publick Liturgy, and there want not
other examples not unparallel to this, in
ſome of <hi>her</hi> Churches alſo. So that Dr.
<hi>Stillingfleet</hi> muſt either condemn her of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi>

to the Eyes of the People; or
himſelf of a moſt groſs Errour, when he
aſſerts in ſo univerſal a manner, <hi>that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be repreſented to men in any way but what
muſt be an infinite diſparagement to him.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he will ſay, they are not expoſed by the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for Worſhip. But <hi>that</hi>
belongs to the <hi>Conſequence.</hi> Our Queſtion
at preſent, is, about the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> whether
they may not be <hi>made</hi> without diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>God?</hi> Beſides that <hi>himſelf</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

maintains, p. 68. when he affirms, <hi>That they
tend highly to the diſhonour of God, and ſuggeſt

But of this more in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

§ 3. <hi>Pictures</hi> or <hi>Images</hi> made with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>God,</hi> may be conſidered <hi>two</hi> ways:

                     </hi> made to repreſent the <hi>Divinity</hi> it
<hi>Self,</hi> out of an <hi>Erroneous Conceit</hi> which the
<hi>Maker</hi> hath of it in his mind; ſuch as the
<hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> had of <hi>God,</hi> whom they
conceived to have <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Ears,</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi>
and other like bodily parts, as we have; or
<hi>as</hi> repreſenting immediately ſuch things as
bear a certain <hi>Analogy</hi> or Proportion to
ſome divine Perfections, and thereupon are
apt to raiſe our Minds to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and
Contemplation of the Perfections them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
As when <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>pictured</hi>
as he <hi>appeared</hi> to <hi>Daniel</hi> in the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of the
<hi>Ancient of Days,</hi> to manifeſt his <hi>Wiſdom</hi>

of a <hi>Dove,</hi> to ſignifie his <hi>Purity</hi> and
<hi>Simplicity,</hi> in a manner ſuitable to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.
The <hi>firſt ſort</hi> of Repreſentations
are an <hi>infinite diſparagement</hi> to the Divine
Nature; becauſe being infinite and inviſible,
it cannot be repreſented as it is in it ſelf by
any corporeal likeneſs or figures. But the
<hi>Second</hi> are no way diſhonourable to him,
becauſe they are not made to repreſent the
Divine Nature by an <hi>immediate</hi> or <hi>proper</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,
but by <hi>Analogy</hi> onely, or <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical</hi>
ſignification, as is above declared.
And if it were no <hi>diſparagement</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in ſuch or ſuch viſible forms, it can be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48446:72"/>
                     <hi>none</hi> to repreſent them in <hi>Picture,</hi> no more
than it is to relate or deſcribe them in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. This premiſed, I anſwer to the
<hi>Prepoſition.</hi> If his meaning be that <hi>Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being infinite and incomprehenſible, cannot
be repreſented to men</hi> (either <hi>Properly</hi> or <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically)
but in a way that muſt be an infinite
diſparagement to it;</hi> I deny it as <hi>falſe.</hi> God
the <hi>Father</hi> would never have repreſented
himſelf in a <hi>humane form,</hi> nor the <hi>H. Ghost</hi>
in the likeneſs of a <hi>Dove,</hi> had it been <hi>diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</hi>
Nor do I believe the Church of
<hi>England</hi> would have permitted the Divinity
to be <hi>pictured</hi> in the likeneſs of a <hi>Triangular
Light,</hi> had ſhe thought it a diſparagement.
But if his meaning be, that the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being infinite,</hi> cannot be repreſented <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi>
as it is, by any corporeal ſimilitude;
I grant it. But then the <hi>Conſequence</hi> in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of this <hi>Antecedent,</hi> can onely be this,
that to worſhip God by ſuch a viſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,
<hi>as conceiv'd proper</hi> to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is <hi>extreamly diſhonourable to him.</hi> And
in this we perfectly agree with him; but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deny what he farther infers <hi>without</hi>
any <hi>reſtriction</hi> or <hi>reaſon;</hi> that <hi>all Worſhip gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to God by any viſible Repreſentation of him,</hi>
(whether conceiv'd as <hi>Proper</hi> or <hi>Analogical)</hi>
is <hi>extreamly diſhonourable to him.</hi>

Having ſhown the <hi>Propoſition</hi> it ſelf (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
taken in the unlimited Senſe he gives it) to
be <hi>falſe,</hi> it follows manifeſtly, that it <hi>cannot</hi>
be the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the Law. Yet for a more
ample diſcovery of his <hi>Sophiſtical</hi> managing
of Controverſie, I ſhall give it a farther
Conſideration, <hi>as</hi> it is aſſigned by him for the
<hi>Reaſon</hi> of the Law.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. The Queſtion at preſent between us,
is, about the <hi>Reaſon of the Law,</hi> viz. Why
<hi>God</hi> forbad the making a <hi>graven Image,</hi> or
the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of any thing in Heaven or Earth,
or under the Earth, to <hi>bow down and worſhip
it?</hi> And on the <hi>People's</hi> part, to whom the
<hi>Law</hi> was given, it is evident that it <hi>was</hi> to
keep them in their duty of giving <hi>Soveraign</hi>
Worſhip to <hi>God</hi> alone, by reſtraining them
from <hi>Idolatry.</hi> But this it ſeems was too
plain and obvious a Reaſon for ſo <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi>
a Diſcourſer; He ſeeks therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
more <hi>ſubtil</hi> and <hi>elevated,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
more apt to lead a vulgar Reader in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a maze, viz. What <hi>Perfection</hi> in <hi>God</hi> was
the <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> why he made this <hi>Law?</hi>
What he aſſerts it to be, we have already
heard, viz. That <hi>the Divinity cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to men, but in a way that muſt be an
infinite diſparagement to it.</hi> What I affirm
it to be, is, <hi>The Supreme Excellency of God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
to which <hi>Soveraign Worſhip</hi> is onely
due, and not <hi>the incongruity of an Image to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48446:73"/>
it,</hi> as he often expreſſeth it. The
Queſtion thus ſtated, I prove my Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
                  <p>1. From the <hi>Preface</hi> of the Law (the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
place where the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of all Laws are
expreſſed) becauſe the <hi>Reaſon</hi> there aſſigned
by the <hi>Law-maker</hi> himſelf, is this, <hi>I am the
Lord thy God.</hi> And what is this, but I am
the onely <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Super-Excellent Being</hi>
above all and over all, to whom therefore
<hi>Soveraign</hi> honour is <hi>onely</hi> to be given, and to
none beſide me? Neither is there any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all made of the <hi>irrepreſentableneſs</hi> of
the Divine Nature, or the <hi>incongruity of an
Image</hi> to repreſent it to men; But the <hi>ſame</hi>
reaſon of his <hi>Supreme Excellency</hi> is enforced
anew from the <hi>Zeal</hi> or <hi>Jealouſie</hi> which God
hath of his honour, when immediately after
the <hi>Prohibition,</hi> he adds, <hi>For I the Lord thy
God am a Jealous God,</hi> (as the Proteſtant
Tranſlation hath it) by which he gives us
to underſtand that the Reaſon why he will
puniſh ſeverely thoſe who ſhall give his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to any thing beſide him, is, becauſe he
<hi>is the Lord their God,</hi> to whom onely it is
due.</p>
                  <p>2. I prove it from the neceſſary <hi>Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
there is, as of an <hi>effect</hi> to its <hi>proper Cauſe,</hi>
between the <hi>Prohibition</hi> of the Law on the
one ſide, and the <hi>Supreme Excellency</hi> of the
Divine Nature on the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48446:73"/>
To make this as clear as the matter will
give me leave, I muſt deſire the Reader to
reflect, that although there be <hi>no diſtinction</hi>
of <hi>Attributes</hi> or <hi>Perfections</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> but that
<hi>All</hi> are <hi>really one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> indiviſible
<hi>Perfection</hi> with his Nature; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>ſame</hi> with one another, viz. his <hi>Mercy</hi>
with his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> his <hi>Juſtice</hi> with his <hi>Truth,</hi>
and his <hi>Truth</hi> with his <hi>Omnip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tence,</hi> &amp;c. Yet
<hi>We,</hi> by reaſon of the narrowneſs of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
are forced to <hi>apprehend,</hi> and
diſcourſe (for example) of his <hi>Mercy</hi> as <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct</hi>
from his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> aſſigning <hi>them</hi> as the
<hi>proper Cauſes</hi> or <hi>Reaſons</hi> of ſeveral (even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
<hi>effects,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> produces by them.
When he <hi>forgives,</hi> we ſay, he does ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is <hi>Merciful;</hi> and when he <hi>puniſhes,</hi>
we ſay, he does ſo, becauſe he is <hi>Juſt;</hi> ſo
that the <hi>formal Reaſon,</hi> as conceived by us,
why he <hi>forgives,</hi> is his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> his
<hi>Juſtice;</hi> and why he <hi>puniſhes,</hi> is his <hi>Juſtice,</hi>
and <hi>not</hi> his <hi>Mercy;</hi> and ſo <hi>immediate</hi> is the
<hi>connexion</hi> between <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>effects,</hi>
that if you abſtract his <hi>Mercy,</hi> there is no
reaſon left to conceive why he ſhould <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give;</hi>

From hence, I think, I may infer, and lay
down this <hi>General Rule,</hi> That <hi>that Notion</hi>
or <hi>Perfection</hi> in God, upon which (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
preciſely in it ſelf) an <hi>effect</hi> depends,
ſo that it <hi>follows</hi> or <hi>not follows</hi> as a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from it, according as the ſaid noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>is</hi> or <hi>is not</hi> conſidered by us; ought to
be aſſigned for the <hi>proper Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> of
ſuch an <hi>effect.</hi> But ſo it is in our preſent
caſe, that if we conſider the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
preciſely as <hi>Supreamly Excellent</hi> (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
from its <hi>Incongruity</hi> to be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
it neceſſarily follows, that <hi>Soveraign
Worſhip</hi> is due onely to <hi>It,</hi> and not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to any other either <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Thing.</hi> But
if we conſider it as <hi>Inviſible</hi> onely, and <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentable,</hi>
(abſtracting from the <hi>notion</hi> of
<hi>Supreme Excellency)</hi> it doth not follow on
that account preciſely, that <hi>Soveraign Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
or indeed <hi>any Worſhip</hi> at all is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. An <hi>Angel</hi> is inviſible and cannot
be repreſented as he is; doth it therefore
follow that <hi>Soveraign Worſhip</hi> is due to him?
Or that <hi>any Worſhip</hi> at all is to be given to a
<hi>Sound,</hi> becauſe it cannot be <hi>painted? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
then, and not <hi>Inviſibility,</hi> is the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Reaſon</hi> of <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Whether a thing
<hi>can</hi> or <hi>cannot</hi> be repreſented by an Image or
Picture, if it have no <hi>Excellency,</hi> no <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
is due unto it; and if it have <hi>Excellency,</hi>
Worſhip is due to it, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48446:74"/>
of <hi>Excellency</hi> it is endowed with. And
upon that account <hi>Soveraign Civil Worſhip</hi>
was equally due from the People to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
being conſtituted their Prince by God,
when his Picture could be drawn, as when
it could <hi>not</hi> becauſe of the ſhining of his face;
or when he kept on his Vail, or put it off:
And God himſelf was no leſs adorable when
he appeared to <hi>Daniel</hi> like the <hi>Ancient of
Days,</hi> than when he gave the <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi>
without any <hi>Similitude:</hi> To conclude, to
be <hi>Supremely-Excellent</hi> is <hi>Proper</hi> to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
<hi>Not-to-be-repreſentable</hi> by an Image, is
<hi>Common</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> with <hi>Angels,</hi> though in a
higher degree: and however it enter <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially,</hi>
or <hi>à parte rei,</hi> (as the Schools ſpeak)
as the other Attributes of <hi>Truth, Wiſdom,

that his <hi>Excellency</hi> preciſely, and none
of the other Attributes, is the immediate
and formal reaſon why <hi>Soveraign Worſhip</hi> is
to be given to none but Him; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
why this Law was made particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to forbid it to be given (as at that time

Things,</hi> that is, Repreſentations of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Beings; or <hi>to any Similitude,</hi> that is,
the likeneſs of any thing, which although
it had a real Being, yet was not <hi>God.</hi>

                     <hi>3dly. Ad hominem,</hi> I argue thus. What
follows <hi>preciſely</hi> from the Divine Nature's
being <hi>Inviſible</hi> and <hi>Irrepreſentable</hi> (abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from its <hi>Supreme Excellency,</hi> the proper
Object of <hi>Latria)</hi> is onely <hi>this,</hi> that men
<hi>therefore</hi> ought not to preſume to make any
<hi>Image</hi> or likeneſs, to <hi>repreſent</hi> it as it is: and
the <hi>Law</hi> in virtue of it, muſt be <hi>to forbid
the making any ſuch Image:</hi> But Dr. <hi>St.</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denies the <hi>Law</hi> we treat of to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any <hi>ſuch</hi> Prohibition in it; as appears
by his words againſt <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others,
pag. 77.—<hi>[As though ever any Men
were ſuch fools to believe an Image could perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
repreſent an Infinite Being; or that God
need to make a Law to forbid that which is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
impoſſible in the very nature of the thing:
He might more reaſonably forbid men to paint
a Sound,—or to make new Worlds, than to
command them not to make any Image which
ſhould perfectly repreſent his Nature.]</hi> Thus
he, to ſhew the <hi>Law</hi> meant nothing leſs than
to <hi>forbid</hi> men to make an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God;</hi>
which yet is <hi>all</hi> that follows in virtue of his
<hi>not</hi> being <hi>repreſentable</hi> by any corporeal fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
Therefore, according to <hi>himſelf,</hi> the
<hi>irrepreſentableneſs</hi> of the Divine Nature, as
<hi>preciſely</hi> conſider'd, cannot be aſſigned for
the <hi>Proper Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this Law. Thus

§. 6. I come now to the places of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>tell us,</hi> that the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
of the Law was, That God's Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Infinite, <hi>could not be repreſented but in a
way that must be an infinite diſparagement to
him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the firſt. <hi>Iſa. 40. 18. To whom will ye
liken God? Or what likeneſs will ye compare
unto him?</hi> I anſwer, The Prophet tells us,
that nothing is or can be like or compared
to God; but where doth he tell us that
this is the Reaſon of the Law, unleſs we
are bound to believe it becauſe Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſaith
it? There is a likeneſs of <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> and
a <hi>likeneſs</hi> of <hi>Compariſon</hi> (as the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſeem to import) but neither of them
evince what he intends. For if the words
be to be underſtood of <hi>likeneſs</hi> in <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
all that can be inferr'd from them,
is, that ſuch a <hi>likeneſs</hi> is not to be made;
the <hi>Prohibition</hi> whereof, as the <hi>Doctor</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to be any part of the <hi>Law;</hi> ſo the thing
it ſelf makes nothing againſt <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who
abhor the very thought of <hi>making</hi> any ſuch

expreſly enjoyns her <hi>Paſtors,</hi> for preventing
any miſtake in ignorant and unlearned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<hi>When ſome Hiſtorical paſſage of H. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
concerning God, is repreſented in Picture,
to teach them that the Divinity it ſelf is not
thereby figured, as if it could be ſeen with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48446:76"/>
Eyes, or drawn in Colours, or expreſſed

are onely Repreſentations of ſome <hi>Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>Action</hi> of God, in a way proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to our Humane Conception. But if
the Prophet ſpeak not of a <hi>likeneſs</hi> in <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,</hi>
but in <hi>Compariſon,</hi> as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the Chapter in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Bible
affirm in theſe words, <hi>The Prophet comforteth
the People v. 18. by the Incomparableneſs of
God:</hi> that is, if his intent be (as their own
<hi>Annotation</hi> hath it upon that place, <hi>Bible in
Quarto, 1610.) to arm them againſt the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
wherewith they ſhould be tempted in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
by ſhewing that none of the <hi>Idols</hi> of
the <hi>Heathen</hi> were to be <hi>compared</hi> to Him in
<hi>Wiſdom, Greatneſs, Power,</hi> &amp;c. as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
he does from <hi>v.</hi> 12. to the end of the
Chapter; it is no more to the purpoſe for
which he alledges it, <hi>viz. Therefore it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to worſhip God himſelf by bowing or
kneeling before an Image,</hi> than if one ſhould
ſay, There is <hi>no compariſon</hi> for <hi>Riches</hi> and
<hi>Greatneſs</hi> between a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Peaſant;
therefore</hi> it is not lawful to give honour to
the <hi>King,</hi> by putting off ones Hat before his

                  <p>§. 7. To the other Text of <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 15.
where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Take good heed to your
ſelves, (for ye ſaw no manner of Similitude in
the day that the Lord ſpake to you.)</hi> I anſwer,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48446:76"/>
That <hi>de facto</hi> no manner of <hi>Similitude</hi> was
ſeen at that time by the People, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they might not take occaſion (as they
were apt enough) to conceive it to have
been a proper Repreſentation of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and ſo entertain an erroneous Conceit
of God. Notwithſtanding, if it had ſo
pleas'd him, when he gave the Law he might
have appeared to the People in ſome viſible
likeneſs, without diſparagement to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as it is likely he did in a glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to <hi>Moſes,</hi> at the Second giving of the
Law, (when he <hi>deſcended and ſtood with him
on the Rock, and he ſaw the back parts of God,
and bowed to the Earth, and worſhipped,</hi> Exod.
33. 23. &amp; 34. 5, 8.) and as both before and
after he appeared to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi>
and conſequently his <hi>not appearing</hi> ſo
<hi>de facto,</hi> could <hi>not</hi> be the Reaſon of the Law.
For as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf confeſſes very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly,
p. 63. <hi>Although God had appeared
with a</hi> Similitude <hi>then, yet there might have
been great reaſon for making a Law againſt
worſhipping the Heathen Idols, or fixing the
intention of their Worſhip upon the bare Image;</hi>
I add, <hi>Even againſt thinking of honouring
God, by an Image made by men,</hi> (if that were
the meaning of the Law, as it is not) ſince
ſuch a Law (if neceſſary) might have been
made, and would have obliged, although
God had choſen ſome viſible <hi>likeneſs</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48446:77"/>
in at that time. The words then <hi>(For
ye ſaw no manner of Similitude on the day that
the Lord ſpake to you)</hi> though cited by the
Doctor without a Parentheſis, to make them
ſeem of more force, were not ſet down by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Reaſon of the Law: But the
matter of fact was made uſe of by him as a
<hi>Motive</hi> to induce the People to the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of it, in a <hi>Sermon</hi> he makes <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. to
preſs them to that duty. And this Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
alſo the Doctor might have found in
his <hi>own Bible,</hi> if he had but vouchſafed to
caſt his Eye upon the Contents of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
where the <hi>whole Diſcourſe</hi> is entituled,
<hi>An Exhortation to Obedience;</hi> or on the
<hi>Breviate</hi> on the top of the Page, where the
<hi>Arguments</hi> us'd in it are call'd <hi>Perſwaſions to
Obedience.</hi> But <hi>there</hi> was the word <hi>likeneſs</hi>
in the firſt Text; and <hi>Similitude</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
denied of God; and theſe were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
without conſidering the <hi>Context,</hi> or
the <hi>intent</hi> of the Writer, or the <hi>Contents</hi>
of the Chapters, to ask, Whether <hi>God by
that Reaſon doth not declare, that all Worſhip
given to him by any viſible Repreſentation of
him, is extreamly diſhonourable to him?</hi> Now,
though Proteſtants may hold with Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>moſt certain Rule of
their Faith;</hi> yet unleſs they wilfully ſhut their
Eyes, they cannot think the Method he takes,
to be the <hi>moſt certain way</hi> to <hi>find</hi> out
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48446:77"/>
its <hi>Senſe.</hi> But to draw to a Concluſion in
this matter.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. Let us ſuppoſe the <hi>Argument</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all that hath been ſaid to ſhew its
deficiency in all its parts) to be good and
ſound, and that, in its largeſt extent, viz.
<hi>The Nature of God being infinite and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible,
cannot be repreſented to men but
in a way that muſt be an infinite diſparagement
to it.</hi> Let us grant, I ſay, this <hi>Antecedent,</hi>
and the Places of Scripture in the ſenſe they
are cited by him. Let us grant the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
too he infers from them, Therefore
all Worſhip given to <hi>Him, by any viſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of him</hi> (whether <hi>Proper</hi> or <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical)
is extreamly diſhonourable to him.</hi>
Suppoſe, I ſay, all this to be ſo. Will
it follow from hence that <hi>Chriſt</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his <hi>Humanity,</hi> cannot be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
but with great <hi>diſparagement</hi> to
Him? Or, that to <hi>put off our Hats,</hi>
when we behold the Figure of his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Body,</hi> as Nailed upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi>
with intent to Worſhip Him, muſt be
extremly <hi>diſhonourable</hi> to Him? What
if the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man be <hi>Inviſible,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be repreſented by any Corporeal
Figure or Colours? Will it follow
from thence, that <hi>any Picture</hi> made to
repreſent a <hi>Prince</hi> according to his Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Features, would be a <hi>diſparagement</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48446:78"/>
to him? and any <hi>Honour</hi> given him by
means of ſuch a Repreſentation, a <hi>Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi>
The Conſequence he brings is no
better, in order to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Image.</hi>
If then his <hi>Argument</hi> do not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the practiſe of <hi>Catholicks</hi> in making
the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Saints,</hi> with
reſpect to their Honour; to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
was it to lay down for the <hi>Reaſon</hi>
of the <hi>Law,</hi> (in which he will have it
to be forbidden) That <hi>God's Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Infinite and Incomprehenſible, could not
be repreſented without infinite diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to it?</hi> To what purpoſe was it to
ſpend no leſs than three Pages, as he
does §. 6. in citing Authours to prove
that the <hi>Wiſer Perſons of the Heathens
themſelves condemned the Worſhip of God
by Images, as incongruous to a Divine Nature?</hi>
Was it to make his Reader believe that
<hi>Catholicks</hi> allow of any <hi>Pictures</hi> as proper
<hi>Repreſentations</hi> of the Inviſible <hi>Deity?</hi>
Let him lay his Hand upon his Heart.
I have told him the Churches Senſe in
that Point. What thoſe <hi>Wiſer</hi> Perſons
of the <hi>Heathens</hi> meant, is evident from
their <hi>Words,</hi> and from the <hi>Time</hi> in which
they lived, to be this: That the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of <hi>God</hi> being <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Inviſible,</hi>
it could not be repreſented by any thing
<hi>like</hi> unto it; and therefore the <hi>Worſhip</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48446:78"/>
which the <hi>People</hi> gave to their <hi>Images,</hi> as
<hi>Gods,</hi> or <hi>like</hi> unto the <hi>Gods</hi> they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
was <hi>incongruous</hi> to the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and a <hi>diſparagement</hi> to the <hi>Deity.</hi>
And if the <hi>Germans,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth,
<hi>(de morib. German. c. 9.)</hi> rejected Images
<hi>made in the likeneſs of men,</hi> (which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
conveniently leaves out) <hi>becauſe they
thought them unſuitable to the Greatneſs of
Celeſtial Deities</hi> (for, Other <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols</hi>
they had in their conſecrated <hi>Groves,</hi> as
the ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> there witneſſeth, and
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſuppreſſeth) it was but what the

the <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>Deity;</hi> which, had the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of <hi>God made Man</hi> been revealed to
them, would have taught them alſo, that
it was <hi>no diſparagement</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> to be <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Worſhip unlawful by the Light of Nature,
equally unlawful to Jews and Christians.
A ſtrange Paradox advanced by Dr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,
viz. What can an Image do to the
heightning of Devotion, or raiſing Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?
How far his Devotion to the
Sun may be allowed in the Judgment of
St. Leo.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1. FRom the Notions of the <hi>Wiſer
Heathens</hi> concerning the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of <hi>Images,</hi> he paſſes to the
<hi>Clearer Diſcoveries</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> S. 7. and
wonders as at <hi>a thing of all things the moſt
ſtrange to him, that any Perſons ſhould think
this Precept onely reſpected the Jewiſh Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi>
and he repeats his wonder in a higher
ſtrain, p. 67. when he asks, <hi>How any men in
their Senſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> can imagine that Worſhip to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
among Christians, which was unlawful to
the Jews?</hi> It ſeems he wanted an <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>
to combate, and rather than lay down
his Weapons, he was reſolved to make <hi>one,</hi>
though of empty Air: For there is not one
word in the <hi>Reply</hi> (which he pretends to
anſwer) to ſignifie that the Author of it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48446:79"/>
ever look'd upon this Precept as a <hi>meer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Law;</hi> (which by his <hi>wondering</hi> he
would make his Reader believe) but the
quite contrary. For the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Law
there given, is this, That what <hi>God forbids
in it, is, to give his Worſhip to Idols;</hi> which
<hi>Prohibition</hi> being but an <hi>Explication</hi> of the
<hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> muſt equally oblige both
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Yet to ſpeak to a
Point, the occaſion of ſo much wonder.
What <hi>Worſhip</hi> is it he means was <hi>unlawful</hi>
to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and is <hi>lawful</hi> to <hi>Chriſtians?</hi>
Was it to worſhip God by ſome <hi>Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Figures inſtituted to raiſe their Minds
to a more lively apprehenſion of Gods <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
and <hi>Glory?</hi> No; for this the <hi>Jews</hi> did
by bowing down before the <hi>Ark</hi> and the
<hi>Cherubins;</hi> and very lawfully they did it,
as appears by <hi>David</hi>'s exhorting them to
<hi>bow</hi> or <hi>fall down before the footſtool of God,</hi>
Pſal. 98. Or was it to worſhip God by
ſome Corporeal Repreſentation conceiv'd
as <hi>Proper</hi> to his Nature? This he hath been
told before, is no leſs <hi>unlawful</hi> to Chriſtians
now, than it was formerly to the Jews, but
rather more, by reaſon of the clearer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
they have of the Nature of God.
What <hi>Worſhip</hi> then does he mean? Pray
take it in his own words, and make the beſt
on't you can. God's being a Spirit, <hi>is given,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>as a particular Reaſon why we ought
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48446:80"/>
to worſhip him after a ſpiritual manner, and
not by any Corporeal Repreſentation, as the
Jews ſaid the Samaritans worſhipped God in the
form of a Dove.</hi> This is what he ſaith;
and if his words be to be taken with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to what the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did, he ought
firſt to have told us what that was; For as
it appears from Scripture, 4 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 33.
they made an <hi>erroneous</hi> Conceit of <hi>God,</hi>
becauſe they <hi>worſhipped him together with the
Gods of the Aſſyrians,</hi> and as <hi>One</hi> of <hi>Many,</hi>
though the <hi>Beſt</hi> of the Company; which
neither the <hi>Jews</hi> did, nor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (I hope)
do, but as the <hi>onely true God.</hi> But if his
words muſt be taken without that reſpect,
as they make up an <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
viz. <hi>God is a Spirit, therefore we
ought to worſhip him after a ſpiritual manner,
and not by any Corporeal Repreſentation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever:</hi>
As the <hi>Conſequence</hi> will hold as well
againſt worſhipping God by any Corporeal
<hi>Geſture</hi> or <hi>Ceremony,</hi> as by an <hi>Image;</hi> So the
giving him Worſhip by any Corporeal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
(ſuppoſing the Law not to be
meerly <hi>Poſitive,</hi> but <hi>Natural,</hi> and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</hi>
good) was, and is alike <hi>unlawful</hi>
both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But in caſe
there were a particular Prohibition
given to the Jews (by reaſon of their
proneneſs to Idolatry) of not making any
Image or likeneſs for Worſhip, though of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48446:80"/>

diſpens'd with, in the making and uſe of
the <hi>Ark</hi> and <hi>Cherubins,</hi> and ſo not obliging
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but manifeſtly inferring, that <hi>the
uſe of Images</hi> (abſtracting from ſuch a <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Prohibition) <hi>is not unlawful.</hi> From
hence it appears how incongruous his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
is between the <hi>uſe of Images</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Swearing: This</hi> being of its own nature
<hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>always dangerous; That</hi> not <hi>ſuch;</hi> nor

means not onely an Image of the <hi>Deity</hi> by
way of <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> or <hi>Analogy,</hi> or <hi>Union; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>tends highly to the

the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Fathers</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
it as a <hi>great Abſurdity,</hi> (p. 79.) the
reaſon whereof he ſeems to give in this
place, when he immediately addes, <hi>And is
there no danger among Chriſtians, that they
ſhould entertain too low and unworthy thoughts
of God? And can any thing tend to it more
effectually, than the bringing down the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations

fancy that where <hi>God forbids to give his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to Idols,</hi> he forbad to <hi>make any Image
with reſpect to his own Worſhip:</hi> and this
forced him (for I cannot believe he did it
without force to his own thoughts) to aſſert
that <hi>an Image can do nothing to the heightning
of Devotion, or raiſing Affections.</hi> If he
think I ſtrain his words too far, (though no
farther than what his diſcourſe gives me
cauſe to do) let him vindicate himſelf by
profeſſing candidly, that the <hi>Images of Chriſt
according to his Humane Nature, may ſerve to
raiſe our Affections, and heighten our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him as God.</hi> But then he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the patronage of his <hi>Conſtantinopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
Fathers,</hi> and retract or anſwer his own
Reaſon, that if this be done by <hi>calling to our
mind the Being we are to worſhip, there muſt
be ſuppoſed ſome Likeneſs, or Analogy, or Union
between the Object repreſented and the Image,
every one of which tends highly to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Deity, and ſuggeſts mean thoughts
to us of the God we are to worſhip:</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>that among Christians nothing can tend
more effectually to it, than the bringing down
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48446:83"/>
the repreſentations of him to the figure and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments

not to do to free our ſelves from <hi>Mistake,</hi>
much more from <hi>Errour?</hi> The Miſtake at
preſent (if I may give it ſo gentle a name)
lies in this, That he conſiders not, that
if one thing hath <hi>connexion</hi> with, or
<hi>analogy</hi> to another, although <hi>Inviſible,</hi> when
the former is repreſented to a Perſon that
underſtands the <hi>analogy</hi> or connexion there
is between them, it is apt to bring to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
the later. Hence it is, that
although the <hi>Soul</hi> of man cannot be drawn
in colours, yet when the <hi>Body</hi> to which it
is united, is repreſented in Picture, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
ſerves as a means to bring to
our minds the Perfections or Graces of the
<hi>Soul</hi> which informs it; and not <hi>to bring them
down</hi> (as againſt Nature and Experience he

                  <p>§. 3. <hi>On this account,</hi> he ſaith (p. 59.) <hi>it
ſeems much more reaſonable for him to worſhip
God by proſtrating himſelf before the Sun, or
any of the Heavenly Bodies; nay to an Ant
or a Fly, than to a Picture or an Image.</hi> And
I have more kindneſs for him, if he ſhould
do it, than to ſuppoſe him therefore (as he
ſuppoſes himſelf, p. 70.) to be a <hi>Heathen
Idolater,</hi> unleſs he take the <hi>Sun</hi> for a <hi>God.
Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> having given me
ſo much inſight into the <hi>nature of humane
actions, as to know they go whither they are
intended;</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> ſo much <hi>Charity,</hi> as
to believe his <hi>intent was onely to worſhip the
true God by it.</hi> But why does it ſeem <hi>much
more reaſonable for him to worſhip God, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
to the Sun, nay to an Ant, or a Fly,
than to a Picture or an Image?</hi> The reaſon,
he ſays, is, becauſe <hi>in thoſe he ſees great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of the Power, and Wiſdom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God, which may ſuggeſt venerable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of God to his mind,</hi> (ſo then now
it ſeems that <hi>analogy</hi> doth <hi>not</hi> always tend
highly to the diſhonour of the Deity, nor
ſuggeſt mean thoughts to us of the God we
are to worſhip) <hi>whereas a Picture or an

                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:48446:84"/>
If this be the reaſon, he ought in my
Judgment to have given the precedence to
the <hi>Ant</hi> and the <hi>Fly,</hi> (or to the <hi>Ape,</hi> the
<hi>Aſs,</hi> and the <hi>Tyger,</hi> brought in by him in
a former compariſon) for <hi>all theſe</hi> have <hi>two</hi>
degrees of <hi>Perfection</hi> beyond the <hi>Sun,</hi> viz.
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Senſe.</hi> If the <hi>danger</hi> be, that he is

of their greater Excellency, for <hi>God,</hi>

why <hi>we</hi> chuſe rather to worſhip <hi>God</hi> by
an <hi>Image,</hi> than by the <hi>Sun) on that account</hi> (to
let him feel the force of his own Argument,
if it have any) <hi>that which deſerves moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſhould have leaſt given it, and that which
deſerves leaſt, ſhould have moſt. For the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is there ſtill greater, where the Excellency is
greater, and by that means we ought rather to
worſhip</hi> (he ſays to us, <hi>a Beaſt than a Saint;</hi> I
ſay to him) the <hi>Earth</hi> than the <hi>Sun; for
there is leſs danger of believing one to be God,
than the other.</hi> But to return to his former
words.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. Is <hi>there nothing then in a Picture worthy
admiration, beſides the Skill of the Painter or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer?</hi>
I dare avouch for the greater part
of <hi>Ladies,</hi> who ſit for their Pictures, that
they do it not <hi>purely</hi> to beget in the Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
an <hi>admiration</hi> of the <hi>Painter;</hi> and thoſe
who procure an Author's Picture to be ſet
before his Book, intend, no doubt, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48446:84"/>
thoſe who fix their eyes upon it, ſhould <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi>
ſomething beſides the Skill of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graver.</hi>
I have my ſelf a Picture of a Friend
which gives me occaſion frequently to <hi>admire</hi>
the great <hi>Endowments</hi> of his <hi>Mind,</hi> but not
at all the <hi>Hand</hi> that did it, it is ſo <hi>rudely</hi>
done. Something then there is in Pictures
beſides the <hi>Skill</hi> of the <hi>Painter,</hi> which may
make them worthy, if not of <hi>admiration</hi>
for <hi>the excellency of the work;</hi> at leaſt of <hi>uſe,</hi>
for <hi>their quick ſuggesting to our Mind,</hi> not
onely <hi>the outward Features,</hi> but alſo <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Graces</hi> of the Perſons they repreſent.
This virtue they have from their more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
repreſentation and likeneſs, even above
other things, which have a greater reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
in natural <hi>perfections;</hi> and <hi>this</hi> is one
Reaſon why we make uſe of <hi>them</hi> ſo <hi>frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
ſince <hi>God was made Man,</hi> becauſe they
bring <hi>Him</hi> more immediately to our Mind,
than either the <hi>Sun,</hi> or an <hi>Ant,</hi> or a <hi>Fly.</hi>
And this may be the Reaſon (if I may have
leave to ſuggeſt one) why Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Himſelf
prefers the <hi>Sun</hi> for a Help to <hi>his</hi> Devotion,
before an <hi>Ant</hi> or a <hi>Fly,</hi> though inferiour to
them by <hi>two</hi> degrees in perfection; becauſe
amongſt corporeal things, <hi>Light</hi> is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
and conceived by us to be <hi>likeſt</hi> to a
Spirit. But to prefer them all, and with
them the <hi>Ape,</hi> the <hi>Aſs,</hi> and the <hi>Tyger,</hi> before
an <hi>Image,</hi> becauſe they have greater natural
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48446:85"/>
perfections than an <hi>Image</hi> hath, may (if it
prevail in the World) quite undo the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Picture-drawers in a little time.
For if it ſhall be made appear much more
reaſonable to make <hi>uſe of</hi> what approaches
nearer in <hi>perfection,</hi> than <hi>likeneſs,</hi> the <hi>Ladies</hi>
may come inſtead of the Pictures of their
Friends, to wear <hi>Ants</hi> and <hi>Flies</hi> in <hi>Cryſtal
Caſes</hi> upon their Breſts: and inſtead of their
own Pictures to ſend them the <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
he brought in ſo lamely in his former
Compariſon, I and his <hi>Tygers</hi> too, when
they can catch them, as greater reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
of their Perfections. Perhaps he'll
ſay, he ſpeaks not of the <hi>Perfections of theſe
Creatures,</hi> as barely ſuch, but <hi>as great eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to him of the Power and Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God.</hi> But how many are there in the
World not ſo <hi>Philoſophical</hi> and <hi>Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
as he is, who think more how to free
themſelves from the importunity of the
<hi>Ants</hi> and <hi>Flies,</hi> and from the heat of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> than to conſider their <hi>perfections</hi> as
<hi>great evidences</hi> of the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>God;</hi>
and yet if they come into a place where a
<hi>Crucifix</hi> is, are preſently put in mind of <hi>God,</hi>
and teſtifie the venerable apprehenſion they
have of him, by bowing their Knee, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off their Hats? If he find his Devotion
more inflam'd by the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>motions</hi> of thoſe <hi>little Beaſts,</hi>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:48446:85"/>
than by an <hi>Image,</hi> much good may it do him.
But this ought not to preſcribe to the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi>
of <hi>Christians,</hi> who I believe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
more frequent and more venerable
thoughts of God ſuggeſted to their Minds
by the ſight of a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> than by ſeeing the
<hi>Sun,</hi> with all the <hi>Ants</hi> and <hi>Flies</hi> in the
World. 'Tis not the nearer approach in
<hi>perfection,</hi> even in the effect, that brings us
always ſooneſt and ſureſt to the knowledge
of the cauſe. We ſee many <hi>Fathers</hi> are
not known by their <hi>Sons,</hi> who yet are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
known by their <hi>Pictures.</hi> And <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi>
deny the <hi>perfections</hi> of the Creatures to
be any <hi>evidences</hi> at all of that <hi>Being</hi> we call
God: but cannot deny a <hi>Crucifix</hi> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to their own thoughts, that Perſon
whom we believe to be God. Pictures
then we ſee have an advantage in <hi>repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
above the Creatures; though in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
perfections they be inferiour to them.
But yet for all this,</p>
                  <p>§. 5. He ſays, <hi>He cannot for his Heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
why he may not as well, nay better
burn Incenſe, and ſay his Prayers to the Sun,
having an intention onely to honour the true
God by it, as to do both theſe to an Image.</hi> And
the reaſon is ſtill the ſame, becauſe <hi>he is ſure
the Sun hath far more advantages than any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Image can have, and the beauty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of it may inflame and warm ones De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48446:86"/>
much more.</hi> I am ſure too, the <hi>Sun</hi>
hath far more advantages than any material
<hi>word</hi> can have, even the Name of <hi>JESUS</hi>
either written or ſpoken; and yet I do not
find the <hi>beauty and influence of the Sun to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
and warm ones Devotion</hi> ſo much as the
hearing or reading of that <hi>Sacred Name.</hi>
But I perceive he hath a particular <hi>Devotion</hi>
to the <hi>Sun</hi> (though it have leſs advantages
than an <hi>Ant</hi> or a <hi>Fly)</hi> and therefore muſt
warn him in Charity, not to <hi>ſay his Prayers
to it,</hi> no more than <hi>we</hi> do to <hi>Images,</hi> (as he
very well knows, though he would make his
Reader believe the contrary) for that were
to terminate his Intention upon the Sun, to
put his truſt in it, and make it his <hi>God;</hi> but
as for his <hi>bowing</hi> to it, with intent to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the true God, (or <hi>burning Incenſe,</hi> uſing
it, as it is uſed by the <hi>Church,</hi> for a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of like nature with bowing) he may
have a Reſolution of the Caſe, how far it
may be allowed him, from the Pen of that
<hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> Doctor S. <hi>Leo:</hi> and for
his farther ſatisfaction I ſhall take the pains
to tranſcribe his words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>From that Opinion</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Leo,</hi> Serm. in
Natal. Dom.) <hi>viz. That the life of Man is
governed by the Stars, that Impiety alſo takes
its riſe, which is uſed by ſome who are leſs
wiſe, to</hi> adore <hi>the</hi> Sun <hi>at his Riſing from ſome
eminent place. A thing which ſome</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48446:86"/>
                        <hi>think they do ſo religiouſly in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of it, that before they enter into the
Church of S.</hi> Peter <hi>the Apoſtle, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the One true and living God, they
go up to the top of the Church, and turning
themſelves to the riſing</hi> Sun, <hi>with low obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
bow down themſelves in honour of that
Illuſtrious Planet. Which we are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grieved to ſee done, partly out of</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<hi>and partly out of a</hi> Heatheniſh <hi>ſpirit.
Becauſe although ſome perchance do worſhip
the</hi> Creator <hi>rather of that fair Light, than

they ought to abſtain from the very

ſome new Convert, who hath forſaken the
Worſhip of</hi> falſe Gods, <hi>ſhall find exhibited

part of his old Opinion as probable or allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which he ſhall ſee to be common both to</hi>
Chriſtians <hi>and</hi> Heathens. <hi>Let the Faithful
therefore abſtain from ſo perverſe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy-to-be-condemned
a Cuſtom; nor let the
honour due to God alone, be mixed with their
Rites who ſerve the Creatures; for the H.
Scripture ſaith,</hi> Thou ſhalt worſhip the
Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou
ſerve, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</q> This is the Reſolution
of that Ancient and Learned <hi>Father,</hi> at a
time, whenas yet there were ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48446:87"/>
of <hi>Paganiſm</hi> remaining in the
World. And from it the <hi>Doctor</hi> may
infer, That if he do not ſay his <hi>Prayers</hi> to
the <hi>Sun,</hi> but onely <hi>bow down,</hi> or uſe ſome
external ſignification of honour of the like
nature, <hi>not</hi> out of <hi>ignorance,</hi> or a <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>

<hi>ſcandal</hi> to the weaker Brethren, it may
paſs for a piece of private Devotion in a
Perſon ſo Philoſophical and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
as I judge him to be. And this is
all which <hi>Vaſques</hi> (ſo much accuſed by

If he ask me yet again, <hi>Why he may not do

I think I may ask him, why he may not as

<hi>God</hi> after their manner, yet it is
ſo rudely, remotely, darkly, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
that there is need of a great deal
of diſcourſe to diſcover the <hi>Analogy</hi> or
Proportion they bear to their <hi>Creator;</hi>
They are called <hi>Gods Foot-steps,</hi> and to
gather the height and bigneſs of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>
from his <hi>Foot-ſtep,</hi> was not the
work of every Vulgar Capacity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
an Image (for example) of Chriſt, is
ſo apparently repreſentative of him, that
upon ſight thereof our thoughts fly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
unto him: and his Picture is no
ſooner in our Eyes, than his Perſon by
imagination in our Mind: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the <hi>likeneſs</hi> it bears to <hi>Him,</hi> is
much more apt to <hi>inflame and warm ones
Devotion,</hi> than <hi>the beauty and influence of
the Sun.</hi> Beſides, that the <hi>Creatures</hi> being
ſubſiſtent in themſelves, and evidently the
Cauſes of many great benefits to Mankind,
the <hi>danger</hi> is greater of <hi>terminating</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
upon them, than upon an <hi>Image,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48446:88"/>
formal Being conſiſting in Repreſentation
onely, connaturally carries our Thoughts
and Affections to the Perſon repreſented by
it. By what hath been ſaid, he may ſee
how far the <hi>Defence</hi> he makes for himſelf

<hi>Supream</hi> and <hi>Relative</hi> Worſhip, in caſe he
ſhould bow down to the <hi>Sun,</hi> with intent to
worſhip the <hi>true God,</hi> will bear him out. If
he go farther, and (as he ſtates the caſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
<hi>pay his Devotions to the Sun as a ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient

to the Supream Deity;</hi> at his peril be
it: For that which poſſibly would juſtifie

                  <p>§. 1. THe next <hi>Onſet</hi> the Doctor makes
upon the <hi>Catholick</hi> uſe of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
is with a freſh Recruit of
his <hi>Wiſer</hi> Heathens; the <hi>moſt Intelligent of

What he would infer from thence, is
ſo ſoul, he could not find in his heart to

his kindneſs to us here, in comparing
us at leaſt with the <hi>moſt Intelligent among the
Heathens;</hi> whereas p. 70. he had done his
endeavour to inſinuate into his Reader's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> (who worſhipped

he premiſes two Texts out of S. <hi>Paul,
Acts</hi> 17. 24. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. as a <hi>mighty
Argument,</hi> he ſaith, to prove the <hi>unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
of the Worſhip of Images to the Nature
of God, to be of an unalterable and univerſal
nature.</hi> And I wonder whoever denyed it
of <hi>ſuch</hi> Images as are conceived to be <hi>proper</hi>
Likeneſſes or Repreſentations of the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the firſt
place; or of the <hi>Images</hi> of the <hi>falſe Gods</hi> of
the Heathens, of which he ſpeaks in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Muſt the words of Scripture be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
taken barely according to their ſound,
without conſideration had to the <hi>Times</hi> and
<hi>Circumſtances</hi> in which they were written?
That the <hi>Athenians</hi> whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> reproved
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 24. thought the <hi>Divinity</hi> to be <hi>like</hi>
to the <hi>Images</hi> they made of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
is evident by his words, as ſet down
by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf, viz. Becauſe <hi>God was He
who made the World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore we ought
not to think that the Godhead is like unto Gold,
or Silver, or Stone, graven by Art or man's
device.</hi> And himſelf grants this to have
been <hi>their ſuppoſition.</hi> This then was a
<hi>mighty Argument</hi> from the mouth of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
to drive that Erroneous Conceit out of the
Minds of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who believed the
<hi>Divinity</hi> to be <hi>like</hi> the <hi>Images</hi> they made;
but none at all from the Pen of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> who deteſt the thoughts
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48446:89"/>
of having or making any <hi>ſuch Image.</hi> To
what purpoſe then was it brought, except
he intended to make his Reader believe the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> to be no <hi>wiſer</hi> than the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
who were ſo poſſeſſed with a wrong appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that (as St.
<hi>Chryſostom</hi> tells us upon that place) when
they heard St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak of <hi>Anaſtaſis,</hi> that
is, the Reſurrection, becauſe it was a new

                  </p>
                  <p>§. 2. As for the ſecond place of <hi>Rom. 1.
21,</hi> 23. nothing can be more clear, than that
the Apoſtle ſpeaks there of the <hi>Idols</hi> or
<hi>Images</hi> of the <hi>Heathens;</hi> for after he had
laid down the matter of fact which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
viz. That <hi>although they knew God,
yet they did not glorifie him as God, but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Glory of the Incorruptible God into an
Image made like to corruptible Man,</hi> he adds
alſo, <hi>And to Birds, and four footed Beasts,
and Creeping Things,</hi> (which words were
clapp'd under Deck by the <hi>Doctor</hi> with an
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they plainly declare what kind
of Images the Apoſtle meant) and then
verſ. 25. tells us that by ſo doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>They chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Truth of God into a Lie, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
and ſerved the Creature, rather than the

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:48446:90"/>
ſo plain that the <hi>Doctor</hi> could find no
evaſion, but to tell us, that <hi>St. Paul doth not
diſcourſe here against the moſt groſs and ſottiſh
Idolaters of the Heathen, but, as St. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>well obſerves, againſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
and the wiſeſt among them: who
though they differed in their Opinions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
extreamly from the Vulgar, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
with them in all the external practices
of their Idolatry.</hi> And before we go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is well worth the obſerving what he
obſerves out of St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Chryſost. Hom. 3. in Ep. ad Rom.</note> 
                     <hi>Dices, quid haec ad
Philoſophos? You will ſay,</hi>
ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> if the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> reprehended the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
for giving the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to irrational
Creatures, and what was yet more ſottiſh,
to their very Images; <hi>what is that to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi>
or more Intelligent among them?
Marry I anſwer, ſaith he, that, what hath
been ſaid, moſt of all concerns them: <hi>For
they have for their Maſters the Aegyptians,
who were the Inventors of theſe things. And
Plato, who yet ſeems graver than the reſt, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in them. Nay his Maſter</hi> (Socrates)
<hi>was a great Admirer of them; for this is He
who commands a Cock to be offered to Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius.
Hence you may ſee the Images of Beaſts
and Creeping Things to be worſhipped, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with them, Apollo and Bacchus.</hi> This
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48446:90"/>
is what St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerv'd of the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers:</hi>
And was it not luckily done of the
Doctor to make him the Patron of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
viz. that the intent of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
was <hi>not to charge them with falſe Notions of a
Deity, but to ſhew their vanity and folly in
thinking they had found out ſubtiller ways of
defending the Common Idolatry among them,
and inſtead of oppoſing them, made uſe of their
Wits to excuſe them?</hi> But ſuppoſe what he
ſays were ſo: that the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> were as
ſubtil as he would make them, were they
not worthily condemned by the Apoſtle,
though but for the external profeſſion of
praying and offering Sacrifice to the Statues
of <hi>Jupiter, Venus, Mercury,</hi> &amp;c. and alſo
to <hi>thoſe</hi> of <hi>Birds,</hi> and <hi>four-footed Beaſts,</hi> and
<hi>Creeping Things,</hi> as the Vulgar did? And
if <hi>they found out ſubtiller ways of defending the
Common Idolatries among them, and inſtead of
oppoſing them, made uſe of their Wits to excuſe
them,</hi> were they not to blame in ſo doing?
But what is all this to <hi>Christians?</hi> To make
his diſcourſe from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words come
home to <hi>them,</hi> he ſhould ſhow that the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
by which they honour <hi>Christ</hi> and his
<hi>Saints,</hi> are worſhipped by <hi>them</hi> as <hi>Gods,</hi> or
as the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> as <hi>thoſe</hi> were of
which the Apoſtle ſpeaks in that place;
otherwiſe the <hi>ſubtil</hi> ways of defending he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly
aims at, wil be as allowable againſt the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48446:91"/>
Deſerters of the Churches Faith, in the
point of Images, as in other Myſteries of
Chriſtianity. But to come to the point
it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. <hi>The moſt Intelligent Heathens,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>did never look on their Images as any other
than Symbols or Repreſentations of that Being
to which they gave Divine Worſhip.</hi> What
<hi>Being</hi> this was, he doth not tell us, whether
the onely <hi>true God,</hi> or thoſe <hi>falſe</hi> ones repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by their Images. If he mean theſe
<hi>latter,</hi> he knows in his Conſcience he does
wrong to <hi>Catholicks</hi> in comparing them <hi>even</hi>
to his <hi>Wiſer</hi> Heathens. If the former, he
does <hi>thoſe</hi> more right by his <hi>ſubtil way</hi> of
defending them, than appears from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
he brings, <hi>They</hi> ever thought of
doing themſelves. For all that is <hi>expreſſed</hi>
there (and you may believe he would <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi>
nothing that might make to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
out of <hi>Origen, Euſebius, Athanaſius,
Arnobius, Auguſtin, Maximus Tyrius, and
Julian,</hi> concerning the more Intelligent
Heathens, is, that <hi>they did not look on their
Images as Gods:</hi> That they look'd upon them
nevertheleſs as <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Symbols</hi> of <hi>falſe
Gods,</hi> ſome of his own Teſtimonies affirm,
as that of <hi>Celſus</hi> in <hi>Origen,</hi> lib. 7. That <hi>none
but a ſtark fool believes the Images themſelves
to be Gods,</hi> had he not left out the latter part
of it, viz. <hi>Non diis dicatas Statuas,</hi> but that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48446:91"/>
                     <hi>they were Statues erected to the Gods.</hi> And
that of <hi>Julian,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>They are but
Symbols of the preſence of the Gods.</hi> But not
any thing is there in them to ſignifie that
they worſhipped the <hi>true God</hi> by them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the two words of <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Deity,</hi>
which he cogg'd into the Teſtimonies of

believe ſo. I ſhall ſet down the paſſages

we honour and worſhip the Gods or Deities in

Gods PER SE,</hi> of themſelves, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

when they ſay expreſly, that the <hi>Object</hi> of

who ſay, I neither worſhip an Idol, nor

ought to worſhip. <hi>And what thing is that?
The</hi> Doctor <hi>ſays,</hi> the Deity; <hi>and that indeed

But was that their meaning? No ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

part, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> of this Sentence, the Apoſtle
condemns the Images or Idols themſelves; and

by calling Figures made by an Artificer by the
name of thoſe things which God made, they
change the Truth of God into a Lie; and by
eſteeming and worſhipping the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf gave in a caſe of

which St. <hi>Paul pitch'd upon to condemn them

<hi>Chriſt</hi> by his <hi>Image.</hi> Who ſees not
here that he ſhould have bid us <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> one

viz. <hi>That God hath forbidden in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Commandment to worſhip him by an

this, whilſt he is endeavouring to
prove it; to make good his Conſequence he
muſt firſt prove that a <hi>Crucifix</hi> and other

§. 6. By this it appears how invidiouſly
he repreſents what the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> did in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
(p. 75.) when he tells his Reader, that
<hi>they never condemned the People for worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Images, but for worſhipping falſe Gods by
them; and perſwaded them not to lay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
but to convert them to the honour of the
true God: and ſo melted down their former
Images, and made new ones of them.</hi> Who
would not imagine by theſe words, but that
the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> had told the People that they
need <hi>not lay aſide</hi> their <hi>Images,</hi> but onely
<hi>change</hi> their <hi>God,</hi> or at the moſt but melt
down the <hi>old ones,</hi> &amp; make <hi>new</hi> ones of them.
The <hi>Doctor</hi> never met with an Adverſary
more willing to take a Teſtimony upon his
word, than my ſelf. But this ſeem'd ſo
exorbitant, that I could not believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeing: And it coſt me ſome pains to
do it, for the Book is ſo <hi>ſcarce,</hi> a man may
run through moſt of the Bookſellers Shops
in <hi>London,</hi> and not meet with it. At length
I found it in the Library of a particular
Friend; and what I found there was this,
that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in <hi>China</hi> had by their <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi>
converted ſome Perſons of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> to the
knowledge of the <hi>True One.</hi> And the ſaid
Converts, to teſtifie the Truth of their
Converſion, (like thoſe in the <hi>Primitive
Church,</hi> who burnt their <hi>Books of curious
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48446:97"/>
Arts, Acts 19. 19.)</hi> brought a <hi>great heap of
Idols,</hi> and <hi>conſumed them in a flaming furnace
which they had made for that purpoſe.</hi> This
done, <hi>after they had re-edified or repaired the
Altar from which they had cast down the
Idols,</hi> (it ſeems they had demoliſhed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
that alſo) <hi>there was placed,</hi> ſaith the
Author, <hi>in their room the Image of Chriſt our
Saviour;</hi> neither doth he ſay ſo much as
that <hi>It</hi> was made of the melted <hi>Metal,</hi>
though that had been no more than of the
materials of a <hi>Pagan</hi> Temple to build a
Church to the honour of <hi>Christ.</hi> His
words are theſe. <hi>Simulacrorum</hi> (mark that)

This is what the <hi>Author</hi>
reports of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi>

none can or will be offended
with them for it; but ſuch
as would be diſpleaſed with
him that ſhould pull down
an <hi>Uſurper's Image,</hi> and ſet up the <hi>Kings</hi> in
its place. But as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> relates it, (I
ſhould ſay <hi>tranſlates</hi> the words, for he is ſo
exact as to refer us to the very page) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
with quite another aſpect, ſomething

                     <hi>Image,</hi> whereas here the <hi>Images</hi> themſelves
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> are confuſedly
blended together by him, when he ſays
that the <hi>Jeſuites never condemned the People
for worſhipping Images, but for worſhipping
falſe Gods by them, and perſwaded them not to
lay them aſide, but to convert them to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the true God; and ſo melted down
their former Images, and made new ones of
them.</hi> I would gladly know what <hi>Images</hi>
thoſe were by which he ſays they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<hi>falſe Gods,</hi> were they not the <hi>Symbols</hi>
or Repreſentations of thoſe very <hi>falſe Gods?</hi>
How then could the <hi>Doctor</hi> add (without
diſtinguiſhing <hi>them</hi> firſt from the <hi>Images</hi> of
Chriſt) that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> perſwaded the
People not to lay <hi>them</hi> aſide, but to convert
<hi>them</hi> to the honour of the True God; And
ſo melted <hi>them</hi> down, and made <hi>new ones</hi> of
<hi>them?</hi> Did the <hi>People</hi> at the preaching of
the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> caſt <hi>them</hi> into the fire, and <hi>They</hi>
not condemn <hi>them?</hi> Did the <hi>People</hi> tear

And to this I anſwer as formerly,
What Roman-Catholick ever denied it of
<hi>ſuch Images</hi> as they there ſpeak of, viz. the

and St. <hi>John Damaſcen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Damaſc. Orth. Fid. Lib. 4. c. 17.</note> cited
by the Doctor, <hi>That it is the

whereas he would make <hi>Clichtovaeus</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>

It is evident he does but trifle; for although
it be impoſſible in the very nature of the

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Second General Council of Nice, called
moſt irreverently by Dr. St. That Wiſe
Synod. His Conſtantinopolitan Fathers
Objections anſwered by Epiphanius, and the
Anſwers ſhewn to be Good.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1. WE are come now to that
<hi>Stone of Offence,</hi> that
<hi>Rock of Scandal</hi> (as the
Doctor would have it) the <hi>Second General
Council of Nice, Anno</hi> 789. in which all
ſuch were <hi>anathematiz'd,</hi> and condemned as
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> who ſhould call the <hi>Images</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Saints, Idols,</hi> and aſſert the
<hi>honour</hi> given them by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
What wonder then if he who finds
himſelf comprehended under that <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
be in ſuch a <hi>paſſion</hi> againſt the <hi>Council,</hi>
that in contempt and ſcorn he moſt irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
calls it, <hi>That Wiſe Synod,</hi> p. 76. that
is in plain Engliſh, the Three Hundred and
Fifty Fathers who voted in it, <hi>Fools,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>Pope's Legates</hi> who preſided,
and the <hi>Vicars</hi> of the <hi>Oriental Patriarchal
Sees,</hi> who aſſiſted in it. O my God! is it
come to this, that an Inferiour <hi>Rector</hi> of

of that dreadful Sentence
of our Lord,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>He that ſhall

wit, to contemn and deride the <hi>Decrees</hi> of
thoſe whom he is bound under pain of being
<hi>accounted as a Heathen and Publican,</hi> to hear?
Will he plead for his excuſe, that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

had never been retracted and anathematized

                  <p>§. 2. Being brought into
the <hi>Council</hi> by a Perſon of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſent from the Emperour,<note place="margin">Conc. Nic. 2. Act. 2.</note>
                     <hi>Taraſius Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
ask'd him, <hi>If hitherto he had not known
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48446:102"/>
the Truth, or knowingly had contemn'd it?</hi> His
anſwer was, that <hi>he hop'd it was out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
but deſir'd to learn.</hi> And when <hi>Tara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
bad him declare <hi>what he deſir'd to learn:</hi>
he anſwered; <hi>Foraſmuch as this whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
doth ſay and think the ſame thing, I know
and moſt certainly believe that the Point now
agitated and preached</hi> (by this Synod) <hi>is the
Truth: and therefore I beg pardon for my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
evils, and deſire with all theſe to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and inlightned: For my Errours and
Crimes are great beyond meaſure; and as God
ſhall pleaſe to move the hearts of this Holy Synod
to Compunction</hi> (towards me) <hi>ſo be it.</hi> Here
<hi>Taraſius</hi> expreſſing ſome doubt he had leaſt
his <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> might not be <hi>ſincere,</hi> but that
he might ſpeak <hi>one thing</hi> with his mouth,
and have <hi>another</hi> in his heart, <hi>Gregorius</hi> cry'd
out, <hi>God forbid! I confeſs the Truth, and lie
not, neither will I ever go back from my word.</hi>
Whereupon <hi>Taraſius</hi> told him, that <hi>he ought
long ago to have given ear to
what the Holy Apoſtle St. Paul
teaches,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 15.</note>

                     <hi>to Timothy and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>

of words. <hi>For what can be a

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:48446:103"/>
To this <hi>Gregorius</hi> return'd, that <hi>what he and
his Partizans had done, was evil; and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>that it was evil: So it was, and
ſo we did,</hi> (by which words it ſeems he made
a particular confeſſion of what evil they had
done) <hi>and therefore we beg pardon of our
faults. I confeſs, moſt Holy Father, before you
and this Holy Synod, that we have ſinned, that
we have tranſgreſſed, that we have done evil,
and ask pardon for it.</hi> Upon this it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that he ſhould bring in his <hi>Confeſſion</hi>
the next Seſſion of the <hi>Synod;</hi> which he did,
of the ſame tenour with that of <hi>Baſilius,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and others in the
firſt Seſſion:<note place="margin">Act. 3.</note> viz. that he <hi>did receive
and ſalute</hi> (or give Veneration to)
<hi>the Holy and Venerable Images</hi> (of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and
his <hi>Saints) and anathematize ſuch as were not
of the ſame mind;</hi> as he expreſſed himſelf
in the vote he gave, after he had by the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>
of the <hi>Popes Legates,</hi> and the conſent of
the <hi>Synod</hi> been reſtored to his <hi>Seat,</hi> upon his
repentance. This is recorded of <hi>Gregorius</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> in the Acts of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of <hi>Nice</hi> to his immortal Glory. May it
be imitated with no leſs Glory by the <hi>Rector</hi>
of St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> May he take to himſelf what
St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid to <hi>Theodoſius, Secutus es er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantem,
ſequere poenitentem.</hi> This I heartily
pray for, and to this end ſhall take the pains
to ſhew with what little Reaſon he abets the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48446:103"/>
Arguments of that falſe Synod, and derides
the Anſwers of the <hi>Nicen Fathers.</hi> If in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, I make his <hi>vanity</hi> appear here, (as
elſewhere I have done) it is but
what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">S. Aug. in Pſal. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>we
ought ſo much the more to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
towards thoſe who oppugn
the Church, by how much the more we deſire their
ſalvation.</hi> And I know not how poſſibly
himſelf could have laid it more open than
in the <hi>Ironical</hi> Title of <hi>That Wiſe Synod,</hi> he
gives that very <hi>Council</hi> to which his Leader
in the Charge of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (the afore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>Gregorius)</hi> ſubmitted himſelf, as to a
moſt <hi>lawful Council,</hi> confeſſing, that what
thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> ſo unanimouſly taught was the
<hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Catholick
Church.</hi> Now what they taught,
was,<note place="margin">Act 7.</note> this, that <hi>the Images of Chriſt
and his Saints were to be placed and
retained in Churches, that by ſeeing them, the
Memory and Affections of the Beholders
might be excited towards thoſe who were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by them: as alſo to ſalute and give an
honourary adoration</hi> (or reſpect) <hi>to the ſaid
Images, like as is given to the figure of the Holy
Croſs, to Chalices, to the Books of the H. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels,
and ſuch like ſacred Utenſils: but not
Latria, which (as true Faith teacheth) is due
onely to God.</hi> What he could find in this
definition, for which the <hi>Fathers</hi> deſerved
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48446:104"/>
from him the title of <hi>Fools,</hi> I cannot imagin,

will appear, though leſs, than in
condemning a <hi>whole General Council.</hi> A far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſcovery of <hi>it,</hi> he makes in deriding
the anſwers given to the Objections of his
<hi>Constantinopolitan Fathers.</hi> Let us ſee what
they are, and with what reaſon he does
it.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. Firſt, ſaith he, <q>
                        <hi>When the Fathers
of the Synod at Conſtantinople had ſaid, that
Chriſt came to deliver us from all Idolatry,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48446:104"/>
and to teach the Worſhip of God in Spirit and
in Truth,</hi> they bravely anſwer, that <hi>then it
is impoſſible for Chriſtians</hi> (meaning I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
particular <hi>Chriſtian) to fall into Idolatry,
becauſe</hi> (he ſhould have added, as the
Council doth, the Prophets had foretold,
that all Idolatry ſhould be extirpated by
the preaching of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, and)
<hi>his Kingdom was always to continue, and the
gifts and graces of God are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
Which would as well hold,</hi> ſaith the
Doctor, <hi>against the prevalency of the Turk,
as Idolatry among them.</hi>
                     </q> And is not this
<hi>bravely</hi> anſwered by the Doctor? Doth he
think that there are as great Promiſes in the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> for the <hi>Turks</hi> not over-running
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as there are for the <hi>Gates</hi> of
<hi>Hell</hi> not prevailing againſt the <hi>Church?</hi> Or
that the Church, which is <hi>Christs Kingdom,</hi>
could apoſtatize ſo far as to enjoyn and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the belief and practiſe of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and
the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> not prevail againſt it? If
he will not maintain theſe impieties to be
true,<note place="margin">Zach. 13. 2.</note> nor deny what God hath
ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Zachary, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the days come, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the names of Idols from off the earth, and
the memory of them ſhall be no more:</hi> and this
not for four or five hundred years, but to
the end of the World, for <hi>the Kingdom
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48446:105"/>
of Chriſt is to continue always, and his graces
are without Repentance;</hi> let him give <hi>Glory</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> and acknowledge his charge of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
to be <hi>falſe,</hi> and that Chriſt hath done
what he came to do, that is, (as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan
Fathers confeſs) <hi>to deliver us
from all Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. The ſecond thing he makes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the falſe <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to
urge, is, <q>
                        <hi>That the Devil not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the World to the former Idolatry, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
underhand to introduce it, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>bringing them again to
the Worſhip of the</hi> Creature, <hi>and making a</hi>
God <hi>of a thing that is made, when they have
called it by the Name of</hi> Chriſt.</q> The words
here cited were taken out of St. <hi>Gregory Niſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi>
in the Oration he made upon his Brother
St. <hi>Baſil;</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the Name of
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> charges them to
have adulterated both the meaning and
words of the Saint, by putting <hi>the name
of Chriſt,</hi> inſtead of <hi>that of the Son.</hi>
For whereas St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Diſcourſe there
was againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> proving them to
be <hi>Idolaters,</hi> becauſe they acknowledged
<hi>Christ</hi> to be a <hi>Creature,</hi> and yet, <hi>adored</hi> and
<hi>ſerved</hi> and put their <hi>truſt</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> they wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
pervert his words againſt the <hi>Images</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> which although <hi>Chriſtians</hi> retain in
memory, and <hi>reverence</hi> out of love to him,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48446:105"/>
that is repreſented by them, yet they neither
<hi>call</hi> them <hi>Gods,</hi> nor <hi>ſerve</hi> them as <hi>Gods,</hi> nor
at any time put their hope of ſalvation in
them, as the <hi>Arrians</hi> did in the <hi>Son,</hi> although
they believed him to be a Creature. The
Dr. thought it not to his purpoſe to take
notice of this <hi>Juggle</hi> of his <hi>Conſtantinopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
Fathers,</hi> in putting the name <hi>Chriſt</hi> for
<hi>Son:</hi> No, it might put us in mind of <hi>his</hi> own
dexterous managing the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of
<hi>Authors</hi> cited by himſelf, as I have ſhewed
in the foregoing Chapter. Only, when <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
makes the difference between the
<hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Catholicks</hi> to conſiſt in this, that
<hi>the Arrians truſted in Chriſt, and gave pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
divine honour to him; but Catholicks did
not ſo to the Images of Chriſt, but only worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them for the ſake of the Object
repreſented by them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Summ. 3. p. 9. 25. a 3.</note> He comes
in (p. 79.) with a <hi>But Aquinas
and his followers have at large
proved, that where any thing is worſhipped
meerly for the ſake of another, it must have
the ſame kind of worſhip given it, which they
give to the thing repreſented by it: For as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas
obſerves, the motion of the Soul towards
an Image, as it is an Image is the ſame with
that which is towards the thing repreſented by
it: Therefore Epiphanius and the Nicen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are in the ſame caſe with the Arrians,
whom they acknowledge to be Idolaters.</hi>

§ 5. I remember the Dr. in his <hi>Preface</hi>
tells his Reader, that <hi>his deſign is to argue
cloſely.</hi> How much he hath failed in the
performance of his deſign, (if ever he had
any ſuch) I have ſhown in almoſt every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
he brings: And for the <hi>preſent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi>
there are ſo many failings in it, that
a <hi>Junior Sophiſter</hi> in the Schools would have
given it the name not of <hi>one,</hi> but of <hi>many Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies.</hi>
For to make the conſequence good,
he ought firſt to have prov'd, that the <hi>Nicen
Fathers</hi> were of the ſame opinion with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi>
and his followers: or that their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
was ſo <hi>evident a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>monſtration,</hi> that
they could not but be guilty of culpable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
if they did not ſee it. 2dly, That
<hi>Aquinas</hi> and his <hi>followers</hi> did conclude
<hi>themſelves</hi> in virtue of ſo <hi>evident</hi> a proof,
to be <hi>Idolaters;</hi> or at leaſt they ought to
have done ſo, for giving the <hi>ſame Worſhip</hi> or
<hi>Reverence</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Image;</hi> to Him,
<hi>abſolutely</hi> for himſelf; to his Image, <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi>
or meerly for his <hi>ſake,</hi> as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
themſelves. 3dly, That the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were <hi>Idolaters</hi> upon <hi>this very account,</hi>
that they gave <hi>onely relative Worſhip</hi> to the
<hi>Son,</hi> and not <hi>properly Divine Worſhip,</hi> which
St. <hi>Gregory Niſſen</hi> ſaith they did, <hi>becauſe</hi>
though they <hi>acknowledged him to be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet they ador'd, and ſerv'd, and put their
truſt in him as God.</hi> Theſe things he ought
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48446:106"/>
to have prov'd, to make his own <hi>conſequence</hi>
good, viz. <hi>Therefore the Nicen Fathers are in
the ſame caſe with the Arrians, whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be Idolaters.</hi> But to tell us;
that becauſe <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the <hi>Nicen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
ſaid, <hi>they onely worſhipped the Images of
Chriſt for his ſake who was repreſented by them:</hi>
and becauſe (not <hi>They,</hi> but) <hi>Aquinas and
his followers have at large proved that when
Chriſt is worſhipped by his Image, the ſame Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
or Reverence is given to him and his Image;</hi>
Therefore <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the <hi>Nicen Fathers</hi>
were in the ſame caſe with the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that
is, <hi>Idolaters;</hi> is ſuch a piece of Logick (if
good) as would have ſerv'd <hi>Diogenes</hi> (had he
known it) to conclude all the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> in
the world to be <hi>blind.</hi> For thus he might
argue from the <hi>Doctors Topicks;</hi> The <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>
and all <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> affirm that for a
man to <hi>ſee,</hi> there muſt neceſſarily be ſome
<hi>union</hi> between the <hi>Object</hi> and the <hi>Eye,</hi> that is,
ſomething muſt paſs from the Eye to the
Object, or from the Object to the Eye. But
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his <hi>Followers</hi> have at large
proved, that this cannot be done by <hi>emiſſion</hi>
of <hi>Rays</hi> from the <hi>Eye</hi> to the <hi>Object,</hi> as the
<hi>Platoniſts</hi> would have it; but by <hi>Immiſſion</hi> of
<hi>Species</hi> from the <hi>Object</hi> to the <hi>Eye:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> in the world are <hi>blind.</hi>
What greater <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> can there be, than
when there are different Opinions how the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48446:107"/>
ſame thing may be done, and one of them
<hi>really</hi> abſurd, at leaſt <hi>ſeemingly ſo</hi> to others,
to make him who does the thing to be guilty
of all the <hi>abſurdities</hi> which follow from ſuch
an Opinion? Yet ſuch is the Doctors man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of arguing in this place: All Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
agree that an Image may be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for his ſake whom it repreſents; St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
and his followers will have this to be
done by the ſame act by which the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type
is worſhipped: Others who take a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
way of explicating the thing, look
upon this as abſurd, and think they can
prove it to be <hi>Idolatrous:</hi> and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> from
hence concludes <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the <hi>Nicen
Fathers,</hi> becauſe they ſay onely what all
<hi>Catholicks</hi> agree in, <hi>viz. That they worſhipped
the Images of Chriſt onely for his ſake who was
repreſented by them,</hi> to be <hi>Idolaters.</hi> The
Reader I ſuppoſe by this time ſees the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs
of this kind of arguing: and that
the Doctor may <hi>feel</hi> it, (if <hi>ſeeing</hi> be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
I ſhall preſs him with his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a Point which himſelf affirms. To
ſhew what kind of <hi>Reverence</hi> we give to <hi>holy
Images,</hi> and that it is not <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> I inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s putting off their
Shoes in <hi>reverence</hi> to the <hi>Ground</hi> where they
ſtood, becauſe it was <hi>Holy.</hi> To this the
Doctor anſwers, p. 105. Firſt, That for this
there was an <hi>expreſs Command;</hi> but in the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48446:107"/>
caſe of <hi>Image Worſhip</hi> there is as plain a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition.</hi>
But let this paſs, though I have
manifeſtly proved the contrary. What I
fix upon at preſent, is his <hi>Second Anſwer,</hi> in
which he avouches, (abſtracting from any
Prohibition or Command) that <hi>the ſpecial
preſence and appearance of God, doth ſanctifie
a place to ſo high a degree, that we may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
testifie</hi> our Reverence <hi>towards it,</hi> and this
<hi>Reverence</hi> ſo teſtified towards the <hi>Ground</hi> by
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> in putting off their Shoes,
I ſuppoſe himſelf will grant, was not given
to the <hi>Ground</hi> for it <hi>ſelf,</hi> but meerly for <hi>His
ſake</hi> who appeared there preſent in a ſpecial
manner, that is for <hi>God</hi>'s. This ſuppoſed, I
ſubſume according to his Logick: But <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
and his followers have at large proved,
that where any thing is worſhipped or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
meerly for the <hi>ſake</hi> of another, it muſt
have the <hi>ſame</hi> kind of <hi>reverence</hi> given it,
which they give to the <hi>thing</hi> which ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it by its preſence; for they do not onely
maintain that the <hi>ſame reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
is to be given to the
<hi>Croſs</hi> on which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered,<note place="margin">Summ. 3. p. q. 25. a. 4.</note>
becauſe it <hi>repreſents</hi> him to us
as <hi>crucified,</hi> but alſo becauſe of his <hi>preſence</hi>
or <hi>conjunction</hi> to it; upon which account
they ſay the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Garment</hi> are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
with the <hi>ſame</hi> act of Civil <hi>Worſhip.</hi>
Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were <hi>Idolaters</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:48446:108"/>
for giving <hi>reverence</hi> to the <hi>Ground</hi> meerly
for <hi>his ſake</hi> who ſanctified it with his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi>
The Conſequence (though horrible
to any Chriſtian Ear) is parallel to that of
the Doctor againſt <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the <hi>Nicen
Fathers;</hi> and if it have any force againſt
<hi>theſe,</hi> it muſt have the ſame againſt <hi>thoſe.</hi>
Thus is the Doctor fallen into his own Trap.
Neither can he ſave himſelf by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to an <hi>expreſs command</hi> in <hi>the caſe;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Gods ſpecial preſence</hi> is given by him
there as a <hi>diſtinct reaſon</hi> why <hi>reverence</hi> might
lawfully be given to the <hi>Ground</hi> for <hi>his ſake</hi>
who was preſent; and if it were <hi>Idolatry</hi> in
it ſelf to do ſo, becauſe <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his
followers have at large proved, that where
any thing is reverenced meerly for the <hi>ſake</hi>
of another, it muſt have the <hi>ſame</hi> kind of
<hi>reverence</hi> given it, which they give to the
<hi>thing</hi> which ſanctifieth it by its preſence: it
follows that <hi>God</hi> commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>
upon his grounds to <hi>do</hi> an <hi>act</hi> which in
it ſelf is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and this ſounds no leſs, if
not more horrible to a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Ear, than
the former. Let him then take his choice,
whether he will allow what <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his
followers have at large proved for good, or
no. If he grant it, he muſt ſhow the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity,
why <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were not as
much <hi>Idolaters</hi> according to his Principles,
as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the <hi>Nicen Fathers.</hi> If he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48446:108"/>
deny it, let him tell us with what conſcience
he could condemn <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the <hi>Nicen
Fathers</hi> for Idolaters, upon Grounds which
himſelf denies to be good and ſolid. Thus
much to the form of the <hi>Doctors</hi> Argument.
As for the diſtinction it ſelf of <hi>Abſolute</hi> and
<hi>Relative Latria</hi> (with which St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and
his followers explicate their Doctrine) I
ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of it hereafter.
In the mean time the Reader may p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that to give <hi>Relative Latria</hi> to the
<hi>Image</hi> of Chriſt, is no more Idolatry, than
to give <hi>Relative Regal honour</hi> to the <hi>Kings
Garment,</hi> is Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. The third thing he urges from his
<hi>Conſtantinopolitan Fathers,</hi> is, <hi>the great Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity</hi>
(as they call it, and he applauds them
for it, p. 80.) <hi>of making an Image of Chriſt
for Worſhip, becauſe Chriſt is God and Man;
therefore the Image muſt be of God and Man:
which cannot be, unleſs the Deity be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
within the created fleſh, or there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of both Natures after their Union, both
which are blaſphemies condemned by the Church.</hi>
To this <hi>Epiphanius</hi> anſwers two things;
1. That the Name of Chriſt is ſignificative
of both Natures, and that an Image repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
onely the Humane Nature, and agrees
onely in name, and not in ſubſtance with the
Prototype. 2. That the <hi>Divine</hi> is no more
circumſcribed within the <hi>Humane</hi> Nature in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48446:109"/>
its being repreſented in an <hi>Image,</hi> than it
was in its being laid in the <hi>Manger,</hi> or nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>roſs.</hi> And conſequently that the
Objection either of <hi>circumſcription</hi> of the
<hi>Divine</hi> Nature, or <hi>confuſion</hi> of <hi>both</hi> Natures,
was vain and frivolous. I, but ſays the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
<hi>What doth this Anſwer ſignifie, unleſs
there be an equal preſence or union of the Divine
Nature of Christ with the Image, as there was
with the Humane Nature?</hi> And I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know what this Anſwer of his is to the
purpoſe, unleſs he think that nothing may
be worſhipped with <hi>relation</hi> to God, unleſs
it have as great an <hi>Union</hi> with the Perſon of
Chriſt, as his Humane Nature had? He
will not deny, I hope, that <hi>the ſpecial preſence
and appearance of God doth ſanctifie a place to
ſo high a degree, that we may lawfully teſtifie our
reverence towards it,</hi> and yet that preſence
or union is not equal to that of the Divine
Nature of Chriſt with his Humane. It is
not onely Union, but Repreſentation alſo,
that may occaſion Worſhip; and ſo we ſee
the <hi>King</hi> is worſhipped by his <hi>Picture,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
him, though it have not ſo cloſe
an <hi>union</hi> with his <hi>Soul</hi> as his <hi>Body</hi> hath. But
what ſticks in the Doctors mind (if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
not) is, how <hi>Christ God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> can
be worſhipped by an <hi>Image</hi> which repreſents
him onely according to his <hi>Humane Nature?</hi>
To this I have ſpoken already in the fifth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48446:109"/>
Chapter; and himſelf may ſatisfie his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the point, by telling him how the
<hi>King,</hi> who conſiſts of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> can be
worſhipped by a <hi>Picture</hi> which repreſents
him onely according to the <hi>Lineaments</hi> of his
<hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 7. In the fourth place, his <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitan-Fathers</hi>
urge, that <hi>If the Humane
Nature of Chriſt be repreſented in the Image of
Christ to be worſhipped as ſeparate from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;
this would be plain Neſtorianiſm.</hi> And
what ſays <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to this? That never
any man well in his wits, when he ſaw the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
of a man, thought that the <hi>Painter</hi> by
drawing him, had <hi>divided</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi> from his
<hi>Body,</hi> that is, that he had not onely <hi>drawn</hi>
the man, but <hi>hang'd</hi> and <hi>quarter'd</hi> him too?
Was ever time ſo fondly miſpent as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
and refuting ſuch pitiful kind of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry,
as this of the Doctors <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan-Fathers?</hi>
And yet He ſays, the <hi>Good
Nicen Fathers</hi> (where he means by <hi>Good,</hi>
what he meant before by <hi>Wiſe) not knowing
what to anſwer, deny the Concluſion, and cry,
They Neſtorians?</hi> No. <hi>They lie in their Teeth.</hi>
Thus He. But what the <hi>Nicen Fathers</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
like <hi>Good</hi> men and <hi>True,</hi> was this,
that <hi>though the Images of Chriſt</hi> (like other
Images) <hi>repreſent onely the external Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Humane Nature, yet when they look
upon them, they understand nothing but what is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48446:110"/>
ſignified by them.</hi> For example, <hi>When he
is repreſented as born of the Virgin</hi> (which
is, I ſuppoſe, what the Doctor means by
the <hi>Birth of the Virgin.</hi> p. 81.) <hi>what they
conceive in their Minds, is not his Humane
Nature as ſeparated from the Divine, but
one Emmanuel, true God and Man: and
therefore were far enough from b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing guilty
of Neſtorianiſm in the uſe of Images.</hi> Here
the Doctor cries out, <hi>Alas for them!
that they ſhould ever be charged with the
Worſhip of Images, who plead for nothing
now but a Help to their profound Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
by them!</hi> And may not I much
better ſay, Alas for him! who, if they
Worſhipped the ſame which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in their Minds, could not ſee
their Worſhip (which is an Act of the
<hi>Will)</hi> muſt be as free from <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi>
as their <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> But he had had
nothing to reply, if he had not thruſt
in thoſe Words of his own, <hi>(to be
Worſhipped as ſeparate from the Divine
Nature)</hi> For they are not in the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as it ſtands Recorded in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
However, they ſignifie little to his
purpoſe, becauſe the <hi>Will</hi> is carried to
the <hi>Prototype</hi> as it is conceived in the
Underſtanding, nor doth it give to the
<hi>Image</hi> t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Worſhip due to the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi>
becauſe the <hi>Image</hi> is not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48446:110"/>
at all for its <hi>own ſake,</hi> but for
the <hi>Principal's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 8. The Fifth Argument which he
makes his <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Fathers</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
is from the Inſtitution of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi>
which they call <q>
                        <hi>Chriſts Image be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
instituted in Commemoration of him.
And whereas he ſaid,</hi> Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of Me, <hi>He did, as it were,
tell them, That no other Figure or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
under Heaven was choſen by Him,
as able to repreſent His being in the Fleſh.
This,</hi> they ſay, <hi>was an</hi> HONOUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ABLE
<hi>Image of his Quickning</hi> BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DY,
<hi>made by Himſelf, which he would
not have of the ſhape of a Man, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Idolatry. And as the Body of Chriſt
was really ſanctified by the Divine Nature;
ſo this Holy Image is by Adoption Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
or made Divine through ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Grace.</hi>
                     </q> This is the ſenſe of the
Argument; to which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> anſwers,
that from the <hi>Fury</hi> they were poſſeſs'd with
againſt the making of <hi>Images,</hi> they were
driven into another <hi>madneſs,</hi> of calling
the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> an <hi>Image,</hi> contrary to the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers.</hi> And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
knows that it is a ſufficient Anſwer
to an abſurd Objection, to ſhew that the
Objector was driven to run into an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48446:111"/>
to maintain his Cauſe. What
the Conſtantinopolitans would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from thence, was, that becauſe
Chriſt (as They aſſerted) made the
<hi>Euchariſt</hi> an <hi>Image</hi> of his Body, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>no other Image</hi> might be made or
Worſhipped. But this They did not,
but left it perhaps (as too hard a Task
for Themſelves) to be undertaken by
ſo Great an Admirer of Them and their
Doctrine, as my Adverſary: and at his
Door it lies. Onely he is deſired to
bear in mind againſt a fit ſeaſon, that
the <hi>Eucharist</hi> with Them is an HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOURABLE
IMAGE, made by
Chriſt Himſelf, and therefore if he will
not deſert his Leaders, he muſt give <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
to it, nay <hi>Divine Honour,</hi> becauſe
although his Beloved <hi>Conſtantinopolitans</hi>
call the EUCHARISTICAL BREAD
an IMAGE, yet they confeſs it in the
ſame place to be NO FALSE IMAGE
of <hi>Chriſts Natural Fleſh,</hi> but by virtue of
the Prieſtly Conſecration, it is <hi>made his
Divine Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 9. In the ſixth and laſt place he
jumbles together no leſs than <hi>Eight</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
or rather Bare Aſſertions of
his <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Fathers,</hi> all which
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> denies and refutes as <hi>frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48446:111"/>

the fact it ſelf he looks upon as</hi> an

the Acts of that Council, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> were very
well known to the Author of the Caroline Book;
and becauſe the Copy of the Nicen Council was
ſent them by Pope Adrian; whoſe Legates alſo
preſided in the Council of Francford, and
might eaſily rectifie any Miſtake, if they were
guilty of it. Beſides, none of the Hiſtorians
of that time do take notice of any ſuch Error,
and the ſecond Canon of Francford publiſhed
by Sirmondus, expreſly condemns the Council
of Nice. <hi>To this he adds,</hi> That the ſame
Council was rejected here in England, and the
Synod of Paris, called by Ludovicus Pius, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
expreſly Pope Adrian for aſſerting a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
Adoration of Images. <hi>Laſtly, he
confirms it from</hi> the Doctrine of the Caroline
Books, (whoſe deſign, as Binius confeſſeth,

                  <p>This is the ſum and force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to manifeſt the inſufficiency of
it in order to his deſign, (ſuppoſing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>fact</hi> to be true, viz. that the <hi>Council</hi>
of <hi>Francford</hi> did reject <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> which
divers learned men not improbably deny) I
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48446:113"/>
ſhall ſhew firſt, that <hi>de facto</hi> there was a
<hi>miſ-underſtanding</hi> of the Doctrine of the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> Secondly, That ſuppoſing
there had been no miſtake, but that the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi>

                  <p>§. 2. Firſt, there was a <hi>miſunderſtanding</hi>
of the Doctrine of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi>
And to make this evident, I ſhall need no
more than to compare what was taught in
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> with what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Francford.</hi> What
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> taught, I have ſet down
in the precedent Chapter, viz. <hi>That the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Chriſt and his Saints were to be placed and
retained in Churches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
adoration</hi> (or reſpect) <hi>was to be given to the
ſaid Images, like as is given to Chalices, and
to the Books of the H Goſpels; but not</hi> LATRIA,
<hi>which (as true Faith teacheth) is due onely to
God.</hi> This was the plain and open <hi>Definition</hi>
of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> Let us now ſee
what it was that the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Francford</hi>
condemned. <hi>Allata eſt in medium Quaeſtio,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>A Queſtion was propoſed in the Council</hi>
(ſaith the Author of the <hi>Caroline</hi> Book)
<hi>concerning the late Synod of the Greeks held at
Conſtantinople</hi> (a miſtake of the place, for
<hi>Nicaea) about the adoring of Images:</hi> In qua
ſcriptum habebatur, <hi>In which there was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48446:113"/>
that thoſe ſhould be anathematized, who did
not give ſervice and adoration to Images of the
Saints, as to the Divine Trinity. Now,</hi> ſaith
the ſaid Author, <hi>our most Holy Fathers deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by all means Service and Adoration, did
both contemn and unanimouſly condemn the ſaid
Synod.</hi> This is what the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi>
at <hi>Francford</hi> condemned, as it ſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
by the Author himſelf of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolin
Book,</hi> to whom my Adverſary ſaith,
that the <hi>Acts of the Council were very well
known,</hi> and by <hi>Goldaſtus</hi> in Sir
<hi>Henry Spelman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Concil. To. 1. p. 307.</note> who cites
them as the very words of
the <hi>Council,</hi> and I ſuppoſe by
<hi>Sirmondus</hi> alſo; for had he publiſhed any
thing elſe, the <hi>Doctor</hi> would not have failed
to let us know it. And now I appeal to any
indifferent Reader, whether there were not
a great <hi>miſunderſtanding</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> For had the <hi>Fathers</hi> of
<hi>Francford</hi> rightly underſtood that the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of <hi>Nice</hi> declar'd onely an <hi>honourary Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to be given to Images, like as to the H. Croſs
and to the Books of H. Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and not
Latria, or the Worſhip due only to God,</hi> they
could never have condemn'd it for defining
that <hi>the ſame Service and Worſhip was to be
given to Images as to the Divine Trinity.</hi>
And therefore Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> ingenuouſly
profeſſeth, that <hi>It is to be granted, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48446:114"/>
it was that writ the Book againſt Images
under the Name of Charles the
Great,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epilog. part. 3. p. 363.</note> 
                     <hi>did underſtand the
Council to enjoyn the Worſhip
of God to be given to the Image
of our Lord. But it is not to be denied that it
was a meer miſtake, and that the Council ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that ſubmiſſion of the heart which
the Excellence of God onely challenges, proper
to the H. Trinity, maintains a ſignification of
that eſteem to be paid to the Image of our Lord.</hi>
It is evident then there was a grand miſtake:
And to omit what <hi>Bellarmin</hi>

                     <hi>Petrus de Marca</hi>
(the late learned <hi>Archbiſhop</hi>

For (as he well obſerveth) the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of <hi>Francford</hi> did not condemn the <hi>plain</hi>
and <hi>open Definition</hi> of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
but (as the <hi>Canon</hi> it ſelf of <hi>Francford</hi> ſpeaks)
<hi>Quod ſcriptum habebatur,</hi> for that <hi>there was
found written in the Acts of that</hi> Council,
<hi>that the Worſhip due unto God, was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Images.</hi> And the Author of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline</hi>
Book tells us, that this was found
written in the Sentence of the aforeſaid <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinus,</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48446:114"/>
whom therefore he condemns of

folly in <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> he ſhould have laid the
fault upon the ignorance of the <hi>Tranſlator,</hi>

the holy and venerable Images <hi>(of

it is is plain how ignorantly or maliciouſly

                     <note place="margin">Inſtit. lib. 1. c. 11. §. 16.</note> that the ſame <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi>

<hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> is evident, my Adverſary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in vain to argue from Conjectures,
that it was not poſſible, eſpecially ſince the

ſo <hi>unskilfully</hi> if not <hi>maliciouſly</hi> tranſlated, as

perſiſted in their miſtake, what wonder
if the Hiſtorians of that time, who favour'd
them, took no notice of it? Or if the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh

is manifeſt they did, by
what <hi>Hoveden</hi> reports,<note place="margin">Hoveden An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. P. Prior. ad Anno 792.</note>
that the <hi>Engliſh Biſhops</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Doctrine of the

<hi>Adoration was to be given to

That the Author of the <hi>Caroline</hi> Book, and

with what the Council of <hi>Francford</hi>
had condemned, viz. <hi>That Worſhip was not to

denied any veneration at all to be due to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48446:115"/>
them, (as the Doctor will have it) hinders
not, but that the Council of <hi>Francford</hi>
condemned that of <hi>Nice</hi> upon a miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of its Doctrine, as I have evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. Secondly, But now ſuppoſing there
had been no miſtake, but that the <hi>Fathers</hi>
at <hi>Francford</hi> (as my Adverſary would have
it) had <hi>really</hi> condemned the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> yet I affirm it had been <hi>no
advantage</hi> to his Cauſe, becauſe as himſelf
(p. 84.) ſaith, The <hi>Popes of Rome ſided with

the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

is confeſſed by the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgenſes;</hi>
and that the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf oppos'd
it, is manifeſt from the Confutation he
wrote of the <hi>Caroline Book;</hi> and that <hi>no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of any Council could be valid without the
Popes conſent,</hi> was ſo undoubted a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that the Author himſelf
of that Book durſt not deny it, but on the
contrary affirms it to have been the ſenſe
even of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>Francford,</hi> as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging

And if the <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>Francford</hi> look'd upon
it then as an <hi>advantage</hi> to their Cauſe, that
the <hi>Pope</hi> (as they pretended) had <hi>not ſided</hi>

of confidence, to alledge <hi>that</hi> for an

<hi>no advantage</hi> to his Cauſe, as little is it,
that the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Francford</hi> denied it to be

we have a ſolid Principle indeed to work
upon, and if the Doctor would give me
leave to infer from it, I would argue thus:
But the <hi>Law-giver</hi> himſelf commanded the
<hi>Ark</hi> and the <hi>Cherubims</hi> to be placed in the
Temple, with reſpect to his Worſhip;
Therefore <hi>he did not expreſly prohibit in the

ſuch a practiſe as ſhould be contrary to
its meaning. But I muſt not foreſtall, but
attend my Adverſary: and the ſubſtance of
what he diſcourſes upon that Principle, is
this, That <hi>the Iſraelites were condemned by
God of Idolatry, for worſhipping the Golden
Calf, and yet they did not fall into the Heathen
Idolatry by ſo doing, but onely worſhipped the
true God under that Symbol of his preſence.</hi> If
you ask him how he knows for certain that
<hi>the Iſraelites did not fall back into the Heathen
Idolatry;</hi> when it is certain that in <hi>Aegypt</hi>
they worſhipped the <hi>Idols</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptians,
Ezek.</hi> 20. 7, 8? He tells you upon his word,
that <hi>they had not the leaſt pretence of infidelity
as to the true God;</hi> and yet the very Text he
cites to prove it, tells us they pretended
their deſpair of <hi>Moſes</hi> returning, as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reaſon to move <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>make them
Gods who ſhould go before them.</hi> If you ask
him how he knows for certain, that the <hi>Calf</hi>
was intended <hi>to be onely a Symbol of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</hi>

would not obey, but thruſt him</hi> (that is,

<hi>And they made a Calf in thoſe days, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſacrifice to the Idol, and rejoyced in the work
of their own hands.</hi> This is what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teſtifieth that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, viz. <hi>that
they forgat the God which made them; that
they thrust him from them, and in their hearts

§. 3. This is what the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> and
the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſay expreſly of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and worſhipping the <hi>Calf.</hi> That they
were <hi>Idolaters</hi> in ſo doing, we confeſs; but
that their <hi>Idolatry</hi> conſiſted onely in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
the <hi>True God</hi> under <hi>that,</hi> as a <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol</hi>
of his preſence, we utterly deny. And
till the Doctor can prove it, by as great, if
not greater Authority of <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
than I have done the contrary, he will
never prove from this fact of theirs, that
<hi>God hath expreſly prohibited in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
the giving him any Worſhip by an
Image.</hi> What he does is, to tell us that he
cannot <hi>imagine the people to have been ſo ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,
as to believe the Calf newly made to have
been the God, which before it was made, brought
them out of the Land of Egypt: or to think the
Gods of Egypt had wrought thoſe Miracles for
them in their deliverance.</hi> But theſe are
Conjectures of his own Fancy, without any
<hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Fathers;</hi> nay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
againſt them, as I have ſhewed. And
although <hi>Aaron</hi> perhaps, and ſome of
the Wiſer among them might not be <hi>ſo ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,</hi>
yet it is certain (as the Doctor confeſſes
of his <hi>Wiſer Heathens)</hi> they were <hi>ſo weak</hi> as
<hi>to concur with them in the external practiſes of
their Idolatry.</hi> But then he tells us again,
(p. 94.) that the <hi>people took it for granted that
Moſes, by reaſon of his forty days abſence, was to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48446:122"/>
be heard of no more; and therefore they fell
upon deviſing the fitteſt Symbol for the preſence
of God going before them; and herein the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
number,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>being poſſeſſed with the
prejudices of their Education in Egypt, where
Golden Bulls were the Symbols of their chief
God Oſiris, they pitched upon that, and forced
Aaron to a compliance with them in it.</hi> And
all the proof he brings for this, is, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before <hi>Moſes</hi> his going up to the
Mount, the laſt Promiſe God made to them
was, that <hi>he would ſend his Angel before them,</hi>
Exod. xxiii. 20, 23. as if thoſe who had <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
the God that made them,</hi> could not alſo
<hi>forget</hi> this <hi>Promiſe;</hi> or at leaſt think that <hi>He</hi>
had <hi>forgotten</hi> it, or was not able to perform
it; and ſo fall upon deviſing the <hi>making of a
God</hi> like thoſe they had ſeen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whoſe
Preſence and Conduct they might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
with them. This follows much
more clearly from the <hi>prejudice of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in Egypt,</hi> than what the Doctor has
<hi>deviſed</hi> for them; for they never deviſed any
ſuch thing to themſelves, as is manifeſt out
of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> before alledged.
And when I conſider the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> a people
without Learning, oppreſſed for four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years together by the moſt Idolatrous
Nation in the World, and ſerving <hi>their
Gods,</hi> as it appears they did, out of <hi>Ezek.</hi> xx.
8. the prejudice which this cuſtom had
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48446:122"/>
wrought in them, and their readineſs upon
every ſlight occaſion, to turn back with their
hearts into <hi>Egypt;</hi> laſtly, the Character
which God himſelf gives of them, <hi>Deut.</hi>
xxxii. 28. that <hi>they were a Nation void of
counſel, neither was there any underſtanding
in them.</hi> When, I ſay, I conſider all this
on the one ſide; and the quaint <hi>device</hi> the
Doctor would transfer from his own head
into theirs, of making the <hi>Calf</hi> onely for the
<hi>Symbol of the preſence of the true God,</hi> on the
other: I cannot but look upon it to be much
of the ſame nature with thoſe ſubtil fetches
which <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> to ſhew their own skill in
<hi>Politicks,</hi> deviſe, rather than diſcover, in the
Actions of thoſe Perſons (though never ſo
ſtupid) who are the ſubject of their Hiſtory.
How many Plots and Deſigns have <hi>Tacitus</hi>
and others framed for them, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dream't of themſelves? much leſs were
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> guilty of any ſuch ſubtil ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
as <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Doctor</hi> have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for them. The higheſt pitch of their
Fancy, if it ſtaid not in the Image it ſelf,
was to magine ſome <hi>Deity,</hi> like thoſe of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> to inſinuate it ſelf into the Calf (as
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> believed of <hi>their Gods)</hi> from
thence to give <hi>Oracres,</hi> and conduct them
into the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Promiſe;</hi> and not as the
Doctor deviſes for them, that they look'd
upon <hi>it</hi> onely as a <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>true God,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48446:123"/>
whom now they had thruſt from them and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</hi>
To make out this device, which
had no other foundation but in his own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
he is forc'd to invent a <hi>new kind</hi> of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<hi>diſtinct from the Heathen Idolatry;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>there is no intimation</hi> (ſaith he, p. 95.)
<hi>made of their falling into the Heathen Idolatry.</hi>
But why then does he charge the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Idolatry</hi> upon this account, (p. 3.)
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>ſhe requires the giving to the Creature
the Worſhip due onely to the Creator?</hi> Is not the
giving <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi> to a <hi>Creature,</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi>
as to make it a <hi>falſe God?</hi> And is it not <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Idolatry</hi> to worſhip a <hi>falſe God?</hi> Either
then he muſt <hi>retract</hi> the ground upon which
he builds his Charge of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> or he
muſt ſtand to it ſtifly without flinching, that
both <hi>Catholicks,</hi> now, and the <hi>Jews</hi> then were
<hi>Heathen Idolaters.</hi> For he does but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
himſelf whilſt he makes us guilty onely
of <hi>Chriſtian Idolatry;</hi> and yet does us no
kindneſs at all, whilſt he charges us to <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi>
the Worſhip due onely to <hi>God,</hi> upon
the <hi>Creature.</hi> Oh, but, ſays he, <hi>when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Iſraelites fell into Heathen Idolatry,
the particular names of the Gods are mentioned,
as Baal-Peor, Moloch, Remphan,</hi> &amp;c. What
then? Is it the <hi>Idol</hi>'s having a Name, that
makes the Worſhippers <hi>Heathen Idolaters?
Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that <hi>words are but the
ſigns of the conceptions of our mind:</hi> and if
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48446:123"/>
they conceived or believed the <hi>Calf</hi> to be a
<hi>God,</hi> were they not as much <hi>Heathen Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
for worſhipping <hi>it</hi> without a Name, as
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for worſhipping it under the
Name of <hi>Apis?</hi> The onely difference I
find is, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by long practice
were become <hi>Maſters</hi> of their <hi>Trade,</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Gods,</hi> whereas the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by this one

the Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">Ezek. xx. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>were after

<hi>the Occaſion,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the Kingdoms coming
to him, was from Solomon's falling into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Idolatry, and this would make him more
cautious of falling into it, eſpecially at his firſt
entrance.</hi> And I believe it would have done
ſo, had he been a <hi>Good Joſias,</hi> and not a <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Jeroboam.</hi> But why the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſhould
think <hi>him</hi> ſo <hi>tender conſcienc'd,</hi> whom God
himſelf upbraids for <hi>having made to himſelf
ſtrange and molten Gods, and cast him behind
his back,</hi> 3 Kings xiv. 9. Or why he ſhould
think him ſo ſcrupulous, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſaith, that <hi>he ſacrificed to the Gods which
he had made,</hi> 3 Kings xii. 32. <hi>and that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
him Prieſts for the high places, and for
the Devils, and for the Calves which he had
made,</hi> 2 Paralip. xi. 15. I cannot imagine.
The Ingenious Author of <hi>the Cauſes of the

Judgment of the matter, when to
ſhew that <hi>Divinity has long ſince been made
the Handmaid to Policy, and Religion modell'd
by Conveniencies of State;</hi> he immediately
adds for an example, that <hi>The Golden Calves
became venerable Deities, when they were found
apt to ſecure Jeroboam's jealouſies.</hi> But had
this been <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> Intention, <hi>how much
better,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, <hi>had he then argued
that they had been hitherto in a great miſtake
concerning the true God, and not meerly as to
the place of his Worſhip, which is all he ſpeaks
againſt; for he continued,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the ſame
Feaſts and way of Worſhip which were at J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g'd it
not fit to leave off on the ſudden all that had
been in uſe before? Sudden Changes from
one extream to another, whether in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
or <hi>Politick</hi> Body, are always look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as dangerous. And therefore the firſt
<hi>Reformers</hi> nere in <hi>England,</hi> when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
a Service onely of Bread and Wine,
thought it expedient to retain the Names of
the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and many of
the ancient Prayers and Ceremonies, which
the nicer Brethren boggle at at this day, as
<hi>Pelicks</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Politick</hi> Inventions to
make the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> go down the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But for <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> he told the People
plain enough what he meant, when pointing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48446:125"/>
to the <hi>Calves,</hi> he bid them <hi>behold the Gods
which had brought them up out of the Land of
Egypt.</hi> And the Text cited by the Doctor
<hi>1 Reg.</hi> xii. 23. ſpeaks but of <hi>one Feaſt he ordain'd
like unto the Feaſt that was in Juda;</hi> though the
Doctor will have it, that <hi>he continued the
ſame Feasts and way of Worſhip which were
at Jeruſalem.</hi> But <hi>Ahab</hi>'s ſin, he ſaith, was
much greater than that of <hi>Jeroboam:</hi> It was
ſo; but will abſolve <hi>Jeroboam</hi> no more from
the guilt of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (which the Scripture
calls <hi>ſpiritual Adultery)</hi> than one mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<hi>adultery</hi> with <hi>many,</hi> will free ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>zeal for the Lord</hi> (nay though it were for <hi>his
Lord,</hi> as the Doctor, not the Scripture, reads
it) exempt <hi>him</hi> from <hi>Idolatry</hi> in following
the ſteps of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> any more than the
<hi>lawful Act</hi> of <hi>Matrimony</hi> acquits a Husband
from the Crime of <hi>Adultery,</hi> who defiles his
Neighbours Bed. But, <hi>How then,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>came the Worſhip of the true God in the ten Tribes
to be ſet in oppoſition to the Heathen Idolatry in</hi>
1 Kings xviii. 21? No otherwiſe ſurely than
by the force of imagination. For when <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
ſaid unto the people, <hi>How long will ye halt
between two Opinions? If the Lord be God,
follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.</hi> The
ſence is plain, that he meant to recal the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the Worſhip of the onely True God,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48446:125"/>
whom he preached to them, and in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he himſelf did worſhip him; and not
that he intended to ſet the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> (which
is what the Doctor means by <hi>the Worſhip of
the true</hi> God <hi>in the ten Tribes)</hi> in oppoſition
to the Worſhip of <hi>Baal.</hi> For in the very
next Chapter the Prophet himſelf ſuppoſes
ſuch a general <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> to
the Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> that he complains as
if he alone were left alive, who had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to his Worſhip; as appears by the
Anſwer which God made him, that <hi>he had
yet ſeven thouſand left in Iſrael which had not
bowed their knees to Baal,</hi> 3 Kings xix. 17, 18.
How then could <hi>Elias</hi> ſet the <hi>Worſhip of the
true</hi> God <hi>in the ten Tribes</hi> in oppoſition to the
Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> when he ſuppoſed all that
were remaining of the Ten Tribes, except
himſelf, to have forſaken the true God to
follow <hi>Baal?</hi> As for the Embaſſy of the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> to the King of <hi>Aſſyria, that a
Prieſt might be ſent unto them from the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi>
the reaſon is plain why they ſent to
him, and not to the King of <hi>Juda,</hi> becauſe
they fear'd his diſpleaſure, ſhould they have
kept Correſpondence with his Enemy.
Moreover they thought the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to
be only a <hi>Topical</hi> God; and therfore they call
him <hi>the</hi> God <hi>of the Land,</hi> 4 Kings xvii. 26. as
diſtinct from <hi>the</hi> God <hi>of Juda.</hi> Now what
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48446:126"/>
the Text ſaith, is, that the Prieſt when he
came, <hi>taught them how they ſhould fear
the Lord;</hi> but there is no mention at all
made of his teaching them to <hi>worſhip him in
the Calves,</hi> as <hi>Symbols of his preſence,</hi> which
was the <hi>onely thing</hi> for the Doctors purpoſe,
had it been there.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. Having thus anſwer'd all the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>

to make the World believe that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
intended the making of the <hi>Calves</hi> for no

                     </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
let us ſuppoſe it, after all, to be as
he would have it; It cannot be denied, but
the <hi>Calves</hi> were originally <hi>Symbols</hi> of <hi>Oſiris,</hi>
the chief (but <hi>falſe)</hi> God of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi>
and himſelf confeſſes (p. 94.) that upon this
account the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> made choice of them
for the <hi>fitteſt Symbols</hi> of the preſence of the
true God: Suppoſe, I ſay, they look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them as <hi>ſuch,</hi> and that they were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of <hi>Idolatry</hi> for intending to worſhip the
<hi>true</hi> God in them, I affirm, it follows no
more from hence, that God <hi>hath expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in the ſecond Commandment to give
him any Worſhip by ſuch Symbols or Images as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48446:126"/>
are</hi> not <hi>the Symbols of falſe Gods;</hi> than it
would follow from a King's condemning
ſuch Perſons of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> as ſhould pretend
to worſhip <hi>Him</hi> by honouring the <hi>Image</hi> of
an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> that he had expreſly prohibited
the giving him any <hi>Worſhip</hi> by his <hi>own Image.</hi>
In fine, if this diſcourſe of the Doctors may
be allowed for good, I ſee no reaſon why he
might not as well juſtifie the groſſeſt of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi>
the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> in their worſhip of
<hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cks and Onyons,</hi> from the guilt of <hi>Heathen
Idolatry,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in worſhipping the
<hi>Calves:</hi> for, proceeding in his way, it were
but to imagin, they could not be <hi>ſo ſottiſh</hi> as
to believe <hi>them</hi> to be <hi>Gods in the proper ſenſe,</hi>
but that they look'd upon them <hi>onely</hi> as <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols</hi>
of <hi>Gods kindneſs to them,</hi> in providing
them <hi>Sauce</hi> as well as <hi>Meat,</hi> though out of
<hi>Reverence</hi> to thoſe Deities they would eat
neither of them.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. To conclude this Point of the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> he tells us,
that the <hi>Jews thought the Prohibition to extend
to all kind of Images for Worſhip.</hi> And I
would gladly know whether we muſt <hi>ſtand</hi>
or <hi>fall</hi> by the Interpretation of the <hi>Jews?</hi>
It was their Opinion that
the Prohibition extended
not only to the <hi>worſhipping,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vaſq. in 3. d. Th. diſp. 103. q. 25. c. 1.</note>
but alſo to the <hi>making</hi> all

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48446:127"/>
condemn the Profeſſions of <hi>Painting</hi> and
<hi>Carving,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Conc. Nicen. Act. 6.</note> as <hi>unlawful,</hi> and
(as his Conſtantinopolitan
Fathers call them) <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous?</hi>
Well, but <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> ſaith he, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,
with other <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> that <hi>it is plain in Scripture, that God
did not only forbid that in the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was unlawful by
the Law of Nature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vaſq. in 3. d. Th. diſp. 104. q. 25. c. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>as the
worſhipping an Image for
God; but the worſhipping the
true God by any ſimilitude of him:</hi> But to
whom do they ſay he forbids it? Does not
<hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſay expreſly, <hi>c.</hi> 2. that it was to the
<hi>Jews?</hi> which the Doctor conveniently leaves
out. And do not thoſe <hi>Divines</hi> in the very
words cited by himſelf plainly declare the
Prohibition of <hi>worſhipping God by any ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of him,</hi> to be but a <hi>Poſitive</hi> Precept,
when they ſo clearly diſtinguiſh it from the
Prohibition of <hi>worſhipping an Image for God,</hi>
which they ſay, <hi>was unlawful by the Light of
Nature?</hi> And if they look'd upon that part
of the Prohibition as a <hi>meer Poſitive Precept,</hi>
does he think they thought it obliged <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?</hi>
Their Doctrine and Practice evince
the contrary. And if <hi>Divines</hi> agree not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves how far this Precept obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the <hi>Jews,</hi> what matter is it, ſo they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that what is forbidden in it to <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:48446:127"/>
is that <hi>which is unlawful by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
The oppoſition then which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
would make between <hi>my</hi> Aſſertion, and
that of other <hi>Catholick Divines,</hi> is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impertinent; for taking it as a <hi>Natural</hi>

in occaſion to mention this Learned
Perſon, I ſhall conclude this Point with
<hi>his Judgment</hi> concerning the <hi>meaning</hi> and
<hi>extent</hi> of the Second Commandment, that
the Reader may ſee how diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s diſcourſe is, to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſo Eminent a <hi>Divine</hi> in the
<hi>Church of England.</hi> Thus then Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. <q>The ſecond Commandment, ſetting
forth God for a God that is jealous of his
People whether they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him or not,<note place="margin">Just Weights, chap. 23.</note> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
ſuppoſeth their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to forſake all other
Gods beſide him: a Contract of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
between Him and his People.
Which if it be ſo, it is no leſs mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that the Images which the Precept
ſuppoſeth, are the Repreſentations of
other Gods, which his People were
wont to commit Adultery with, by
Worſhipping them for God. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is manifeſt how much Idolatry
was advanced by Imagery, (though it
may be without it) there can be no
marvel that there ſhould be a peculiar
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48446:128"/>
Precept againſt it. Wherefore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
that <hi>Jews</hi> by the Letter of this
Precept are tied from <hi>all Images</hi> which
their Elders, who had the power of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
what is lawful, and what is not
by the Law, ſhould declare to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful:
But to think that their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
ought to bind <hi>Christians,</hi> were
to imagine that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to be
<hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </q>—And then a little after, he goes
on. <q>For Chriſtianity, ſaith he, having
put Idolatry to flight, which the Law
never pretended to do, it is not to be
imagined, that the having of Images
can make a man take thoſe for God,
which they repreſent, ſo long as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of Chriſtianity is alive at the heart.
For neither was it Idolatry, though it
were a breach of this Commandment,
for a Jew to have ſuch Images as were
forbidden by their Elders, not taking
that for God which they repreſented.
But what honour of Saints departed,
or what ſigns of that honour, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
may require, what Furniture or
Ceremonies the Churches of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and the Publick Worſhip of God
in them, may require, now all the world
profeſſes Chriſtianity, and muſt honour
the Religion which they profeſs, this
the Church is at freedom to determine
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48446:129"/>
by the Word of God, expounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the beſt agreement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi>'s Diſcourſe, in
which the Reader may obſerve,</p>
                  <p>1. That to think the Declarations of the
<hi>Jews</hi> ought to bind <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> were to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to be <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That all things forbidden to the <hi>Jews</hi>
by this Commandment, were <hi>Not Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That the Images which the Precept
ſuppoſeth, were the <hi>Repreſentations</hi> of <hi>other,</hi>
that is, <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> which his People were
wont to <hi>worſhip</hi> for <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>That</hi> what Furniture <hi>(viz. of Images,
the matter he there treats of)</hi> or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the Publick Worſhip of God may require,
is left to the Judgment of the Church to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>5. and laſtly, That the Oppoſition in this
Point between Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> is
not onely concerning the obligation of the
<hi>Jews</hi> (as between <hi>Catholick Divines)</hi> but of

them, or putting off our Hats, or kneeling
before them: much like the Worſhip which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Chair of State, or the Reverence
which Moſes and Joſhua gave to the Ground,
by putting off their Shoes,</hi> &amp;c. That this was
the meaning of the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Nice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Church, l. 3. c. 36.</note> is confeſſed by Dr. <hi>Field</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> as I have
ſhewed p. 124. And that the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> means no more, is manifeſt
from the words of the <hi>Council</hi> related above,
Chap. 2. as alſo for that <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 25. it refers us
expreſly to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> Yet becauſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48446:130"/>
the <hi>Doctor</hi> is reſolved to quarrel the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Relative</hi> Worſhip, that
the Reader may ſee what is meant by it, I
ſhall deſire him to take notice, firſt, That
<hi>Adoration</hi> or Worſhip being an <hi>Act</hi> of the
<hi>Will;</hi> as the <hi>Will</hi> can <hi>love</hi> one thing <hi>for it
ſelf,</hi> becauſe of the Perfection it is endow'd
with, and another thing not for it ſelf, but
purely for that <hi>others ſake</hi> to whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.
So likewiſe it may <hi>adore</hi> or <hi>worſhip</hi>
a thing, either <hi>for it ſelf,</hi> that is, for ſome
intrinſecal Excellency in the thing, for which
it deſerves Worſhip; and then it is ſaid to
<hi>worſhip</hi> the thing <hi>abſolutely,</hi> becauſe for it
ſelf. Or it may <hi>worſhip</hi> it for <hi>another's ſake,</hi>
that is, for ſome Excellency in the Perſon to
whom the ſaid thing hath a <hi>Relation</hi> or <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
and then it is ſaid to worſhip ſuch a
thing with a <hi>Relative</hi> or <hi>Inferiour</hi> Worſhip,
becauſe purely for that Perſons ſake. And
becauſe <hi>Intellectual Beings</hi> are capable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſome <hi>Excellency</hi> in themſelves, for
which they deſerve to be worſhipped, as
<hi>Virtue, Sanctity, Wiſdom, Power,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
Beings</hi> are capable of bearing a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
to a Perſon endowed with ſuch Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
it follows that as <hi>Intellectual Beings</hi>
may have <hi>Abſolute</hi> Worſhip given to them;
ſo <hi>Inanimate Things</hi> relating to them, may
for their ſakes have a <hi>Relative</hi> Reſpect, or
<hi>Honourary Adoration</hi> given to them; and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48446:131"/>
that ſo far from being <hi>injurious</hi> to the Perſon
to whom they belong, that it would be
look'd upon as a <hi>diſreſpect</hi> and <hi>affront,</hi> if in
due circumſtances it were not done. Such
a kind of <hi>Relative Worſhip</hi> it is we affirm to
be <hi>due,</hi> and to be <hi>given</hi> to the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and his <hi>Saints,</hi> when we <hi>kiſs</hi> them, or put
off our <hi>Hats</hi> before them. Secondly, I muſt
deſire him to observe (as Mr.
<hi>Thorndike</hi> doth very well) that
the words <hi>Adoration,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epil. p. 3. p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>3.</note> 
                     <hi>Worſhip,
Reſpect, Reverence, or howſoever
you tranſlate the Latine word</hi> Cultus, <hi>are
or may be in deſpite of our hearts equivocal;</hi>
that is, ſometimes they may ſignifie one kind
of honour, and ſometimes another: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that which belongs to <hi>God,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that which belongs to the <hi>Creature.</hi>
And the <hi>cauſe of this equivocation,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is,
the want of words; vulgar uſe not having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
words properly to ſignifie conceptions
which came not from common ſenſe.</hi> And from
this equivocation in the Words <hi>Adoration,
Worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> the greateſt part of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
which occur in this, take their riſe.
Now when the Doctor ſhould ſet himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
to confute the aforeſaid Explication,
he puts his Reader into a fit of laughing
with a <hi>Drolliſh Parallel,</hi> p. 100. that to give
this <hi>Inferiour</hi> and <hi>Relative</hi> kind of Worſhip
to the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, to honour and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48446:131"/>
reverence <hi>it</hi> for <hi>his ſake,</hi> is <hi>juſt as if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte
Wife ſhould plead in her excuſe to her
Husband, that the perſon ſhe was too kind with,
was extreamly like him, and a near friend of
his, and that it was out of reſpect to him that
ſhe gave him the honour of his Bed.</hi> But to
lay open the <hi>unparallell'd</hi> fondneſs of this
Compariſon, there needs no more than to
appeal to any married man for his Opinion
in the caſe, viz. Whether he think it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of like Reſentment to find his <hi>Wife</hi> kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his <hi>Picture</hi> as it hangs at her Breaſt, as
to ſurprize her in Bed with a <hi>Friend</hi> of his,
though never ſo like him? Some things
done out of reſpect are very <hi>well</hi> taken, and
cannot in reaſon be otherwiſe, by the Perſon
for whoſe ſake the reſpect is given; of this
kind I take the <hi>wearing</hi> of her Husbands <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
to be in a Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, or her being <hi>kind</hi>
(though not <hi>too kind)</hi> to his <hi>Friend</hi> for his
ſake. But others there are, which would
be very <hi>ill</hi> taken, though pretended to be
done with never ſo much reſpect: And of
this kind I ſuppoſe it would be, to <hi>give the
Honour of her Husbands Bed</hi> to another,
though never ſo <hi>like</hi> him. No man ſurely
well in his Senſes, can look upon theſe two
with an equal Concern. And yet if the
Doctor will make his Compariſon hold
good, he muſt prove the whole ſtate of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Mankind <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>do</hi> ſo: At leaſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48446:132"/>
to infer any thing againſt us, he muſt ſhew
it not poſſible to give any Honour or Reſpect
(even inferiour) to the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for
his <hi>ſake.</hi> For if this be poſſible, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that as in a <hi>Chaste Wife</hi> it is a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
expreſſion of the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> ſhe
bears her <hi>Husband,</hi> to kiſs his <hi>Picture,</hi> or
wear it near her Heart; So it will be no leſs

indeed hath declared himſelf,</hi> as the Doctor
ſaith <hi>particularly jealous of his Honour in this
Commandment, that he will not give his Glory
to another, but hath reſerved all Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
as peculiar to himſelf;</hi> but where hath he
declared that we may not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Him</hi> Divine Worſhip by <hi>kiſſing</hi> his <hi>Image,</hi> or
the <hi>Books</hi> of the H. Goſpels, or other things
relating to Him? The <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Jealouſie</hi> is
a <hi>Rival,</hi> or what hath <hi>relation</hi> to, or <hi>union</hi>
with <hi>him;</hi> not what may ſerve to expreſs
Affection and Reſpect to the <hi>Perſon</hi> who
<hi>ought</hi> to be loved: And therefore a <hi>Jealous</hi>
Husband will neither permit his Wife to
admit his <hi>Rival</hi> into her Company, nor <hi>his
Picture</hi> into her Cloſet; yet never thinks her
an <hi>Adultereſs</hi> for carrying <hi>his own</hi> in her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.
The Images which the Precept ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth,
were as Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
of other Gods, which his people
were wont to commit Idolatry with.</hi> And the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48446:132"/>
Doctor, though in the Reply I challeng'd him
to do it, neither hath nor can produce any
Prohibition of giving to the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and his <hi>Saints</hi> a <hi>relative</hi> Reſpect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Worſhip
for his ſake. And in caſe he could, yet that
I hope would prove it no more to be <hi>Idolatry</hi>
in a Chriſtian to kiſs, for example, the <hi>Image</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> than it would be <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
in a Wife out of reſpect to her Husband,
(though he ſhould forbid it) to kiſs <hi>his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
Diſobedience</hi> there might be in either
caſe, but <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Adultery</hi> in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. Having prepared his Reader with
ſo <hi>juſt</hi> a Compariſon, and told him <hi>by the
by,</hi> of the diſtinction of <hi>Abſolutely and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi>
being very ſubtilly applied in <hi>Scotland</hi>
to ſaying <hi>the Lords Prayer to a Saint,</hi> which
in reality needed no ſuch diſtinction, as ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
no more, than ſaying the <hi>Pater Noster</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> with an intention directed to ſuch or
ſuch a <hi>Saint,</hi> to deſire him to become <hi>Joynt-Petitioner</hi>
with us for what we beg in it; He
<hi>wonders,</hi> in the next place, (p. 101.) <hi>very
much we stick at any kind of Worſhip to be done
to Images. For his part, were he of our mind,
he ſhould as little ſcruple offering up the Hoſt to
an Image, as ſaying his prayers to it, and he
doubts not to come off with the ſame diſtinctions.
For if I do it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to God abſolutely and
for himſelf, and to the Image onely improperly
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48446:133"/>
and relatively, wherein am</hi> I <hi>to blame?</hi> This
is his Diſcourſe, and the Reader may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in it, 1. That he hath not read, or at
leaſt takes no notice, that the anſwer in the
ordinary <hi>Catholick Catechiſm,</hi> to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Whether we may pray to Images? is a
down-right <hi>No, by no means:</hi> and that the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> Seſſ. 25. hath declared that
<hi>we are not to ask any thing of an Image.</hi> Let the
Reader judge whether this were ignorance
or no. 2. That he cannot contain himſelf
any where within bounds of Mediocrity, but
muſt always run into extreams, which ſide
ſoever he take. He cannot be a <hi>Church-of-England-man,</hi>
but with the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> he
muſt deny <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to be of <hi>Divine Right,</hi>
and <hi>any honour</hi> to be <hi>due</hi> to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> or
<hi>Altar,</hi> &amp;c. Neither will he be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>offering up the Hoſt and ſaying his prayers to
an Image.</hi> So that if He become a <hi>Proſelyte,</hi>
He cannot content Himſelf with the <hi>Common
Idolatry</hi> of the Papiſts, in kiſſing or putting
off their Hats to the <hi>Images of Chriſt,</hi> but
will needs make Himſelf <hi>twice a greater Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later</hi>
than they are. How much He would
be to blame in ſo doing, He will better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
when He is become a <hi>Proſelyte.</hi> In
the mean time it may ſuffice Him to know,
<hi>that the Church of God hath no ſuch cuſtom:</hi>
for however the <hi>material</hi> action of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
may be done for ſeveral ends and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48446:133"/>
yet when it proceeds from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to profeſs a total ſubmiſſion of our
ſelves to <hi>God,</hi> as the Supream Author of
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> (which gives it the <hi>formality</hi>
of a <hi>Sacrifice)</hi> it is uſed and taken by the
<hi>publick Uſe and Cuſtom of the Church,</hi> for an
acknowledgement of the <hi>abſolute Worſhip</hi> due
to <hi>God,</hi> and not of <hi>Relative</hi> to an <hi>Image:</hi> and
that more eſpecially in offering up the <hi>Hoſt,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the true
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Sacrifice, the Nature and Dignity
whereof requireth that it be offered to <hi>God</hi>
alone. As for the Rule of
St. <hi>Baſil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Baſ. li. de Spiritu ſancto. cap. 18.</note> upon which he
would ground <hi>his</hi> Practiſe

inſinuate the contrary to the Reader)
viz. <hi>That the Worſhip of the Image is carried
to the Prototype;</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> hath told

ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, to diſpute
whether that be to be done or no,
which is practiſed by the whole Church through

<hi>Saints,</hi> hath been confeſſedly for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds

                  <p>§. 3. But before the Doctor can or will
become a perfect <hi>Proſelyte</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome, he deſires ſeriouſly</hi> (it ſeems he was but
(as I gueſs'd) in a fit of Drolling before) <hi>to
know of me, whether any Worſhip doth at all
belong to the Image, or no? Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>if there be any Worſhip due (as the Council of
Trent ſaith there is) to the Image, either it is
the ſame that is given to the Prototype, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from it. If it be the ſame, then proper
Divine Worſhip is given to the Image: If di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
then the Image is worſhipped with Divine
Worſhip for it ſelf, and not relatively, as I
would have it.</hi> And was it not ſubtilly done
to tell us, that if the <hi>Worſhip given to an
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48446:134"/>
Image be diſtinct from that which is given to the
Prototype,</hi> (God) <hi>then the Image is worſhipped
with Divine Worſhip for it ſelf?</hi> The <hi>words</hi>
had been more <hi>expreſs,</hi> but the <hi>ſenſe</hi> had
been the <hi>ſame,</hi> had he ſaid: If an Image be <hi>not
worſhipped</hi> with <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip, then <hi>it is
worſhipped</hi> with <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip: for the
<hi>Worſhip</hi> due to <hi>God,</hi> is <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip, and
that which is <hi>diſtinct</hi> from it, is <hi>not Divine</hi>
Worſhip. So hard a thing it is for one, who

of the <hi>Church</hi> is concerned in them, I
ſhall let the Reader ſee by a Parallel exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in a paſſage relating to <hi>Civil Worſhip.</hi> A
<hi>Gentleman</hi> at Court paſſing through the
Guard-Chamber, ſaw a <hi>Countrey-man</hi> there
engaged in a <hi>Diſpute</hi> with three or four of
the <hi>Yeomen.</hi> The Clown, it ſeems, would
have gone into the <hi>Preſence</hi> cover'd. They
pull'd him back, and told him when he went
into that Room, he muſt pull off his Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

He asked them very pertly, To whom, or to
what, for he ſaw nothing but a <hi>Chair</hi> and a
<hi>Canopy?</hi> They told him, It was the Kings
<hi>Chair</hi> of State, and he muſt do it to the <hi>Chair</hi>
out of reſpect to the <hi>King.</hi> The Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
here (perhaps he had read Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s
Argument, or heard him preach it, for ſuch
kind of preaching hath been the ground of
that part of <hi>Quakeriſm)</hi> began with a ſerious
countenance to demand of them, whether
any Worſhip at all were due to the <hi>Chair</hi> or
no? For his part, he was a Loyal Subject of
His Majeſties, and had really a ſcruple in
the caſe. For if any Worſhip were due to
it, it was either the <hi>ſame</hi> which is given to
the <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>diſtinct</hi> from it. If the <hi>ſame,</hi>
then <hi>proper Regal Worſhip</hi> would be given to
ſomething beſide the <hi>King,</hi> which were <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:48446:135"/>
to do. If <hi>diſtinct,</hi> then the <hi>Chair</hi> would
be worſhipped with <hi>Regal Honour</hi> for it ſelf,

§. 4. This is what the <hi>Church</hi> requireth
of her Children to believe, and this is all
that a <hi>Catholick Controvertist</hi> is bound to
ſpeak to. Nor do the Arguments the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

otherwiſe than <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Arguments againſt

<hi>Zeno</hi> proves every jot as ſubtilly that a man

honour the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> without falling

the <hi>Worſhip given to the Image be the
ſame that is given to the Prototype, or diſtinct
from it?</hi> And I am the rather induced to do
it, in St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his way, who bolds that
<hi>the ſame Reverence is given to Chriſt and to his
Image:</hi> becauſe I find my Adverſary himſelf
(in caſe any Honour or Veneration be due to
the Image, as the <hi>Council</hi> affirms there is)
p. 79. very well inclin'd to allow of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
his Reaſon for it, becauſe, as the ſaid
St. <hi>Thomas</hi> well obſerves (ſaith Dr. <hi>St.) the
motion of the Soul towards an Image, as it is an
Image, is the ſame with that which is towards
the thing repreſented by it.</hi> When therefore
he objects, that <hi>if it be the ſame, then proper
Divine Worſhip is given to the Image,</hi> I deny
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48446:137"/>
the Conſequence, becauſe although it be the
<hi>ſame</hi> as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Act, yet it
falls upon the <hi>Image</hi> after an <hi>inferiour man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
as a thing relating to <hi>God,</hi> and purely
<hi>for his ſake.</hi> Hence it is, that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his
followers diſtinguiſh in the <hi>ſame</hi> Act of
Worſhip a <hi>double</hi> notion; the One of <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Latria,</hi> as it tends to <hi>God</hi> Himſelf; the
other of <hi>Relative Latria,</hi> as it reflects upon
the <hi>Image</hi> for his ſake. Now to help the
Fancy in <hi>ſo nice</hi> a Speculation, ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are uſed of <hi>other Acts</hi> which tend to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Terms or Objects relating to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which though not in all things <hi>parallel,</hi>
yet ſerve to ſhow how the <hi>ſame</hi> indiviſible
Act may include different <hi>habitudes</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,</hi>
the one inferiour to the other. Is it
not an Act of <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> to help our
Neighbours <hi>Horſe</hi> or his <hi>Aſs</hi> out of a <hi>ditch,</hi>
and yet if we conſider the <hi>Act</hi> as preciſely
tending to relieve the <hi>Horſe,</hi> it is not <hi>Charity,</hi>
but an <hi>inferiour</hi> kind of love, (if we may ſo
call it) or rather <hi>compaſſion</hi> of the Beaſt?
And do not the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven <hi>ſee God</hi> and
the <hi>Creatures</hi> by the ſame Act of <hi>Beatifical
Viſion,</hi> and yet the <hi>Act</hi> as conſidered preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in order to the <hi>Creatures,</hi> is <hi>not Beatifical,</hi>
but of an <hi>inferiour</hi> kind to it ſelf, as termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
upon the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

give to the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and his <hi>Saints,</hi> I added, as a farther Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it, that it was <hi>much like the Honour
given to the Chair of State, or the Kings Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,

rather than <hi>Anſwers,</hi> he gives to them.</p>
                  <p>§. 1. For the <hi>honour given to the Chair of
State,</hi> (and we may ſuppoſe he means the
ſame of the <hi>Kings Picture</hi> and <hi>Garment)</hi> he
ſays, that our <hi>diſpute is not concerning Civil
Worſhip, but Divine.</hi> And here, in the firſt
place, he impoſes upon his Reader, for the
Diſpute between <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
is not whether <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Images, for <hi>that</hi> they acknowledge to
be due to <hi>God alone;</hi> but whether they may
not give an <hi>inferiour</hi> or <hi>honourary</hi> reſpect and
veneration to them for his ſake? This I ſaid
was much like the <hi>honour given to the Chair
of State;</hi> that is, as we honour the <hi>Chair</hi> for
the <hi>Kings</hi> ſake, and yet do not give the <hi>ſame
Regal honour</hi> to the <hi>Chair,</hi> as to the <hi>King;</hi> ſo
in like manner we honour Chriſts <hi>Picture</hi> or
<hi>Image,</hi> and yet give not the <hi>ſame Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
to the Image as to Himſelf, but an <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi>
Reſpect and Reverence, as hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
declared. The Compariſon then you
ſee is onely about the <hi>way</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Honour, which may be the <hi>ſame</hi> to <hi>God</hi>
and the <hi>King,</hi> although the Honour ſo given
be very different; and therefore for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48446:139"/>
to tell his Reader, that the inſtance was

But though he ſay <hi>our diſpute is not
concerning Civil Worſhip,</hi> yet 'tis obſervable,
he does not tell us clearly, whether he hold
it lawful to give any <hi>ſuch Worſhip</hi> to the <hi>Chair</hi>
or no. If he do not, I grant he proceeds
conformable to his own Principles againſt
the Worſhip of Images, and ſo leave him
to diſpute it with the <hi>Guard.</hi> If he do, the
Countrey-man (of whom I ſpake in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Chapter) ſets upon him with his own
Argument; that <hi>either the honour he gives to
the Chair, is the ſame with that which he gives
to the King, or diſtinct from it. If it be the
ſame, then proper Regal Worſhip is given to the
Chair. If diſtinct, then the Chair is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with Regal Worſhip for it ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. and it
is in his choice to take which part of the
<hi>Dilemma</hi> likes him beſt. But to preſs the
Inſtance yet cloſer: If he, do acknowledge
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48446:140"/>
that <hi>Civil Honour</hi> is given to the <hi>Chair</hi> of
State, let him give a ſufficient Reaſon, why a
like <hi>proportionable Reverence</hi> (call it by what
Name you will) may not be given to the
<hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This will be to ſpeak to
the purpoſe, but that was not his intention,
and therefore he flies for refuge to a frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſuppoſition, that <hi>I would not ſay that
were any honour to the King, in caſe he had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
forbidden it, as we have proved,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>God hath done in the caſe of Images.</hi> As
for that pretty <hi>ſelf-denying Ordinance</hi> of a
Prince's forbidding any Reverence to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to his Picture or Chair of State, (which
perhaps the Doctor thinks very ſit ſhould
be enacted in conformity to what God (he
ſaith) hath forbidden in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment)
were it, I ſay, enacted, I grant
as formerly that to diſobey it would be to
diſhonour the King, as the diſobeying any
other Law would be; but that hinders not

one Obſervation more upon that ſubject:
and it is this, that the <hi>Compilers</hi> of the 39

                     <note place="margin">Art. 22.</note> not as Idolatry
(as the Doctor doth) but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to the plain words of Scripture,</hi> (as
they profeſs very roundly, though without
ground, when they come to
ſpeak of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation)</hi> but
as being <hi>rather repugnant to the
Word of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Art. 28.</note> which qualification of theirs
plainly gives us to underſtand, that they had
done their endeavours to find a <hi>Command,</hi>
but could meet with none; for had they
made any ſuch diſcovery either in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

us of it, and have cry'd it down for flat <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>

it is pleaſant to ſee, what Veneration this

when they after the beſt enquiry they
could make, pronounce onely <hi>Problematically</hi>
that in their Judgment, they thought it to
be <hi>rather repugnant to the Word of God,</hi> than

                  <p>§. 2. <hi>The ſecond Inſtance was of the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
which God commanded Moſes and Joſue
to give to the Ground whereon they ſtood, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

After this ſhort deſcant, I ſay, and one</hi> Note
<hi>in it above</hi> Ela, <hi>that</hi> there is as plain a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
againſt giving honour to the Image of

was an expreſs Command to do it to the Ground.
<hi>(Alas for the</hi> Compilers <hi>of the</hi> 39 Articles,
<hi>that they could not ſee it!) At length he
gives</hi> Glory <hi>to</hi> God, <hi>and tells us, that</hi> the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
preſence &amp; appearance of God doth ſanctifie
a place to ſo high a degree, that we may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teſtifie our Reverence towards it. <hi>Who will
not here admire the force of</hi> Truth, <hi>which
after long ſtanding out, makes all her Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi>
ſubmit <hi>to her power? What could
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48446:141"/>
the Doctor have ſaid ſo much to the</hi> ruine <hi>of
his own Cauſe, and the</hi> establiſhing <hi>of ours,
as to confeſs that</hi> Moſes and Joſue might
and did lawfully teſtifie their Reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Ground? <hi>I can eaſily believe his</hi>
Paſſion <hi>blinded him ſo far, that he did not
foreſee the</hi> Darts <hi>he threw ſo ſpitefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the</hi> Images <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>would recoil
(as they do) with double force upon his
own head. For a ſubtil</hi> Logician <hi>like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
would ask him here, whether</hi> this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<hi>he ſpeaks of, were</hi> Abſolute <hi>or</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<hi>that is, were teſtified to the</hi> Ground
<hi>for</hi> it ſelf, <hi>or meerly for</hi> God's ſake <hi>who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
there preſent? His Anſwer, I doubt
not, would be, that it was not to the Ground
for</hi> it ſelf, <hi>but meerly out of</hi> reſpect <hi>to</hi> God.
<hi>And what would his</hi> Oppoſer <hi>do here, but firſt
turn his</hi> own Compariſon <hi>upon him, p. 100.
that this was</hi> juſt as if an unchaſte Wife ſhould
plead in her excuſe to her Husband, that the
Perſon ſhe was too kind with, was a near Friend
of his, and that it was out of reſpect to him, ſhe
gave him the honour of his Bed? <hi>And then
make a grave application upon it, as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
does,</hi> That if ſuch an excuſe will not be
taken by a Jealous Husband, how much leſs will
ſuch like pretences avail with that God who
hath declared himſelf particularly jealous of his
honour, and that he will not give his Glory to
another, but hath reſerved all Divine Worſhip
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48446:142"/>
as proper to himſelf, and no ſuch fond excuſes
of relative and inferiour Worſhip will ſerve,
when they encroach upon his Pregrogative?
<hi>Neither would this ſubtil</hi> Diſputant <hi>be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to ſtop here, but would farther adde,
that</hi> for his part he could ſee no reaſon, <hi>why
had he been in</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Joſue's <hi>place, but</hi>
he might with as little ſcruple have offered ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to the Ground, as put off his ſhoes to it.
And he ſhould think himſelf hardly dealt with,
if he did not come off with the ſame diſtinction.
For if he did it to God abſolutely, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and to the Ground onely improperly and
relatively, wherein were he to blame, <hi>in the
Doctors Principles? Let him deal as he
pleaſes with this Perſonated</hi> Soſta.</p>
                  <p>For my own part, (to purſue his Method
of arguing a little farther, that the Reader
may ſee whether it leads) <hi>I deſire ſeriouſly to
know of him whether any Reverence
was due to the Ground or no?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 102.</note> 
                     <hi>If
none at all, to what end did they put
off their ſhoes, which if the Ground</hi> (as he ſaith
of <hi>Images) had any ſenſe in it, would think was
done to it?</hi> Why was there an expreſs
Command to require it? <hi>And why doth the
Doctor himſelf determine that they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
teſtifie their Reverence towards the Ground
becauſe it was ſanctified or Holy, if none were
due? If there were any due, whether it were the
ſame which was given to God, or diſtinct from
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48446:142"/>
it? If it were the ſame, then proper Divine
Worſhip was given to the Ground; if distinct,
then the Ground was worſhipped with Divine
Worſhip for it ſelf, and not relatively.</hi> Again,
either it was <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip, or an <hi>Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
Worſhip <hi>diſtinct</hi> from it. If it were
<hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip, then the Argument he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
out of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> (p. 103.) returns upon
him, that <hi>it is the nature of Divine Worſhip
to be given for it ſelf; and therefore if it were
given to the Ground, the Creature was equally
worſhipped with God, which certainly was Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
If it were <hi>not Divine,</hi> but an <hi>Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
Worſhip, <hi>diſtinct</hi> from that which is
given to God, then <hi>Vaſquez, (a man of great
Reputation too, and of as ſearching a Wit as
Bellarmin)</hi> comes upon him, that <hi>he that ſo
gives it, incurs the crime of Idolatry, becauſe he
expreſſeth his ſubmiſſion to a meer inaninate
thing, that hath no kind of excellency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
if from him.</hi> So that upon the whole,
what follows in Doctor <hi>St.</hi>'s <hi>Logick</hi> is, that
<hi>it was in Moſes and Joſue's choice what ſort
of Idolatry they would commit, when they testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
their Reverence to the Ground, but in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way could they avoid it.</hi> I cannot expect
he will ſet much by the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
and <hi>Vaſquez;</hi> but what I expect and in
juſtice may exact from him, is, that he will
anſwer their Reaſons, at leaſt one of them,
if he embrace the other; or elſe give a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48446:143"/>
reaſon himſelf why this <hi>manner</hi> of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
is <hi>abſurd</hi> againſt the <hi>Reverence</hi> he
confeſſes due to the <hi>Ground,</hi> and not againſt
the <hi>Reverence</hi> we aſſert to be due to <hi>Holy
Images.</hi> If he fly to the <hi>old ſhift,</hi> of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<hi>Command</hi> for the one, and a pretended
<hi>Prohibition</hi> for the other, no relief is to be
had from thence; for beſides his giving <hi>Gods
ſpecial preſence</hi> here as a <hi>ſecond</hi> and diſtinct
reaſon why <hi>they might lawfully teſtifie their
Reverence towards the Ground,</hi> whether there
were any Command or no; yet taking in the
Command, the Argument hath ſtill the ſame
force as before. For either <hi>the Reverence they
were commanded to teſtifie towards the Ground,
becauſe it was Holy, was the ſame which they
gave to God, or diſtinct from it. If the ſame,
then proper Divine Worſhip was given to the
Ground by Gods Command; If diſtinct, then
the Ground was worſhipped with Divine Worſhip
for it ſelf.</hi> Both <hi>Idolatry</hi> in their own <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
according to <hi>his Principles:</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it is now <hi>in his choice,</hi> whether he
will blame <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſue</hi> for committing,
or <hi>God</hi> for commanding them to commit
<hi>Idolatry.</hi> If it were <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the nature
of the thing to <hi>put off their ſhoes in reverence
to the Ground, God's Command</hi> could not
make it to be otherwiſe. And if it were
<hi>not Idolatry</hi> in it ſelf, neither is it to give a
<hi>like honour</hi> to the <hi>Image of Chriſt.</hi> From
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48446:143"/>
whence it follows to the utter ruine of all
he hath argued from his <hi>pretended Prohibition,</hi>
that as no <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>God</hi> can make that to
be <hi>not Idolatry,</hi> which is ſo in the nature of
the thing; ſo no <hi>Prohibition</hi> (if there were
any) could make that to be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which
hath not in it the true and real nature of
<hi>Idolatry.</hi> Here the <hi>Ax</hi> is laid to the <hi>Root,</hi>
and if ever the Doctor will ſpeak home to
the purpoſe, it muſt be upon this point. He
muſt ſpeak to the nature of the thing, and not
ſtand pointing at the Sky, as <hi>Polus</hi> did, to
perſwade the World he ſees a <hi>ſiery Dragon,</hi>
and that all are blind who ſee it not, when
there is nothing but <hi>pure Air.</hi> What he
faintly ſuggeſts at preſent, as ſome little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the caſe of giving <hi>reverence</hi>
to the <hi>Ground,</hi> and that of giving the like
to <hi>Images,</hi> viz. that <hi>God was preſent in the
place by a ſpecial appearance, but is not ſo in
Images,</hi> is (to uſe his own Compariſon, that
he may ſee how ſit it was to the matter he
applied it) <hi>juſt as if an unchaſte Wife ſhould
plead in her excuſe to her Husband for giving a
Friend of his the honour of his Bed, that ſhe
did it not when he was abſent, but to testifie her
greater reſpect to him, at a time when he was
particularly preſent: and can any one think</hi>
but <hi>that ſuch an excuſe as this would be taken
by a Jealous Husband?</hi> He adds for a farther
difference, that <hi>the Reverence then requir'd,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48446:144"/>
was not kiſſing the Ground, or bowing to it, much
leſs praying to it, but onely putting off their ſhoes.</hi>
And I wonder what Edition of the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Trent</hi> he makes uſe of, to ground this <hi>calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of praying to Images,</hi> ſo often repeated by
him; for in all thoſe printed in <hi>Catholick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
we are told we are not <hi>to ask any thing of
them:</hi> and I wonder no leſs by what <hi>Rule</hi> he
makes <hi>putting off the ſhoes</hi> to be a ſign of <hi>leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,</hi>
than <hi>kiſſing</hi> the <hi>Ground,</hi> or <hi>bowing to
it.</hi> The <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the <hi>Miſſal</hi> preſcribes it to
be done but once a year by the <hi>Prieſt</hi> upon
<hi>Good Friday</hi> to teſtifie a <hi>greater Reverence</hi> to
the <hi>Image</hi> of our <hi>Crucified Lord.</hi> But I ſhall
not diſpute it with him, onely I perſwade
my ſelf, that if the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi>
ſhould ordain the <hi>Miniſter</hi> when he goes
up to the <hi>Communion-Table</hi> either to <hi>put off
his ſhoes,</hi> or to <hi>bow to it,</hi> he would ſcruple
much more to go <hi>barefoot,</hi> than to <hi>nod</hi> to it
with his Shoes on.</p>
                  <p>Two other pretences of difference he brings
not unlike the former; The firſt, that in <hi>kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the <hi>Ground,</hi> or <hi>bowing to it, if theſe things
had been done to the Ground, the danger had not
been ſo great as to Images.</hi> The other, that
<hi>the Reverence of Holy Places and Things, is of
a quite different nature from the Worſhip of
Images.</hi> For the firſt of <hi>danger,</hi> he may
leave that (as Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> hath told him)
<hi>to the Judgment of the Church.</hi> And for the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48446:144"/>
ſecond, <hi>Holy Places</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> may have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Relations to God, according to the
different uſes for which they ſerve in order
to his Worſhip; and yet the <hi>Reverence</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them may be <hi>proportionably alike,</hi> that is,
an <hi>inferiour Reſpect</hi> and Veneration, and <hi>not
Latria,</hi> which is due to God alone. But
how different ſoever he would make it from
that of <hi>Images,</hi> he muſt <hi>not think to eſcape;</hi>
For if any be due at all to <hi>Holy Places</hi> and
<hi>Things,</hi> I ſuppoſe it is given them for <hi>God's
ſake,</hi> and then all his own Arguments return
upon him afreſh; for <hi>either it is the ſame
which is given to God, or diſtinct from it;</hi> and
which way ſoever he take, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> or <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi>
will be upon him. Or <hi>none</hi> at all is
due to them, and then he mocks his Reader,
when he tells him, that <hi>the Reverence of Holy
Places and Things, is of a quite different nature
from the Worſhip of Images.</hi> And this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what lies at the bottom, how ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſoever he pretend the contrary here in
words, as will manifeſtly appear from his
Anſwers to the following <hi>Inſtances.</hi> For
firſt,</p>
                  <p>§. 3. To that <hi>of the Reverence given by the
Jews to the Ark and the Holy of Holies, where
the Cherubins and Propitiatory were,</hi> he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough denies that any was given them.
To prove there was, I produced firſt that
Text of the <hi>Pſalm, Adore ye the foot-ſtool of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48446:145"/>
God, for it it is holy,</hi> Pſal. xcviii. 5. (as all the
Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> read it without ſcruple) or
as their own Tranſlation hath it, <hi>Fall down
before his Foot-ſtool, for He</hi> (the Margin hath
it <hi>It) is holy.</hi> And ſecondly, the Teſtimony
of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who ſaith expreſly <hi>(Ep. 17. ad
Marcel.) Venerabantur olim, that the Jews in
times paſt did worſhip or reverence the Holy of
Holies, becauſe there were the Cherubins, the
Propitiatory, the Ark,</hi> &amp;c. To neither of
theſe doth he vouchſafe any Anſwer at all,
but with an <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> tells us, p. 106. that
<hi>the Jews onely directed their Worſhip towards
that place where</hi> God <hi>had promiſed to be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
preſent among them; and ſignifies no more
to the Worſhip of Images, than our lifting up
our Eyes to Heaven doth, when we pray.</hi> Thus
He, Oracularly, without either <hi>Scripture,</hi>
or <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> to abet him. But if
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſue</hi> might lawfully teſtifie
their <hi>Reverence</hi> to the Ground, becauſe <hi>it</hi>
was <hi>holy,</hi> why might not the <hi>Jews</hi> do as
much to the <hi>Foot-ſtool</hi> of God, becauſe <hi>that</hi>
alſo was <hi>holy?</hi> Why was it placed in the
<hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and why were the People
commanded to <hi>adore,</hi> or <hi>bow down before it,</hi>
but to <hi>testifie</hi> their <hi>Reverence</hi> to it, and that
a <hi>much greater,</hi> in the Doctors opinion, than
<hi>putting off their ſhoes,</hi> for they were to <hi>adore
it,</hi> or <hi>fall down before it:</hi> and all this, I hope,
<hi>ſignifies</hi> ſomething <hi>more</hi> to the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48446:145"/>
                     <hi>Images than the lifting up our Eyes to Heaven
doth, when we pray;</hi> which might have been
as well, if not better, without all this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
in an open field.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> he tells, That <hi>they were
always hid from the ſight of the People;</hi> as if
nothing could have <hi>Reverence</hi> given it, but
what is ſeen: It may reaſonably be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that himſelf will charge us with <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
for adoring the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> not onely when
we <hi>ſee</hi> it upon the Altar, but when it is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi>
in a Tabernacle, or <hi>covered</hi> with a
Veil. Nor doth he mend the matter when
he ſays, That <hi>the High Prieſt himſelf went into
the Holy of Holies but once a year;</hi> for if at
that time it were <hi>lawful</hi> for him to teſtifie
<hi>Reverence</hi> to the Throne of God there pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
it is as much as we deſire; and if <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi>
it was more than he ought to have
done, though but once a year;
for as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Li. adverſ-Vigilant.</note> 
                     <hi>Quod
ſemel feciſſe bonum eſt, non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
malum eſſe, ſi frequenter fiat;
aut ſi aliqua culpa vitanda eſt, non ex eo quod
ſaepe, ſed ex eo quod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>it aliquando, culpabile eſt.</hi>
What he adds of the <hi>Cherubins</hi> being placed
meerly <hi>as Appendices to the Throne of God,</hi>
was a means rather to <hi>increaſe</hi> than <hi>diminiſh</hi>
the people's <hi>reverence</hi> to them; and for their
<hi>form,</hi> there needed no more be known than
what <hi>Calvin (in Exod.</hi> xxv. 18.) affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48446:146"/>
of them, That <hi>they repreſented An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. <hi>To bowing at the Name of JESUS.</hi>
This Ceremony was appointed and allowed
by the <hi>Injunctions</hi> made in the time of <hi>Queen
Elizabeth,</hi> Art. 52. and was defended by
Dr. <hi>Whitgift</hi> in his Defence
againſt <hi>Cartright,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tr. 21. ch. 7. Ag. Rhem. Teſt. Phil. <hi>ii.</hi> 10.</note> by Dr.

and that in Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s own ſight, by ſuch as
eſteem themſelves the onely <hi>true</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi>
Sons of <hi>that Church.</hi> This Inſtance I thought
to be very pertinent, becauſe firſt it is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Protestants,</hi> and ſo more eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
and ſecondly becauſe of the <hi>Analogy</hi>
there is between <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
being a <hi>Word</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> and a <hi>Word</hi>
(as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it) a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
to the <hi>Ear.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Peri Herm. c. 1.</note> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon I had alſo, becauſe the Doctor
being inoculated into the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or, (to ſpeak his Dialect) <hi>a Revolted
Presbyterian,</hi> I thought he would not dare to
diſavow all <hi>reverence</hi> to the Sacred Name of
JESUS. But I find I was deceived; for he
tells me plainly, <hi>I might as well have inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in going to Church at the Toll of a Bell, as
in bowing at the Name of Jeſus; for as the one
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48446:146"/>
only tells us the time when, ſo the other only puts
us in mind of the Perſon whom we are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>
This is plain enough, I confeſs (if it
be as mannerly) to tell us that no more <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
is due to the moſt H. <hi>Name</hi> of JESUS,
when we hear it ſpoken, than to a <hi>Bell</hi> when
we hear it <hi>toll.</hi> And the Compari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on is
ſomewhat more elevated, than if he had
made it with <hi>Whittington's</hi> fancying the <hi>Bells</hi>
to call him back to be <hi>Lord Maior</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
But was this all that St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant,
when he told us, That <hi>at the Name of Jeſus</hi>
(or as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf reads it, p. 111. <hi>To the
Name of Jeſus) every knee ſhall bow?</hi> Phil.
ii. 10. Was it for this that <hi>God</hi> ſo highly
<hi>exalted</hi> Him, that <hi>He gave Him a Name which
is above every Name,</hi> that it might have as
much <hi>Reverence</hi> given <hi>It,</hi> as we give to great
<hi>Meg</hi> of <hi>Weſtminster?</hi> What would Biſhop
<hi>Andrews</hi> have ſaid, had he lived to hear
this? <q>Verily (ſaith He in his Sermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the foregoing words of St. <hi>Paul)</hi> God
will not have us worſhip him like <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,</hi>
as if we had no Joynts in our
Knees. He will have more honour of men,
than of the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the Church. He will
have us to <hi>bow</hi> our Knees, and let us <hi>bow</hi>
them in God's Name, and <hi>To</hi> his Name.
For this is another Prerogative. He is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to whoſe <hi>Perſon</hi> Knees do bow; but
He to whoſe <hi>Name</hi> onely much more. But
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48446:147"/>
the cauſe is here otherwiſe. For his <hi>Perſon</hi>
is taken up out of our ſight; all we can
do, will not reach unto it. But his Name
he hath left behind to us, that we may
ſhew by our <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Reſpect to it,</hi>
how much we eſteem him; How true the
<hi>Pſalm</hi> ſhall be, <hi>Holy and Reverend is his
Name.</hi> But if we have much ado to get it
<hi>bow</hi> at all; much more ſhall we have to
get it done to his <hi>Name.</hi> There be that do
it not; what ſpeak I of not doing it? There
be that not onely forbear to do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but put themſelves to an <hi>evil Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,</hi>
to find faults where none is, and
caſt ſcruples into mens minds, by no means
to do it</q>—And again a little after. <q>But
to keep us to the Name. This is ſure; the
words themſelves (of St. <hi>Paul)</hi> are ſo <hi>plain,</hi>
as they are able to <hi>convince</hi> any mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
And there is no Writer (not of
the <hi>Ancient)</hi> on this place that I can find,
(ſave he that turned all into <hi>Allegories)</hi> but
literally underſtands it, and likes well
enough we ſhould actually perform it.</q> Thus
Dr. <hi>Andrews, (a very Learned Biſhop of his
Church,</hi> as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf calls him, p. 101.)
And can any legitimate <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>that Church</hi>
hear him preach, that <hi>no</hi> more <hi>Reverence</hi> is
due to the Name of JESUS, than to the <hi>toll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of a <hi>Bell,</hi> and yet cry him up hereafter
for a <hi>Pillar</hi> of <hi>that Church</hi> (unleſs it be in the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48446:147"/>
                     <hi>Biſhop's ſenſe</hi> above-mentioned) whoſe <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe</hi>
he expoſes as <hi>ridiculous,</hi> by ſo unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
a Compariſon? I remember at the

firſt Wounds given to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
was from a Book whoſe <hi>Title</hi> (as I read it
poſted up in <hi>Weſtminster-Hall)</hi> was <hi>Jeſu-Worſhip
Confuted;</hi> and whether the ſame
might not have been put for a <hi>Marginal Note</hi>
to this Anſwer of the Doctors, I leave to
Judgment of the Reader. Give me leave to
ſpeak a Word to you, Sons of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> what if the Doctor ſhould
come upon you for <hi>reverencing</hi> the Name of
JESUS with your <hi>Hat</hi> or <hi>Knee,</hi> as he doth
upon us for honouring in like manner his
<hi>Image,</hi> viz. p. 102. that the <hi>Reverence you
give to that Holy Name, is either the ſame you
give to God or diſtinct from it. If it be the
ſame, then you give proper divine worſhip to
the Name; and if it be diſtinct, then the Name
is worſhipped with divine worſhip for it ſelf;
and it is in your choice what ſort of Idolatry
you will commit who worſhip the Name of</hi> JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS,
<hi>but neither way can you avoid it?</hi> If
you tell him that the <hi>Reverence</hi> you give
that <hi>H. Name</hi> is <hi>not</hi> the <hi>worſhip</hi> due to <hi>God,</hi>
but a <hi>Relative</hi> and <hi>inferiour reſpect</hi> for his
ſake; he will tell you again, as he did me in
the caſe of <hi>Images,</hi> p. 100. that <hi>this is juſt
as if an unchaſt Wife ſhould plead in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48446:148"/>
to her Husband, that the Perſon ſhe was too
kind with, was extreamly like him, and a dear
friend of his, nay had his very name, and that
it was out of reſpect to him, that ſhe gave him
the honour of his Bed.</hi> I do not hear that he
hath preſs'd this argument upon you; and
if he do not, I cannot but wonder, his zeal
for God's honour ſuffers you ſo long to go
on in your <hi>Idolatrous</hi> practiſe; and much
more, if he comply with you himſelf in
ſhewing any <hi>reverence</hi> to that <hi>Name,</hi> for
though like <hi>a wiſer Chriſtian</hi> (there being
degrees among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as well as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,)
he differ extreamly from the Vulgar in
his Opinion of Religion, yet this is to concur
with them in the external practiſe of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi>
and ſo he falls under the ſame cenſure
with his <hi>wiſer Heathens,</hi> p. 73.
On the other ſide if he do it

ſtrucken with ſomething, which ſhall make it
not able to bow; and for the Name, that they
that will do no honour to it, when time of need
comes ſhall receive no honour by it.</hi> But to
conclude this Point. If it be the ſenſe of
the Sons of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that
they intend to give <hi>no</hi> more <hi>reverence</hi> to the
moſt <hi>Holy Name of Jeſus,</hi> when they hear
it <hi>read,</hi> than to a <hi>Bell,</hi> when they hear it

<hi>this Practiſe</hi> of theirs for an <hi>Inſtance.</hi> But
if they acknowledge <hi>more</hi> is due to that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Name,</hi> than to a <hi>Bell,</hi> and yet not ſo
much as is due to <hi>God</hi> himſelf, I have the
end for which I brought it, which was to let
them ſee what kind of <hi>worſhip</hi> it is we give
to the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſuch as is given by
themſelves to the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For <hi>we</hi>
make <hi>Images</hi> no more the <hi>Objects</hi> of our <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
when we <hi>kneel</hi> before them, than <hi>they</hi>
do that <hi>Holy Name,</hi> when they <hi>bow</hi> at it.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. The <hi>Fift</hi> Inſtance was of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
given to the Sacramental ſigns in the
Supper by kneeling before them;</hi> which if the
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> had <hi>any ſenſe in them</hi> (as
he ſaith <hi>of Images,</hi> p. 102.) <hi>would think
were done to them.</hi> And what ſaith my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
to this, Marry, that <hi>this of all things
ſhould not be objected to them.</hi> If you ask
him why? He tells you, becauſe <hi>they have
declared in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ubrick after the Communion,
that thereby no adoration is intended or ought
to be done either unto the Sacramental Dread
and Wine, there bodily received; or any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
preſence of Chriſt's Natural Fleſh and
Blood; for the Sacramental Bread and Wine
remain ſtill in their very natural ſubstances,
and therefore may not be adored. For that
were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful
Chriſtians.</hi> I confeſs I reflected up in this
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48446:149"/>
                     <hi>Rubrick,</hi> when I put down <hi>Kneeling at the

is not yet more than a dozen years, ſince
this <hi>Rubrick</hi> was inſerted into the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

have been a deſign to gain ſcrupulous and

diſſented from her, as to declare <hi>no adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

what the word now ſignifieth by

a practiſe of great <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>

Places,</hi> (p. 105.) and ſurely the <hi>Church,</hi> the
<hi>Houſe of God</hi> is one of them. Here then
we find him incline to admit a <hi>Reverence</hi>
due to the Altar; and <hi>if it be of the ſame
nature with putting off our Hats while we are
in the Church,</hi> as he doth the <hi>one,</hi> ſo he may
lawfully do the <hi>other.</hi> But then, as if he
had granted too much, he preſently draws
back, and tells us, <hi>This is only determining a
natural act of Reverence, that way which the
ancient Chriſtians did uſe to direct their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi>
(which as far as I can underſtand the
words) is not of the ſame nature with <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off our Hats when we are in the Church,</hi>
but with <hi>going to Church</hi> when the <hi>Bell tolls,</hi>
which is to give no more Reverence to the
<hi>Altar,</hi> than to the <hi>Bell.</hi> But who can unfold
the Riddle, and tell me what he means by
<hi>a natural Act of Reverence that way which
the ancient Chriſtians did uſe to direct their
Worſhip?</hi> If he mean by <hi>that way</hi> the <hi>local
ſituation</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which was
<hi>the way the ancient Chriſtians uſed to direct
their Worſhip,</hi> and that <hi>Nature</hi> teacheth us

the <hi>Altar</hi> (for example) in St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s,
may ſerve for ſuch a determination, becauſe
it is placed in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> yet he muſt give
another reaſon why thoſe in the <hi>Savoy</hi> bow
towards the <hi>Altar,</hi> where it is ſeated in the

                     <hi>Natural Act of Reverence that way, which the

which was towards the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> But if he
mean by <hi>that way,</hi> a <hi>like manner of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
to the <hi>Altar,</hi> as was uſed to be given

they acknowledged an <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
due to the <hi>Holy Altar,</hi> and teſtified that

And hereupon Mr.
<hi>Thorndike</hi> (Epil. 3. p. pag. 351.) ingenuouſly
ſaith, <hi>I do believe that it was ſo practiſed and
done in the ancient Church, which I maintain
from the beginning to have been the true Church
of Chriſt—For I do acknowledge the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
that are produced out of St.</hi> Ambroſe,
<hi>St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>St.</hi> Chryſoſtome, <hi>St.</hi> Gregory
Nazianzen: with the reſt, and more than I
have produced. And now it is in the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's
choice, whether he will condemn ſo
<hi>great</hi> and <hi>Holy Men,</hi> and with them the
<hi>Church</hi> of that time, of <hi>Idolatry</hi> for adoring
<hi>our Lord Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
or will abſolve <hi>Uj</hi> for doing what <hi>they</hi>
did. It is with them we muſt ſtand or fall.
And the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s argument will make <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
or <hi>both</hi> Idolaters. But before I ſpeak
to that, and that the Reader may ſee what
force it is like to have, behold how he uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
it in.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. <hi>I proceeded,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Hoſt, and here the argument I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
was to take off the common anſwer,</hi> viz.
(of Catholicks) <hi>that it cannot be Idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they believe the Bread to be God.</hi> This
is what the Doctor expoſes in the <hi>front</hi> of
his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to publick view. And if the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48446:155"/>
Reader meet with ſuch <hi>ſophiſticate</hi> Ware in
the <hi>Mouth of</hi> the <hi>Sack,</hi> What may he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
when he comes neerer to the <hi>bottom?
The argument I propoſed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was to take
off the Common Anſwer,</hi> (viz. of <hi>Catholicks)
that it cannot be Idolatry, becauſe they believe
the Bread to be God:</hi> And that too, <hi>just as
the Worſhippers of the Sun believed the Sun to
be God; For upon the ſame ground</hi> he ſaith,
it is that <hi>they who believe the Sun to be God,
and worſhip him on that account, would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
from Idolatry too.</hi> The <hi>unhandſomneſs</hi>
of this Proceeding I fairly hinted to him in
my Reply, whereas I might juſtly have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it a <hi>moſt injurious calumny;</hi> and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
an Ingenuous Writer, either to have
juſtified his charge; or (if he could not do
that, nor yet had humility enough to retract
it,) to have wav'd at leaſt the repeating it
in his Anſwer. But this he is ſo far from
doing, that without any proof at all, what
he did but inſinuate before in the Body of
his Argument, he lays down now expreſly
in his Rejoinder, as the <hi>Ground</hi> of his charge
of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in this matter. Wherefore I
muſt now challenge him to prove it, <hi>viz.</hi>
that <hi>it is the Common Anſwer of Catholicks
that their Adoration of the Euchariſt cannot be
Idolatry, becauſe they believe the Bread to be
God;</hi> or if that be too much, to produce at
leaſt any one <hi>Catholick</hi> Author, who ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48446:155"/>
himſelf from <hi>Idolatry</hi> upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Nothing is more notorious than that
Catholicks believe the whole ſubſtance of
<hi>Bread</hi> to be converted into the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and conſequently <hi>Bread</hi> not to be there.
Wherefore to do both himſelf and us right,
he ſhould have ſaid, the <hi>Common Anſwer of
Catholicks,</hi> when they are charged with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
in the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> is not,
<hi>that it cannot be Idolatry, becauſe they believe
the bread to be God;</hi> but becauſe <hi>they believe
no bread at all to be there,</hi> but <hi>the Body of
Christ true God,</hi> into which it is changed.
This had been to ſpeak <hi>Truth;</hi> but withall
it had been to <hi>ſtifle</hi> his argument in its birth,
by choaking his <hi>Parallel</hi> between <hi>Catholicks</hi>
and <hi>thoſe</hi> who worſhipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it to remain ſtill the <hi>Sun.</hi> And why
ſhould be ſcruple more to preſerve his <hi>own
Child,</hi> than the <hi>Aegyptian Midwives</hi> did to
ſave thoſe of <hi>other</hi> People?</p>
                  <p>The Argument, as it is <hi>artificially</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by himſelf, runs thus, that <hi>Upon the ſame
Ground that Catholicks would excuſe
themſelves from Idolatry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 109.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe
they believe the bread to be God: they
who believe the Sun to be God, and worſhip him
on that account would be excuſed from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
too;</hi> which who ſo reads would think it
intended directly to excuſe the <hi>worſhippers</hi>
of the <hi>Sun</hi> from <hi>Idolatry.</hi> But becauſe his
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48446:156"/>
Intention is to make it fall with a revers'd
blow upon <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and <hi>conclude</hi> them
guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that the Reader may ſee
the force of the Argument, I ſhall reduce
it to form, as it may ſerve to infer that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</hi>
And this it is. <hi>If the Worſhip of the
Sun by thoſe who believe the Sun to be God,
and Worſhip him on that account, be Idolatry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then the Worſhip of the bread in the Euchariſt,
by thoſe who believe it to be God, and worſhip
it on that account, is Idolatry. But it is the
Common Anſwer of Papiſls,</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>St.)
that they believe the bread to be God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>they are Idolaters.</hi> This is the ſumme
of this mighty Argument; and there needs
no more to overthrow it, but to deny as
moſt notoriouſly <hi>falſe,</hi> the ſecond Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Catholicks believe the Bread to be
God, as the Worſhippers of the Sun believed
the Sun to be God.</hi> Others may judge of it,
as they pleaſe, but for my part I ſhould
wonder extreamly, how the Doctor could
have the confidence to advance ſo palpable
a <hi>calumny</hi> the ſecond time, but that I ſee,
what <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> are neceſſary to uphold
ſo <hi>unjuſt</hi> a charge. Perhaps he will reply,
his meaning was, that <hi>Catholicks believe that
to be God, which he and his Partizans believe
to be meer bread.</hi> But then what a rare
conſequence is it to ſay, the <hi>worſhippers</hi> of
the <hi>Sun</hi> were <hi>Idolaters,</hi> becauſe they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48446:156"/>
for God what <hi>themſelves</hi> believed
to be the <hi>Sun:</hi> Therefore <hi>Catholicks</hi> are <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters,</hi>
becauſe they <hi>worſhip</hi> that for <hi>God,</hi>
which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his Partizans believe to
be but <hi>bread?</hi> Which is juſt, as if an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
ſhould conclude both <hi>Catholicks</hi> and
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> to be Idolaters, for worſhipping
<hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe they worſhip <hi>him</hi> for <hi>God</hi>
whom the <hi>Arrians</hi> believe to be but a <hi>pure
creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3. <hi>This is all which needed to have
been replyed to the Argument, to ſhow the
inconcluſiveneſs of it: but to prevent what
I thought was likely to be objected by my
Adverſary, I added two things. 1. That</hi>
Catholicks are not miſtaken in their belief of
the Bread's being changed into the Body of
Chriſt, as having the ſame grounds and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and a like divine Revelation to believe
this, as to believe that Chriſt is God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
to be adored. <hi>Hereupon</hi> I affirmed
that the Doctor's argument, altering only the
names, would be of as much force from the
Pen of an Arrian againſt the Adoration of
Christ for God, as it was from his own, againſt
the Adoration of him in the Euchariſt. <hi>And I
think ſit to repeat the argument here, for
the ſame reaſon, for which the Doctor ſeems
unwilling to hear of it. What that was, the
Reader will ſee below, §. 5. of this Chapter.
The argument as I then propoſed it was this.</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:48446:157"/>
The ſame argument which would make the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
Heathen Idolatry lawful, cannot excuſe any
Act from Idolatry; But the ſame argument
by which Protestants make the worſhip of Chriſt
(a pure Man, ſaith the Arrian; <hi>I ſhould
have ſaid,</hi> creature, <hi>and I thank the Doctor
for minding me of it,)</hi> not to be Idolatry,
would make the groſſeſt Heathen Idolatry not
to be ſo. For if it be not therefore Idolatry,
becauſe they ſuppoſe Chriſt to be God, then the
worſhip of the Sun was not Idolatry by them
who ſuppoſed the Sun to be God. 2dly, <hi>I add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that ſuppoſing Catholicks ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in their belief, yet Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> an eminent
Man among the Proteſtants, denies it would
follow from thence, that they were Idolaters.
<hi>And I ſhall repeat his words, when I come
to ſpeak to that Point. The Doctor, to
make good his Argument againſt theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
(which he calls only</hi> appearances of
anſwering) <hi>undertakes to prove four things.</hi>
1. That ſuppoſing there were the ſame Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Chriſt's Divinity, and of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
in the Euchariſt by Tranſubſtantiation,
yet there could not be the ſame reaſon for the
Adoration of the Hoſt, as for worſhipping
Christ himſelf. 2. That there are not the
ſame motives and grounds to believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Tranſubſtantiation, that there are to
believe that Chriſt is God. 3. That ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
they are miſtaken in the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48446:157"/>
this doth not excuſe them from
Idolatry. 4. That the ſame Reaſon which
would excuſe them, would excuſe the moſt groſs
Idolaters in the World. <hi>Theſe are the</hi> heads
<hi>of what he</hi> rejoins <hi>in this matter, Great and
Glorious things, if they can be made out.
But how far the</hi> performance <hi>comes ſhort of
the undertaking, will appear by the enſuing
Anſwers to the ſeveral</hi> Propoſitions, <hi>and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t
he brings in proof of them, in order as
they lye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. The Doctor's firſt Propoſition:
<hi>Suppoſing there were the ſame divine
Revelation of Tranſubstantiation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 111.</note>
(that is, of Chriſt's Preſence in the
Euchariſt, by the change of the Bread into
his Body) <hi>and of His Divinity, yet there could
not be the ſame reaſon for adoration of the
Hoſt, as of Chriſt himſelf.</hi> The firſt thing
we are to conſider here, is, what he means
by the word <hi>Hoſt,</hi> whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf
under the ſpecies or accidents of Bread; or
the <hi>Accidents</hi> themſelves. If he mean <hi>Chriſt</hi>
under the Accidents, the Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſame adoration be due to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as <hi>out</hi> of it? If he mean only
the <hi>Accidents,</hi> the Queſtion is, whether the
<hi>ſame adoration,</hi> that is, <hi>as much</hi> or <hi>as great</hi>
adoration is due to <hi>them</hi> as to <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
The <hi>firſt</hi> he knows is affirmed by us,
the <hi>ſecond</hi> denyed, becauſe as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48446:158"/>
of <hi>Images</hi> (p. 190.) although <hi>Chriſt</hi> and
the Accidents be worſhipped by the <hi>ſame
Act</hi> of <hi>Adoration,</hi> yet as conſidered <hi>preciſely</hi>
relating to the Accidents, it falls upon them
after an <hi>Inferiour manner.</hi> And it became
a Generous Adverſary, (as he ſhows himſelf
to be, in ſuppoſing the <hi>ſame divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Preſence in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as
for his <hi>Divinity,</hi> which he needed not have
done) to have told us clearly his meaning
in this Point. But this he thought not fit to
do, but to blend both <hi>ſenſes</hi> confuſedly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that when he found himſelf preſs'd in
<hi>one,</hi> he might ſlie for refuge to the <hi>other.</hi>
The <hi>Catholick ſenſe</hi> is this, that the <hi>ſame</hi> or
as great <hi>adoration is due to Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as out of it.</hi> Againſt this he objects
two things. 1. That <hi>there is a plain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in Scripture for the One, and none for
the other. 2. That the One gives us a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reaſon for our Worſhip, the other doth not.</hi>
To the firſt I anſwer (as he foreſaw very
well I would) that <hi>a General Command</hi> (ſuch
as thoſe cited by himſelf, <hi>Let all the Angels
adore him,</hi> that is, <hi>Christ,</hi> Hebr. 1. 6. and <hi>to
his Name every Knee is to bow,</hi> Phil. 2. 10.)
<hi>doth extend to him wherever he is preſent:</hi>
as a like command of honouring <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
for <hi>King</hi> would do, wherever he ſhould
be known to reſide: And this I take to be
<hi>Intimation enough that we are to worſhip Chriſt
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48446:158"/>
under the Accidents ſuppoſing him preſent there.</hi>
And whereas he ſaith this Anſwer proves
<hi>no more his worſhip in them, than in a Turf,
or any other piece of bread, becauſe Chriſt,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>being God is every where preſent,</hi> (as if
his being <hi>God</hi> made him every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<hi>as</hi> he is ſuppoſed to be <hi>in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;)</hi>
This was but an Artifice to divert
the Reader from the matter in hand, which
is not about the worſhip of <hi>God, as every
where preſent,</hi> but <hi>as hypoſtatically</hi> preſent in
the <hi>Fleſh:</hi> And ſo the Queſtion between us,
is, whether in caſe there be a <hi>general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
to worſhip the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God made Man,</hi>
we may not as lawfully do it to him (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
a divine Revelation, that he is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
<hi>in the Sacrament,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and
others adored him, when he was converſant
among them? To this Queſtion I Anſwer
affirmatively, and he Negatively, unleſs <hi>he
can ſee a plain Command to do it to him, as
preſent in the Sacrament.</hi> And who can but
wonder to ſee <hi>him</hi> now ſo <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> in give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
adoration to <hi>God made Man,</hi> (believing
him to be really preſent in the <hi>Hoſt)</hi> unleſs
he have an expreſs command to do it; who
profeſſes of himſelf (p. 101.) that were he
of our mind in the matter of <hi>Images,</hi> he
<hi>ſhould not stick to offer up the Hoſt it ſelf,</hi> that
is, God-Man really preſent under the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
ſigns,</hi> in Sacrifice to <hi>a block</hi> or a <hi>hewn
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48446:159"/>
ſtone,</hi> without any command at all either
<hi>general</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> to do it? But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this ſcruple; as I have endeavoured to
do ſome others, it may ſuffice to tell him,
that although <hi>our worſhip be not to be guided
by our fancies, but the will of God;</hi> Yet where
there is a <hi>general command</hi> without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
to worſhip the <hi>Word made Fleſh,</hi>
there he hath given a ſufficient Indication
of the lawfulneſs of doing it, wherever we
are certain by <hi>Faith</hi> that He is ſo preſent.
What particular command had the <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
to adore Him in the <hi>Manger,</hi> or the
<hi>Thief</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs?</hi> Was it not enough
that they had a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> that He
was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to move them to <hi>adore</hi>
Him with Divine Worſhip? Or is he <hi>leſs
adorable</hi> under the <hi>Sacramental ſigns,</hi> than
bound up in <hi>ſwadling-cloths,</hi> or covered with
<hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſpittle?</hi> Surely it was happy for
the <hi>Wiſe-men</hi> and the <hi>Thief,</hi> that they had
not Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to direct them what to do. For
had they followed his <hi>Caſuiſtry,</hi> they muſt
have ſuſpended their Adoration for want
of an <hi>Expreſs Command</hi> in their particular
caſes.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. But he had not advanced above a
Leaf farther, when it ſeems he perceiv'd the
weakneſs of this Anſwer; and therefore to
piece it out, he tells us, (p. 115.) that <hi>in
caſe of Chriſt's viſible appearance to us in any
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48446:159"/>
place, we need not a particular command in ſuch
a caſe to make it lawful to adore him.</hi> But
that which goes againſt the grain of his
<hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> is, that he ſhould do it to
him under a <hi>Veil,</hi> though he be more certain
by <hi>Faith,</hi> that it is <hi>He</hi> that is there preſent,
than if he ſaw him with his eyes. This is
ſuch a <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> as is not to be expected
from <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood.</hi> And if you ask him
why there is not <hi>the ſame reaſon of believing
Chriſt to be preſent, as ſeeing him?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
with a <hi>distinction</hi> much more ſubtil,
than that he alledged out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for
<hi>ſaying the Lord's Prayer to a Saint,</hi> p. 101.
that <hi>in matters of pure Revelation, where the
matter propos'd to our Faith can be no Object
of ſenſe, as Chriſt's Infinite preſence in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as God; there he may firmly believe, and
worſhip Him upon the credit of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
but ſpeaking of the viſible preſence of
Chriſt, where honour is given on the account of
the divine nature, but he can be known to be
preſent only by his Humanity in this caſe I ſay,</hi>
ſaith he, (and his <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> muſt be of no
leſs authority than that of <hi>Pythagoras) I ſay,
the evidence of ſenſe is neceſsary in ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r to the
true worſhipping of the Perſon of Chriſt.</hi> Here
is indeed an appearance of a diſtinction, but
ſuch an one as quite overthrows his whole
diſcourſe, for if he ſuppoſe (as he doth at
preſent) that the <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48446:160"/>
preſent in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in ſuch a way
that it <hi>cannot be the Object of ſenſe,</hi> he muſt
rank it among his <hi>matters of pure Revelation,</hi>
and ſo not only firmly <hi>believe</hi> it, but alſo
give him <hi>worſhip</hi> ſuitable to his preſence.
When therefore he tells us the queſtion is
concerning the <hi>viſible preſence of Chriſt,</hi> it is
manifeſt he either changes the ſtate of the
<hi>Queſtion,</hi> or retracts what before he ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
granted of his <hi>Inviſible</hi> preſence in
the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> This then is plain was but
to delude the Reader, and not anſwer to the
Queſtion, which was, <hi>Why there is not the
ſame reaſon for worſhipping Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
believing him to be there upon the
credit of a Divine Revelation, as if we ſaw
Him with our eyes.</hi> But to follow him a little
in his wandrings, and ſpeak to the <hi>viſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Chriſt. In caſe he can be known to be
preſent only by his Humanity, Why muſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of ſenſe be neceſsary in order to his
worſhip?</hi> Was he not <hi>ſo</hi> preſent in the
<hi>Womb</hi> of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> after the <hi>Angels</hi> meſſage?
Was he not <hi>ſo</hi> preſent in his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> after
he was intercepted from his Diſciples ſight
by a <hi>Cloud?</hi> Was he not <hi>ſo</hi> preſent, before
he opened the Eyes of the <hi>two blind Men,</hi>
who ſate by the way ſide, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 30.?
And is he not believed by all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be
<hi>ſo</hi> preſent at the <hi>right hand</hi> of his <hi>Father?</hi>
And might none of theſe <hi>worſhip</hi> him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48446:160"/>
they could <hi>not ſee</hi> him? If he pretend
a difference in the caſes, becauſe in all them
he was the <hi>Object of ſenſe</hi> either <hi>before</hi> or
<hi>after:</hi> but <hi>as</hi> he exiſts in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> he
<hi>can be no Object of ſenſe;</hi> he muſt grant his
preſence there to be <hi>a matter of pure Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
and ſo falls upon the other <hi>edge</hi> of his
diſtinction, that <hi>in matters of pure Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where the matter propoſed to our Faith
can be no Object of ſenſe, there firm credit is
to be given to the divine Revelation, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
alſo ſuitable to his preſence.</hi> But to go
one ſtep further, In caſe <hi>a thing</hi> be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by <hi>evidence of ſenſe,</hi> May it not alſo be
made known by <hi>Divine Revelation?</hi> And
will not <hi>God's Revelation</hi> aſcertain us as
well, if not much better, than <hi>our Eyes?</hi>
Who ſaw the <hi>World</hi> riſe out of <hi>nothing?</hi>
No leſs a Philoſopher than <hi>Aristotle</hi> (not
to ſpeak of others) held it never had <hi>any</hi>
beginning. And yet what <hi>Christian</hi> does
not believe it had, more firmly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>God's Revelation,</hi> than if he had
been preſent in ſome corner of the <hi>ſpatium
Imaginarium,</hi> and beheld the foundation of
it with his <hi>Eyes?</hi> Upon the whole then,
which way ſoever the Doctor turn himſelf,
unleſs he will maintain (what he ſeems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> all along in this diſcourſe)
that we are to give <hi>more credit</hi> to our <hi>ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

then to <hi>God's revealed word,</hi> he muſt confeſs

that wherever there is a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s preſence, (which at preſent he
ſuppoſes <hi>in the Sacrament.) there is the ſame,</hi>

him,</hi> than if he <hi>ſaw</hi> him as clearly as the
<hi>Wiſe-men</hi> did in the <hi>Manger,</hi> or the <hi>Thief</hi>

                        </gap>ion for Chriſt's
preſence in the Euchariſt by Tranſubſtantiation,
as for his being true God, yet there would not
be the ſame reaſon to worſhip him there,</hi> as when
he dwelt viſibly among us. All that he
could deviſe to elude the Parallel argument
I urged from the Pen of an <hi>Arrian,</hi> Viz. that
<hi>the Argument he brings to conclude Catholicks
to be Idolaters, for their adoration of Chriſt in
the Euchariſt, would be of as much force from
the Arrians againſt the adoration of him as God:</hi>
All, I ſay, he could deviſe to elude this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
with, ſtanding to the <hi>true ſtate</hi> of
the Queſtion, and <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> (as he does) <hi>a
like divine Revelation for both,</hi> was to ſay
there was not <hi>an expreſs command</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<hi>him</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> which how piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an Evaſion it is, I have ſhewed above.
And yet as pitiful as it is, it may ſerve well
enough to make an unwary Reader believe,
he concludes all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the World <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters</hi>
for worſhipping <hi>our Lord Chriſt</hi>
himſelf <hi>in the Sacrament.</hi> But why it ſhould
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48446:161"/>
do ſo, when nothing leſs than <hi>an expreſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi>
could make them <hi>Idolaters</hi> in the
matter of <hi>Images,</hi> I cannot imagin.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. The Second Proof he brings to
ſhow that, <hi>Suppoſing a like divine Revelation
for Chriſt's being preſent in the Sacrament, as
for his being true God, yet there is not the ſame
reaſon of adoration,</hi> is p. 112. <hi>becauſe the
One,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>gives us a ſufficient reaſon of
our Worſhip,</hi> viz. <hi>his Divinity; but the other
doth not, becauſe all that He</hi> can <hi>believe then
preſent, ſuppoſing Tranſubſtantiation, is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Chriſt, and that is not the Object of our
Adoration.</hi> But this is altogether as <hi>weak</hi>
as the former; for however <hi>that</hi> be all he <hi>can</hi>
believe, and more than he <hi>does</hi> believe, (God
encreaſe his <hi>Faith.)</hi> yet <hi>Catholicks</hi> believe
much more, <hi>viz.</hi> that together with his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> are preſent his <hi>Soul,</hi> his
<hi>Perſon,</hi> his <hi>Divinity,</hi> in a word, <hi>whole Chriſt;</hi> and
to <hi>his Perſon</hi> it is they <hi>terminate</hi> their <hi>worſhip</hi>
as <hi>hypoſtatically</hi> united with his <hi>Body.</hi> For
as the <hi>Dr.</hi> himſelf ſaith very well (p. 114.)
<hi>although the humane nature of Chriſt, of it ſelf
can yield us no ſufficient reaſon of adoration,
yet being conſidered as united to the Divine
Nature, that cannot hinder the ſame Divine
Worſhip being given to his Perſon, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to his Divine Nature, any more than the
Robes of a Prince, can take off from the honour
due unto him.</hi> To elude this Anſwer (for
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48446:162"/>
now his chiefeſt hope conſiſts in ſeeking out
ways to <hi>eſcape)</hi> inſtead of rejoining to it,
upon the ſuppoſition of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi>
he falls to diſpute down-right againſt <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi>
it ſelf, where he tells the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that this Anſwer of <hi>Chriſt's Body being
hypostatically united with the Divine Nature, is
indeed a good argument to prove the Body of
Chriſt cannot be there by Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
And I deſire the Reader to be very attentive
to the argument as it is propos'd by the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor;</hi>
for otherwiſe perhaps it may coſt him
the labour of a ſecond reading. <hi>If the
Bread,</hi> ſaith he, p. 113. <hi>be converted into
that Body of Chriſt, which is hypoſtatically u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
with the Divine Nature, then the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
is not meerly into the Body, but into
the Perſon of Christ, and then Chriſt hath as
many Bodies hypoſtatically united to him, as
there are Elements conſecrated: and ſo all the
accidents of the Bread belong to that Body of
Christ which is hypostatically united with the
Divine Nature. Therefore the Body of Chriſt
cannot be in the Sacrament by Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
This is his argument, which he calls a
<hi>Good One.</hi> I am ſure I may call it a <hi>ſublime
One,</hi> and <hi>ſo ſublime,</hi> that there wants only an
Adverſary of the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
with <hi>Mr. J. S.'s</hi> to
ſet it out for a notable
piece of new <hi>Mystical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi>

                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:48446:162"/>
For <hi>I do verily believe that neither
Harphius nor Rusbrochius, nor the profound
Mother Juliana have any thing in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
ſo ſeemingly un intelligible,</hi> and <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory,</hi>
as this diſcourſe of the Doctor's
is <hi>really</hi> ſuch. For (beſide the hard words
of <hi>hypoſtatical union, conſecrated Elements,
Converſion into the Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. which
quite put down Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi>'s vulgar ones of
<hi>Potentiality, Actuality, Actuation, ſupervene
ſubſume,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Firſt,</hi> He will have it to be
the <hi>ſame Body,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>that Body which
is hypostatically united with the divine nature.</hi>
Then he will have it <hi>not</hi> to be the <hi>ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
becauſe <hi>Chriſt would have as many Bodies,
as there are Elements conſecrated.</hi> And then
again it muſt be the <hi>ſame Body,</hi> becauſe <hi>all
the Accidents of Bread belong to that Body,
which is hypoſtatically united with the Divine
Nature.</hi> But this way of refining a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
into <hi>Myſtical Divinity</hi> is proper only
to confute <hi>demonſtrations;</hi> and the argument
I have to deal with is ſo far from that, that
it carries not the ſhow of a <hi>Probability.</hi> For
if the <hi>Bread</hi> be converted into <hi>that Body</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> which is <hi>hypoſtatically</hi> united with the
<hi>divine nature,</hi> and not meerly into <hi>that,</hi> but
into the <hi>Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> does it follow that
<hi>he hath as many Bodies hypoſtatically united to
him as there are Elements conſecrated?</hi> No
more, than becauſe the <hi>Bread,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48446:163"/>
                     <hi>Fiſh</hi> which he eat upon Earth, were <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
into the <hi>ſubstance</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically</hi>
united to him, it follows, that he
had <hi>as many bodies hypoſtatically</hi> united to
him, as there were <hi>ſeveral meats</hi> eaten by
him. Before <hi>Digeſtion</hi> or <hi>Converſion</hi> they
were diſtinct; by <hi>Converſion</hi> they were made
the <hi>ſame body.</hi> But if this will not ſerve the
turn, he wants not a <hi>falſe ſuppoſition,</hi> to blind
his Reader with, <hi>Viz.</hi> that <hi>we make the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
i.e.</hi> the Accidents of Bread, <hi>(for we

my Adverſary will now undertake
<hi>p. ii4.</hi> to prove yet further, that <hi>upon the

be aſsured, that he doth not commit Idolatry

of the diſparity between the worſhip gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Perſon of Christ, and that which

to this <hi>he muſt</hi> needs <hi>miſtake,</hi> or rather <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi>
the Controverſy, which he does in

<hi>Preambles</hi> for three whole Pages together,
no more to the purpoſe, than the <hi>Flouriſhes</hi>
of a great <hi>Text-letter</hi> are to the force of a

<hi>ſtate of the Controverſy between us, is, whether
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48446:164"/>
proper divine worſhip may be given to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
(i. e. the <hi>Accidents)</hi> on account of

(whatever <hi>Divines</hi> diſpute concerning the

the Object of Catholicks A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi>
(as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly

(What is repreſented to them in their mind,

is the only true and Eternal God hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
joined with his Holy Humanity:</hi> And
conſequently the Queſtion between us, is,
<hi>Whether ſuppoſing our Lord Chriſt to be really
preſent under the Sacramental ſigns, the ſame
proper divine worſhip be not to be given to him
there which is due to his Perſon, wherever it is
preſent by hypoſtatical union with his ſacred
Humanity?</hi> Let the Doctor do thus, and we
have no quarrel with him; which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ſign, that the Queſtion between us, is
not, as he ſays; whether the ſame Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ought to be given to the <hi>Accidents,</hi> which
we would give to the very Perſon of <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
But what may not be venture to ſay, who

a calumny,</hi> as that it is our <hi>common anſwer</hi>
in this matter, to excuſe our ſelves from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
that <hi>we believe the Bread to be God?</hi>
I told the Reader what he was like to find
neer the bottom of the <hi>Sack,</hi> when he met
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48446:164"/>
with ſuch ſophiſtical Ware at the very top.
But the Doctor pretends he hath ſomething
to ſay here in his defence; and it is this,
that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi>
hath expreſly determin'd
that <hi>there is no manner of
doubt left,</hi>

                     <hi>but that all Christians ought to give
the ſame worſhip to this Holy Sacrament, which
they give to God himſelf. For it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leſs to be worſhipped, becauſe it was Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by Chriſt our Lord, that it might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
But who tells him that the <hi>Council</hi>
here by the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> means only the
<hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>Bread?</hi> Why may it
not mean <hi>the Holy Victime which is diſpenſed
from the Altar,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did, when he
ſaid that his Mother St. <hi>Monica had tied her
Soul faſt to this Sacrament by the bond of
Faith?</hi> If the <hi>Council</hi> may be allowed to
explicate its own meaning, we ſhall find the
<hi>ſenſe</hi> of the word to be, the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and with it <hi>his Divinity,</hi> under the <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
Veil: for, the reaſon it gives in the
words immediately following, (which the
Doctor conveniently leaves out) of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration,
is, <hi>becauſe we believe the ſame God
to be preſent in it, of whom the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaid, Let all the Angels of God adore him.</hi>
And this is yet more plain from the <hi>6th.

thoſe, <hi>who ſhall ſay, that in the moſt

H. Sacrament of the Euchariſt, the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of God is not to be adored with the worſhip
of Latria.</hi> But let the <hi>Council</hi> ſay what it
will, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſays, that <hi>by the Sacrament it
must underſtand the Elements or Accidents, as
the Immediate term of that divine worſhip, or
elſe the latter words,</hi> [that the Sacrament
ought not leſs to be adored, becauſe it was

And why ſo? Do <hi>Catholicks</hi> underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Or was nothing <hi>inſtituted</hi> to be <hi>taken,</hi> but the

are to be adored with the worſhip of Latria,
but only to be reverenced with a certain inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
worſhip, which is due to all Sacraments.
What we affirm is, that Christ is properly and
per ſe to be adored with the worſhip of Latria,
and that this adoration belongs alſo to the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols
of Bread and Wine, under which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
as they are apprehended united with him,
in ſuch manner as thoſe who adored him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parl'd

<hi>as to require him to put off his cloths,
before they adored him, nor yet to ſeparate him

but worſhipped him abſolutely, as then he was.</hi>
And then a little after, <hi>whatever difference,</hi>

the Controverſy between us, concerning the
adoration of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> to be,
<hi>whether the Accidents be to be adored with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Divine Worſhip which is due to God alone?</hi>
is juſt as if a <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhould make the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48446:166"/>
between <hi>him</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the worſhip of the <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>Robes</hi> to
be, whether the <hi>Robes</hi> are to be worſhipped
with the ſame Regal worſhip which is due
only to the <hi>King's Perſon?</hi> The ſubtilty,
(ſuch as it is) is Parallel in both: Only the
Doctor hath the fortune to be <hi>applauded</hi> for
what the poor <hi>Quaker</hi> would be laughed at,
and hiſs'd out of the Court.</p>
                  <p>I cannot doubt but the Doctor (who is
ſo well vers'd in <hi>Bell.</hi> as his <hi>Objections</hi> ſhow)
had read theſe paſſages in him, when he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins,
that <hi>Catholicks</hi> to <hi>anſwer</hi> their <hi>adverſaries</hi>
arguments, <hi>would ſeem to direct their worſhip
only to Chriſt, as under the Elements or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;</hi>
a pretty <hi>ſelf-conviction,</hi> if well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
for who ſhould we believe for the
Doctrin and practiſe of <hi>Catholicks</hi> but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
But what he adds, <hi>that they yield,
that on the account of this corporal preſence,
that which appears ought to have the ſame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
given to it with that which is ſuppoſed or
believed,</hi> is ſufficiently convinced by what
hath been cited out of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> in that <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
ſenſe</hi> in which the Doctor charges it
upon us, to be a <hi>meer calumny,</hi> (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
calls it) for although he affirm, that when
<hi>Christ</hi> is worſhipped under the <hi>Symbols,</hi> that
<hi>adoration</hi> belongs alſo to the <hi>Symbols,</hi> yet he
ſays it is, <hi>in ſuch manner, as the adoration gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him upon Earth in his apparel belonged
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48446:166"/>
to his Garments;</hi> which he qualifies with a
<hi>quodammodo, after a certain manner;</hi> that is
to ſay, <hi>not as it is given to Chriſt himſelf,</hi> but
in an <hi>inferiour</hi> manner, as hath been above
declared, <hi>Part 1. chap. 10. p.</hi> 190.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. After all this turning and winding
to miſ-repreſent the ſtate of the Controverſy
to be, <hi>whether on the account of Chriſt's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
preſence in the Sacrament, that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears</hi>
(viz. the accidents of bread) <hi>ought to
have the ſame worſhip given to it with that
which is ſuppoſed or believed,</hi> that is, with
Chriſt himſelf; He comes at length to ſhow,
<hi>that upon the Principles of the Roman Church
no Man can be aſſured, that he doth not commit
Idolatry every time he gives adoration to the
Hoſt.</hi> To prove this, he makes uſe of a
double <hi>Medium.</hi> The firſt, <hi>That no Man can
be ſecure that the Object is ſuch as doth deſerve
divine worſhip.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>That no Man
can be ſatisfied, that he hath a ſufficient reaſon
for giving this worſhip to the Hoſt.</hi> And they
are both of them impertinent to the preſent
purpoſe, and quite overthrow his ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for proceeding upon the <hi>Principles</hi> of
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and ſuppoſing (as he doth
at preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt) <hi>a divine Revelation for the preſence
of Chriſt true God and Man in the Saccrament,</hi>
he muſt either deny <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf to be <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
or he muſt grant, that the <hi>Object doth
deſerve Divine Worſhip, and that there is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48446:167"/>
reaſon to give it.</hi> He that is too Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
in giving away, what in time he may
need himſelf, caſts himſelf upon a neceſſity
either of <hi>begging</hi> what he gave, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>Error</hi> in the <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Gift.</hi> And to
theſe ſtraits hath the Doctor brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
by his over-liberality in <hi>ſuppoſing a like
divine Revelation for Christ's preſence in the
Sacrament, as for his being true God.</hi> His
<hi>honour</hi> will not permit him to <hi>begg,</hi> what
he ſo freely granted; and therefore he takes
the other courſe of pretending a <hi>double flaw</hi>
in the <hi>donation:</hi> and although his pretences
be excluded by the very <hi>evidence</hi> of the <hi>deed,</hi>
as it ſtands upon Record in his own Book,
<hi>p.</hi> 111. yet I ſhall give them the hearing,
and ſhow them to have nothing at all of
<hi>proof</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>1. He ſaith, <hi>p. 120. No Man can be ſecure, that
the Object is ſuch as doth deſerve divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi>
If you ask him why? He tells you, <hi>the
Maſs-Bell now rings,</hi> the Hoſt is to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>and if he ſhould chance to believe his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
or harken to his reaſon, he becomes an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later
by not being a Fool or a Mad-man.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if he conſider the miraculouſneſs of
the <hi>change; it is ſo ſtrange and ſudden, he
can hardly ſay that God becoming Man was ſo
great a wonder, as a little piece of Bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
God.</hi> If he be recall'd from <hi>carnal
Reaſon to the Words of Chriſt, this is my body,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48446:167"/>
he is told that Scripture is very obſcure, and
dangerous for any one to be too confident of the
ſenſe of it;</hi> If he be ſent for the meaning of
it to the <hi>unanimous conſent of the Fathers;
he ſees the World is as full of diſputes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſenſe of their words, as of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Laſtly,</hi> If he be <hi>counſel'd</hi> to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
his <hi>ſcruples,</hi> and ſubmit <hi>to the authority
of the preſent Church, he finds that Catholicks
are not agreed about that neither:</hi> Some think
it enough, that it is <hi>defined</hi> by the <hi>Pope;</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
require the concurrence of a <hi>General
Council,</hi> and that it be confirmed <hi>wholly</hi>
by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and doth proceed in the <hi>way of
a Council. So that he ſees he may ſpend all
his life in the ſtudy and ſearch of theſe things,
and yet never be ſatisfied in them,</hi> nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in Tranſubſtantiation it ſelf, which
is now the Point he pretends <hi>he is not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in:</hi> wherefore if <hi>this be the only way of
ſatisfaction, he muſt forbear giving adoration,
or be guilty of Idolatry in doing it.</hi> And doth
he not manifeſtly prove himſelf here to be
in the caſe of the <hi>Prodigal</hi> I lately mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when <hi>ſuppoſing a like divine Revelation of
the preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, as of
his being true God,</hi> he now ſpends no leſs
than four whole Pages to prove <hi>that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſatisfied there is any ſuch Revelation?</hi>
Let <hi>Schollars</hi> judge of this <hi>illiberal</hi> manner

with particular Reflexions upon the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

difficulties he ſtarts concerning the <hi>evidence</hi>

the <hi>obſcurity</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>conſent</hi> of the
<hi>Fathers,</hi> which have been anſwered over and
over by <hi>Catholick</hi> Writers,) to free my ſelf
from all ſcruples in the caſe, <hi>I take the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the preſent Church to be ſufficient for
me.</hi> For however ſome <hi>Divines</hi> think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that it be <hi>defined</hi> by the <hi>Pope</hi> who is
<hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Others require the
<hi>concurrence</hi> of a <hi>General Council;</hi> and that
this <hi>General Council</hi> be <hi>wholly confirmed by
the Pope, and doth proceed in the way of a
Council:</hi> Yet I am ſure that none of theſe
are wanting in the point of <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
For it hath been <hi>defined</hi> long ago both
by <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> and received as <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
defined</hi> by the whole <hi>Church Catholick,</hi>
that <hi>our Lord Chriſt</hi> is truly and really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> by the <hi>converſion</hi> of the
<hi>Elements</hi> into his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(for any thing the Doctor hath ſaid in
this matter) I may <hi>ſecurely</hi> give the ſame
<hi>proper divine worſhip</hi> to <hi>him there,</hi> which is
due to his <hi>Perſon,</hi> without fear of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3. But becauſe the Doctor profeſſes
that the <hi>end</hi> why he took this way, was <hi>a
hope he had, that it would abundantly add to the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48446:168"/>
diſcovering the diſparity between the worſhip
given to the Perſon of Chriſt, and that which is
given to the Euchariſt upon ſuppoſition of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi>
I ſhall in the next Place
ſhow, how he hath failed of this <hi>End;</hi> and
there will need no more to do it, but to
ſuppoſe a <hi>Socinian</hi> to take up his own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and retort it upon him in the point of
the <hi>worſhip</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>God.</hi> And if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
not my Anſwer for good, it will be
expected from him to give a better. Behold
then a <hi>Socinian</hi> propoſing the argument in
Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s own <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi> The <hi>chimes</hi>
now ring all in to <hi>Church,</hi> where I muſt give
the ſame <hi>divine worſhip</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> as to the
<hi>Eternal Father.</hi> But ſtay (ſaith the <hi>Socinian)</hi>
how can I be ſecure, that <hi>the Object is ſuch
as deſerves divine worſhip? If I ſhould chance
to believe my ſenſes, and hearken to my reaſon,</hi>
which can diſcover nothing in him, but his
<hi>Humanity; I become an Idolater by not being a
Fool, or a Mad man.</hi> Again, if I conſider
the <hi>miraculous union</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Nature in one <hi>Perſon;</hi> it ſeems <hi>more
ſtrange</hi> to me, that <hi>Man</hi> ſhould be <hi>God,</hi> than,
what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, that <hi>Bread</hi> ſhould be
<hi>converted</hi> into his <hi>Body. Muſt I rely on the
bare words of Chriſt, I and the Father are
One;</hi> but I am told by no leſs a Man than
St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> that there are <hi>certain
things in Scripture hard to be
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48446:169"/>
underſtood, which the unlearned and unſtable
deprave to their own perdition,</hi> and therefore
it muſt needs be <hi>dangerous for me to be too
confident of the ſenſe of it,</hi> in ſo difficult a
point. I have heard there have been great
diſputes concerning the meaning of <hi>thoſe
words</hi> among the <hi>Primitive Christians;</hi> And
<hi>What a caſe am I in then, if thoſe words do not
prove it?</hi> Muſt I have recourſe for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of them to the <hi>unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Fathers? Alas, what relief is this
to my anxious mind! For I ſee the World is
full of diſputes concerning the ſenſe of their
words, as well as the Scriptures.</hi> And I have
heard of a late Author, one <hi>Christophorus
Sandius,</hi> who in a Set-Treatiſe contends
that the greateſt part of thoſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> who
are eſteemed <hi>Orthodox,</hi> deny the <hi>Son</hi> to be
<hi>conſubſtantially</hi> One with the <hi>Father. In this
great confuſion, what ground of certainty have
I to ſtand upon, whereby to ſecure my mind
from the Commiſſion of a great ſin? While I
am in this Labyrinth, behold a kind Catholick
offers to give me caſe, and tells me theſe are
doubts and ſcruples, I ought not to trouble my
ſelf about: The Authority of the preſent Church
is ſufficient for me. But how ſhall I know what
he means by the Authority of the preſent Church.
For I find Catholicks themſelves are not agreed
about that neither. May I be ſure, if the
Pope, who is Head of the Church ſay it? No,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48446:169"/>
not unleſs he defines it? But may I be ſure
then? No, not unleſs a General Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur.
But may I be ſure if a General Council
determins it? Yes, if it be confirmed wholly
by the Pope, and doth proceed in the way of a
Council: But how is it poſſible for me to judge
of that, when the intrigues of actions are ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret:
I ſee then, if this,</hi> or any of theſe, <hi>be
the only way of ſatisfaction, I muſt forbear gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſame adoration to Chriſt, as to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or be guilty of Idolatry in doing it.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
here the Doctor's argument return'd
upon himſelf; and if it have any <hi>force</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the adoration of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi>
it muſt have the <hi>ſame</hi> againſt the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of <hi>Him</hi> as <hi>God.</hi> And what a caſe is
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in, if it depend upon his <hi>ſolving</hi>
his own <hi>Argument?</hi> But his <hi>ſcruples</hi> are not
yet at an <hi>End.</hi>

the <hi>Prieſt</hi>'s Intention, or
rather <hi>not Intention</hi> to Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate;
and I confeſs I never met with any
Man ſo <hi>unevenly ſcrupulous,</hi> as he is; that is,
ſo <hi>reſolute</hi> in ſome caſes, <hi>(were he of our mind)</hi>
as <hi>in ſaying his Prayers to the Sun,</hi> and <hi>offering
up the Host to an Image:</hi> and yet ſo <hi>timorous</hi>
in others, as in this of not daring to <hi>adore
Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>(were he of our mind in the
Point of Tranſubstantiation)</hi> as ſuppoſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for fear the <hi>Hoſt</hi> ſhould
not be conſecrated through <hi>defect</hi> or <hi>malice</hi>
of the <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Suppoſe, ſaith he, (p. 123.)
<hi>I am ſatisfied in the Point of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
(by which you ſee he ſet himſelf to
fight againſt it at the ſame time that he told
us he would ſuppoſe it) <hi>it is not enough for
me to know in general, that there is ſuch a
change, but I muſt believe particularly that very
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48446:170"/>
Bread to be changed ſo, which I am to worſhip,
And by what means can I be ſure of that?</hi> It
is a very <hi>evil</hi> thing to be troubled with too
many <hi>ſcruples:</hi> While the <hi>mind</hi> is perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>them,</hi> the <hi>tongue</hi> runs unawares into
<hi>Contradictions.</hi> What is it elſe to ſay, that
<hi>he is to worſhip that very Bread which he muſt
believe to be changed?</hi> What <hi>common ſenſe</hi>
will charge him to honour <hi>that,</hi> which he
muſt believe <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>there?</hi> This hath a
reliſh of the old Leaven, that <hi>Catholicks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Bread to be God:</hi> And I ſee a <hi>cuſtome</hi>
of any thing, though it be <hi>ſelf-contradiction</hi>
will turn by degrees into a <hi>ſecond nature.</hi>
But to let this paſs, and attend to his ſcruple.
Here he would ſeem to return again to his
former ſuppoſition of a <hi>like divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Chriſt's Preſence in the Euchariſt by
Tranſubstantiation, as for his being true God:</hi>
but in reality he does but ſeem to do it.
For, from his whole diſcourſe, (p. 111. &amp;c.)
where he ſuppoſes the ſame divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Tranſubſtantiation, as for <hi>Chriſt's
Divinity,</hi> it is evident he ſpeaks not only of
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> but alſo in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi>
What means elſe his firſt Proof,
(p. 111.) that <hi>there is a plain command in
Scripture for adoring Chriſt himſelf, but not
the least intimation given that we are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
Him in the Elements, ſuppoſing Him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
there.</hi> And again, what means his <hi>2d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:48446:171"/>
Proof, (p. 112.) that <hi>the one gives us a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reaſon of our worſhip,</hi> viz. <hi>that he is the
Eternal Son of God; but the other doth not,
ſuppoſing the Bread to be really converted into
the Body of Chriſt?</hi> Who ſees not here that
the ſuppoſition is of the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>undoubted</hi>
preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the change of the Bread
into his Body? and that he does but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to <hi>take back</hi> by <hi>parcels,</hi> what he unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
gave away in the <hi>lump,</hi> when he raiſes
doubts and ſcruples about the certainty of
the change of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that particular Bread?</hi>
But let him <hi>contradict</hi> himſelf never ſo much,
it makes nothing for us. <hi>We muſt be guilty of
Idolatry every time we hear Maſs,</hi> unleſs we
can be <hi>ſure</hi> that there is a <hi>change</hi> made of
the <hi>bread</hi> into the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in that <hi>very
particular Hoſt,</hi> which is to be <hi>worſhipped.
And by what means can we be ſure of that?</hi>
For, <hi>the Church,</hi> ſaith he, (p. 124.) <hi>having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that it is neceſsary, that he that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
be a Prieſt, and that he have an intention
of conſecrating; if either the Conſecrator ſhould
chance to be no Priest, becauſe not rightly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
(which is no unheard of thing) or not
have an intention to conſecrate, they who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Hoſt, must be guilty of Idolatry every
time he celebrates.</hi> This is the mighty <hi>ſcruple</hi>
which torments his mind, and although the
abſurdneſs of the <hi>Aſsertion,</hi> that <hi>another</hi> Man's
<hi>defect</hi> or <hi>wickedneſs</hi> ſhould make me incur
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48446:171"/>
the crime of <hi>Idolatry</hi> whether I will or no,
might ſuffice to make any reaſonable Man to
depoſe ſo chimaerical a ſcruple, yet becauſe
he will not or cannot do it, I would ask him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what kind of certainty it is he would have?
If no leſs than <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>evidence</hi>
of <hi>ſenſe</hi> will ſerve his turn, I would ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
what like <hi>certainty</hi> hath a Child or a
Husband that <hi>thoſe</hi> Perſons whom <hi>they</hi> take,
the <hi>one</hi> for his <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> for his <hi>Wife</hi>
are ſo in very deed? I cannot believe him
ſo <hi>rigid</hi> a <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> as neither to permit a <hi>child</hi>
to do his duty to his Mother's Husband, till
he have a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> that he is his
<hi>true Father;</hi> nor a <hi>Husband</hi> to pay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
debt, unleſs he firſt have as much <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
as <hi>ſenſe</hi> can give him, that <hi>Lia</hi> is not
put in the place of <hi>Rachel:</hi> and when that is
done, perhaps a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> may be
neceſſary to know whether ſhe be <hi>not marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
before to <hi>another</hi> Man; for <hi>this</hi> alſo is <hi>no
unheard of thing.</hi> Who might not ſay here,
as the <hi>Diſciples</hi> did on another occaſion,
Matth. 19. 10. <hi>If the caſe of a Man with his
Wife be ſo, it is not expedient to marry?</hi> But
as I ſaid before, I cannot believe the <hi>Doctor</hi>
will be ſo <hi>rigid</hi> in this Point. But why then
muſt <hi>we</hi> be tyed up from giving worſhip to
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> as preſent in <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that particular
Hoſt,</hi> unleſs we be certain either by <hi>evidence</hi>
of <hi>ſenſe</hi> or by <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> that it is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48446:172"/>
                     <hi>truly conſecrated?</hi> If the want of <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
ought to make us ſuſpend our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
I am ſure the want of the like for <hi>true
diſpoſition,</hi> ought to make the <hi>Communicant</hi>
forbear <hi>receiving.</hi> But if he ſpeak of <hi>ſuch
a certainty,</hi> as is uſually found in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<hi>humane Actions,</hi> and others of the like
nature; why may not <hi>this</hi> ſuffice as well to
ſecure <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from ſinning in their <hi>adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as thoſe <hi>other</hi> Perſons in paying their
<hi>reſpective duties?</hi> Doth it happen oftner that
a <hi>Perſon</hi> ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> is no <hi>Priest,
(becauſe not rightly baptized,)</hi> than that a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Father</hi> is not the <hi>Man?</hi>
Or doth it happen oftner, that a <hi>Prieſt cheats</hi>
the People by having <hi>no intention</hi> to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate,
than that a light Houſ-wife <hi>wheadles</hi> a

Why then muſt <hi>we</hi> be more guilty of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
(though the <hi>Hoſt</hi> through <hi>defect,</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi>

their own <hi>good Intentions</hi> abus'd by the

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48446:172"/>
believes to be his <hi>Father;</hi> And the <hi>wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of a <hi>Prieſt</hi> (as there was one <hi>Judas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Twelve)</hi> may make him a <hi>Devil:</hi>
but that cannot make me an <hi>Idolater.</hi> For
whilſt my <hi>Adoration</hi> is directed <hi>not</hi> to the
<hi>Bread,</hi> which I ſuppoſe <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>there,</hi> but
to the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> true <hi>God,</hi> whom
I firmly believe to be in every <hi>Host duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated,</hi>
and have not the leaſt reaſonable
cauſe to ſuſpect other at preſent, the <hi>Action</hi>
on my part hath all that is requiſite to make
it <hi>good</hi> and <hi>lawful;</hi> and is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> that it is a <hi>real honouring</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and will be ſo accepted. When <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeſtion</hi>
was honoured by a miſtake for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
that great <hi>Prince</hi> was ſo far from
condemning the Perſon as a <hi>Traytor,</hi> that he
took the <hi>honour</hi> as done to himſelf. And in
caſe thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were ſo deſirous to
<hi>ſee</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Jo. 12. 21. had either for
want of a Guide to direct them to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
or by the treacherous malice of a <hi>Judas</hi>
proſtrated themſelves at the <hi>Feet</hi> of ſome
<hi>other:</hi> what reaſonable Man would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them for Idolaters? And yet we
poor unfortunate <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> if it
ſhould chance at any time to happen, that
either the <hi>Prieſt</hi> be <hi>no</hi> true one, or <hi>have no
intention to conſecrate,</hi> though <hi>our Intentions</hi>
be never ſo ſincere to adore only our <hi>Lord
Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt ſtand condemned of <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48446:173"/>
Idolatry,</hi> for ſo the Doctor calls it
(p. 124.) and that without any Proof at all,
but the old <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> that <hi>without the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Prieſt in conſecrating, it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 2. The ſecond <hi>Medium</hi> he takes (p. 125)
to prove that <hi>upon the Principles of the Roman
Church no Man can be aſſured, that he doth not
commit Idolatry every time he gives adoration
to the Hoſt,</hi> is, <hi>that no Man can be ſatisfied that
he hath ſufficient reaſon for giving this worſhip
to it.</hi> And the ſubſtance of the reaſon he
gives, is, becauſe <hi>if I worſhip Chriſt,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>in the Sacrament, it is upon account of his
corporal preſence, and he finds it generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
by the Doctors of the Roman Church, that
the humane Nature of Chriſt conſidered alone,
ought not to have divine honour given to it;
and hotly diſputed among them, whether Chriſt's
humane nature, though united to the divine,
ought abstractedly conſidered, to have any true
divine honour given it.</hi> And what will he
infer from hence? That therefore he cannot
be ſatisfied, that he hath ſufficient reaſon
for giving true <hi>divine</hi> honour to the <hi>humane
nature</hi> of <hi>Chriſt conſidered alone, or abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
in the Sacrament?</hi> Much good may it
do him. But what is this to the purpoſe?
Do <hi>Catholicks</hi> adore the <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>Christ
alone,</hi> or <hi>abstractedly</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> Do
they <hi>ſeparate,</hi> or <hi>abſtract</hi> in their minds and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48446:173"/>
thoughts his <hi>Body</hi> from his <hi>Perſon,</hi> when
they <hi>adore</hi> him there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No more than the
<hi>Wiſe-men</hi> did, when they <hi>adored</hi> him in the
<hi>Manger,</hi> or the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when they <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
him after his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> Or, than he
is <hi>adored</hi> now at the <hi>right hand</hi> of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
All thoſe <hi>Preciſions</hi> and <hi>Conſiderations</hi>
the Doctor ſpeaks of, are only in the Heads
of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> when they are <hi>diſputing,</hi>
not in the minds of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when they
are <hi>adoring.</hi> The <hi>Object</hi> they <hi>adore,</hi> whether
in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or out of it, is the only-begotten
<hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> made <hi>Man,</hi> without <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating</hi>
or <hi>abſtracting</hi> one <hi>nature</hi> from <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
any more than we do the <hi>King's Body</hi>
from his <hi>Soul,</hi> when we worſhip him. And
as Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> very
well obſerves,<note place="margin">Epil. 3. part. p. 350.</note> 
                     <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
propoſeth not to
himſelf the conſideration of the Body and Blood
of Chriſt, as it is of it ſelf, and in it ſelf a
meer Creature (which he that doth not on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
cannot do) cannot but conceive it, as he
believes it to be, being a Chriſtian:</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the <hi>primary reaſon</hi> of his <hi>adoration,</hi>
is the <hi>divinity</hi> there preſent. I, but ſays the
Doctor, <hi>when I worſhip Chriſt as in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I muſt worſhip him there upon the account
of his bodily preſence, for I have no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to worſhip him in the Sacrament, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Body is preſent in it.</hi> And what may
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48446:174"/>
this mean? Have the <hi>Niceties</hi> and <hi>Preciſions</hi>
of the <hi>Schools</hi> ſo perplex'd his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he hath loſt the very <hi>firſt Notions</hi>
of <hi>Chriſtianity?</hi> Is it not <hi>Christ's Body?</hi>
Are they not the very words of <hi>Chriſt, This
is my Body?</hi> And is not <hi>Chriſt true God?</hi>
How comes it to paſs then that he hath <hi>no
other reaſon</hi> to <hi>worſhip</hi> him in the <hi>Sacrament,
but becauſe his Body is preſent in it?</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is the reaſon why his <hi>Divinity,</hi> as <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically</hi>
united to his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>
in the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> but the <hi>reaſon</hi> of his
being <hi>adored</hi> there is his <hi>Divinity,</hi> and not his
<hi>Body.</hi> Philoſophy tells us, that it is <hi>one</hi>
thing that makes a Man to be in a <hi>place,</hi> and
<hi>another,</hi> that makes him to be <hi>worſhipped</hi> in
that place: and yet he would not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
<hi>there</hi> for this <hi>latter,</hi> unleſs he were
preſent by vertue of the <hi>former.</hi> The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
may not ſeem ſo clear to ſuch as
are not vers'd in the <hi>Schools;</hi> but an example
will make it plain. There is a <hi>Preacher</hi> in
the World much <hi>admired</hi> and <hi>honoured</hi> by
his <hi>Party</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> That which makes
him to be <hi>preſent there,</hi> (or is the <hi>reaſon</hi> of
his <hi>preſence</hi> there,) is his <hi>Quantity</hi> or <hi>Bodily
Dimenſions;</hi> but what he is <hi>admired</hi> for and
<hi>honoured,</hi> is his <hi>Wit,</hi> his <hi>Eloquence,</hi> his <hi>Zeal</hi>
againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
for which I hear he is applauded, and I
eaſily believe it. But if <hi>my Adverſaries</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48446:174"/>
be good (whom I take to have as
<hi>much Eloquence,</hi> and to be of <hi>as</hi> ſubtil a <hi>wit,</hi>
and of as flaming a <hi>Zeal</hi> as the other) I
muſt tell his Admirers they are in a very
great Errour, as to the <hi>reaſon</hi> of their <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi>
and I doubt not but to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon his own Principles. For I find it
<hi>generally agreed</hi> by all the <hi>old Philoſophers,</hi>
and by the <hi>Doctors</hi> alſo at preſent of <hi>both U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities,</hi>
that <hi>Quantity,</hi> or <hi>corporal dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
conſidered <hi>alone,</hi> ought not to have <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
worſhip</hi> given to it: and I find it very
uncertain, whether the <hi>Body</hi> it ſelf though
<hi>united</hi> to the <hi>Soul,</hi> ought, <hi>abſtractedly</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
to have any <hi>true civil honour</hi> given it.
But I am <hi>moſt certain</hi> that the <hi>only reaſon</hi> why
he is <hi>preſent</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> is his <hi>Quantity</hi> or
<hi>Bodily dimenſions;</hi> Therefore if they will <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
or <hi>admire</hi> him in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> it muſt be
upon the account of his <hi>bodily preſence,</hi> or
<hi>corporal dimenſions;</hi> and not for thoſe other
great <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> for which they have
hitherto <hi>admired</hi> him in that place; for if
they conſider well, they <hi>have no other reaſon
to honour him, as in the Pulpit, but becauſe his
Body is preſent in it.</hi> And I am of Opinion,
that if any thing can cure them of their <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
it will be the Parallel Argument, he
brings againſt the worſhip of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the
<hi>Sacrament.</hi> Viz. that becauſe worſhip muſt
be given him there upon the account of his
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48446:175"/>
                     <hi>bodily preſence,</hi> as the <hi>condition</hi> why his <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>
as <hi>united</hi> with his <hi>humane Nature</hi> is
<hi>there</hi> preſent; Therefore his <hi>Bodily Preſence</hi>
and <hi>not</hi> his <hi>Divinity</hi> united to it, muſt be
the <hi>reaſon</hi> of <hi>adoration.</hi> As for what he adds,
(p. 127.) <hi>That ſuppoſing Tranſubstantiation
his Divinity ſhould be there in a particular
manner preſent to no End;</hi> I ſuppoſe he
means by that <hi>particular manner,</hi> the <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical
union</hi> with his <hi>humane nature</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is: And doth it not well become a
<hi>Maſter</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to affirm that <hi>ſuch a preſence</hi>
of the <hi>Divinity</hi> would be to no end, when
and where himſelf ſuppoſes the <hi>Body</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>really</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> preſent?
There wants but one ſtep more, to deny that
the <hi>hypostatical union</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi>
to the <hi>Humane</hi> was neceſſary at all, either for
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s offering himſelf upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or
<hi>now</hi> at the <hi>right hand</hi> of his <hi>Father;</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of offering him upon
the <hi>Altar</hi> be performed by the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> yet
<hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is there alſo both <hi>Offerer</hi> and
<hi>Oblation, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Victim,</hi> as the <hi>Fathers</hi>
teach. [S. <hi>Greg. Niſſ. Orat. 1. de Reſurr.</hi>
S. <hi>Ambr.</hi> in <hi>Pſ. 31. 1. Chryſoſt. Ho.</hi> 24. in 1. <hi>ad
Cor.]</hi> Well, but the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt makes
not the leaſt manifeſtation of it ſelf in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
to our carnal ſenſes; And muſt
this hinder us from giving him the <hi>worſhip</hi>
due to his <hi>Perſon?</hi> Is it not enough that we
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48446:175"/>
know <hi>Him</hi> to be there by <hi>divine Revelation,</hi>
as the Doctor at preſent <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> we do?
What other <hi>manifeſtation</hi> had the <hi>Divinity</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> made of it ſelf to the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> when
before the appearing of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to Baptize him? An evident ſign that
he <hi>reverenc'd him</hi> as the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> Matth.
3. 13, 14. Did not our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, when
St. <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed him to be <hi>Chriſt the Son of
the living God,</hi> declare that <hi>Fleſh and Blood
had not revealed this to him, but his Father
which is in Heaven?</hi> And upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
pronounce Him <hi>Bleſſed? Matt.</hi> 16. 17.
But it ſeems the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is now <hi>revers'd,</hi> and
inſtead of <hi>Bleſsed are they that have not ſeen,
and yet have believed,</hi> Jo. 20. 29. We muſt
now ſay, <hi>Bleſſed are they who will not believe
unleſs they ſee,</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> p. 561. <hi>n.</hi> 5. And what
will the end of this be, but the baniſhing
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> out of the World?</p>
                  <p>§. 3. <hi>After all theſe endeavours to wreſt
out of our hands the</hi> ſuppoſition <hi>he ſo freely
granted (p. 110.) of</hi> the ſame Revelation for
Chriſt's Preſence in the Euchariſt, as for his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
<hi>he would bring the buſineſs at laſt to
a Compoſition,</hi> if we will beg of him to yield
that the Body of Chriſt being preſent, his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is there preſent too. <hi>And I am not ſo
nice, (if it will come no</hi> cheaper <hi>way) as not
to</hi> begg <hi>it of him, for</hi> Chriſtianity's ſake: <hi>but
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48446:176"/>
then he adds that even upon this ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that</hi> Chriſt's Divinity is preſent with his
Body in the Sacrament, <hi>(p. 127.)</hi> his mind
muſt still unavoidably reſt unſatisfied as to the
Adoration of the Hoſt. For, ſuppoſing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature preſent in any thing gives no
ground upon that account, to give the ſame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to the thing wherein he is preſent, as I do
to Chriſt himſelf. <hi>But here again he relapſes
into his former</hi> mistake <hi>of the</hi> Controverſy,
<hi>which (in ſpight of the</hi> practiſe <hi>of</hi> Catholicks,
<hi>which is to adore</hi> Chriſt <hi>under the</hi> Accidents,
<hi>in like</hi> manner <hi>as he was</hi> worſhipped <hi>in his</hi>
Apparel,) <hi>he will have to be, that</hi> proper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worſhip is to be given to the Accidents:
<hi>For, this is what he means here by the</hi> Hoſt.
<hi>Let him ſtate the Queſtion as it ought to be,
that is,</hi> Whether Chriſt may not be worſhipped
under the Accidents, as well as in his Garments?
<hi>Or (if he will needs mix the</hi> Queſtions <hi>of the</hi>
Schools <hi>with thoſe of</hi> Faith) Whether the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
may not be worſhipped together with
Chriſt, in like manner as his Garments were
worſhipped together with Him? <hi>And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
will quickly be at an End. But,
(not to tire the Reader with following him
in his Repetitions) his</hi> ſcruple, <hi>if I miſtake
not, at preſent, is, why,</hi> ſuppoſing the divine
nature preſent in any thing gives no ground to
worſhip every thing in which he is preſent; <hi>yet
his</hi> preſence <hi>in the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>ſhould be a</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48446:176"/>
reaſon <hi>to worſhip the</hi> Accidents <hi>toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with him? And
to this I give</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min<hi>'s
anſwer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">lib. 4. de Euch. c. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>(which
I take alſo to be the ſenſe of</hi> Greg. de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,
<hi>in the place cited by the Doctor.)</hi>
Longe aliter Christus eſt in Euchariſtia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
That Chriſt is in the Euchariſt in a far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
manner, than God is in other things. For
in the Euchariſt there is but one only Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
and that divine: All other things there
preſent belong to that, and in a certain manner
make one with that, though not in the ſame
manner. <hi>(mark that)</hi> Hence it is that the
whole is rightly worſhipped together, as we ſaid
before of Chriſt apparell'd. But although God
be in all other things, yet not ſo, that he is
one Suppoſitum with them, nor is there ſuch an
Union between God and the Creature in which
he is, that they can be ſaid to be in a manner
One. <hi>By this it appears, that as</hi> Greg. de
Valentia <hi>deſervedly calls</hi> this preſence <hi>of</hi>
Christ <hi>to the Accidents,</hi> an admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juction,
<hi>ſo the Doctor unjuſtly</hi> impoſes <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
Bellarmin, <hi>that</hi> he grants as great an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical
union between Christ and the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
as between the divine and humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<hi>for although</hi> Bellarmin <hi>ſay, that</hi> all
things there preſent, in a certain manner make
One with the Suppoſitum, <hi>yet he declares ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,</hi>
that it is not in the ſame manner. <hi>But
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48446:177"/>
here the Doctor complains of</hi> un-intelligible
terms and notions <hi>uſed in this matter; And
might he not do the ſame with as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the</hi> terms <hi>and</hi> Notions <hi>uſed by the</hi>
School-men <hi>in explicating the</hi> myſteries <hi>of the</hi>
Trinity <hi>and</hi> Incarnation? <hi>How</hi> un-intelligible
<hi>ſoever the</hi> School-terms <hi>appear to him, yet it
is</hi> very eaſy <hi>to underſtand that neither</hi> Greg.
de Valentia, <hi>nor</hi> Bellarmin <hi>mean to give</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
honour <hi>to the</hi> Accidents <hi>for themſelves;
and yet much</hi> eaſier <hi>to underſtand what</hi>
Christian <hi>People mean, when they profeſs,
the</hi> Object <hi>of their</hi> Adoration <hi>in the</hi> Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,
<hi>to be</hi> the only begotten Son of God under
the Accidents of Bread and Wine. <hi>As for
what he alledges out of</hi> Vaſquez, <hi>that</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the preſence of Chriſt to be the Ground
of Adoration, <hi>it follows in his Opinion,</hi>
that God may very lawfully be adored by us in
any created Beeing, wherein he is intimately
preſent; <hi>I have ſpoken to it in the</hi> 5th.
<hi>Chapt. of the 1. Part: And as</hi> Vaſquez

                  <p>§. 1. WE come now to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
<hi>Second</hi> Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>there are not the
ſame Motives and Grounds to believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Tranſubſtantiation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 130.</note> 
                     <hi>that there are to
believe that Chriſt is God: which,</hi> he ſaith,
<hi>I affirm without any appearance of reaſon. And
he would gladly know what excellent Motives
and Reaſons thoſe are, which ſo advantageouſly
recommend</hi> ſo abſurd <hi>a doctrine as Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
is, as to make any Man think he hath
reaſon to believe it. He is ſure,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it
gives the greateſt advantage to the Enemies of
Chriſt's Divinity, to ſee theſe two put together
upon equal terms, as though no Man could have
reaſon to believe Chriſt to be the Eternal Son of
God, that did not at the ſame time ſwallow the
greatest Contradictions to ſenſe and reaſon i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable.</hi>
This is a <hi>Topick,</hi> in which the
Doctor wonderfully delights himſelf (as all
others have done before him who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48446:178"/>
the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church.)</hi> We have it
over and over at every turn; as if the whole
<hi>Syſtem</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Article</hi> of it, were to be meaſured by the
<hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> ſo that if any
thing ſeem <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>contradictory</hi> to <hi>them,</hi>
no <hi>grounds</hi> or <hi>motives</hi> can recommend it <hi>ſo
advantageouſly, as to make any Man think he
hath reaſon to believe it.</hi> This is what lies
at the bottom of his Diſcourſe; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

upon by every thing which pretends to be ſo.</hi>
The perfect diſcuſſion of this <hi>Principle,</hi> I
ſhall not engage my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Men of Principles,</hi> (as the Doctor calls them
not without juſt cauſe) are likely enough
to take it into <hi>Conſideration</hi> a <hi>ſecond,</hi> and
perhaps a <hi>third</hi> time too. At preſent it
may ſuffice to ſhew briefly now <hi>abſurd in it
ſelf,</hi> and how <hi>deſtructive to Chriſtian Religion</hi>
this <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s is, Viz. <hi>That
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48446:179"/>
we are to judge of the truth of divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(i.e.</hi> whether <hi>God</hi> have <hi>revealed</hi> ſuch
a thing, or <hi>no) by exerciſing our Faculty of
diſcerning truth and falſhood in matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to our belief:</hi> that is, by making our
<hi>Reaſon</hi> the <hi>Judge,</hi> whether the matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to our belief be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe.</hi> This
is what I <hi>can</hi> underſtand by the Doctor's
<hi>words</hi> to be his <hi>meaning.</hi> If <hi>He</hi> can give
<hi>them</hi> a better, I ſhall be glad to find my ſelf
<hi>miſtaken.</hi> But if this be, (as to me it ſeems
to be) the ſenſe of his words, I am ſorry that
any thing ſo <hi>irrational</hi> in its ſelf, and ſo fatal
to <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhould proceed from the Pen of
a <hi>Christian.</hi> For firſt, as I ſaid, it is <hi>abſurd
in it ſelf,</hi> becauſe it can by no means ſubſiſt,

That which ſeems a <hi>Camel</hi> to us, is not ſo
much as a <hi>Gnat</hi> to the knowledge and power
of <hi>God,</hi> and therefore rather than give <hi>Him</hi>
the <hi>lye,</hi> we muſt ſtrain our ſelves to <hi>ſwallow

<hi>Eve,</hi> by taking part with her <hi>ſenſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

what more ſuitable <hi>Penance</hi> for this <hi>Fault,</hi>
or <hi>Cure</hi> for this <hi>Pride,</hi> than for <hi>God</hi> to exact
of us, that we ſhould believe <hi>Him</hi> rather than
our <hi>ſenſe?</hi> and this particularly in the point
of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> into the
<hi>Body</hi> of our <hi>Redeemer;</hi> that as by following
<hi>ſenſe,</hi> and eating the fruit of the <hi>Tree</hi> of the
<hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> Death came
upon all, both of Soul and Body; ſo all may
receive Life by denying the ſuggeſtions of
Senſe, and eating the true food of the <hi>Body</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> under the forme of <hi>Bread. 2dly,</hi>
It is <hi>deſtructive</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſince if we
muſt believe nothing, but what our <hi>Senſe</hi> and
<hi>Reaſon</hi> can <hi>comprehend,</hi> we muſt lay aſide
our <hi>Creed,</hi> and neither believe the <hi>Creation</hi>
of the World, nor the <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Perſons,</hi>
nor the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> nor

to imply as many and great <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and

would be too tedious to inſiſt upon them
all: Thoſe who are curious may meet with
them every where in the Writings both of

the <hi>other</hi> wrote in <hi>Verſe;</hi> as may appear from
this following Parallel. 'Tis <hi>Ignorance</hi> and
<hi>Madneſs,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Cerinthian Heretick,</hi> to
believe that <hi>God</hi> can be <hi>Three</hi> and <hi>One,</hi> and
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>God, Stanz.</hi> 213. 220. 'Tis
<hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Madneſs</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to believe
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation, (He becomes an Idolater
by not being a Fool or a Mad-man.)</hi> p. 120.
The <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are monſtrous Prodigies of abuſed Faith,</hi>
ſaith the <hi>Cerinthian, Stanz. 213. Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi>
ſaith D. <hi>St. is ſo strange and
ſudden a change, that he can hardly ſay, that
God becoming Man was ſo great a wonder, as
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48446:182"/>
a little piece of bread becoming God,</hi> p. 120.
The <hi>Cerinthian</hi> affirms of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi>
that they are <hi>againſt all reaſon,</hi> and
<hi>founded on Contradictions,</hi> Stanz. 214. Dr.

<hi>abſurd,</hi> and for a Man to believe it, <hi>he muſt
ſwallow the greateſt Contradictions to Senſe and

makes his <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be the
<hi>Rule</hi> of his <hi>Faith,</hi> Stanz. 234. And Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
will <hi>believe</hi> nothing that ſeems to <hi>contradict
them,</hi> p. 561. Only the <hi>Cerinthian</hi> affirms the

but <hi>thoſe</hi> in the Point of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi>

to be <hi>believed</hi> by <hi>thoſe</hi> to whom they <hi>ſeem</hi>
ſo, that is, by the <hi>unlearned,</hi> who are the

<hi>believe</hi> thoſe <hi>Myſteries,</hi> they may much
rather believe that of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi>
ſince it <hi>ſeems</hi> a <hi>greater</hi> Contradiction, that

My deſign was to let the Reader ſee, how far
my Adverſary's beloved <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Senſe</hi>
and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> are from being fit Umpires, to
<hi>judge</hi> of <hi>matters propoſed as of divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi>
particularly in what relates to the
<hi>preſence</hi> of our Saviour in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and
I thought I could not do it better, than in
the words of this <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>Ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
whoſe whole Diſcourſe ſeems but a
Deſcant upon thoſe words of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
when ſpeaking of this <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi>
to the People of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hom. 60. ad pop.</note> he ſaith, <hi>Let us obey
God in all things, and not gain-ſay Him, though
what is ſaid, ſeem to contradict both our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
and Eyes. Let his word obtain more
credit from us, than our thoughts or ſight. And
thus let us behave our ſelves in the Myſteries</hi>
(that is in the moſt Holy Sacrament) <hi>not
beholding only thoſe things which lye before us,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48446:186"/>
(viz.</hi> the Symbols of Bread and Wine) <hi>but
holding faſt his words. For his Word is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
but our ſenſe is eaſy to be deceived. That
never fails, but this moſt frequently miſtakes.
Becauſe therfore the Word ſaith. This is my Body,
let us obey and believe and behold Him with the

that <hi>the uſe he would have of reaſon, was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nothing, but what his reaſon could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi>
He aſſures me (p. 542.) upon his word

revealed by it in H. Scriptures, although I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reconcile all particulars concerning them to
thoſe Conceptions we call Reaſon.</hi> But here I
obſerve firſt, (as no very great <hi>ſign</hi> that he
means not by the <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> what I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)
that he doth not tell us of any <hi>one</hi>

condition, unleſs he mean he <hi>cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
all particulars concerning the exiſtence
of a Deity;</hi> but huddles them up in a blind
<hi>Univerſal, that he believes all the Doctrines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by God in the H. Scriptures;</hi> as if it
were enough for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to believe in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

without troubling himſelf about the

                     <hi>Senſe</hi> of any thing in <hi>particular,</hi> for fear of
over-ſtraining his <hi>Reaſon</hi> to ſwallow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that may ſeem a Contradiction. And
I confeſs the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> may be a
ſufficient <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Faith.</hi> 2dly, <hi>This
Aſſertion</hi> of his <hi>expoſes the Faith of Chriſtians</hi>

<hi>Catholicks;</hi> by its <hi>denying</hi> to Men the <hi>uſe</hi>
of their <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Reaſon as to matters of
Faith revealed by God in the Scriptures,</hi> when
they muſt neceſſarily <hi>uſe</hi> them to find out
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>exiſtence of a Deity.</hi>
For whether the <hi>Scripture</hi> or the <hi>Church</hi> be
ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Ground</hi> of believing, the

Men muſt be allowed the <hi>uſe</hi> of their <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

therefore he muſt either acknowledge his

Contradiction</hi> in a matter of Faith) that
they may and ought to make <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

I take to be the ſame, as <hi>to believe no

again, <hi>to prove if I can</hi> (as if it belong'd not

was a Doctrine received in the Univerſal

was not believed.</hi> Theſe are <hi>bigg

Which <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>proof</hi> is look'd upon
by all ſober Men, as very <hi>proper</hi> both to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie

it is, that when <hi>Bellarmin</hi> makes uſe of

                  </p>
                  <p>This is what <hi>Protestants</hi> themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
of the moſt eminent <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>God's
Church</hi> in each Age from our <hi>Saviours</hi> time
concerning the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi>

called <hi>The Proteſtants Apology for the Roman

heard were taxed of inſincerity in their quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48446:193"/>
And if it be true, what Dr. <hi>Field</hi>
ſaith of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that <hi>if he could prove that
Proteſtants confeſs the Roman to be the true
Church, he needed not to uſe any other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
I might ſuperſede any farther proof

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Reader perhaps may deſire to ſee

becauſe this is the Age I ſuppoſe the Doctor
pitches upon, when he ſaith he will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to <hi>inſtance in an Age, ſince the firſt three
Centuries,</hi> Wherein <hi>if the moſt learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Biſhops who lived in it are to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited,
Tranſubstantiation was not believed;</hi> I
ſhall be ſomewhat larger in citing the words
of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and alſo add other Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of <hi>Fathers</hi> of the ſame time to <hi>his,</hi>
that the Reader may ſee what <hi>Iſsue</hi> his <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking</hi>
is like to have in this matter.
<hi>First,</hi> Then St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>
as if he foreſaw my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
objection,<note place="margin">li. de Initiand. c. 9.</note> puts
it down in theſe formal words. <hi>You will ſay
perhaps, How do you prove to me that I receive
the Body of Chriſt, when I ſee another thing?</hi>
And the way he takes to <hi>Anſwer</hi> it, is by
comparing the <hi>change</hi> made here in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Bread, with the <hi>examples</hi> of <hi>thoſe
miraculous changes,</hi> which were wrought by
Holy Men of Old in the <hi>Natures</hi> of other
things, as of <hi>Moſes's Rodd being turned into
a Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Waters of Aegypt into Blood,</hi> &amp;c.
From whence he infers, that <hi>if the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of thoſe who were but pure Men, was of
ſuch force, as to change Nature, What muſt we
ſay of that divine Conſecration, where the very
words of our Lord and Saviour do operate?—
Thou haſt read,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the works of the
Creation, how God ſpake the Word and they
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48446:194"/>
were made, he commanded and they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
(that is, produc'd out of nothing) <hi>The
Word therefore of Chriſt which of nothing could
make that to be which was not, can it not change
thoſe things which are (viz.</hi> Bread and Wine)
<hi>into that which before they were not, (viz.</hi> his
own Body and Blood?) <hi>ſurely it is not a leſs
matter to give new natures to things</hi> out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>than to change them</hi> after they are
made.—Again, <hi>You will ſay perhaps, my
Bread is uſual</hi> Bread, <hi>No,</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>this Bread is
Bread before the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
words;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">li. 4. de Sacram. c. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>When the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
is performed, of Bread is made the
Fleſh of Chriſt.—He ſpake the Word and
it was made; he commanded and it was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
—And that we may not doubt he meant
it was made his <hi>true Fleſh,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>As our
Lord Jeſus Christ is the true Son
of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">li. 6. c. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>not as Men are by Grace,
but as the Son, of the ſubſtance of
his Father; ſo it is his very true Fleſh, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath ſaid, which we receive, and his very
true Blood which we drink.</hi> This and much
more doth St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> write of this ſubject;
ſo that no Man need to wonder, if the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiſts</hi>
ſay, <hi>he wrote not well
of Tranſubſtantiation:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cent. 4. c. 4. col. 295.</note> And
I have either read or heard
it reported of <hi>Calvin</hi> that

but the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of his <hi>Brethren</hi> will

that the words taken as they ſound, <hi>ſeem</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently

to have been very <hi>jealous</hi> not only of <hi>new
doctrines,</hi> but of any <hi>new forms</hi> of <hi>words;</hi>
or by <hi>thoſe</hi> who lived in the <hi>Ages after</hi> them:

this Point in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence;</hi>

                     <p>§. 4. But what if the Doctor ſhall deny
all this, that is, both the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the
<hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of his <hi>Brethren</hi> to
be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to prove <hi>Tranſubſtantiation to
have been a Doctrine received in the Univerſal
Church from Chriſt's time?</hi> To ſhow the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48446:196"/>
of ſuch a denyal, I would
propoſe this caſe to <hi>his</hi> Conſideration, and
the <hi>Readers. Viz.</hi> In ſuppoſition that a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy</hi>
ariſe in this preſent Age about the
<hi>ſenſe</hi> of a <hi>Law,</hi> which was made 500. Years
ago, and that a conſiderable number of <hi>thoſe</hi>
who ſtarted the <hi>Controverſy,</hi> ſhould <hi>confeſs,</hi>
that for the laſt two hundred years the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
to what they maintain, was generally
received in the Kingdom as the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the
<hi>Law,</hi> and ſhould further <hi>confeſs</hi> that the moſt
<hi>eminent Lawyers</hi> of the <hi>former</hi> Ages, from the
firſt <hi>enacting</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> held the <hi>ſame</hi> with
the <hi>latter;</hi> Nor had there ever been any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
or <hi>oppoſition</hi> among them in that
Point; whether it be not a <hi>ſufficient</hi> proof,
that what they taught to be the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the
<hi>Law,</hi> was generally received to be the <hi>ſenſe</hi>
and meaning of it, from the beginning?
The <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> themſelves of thoſe <hi>Ancient
Lawyers</hi> would be conviction enough: how
much more when <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
of the <hi>Adverſe Party</hi> it ſelf? Now if
this be <hi>ſo</hi> in the delivery of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of a
<hi>humane Law,</hi> where it happens very often
that great <hi>Lawyers</hi> may be and often are of
<hi>different judgments;</hi> how much more, in the
delivery of a <hi>divine Doctrine,</hi> where the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> are bound to <hi>deliver</hi>
what they <hi>received,</hi> and the <hi>ſucceeding Age</hi>
is ſtil <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> what they <hi>delivered?</hi>
                        <pb n="310" facs="tcp:48446:197"/>
Surely, if we add to this the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of the
very <hi>Adverſaries</hi> themſelves, the <hi>Proof</hi> (as
St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith) muſt be
<hi>true and without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Adv. haer. lib. 4. c. 14.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 5. But if the Doctor will ſtill perſiſt
in the denyal of ſo Evident a Proof; becauſe
the <hi>Propoſition</hi> is <hi>comparative</hi> between the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt's Divinity,</hi> as to its <hi>general reception</hi>
in the <hi>Church,</hi> I muſt deſire him <hi>ſoberly</hi> to
conſider, how much leſs St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi>
thought <hi>ſufficient</hi> to prove this <hi>latter</hi> to be a
<hi>Catholick Tradition.</hi> For having cited the
<hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>four Fathers</hi> only for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiality</hi>
of the <hi>Son</hi> with his <hi>Father,</hi> viz.
<hi>Theognoſtus, Dionyſius
Alexandrinus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Decret. Nicen. Synodi.</note> 
                        <hi>Dionyſius
Romanus,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi>
he concludes with an
<hi>Ecce. Behold, we demonstrate,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this
Doctrine to have been delivered from Fathers
to Fathers, as it were by hand.</hi> And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
uſing the like Argument
in the point of <hi>original
ſin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Contr. Julian. li. 1. c. 2. &amp;c.</note> firſt makes this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
<hi>I will alledge,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>a few Teſtimonies of a few of the Fathers,
with which nevertheleſs our Adverſaries will
be conſtrained to bluſh and yield, if either any
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48446:197"/>
fear of God, or ſhame of Men can over-power
in them ſo pervicacious an obſtinacy.</hi> And
then having produced the Teſtimonies of
<hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> of the <hi>Latin Fathers,</hi> he tells <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
againſt whom he wrote, that <hi>that part of
the World ought to ſuffice him,</hi> (that is, to
make him yield it to be the <hi>Catholick Faith)
in which our Lord was pleaſed to crown with a
moſt glorious Martyrdome the Firſt</hi> (or Prince)
<hi>of the Apoſtles.</hi> And then to ſhow that the
<hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> was the <hi>ſame</hi> with
that of the <hi>Latin</hi> in this Point, he cites the
Teſtimonies only of <hi>three Greek Fathers;</hi> and
to the firſt of them; viz. St. <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,</hi>
he immediately adds, <hi>This is ſo great a Man,
that neither he would ſay this but from the
Chriſtian Faith moſt notorious to all; neither
would they have esteemed him ſo Venerable, if
they had not acknowledged that he ſpake theſe
things out of the rule of the moſt known Truth.</hi>
And now let the Reader judg whether when
we produce a far <hi>greater number</hi> of moſt
manifeſt <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ages, teaching without any Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that <hi>the Bread is changed into the Body
of Chriſt by Conſecration;</hi> and this confeſſed
of <hi>ſome</hi> of the moſt Eminent of <hi>them</hi> in <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Age</hi> by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves, we do
not more than <hi>ſufficiently</hi> prove that it was
<hi>a Doctrine received in the Univerſal Church
from our Saviour's time?</hi> And, if he think
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48446:198"/>
yet he can produce greater Evidence for the
Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt's Divinity,</hi> being <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally</hi>
received in the <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
time, the <hi>early conteſt</hi> of the <hi>Arrians</hi> about
that <hi>Point,</hi> their <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi> for
ſo many Ages, compared with the <hi>open</hi> and
<hi>undiſturbed</hi> delivery of the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi>
may ſoon convince him of the
<hi>vanity</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> an undertaking.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. The <hi>3d.</hi> and laſt <hi>Ground</hi> he inſtances
in, is <hi>Scripture;</hi> and <hi>this,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>he doth
and ſhall acknowledge for his only Rule of
Faith in ſpight of all pretences to infallibility
either in Church or Tradition.</hi> When he hath
conſidered well, what Mr. <hi>E. W.</hi> hath ſaid
to him upon this Subject in his two Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Treatiſes, <hi>(Proteſtancy without Principles,</hi>
and <hi>Religion and Reaſon)</hi> I hope this <hi>ſpight</hi> of
<hi>his</hi> may be abated. But in the mean time
what doth he alledge out of this his <hi>only
Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> (as he will have it) againſt <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation?</hi>
Not ſo much I can aſſure
you as <hi>one</hi> ſingle <hi>Text.</hi> But becauſe <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
produces <hi>One,</hi> and but <hi>One</hi> for that Point,
<hi>(viz.</hi> the words of <hi>Chriſt, This is my Body.)</hi>
whereas he cites <hi>many</hi> for proof of <hi>Chriſt's
Divinity,</hi> he will appeal to him, <hi>whether there
are the ſame Grounds and Motives from thence
to believe Tranſubſtantiation, as there are the
Divinity of Chriſt.</hi> But if <hi>Catholicks</hi> do not
acknowledge <hi>Scripture</hi> alone to be the <hi>Rule</hi>
                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:48446:198"/>
of <hi>Faith,</hi> what am I concern'd whether <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
produce <hi>many</hi> Texts, or but <hi>One,</hi> or
<hi>none</hi> at all? Does not the Doctor himſelf
ſay, that <hi>ſome of our Religion have ſaid, that
Tranſubſtantiation could not be prov'd from
Scripture alone;</hi> and have not others of it
ſaid as much of the <hi>Conſubstantiality</hi> of the
<hi>Son</hi> with the <hi>Father?</hi> I am ſure <hi>this</hi> was
believed before the <hi>Scripture</hi> was written;
and ſo <hi>Scripture</hi> could not be the <hi>Rule</hi> of
<hi>believing</hi> it. But then again, what if <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
produc'd but <hi>One</hi> Text of <hi>Scripture</hi>
for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> therefore can there no
more be produc'd? Or, if no more could
be produc'd, would there not be the <hi>ſame
Ground</hi> of believing from thence, ſuppoſing
I am certain of the <hi>true ſenſe</hi> of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s <hi>One,</hi> as
if there were <hi>many?</hi> Are we not bound as
much to believe <hi>God</hi> when he ſays a thing
<hi>once,</hi> if we be <hi>ſure</hi> of the <hi>true ſenſe</hi> of what
he ſaith, as when he ſays the ſame <hi>twice</hi> or
<hi>thrice?</hi> And were not all thoſe places cited
by <hi>Bellarmin, for Chriſt's Divinity,</hi> as much
impugned by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> as this, (of <hi>Chriſt's
words, This is my Body.)</hi> is by <hi>Calvin</hi> and his
Complices? Why then muſt I, becauſe
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> produces out of Scripture but <hi>one</hi>
Text for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> for
<hi>Chriſt's Divinity,</hi> acknowledge there are not
the <hi>ſame Grounds or Motives to believe the
one</hi> as the <hi>other?</hi>
                     </p>

§. 7. I, but <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
that <hi>there is ſome obſcurity or ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi>
in the very <hi>Text</hi> he cites; for after he had
ſpent the greateſt part
of the Chapter againſt
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>li.</hi> 3. de Euch. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> 
                        <hi>He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
it thus,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, p. 131. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there</hi> be <hi>ſome obſcurity or ambiguity in
the words of our Lord, yet that is taken away
by Councils and Fathers, which is a plain Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
he thought, the Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
could not be proved from Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi>
But ſtay, am I bound to believe Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
upon his bare word? May I not look into
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> to ſee what he ſays, without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a ſin of raſh judgement againſt my
Neighbour? The Book (God be thanked)
is not ſo hard to be found, as that of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gautius.</hi>
I ventur'd to look the place upon
the Remembrance of ſome former <hi>dexterity</hi>
I had noted in him in citing of <hi>Authors,</hi> and
(although I could hardly believe my <hi>Eyes,</hi>
nor did not, till I look'd into <hi>another Edition)</hi>
I found <hi>Bellarmin</hi> not to ſay what he affirms
him to ſay, but in reality the <hi>contrary.</hi> For
after he had proved from the words of our
Lord, the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of <hi>his Body</hi> in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
againſt the <hi>Calviniſts, li. 1. de Euch.
c.</hi> 1. and in the preſent Chapter had ſhown
againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation
is abſolutely inferr'd from the very ſame words,</hi>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:48446:199"/>
being to carry on his Proofs from <hi>Scripture</hi>
to <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> he concludes the
Chapter in theſe words, and that by way of
Tranſition:</p>
                     <p>Adde, quod LICET in verbis Domini
ESSET <hi>aliqua obſcuritas, vel</hi> ambiguitas,
<hi>ea tamen ſublata eſt per multa Concilia Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae
Eccleſiae, &amp; Patrum Conſenſum. Add,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>that</hi> ALTHOUGH THERE WERE
<hi>(or ſhould be,</hi> which is as much as to ſay,
<hi>ſuppoſe there were) ſome obſcurity or ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
in the words of our Lord, yet that is taken
away by the many Councils of the Catholick
Church, and the Conſent of Fathers.</hi> And
now I appeal to the Reader, whether Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
have not given us here a very rare example
of <hi>reporting faithfully,</hi> (as he calls it in his
<hi>Preface)</hi> the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of an <hi>Author.</hi>
Is it all one to ſay, <hi>although there be,</hi> and <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there ſhould be?</hi> He that ſaith, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be ſome ambiguity in the words,</hi>
ſuppoſes them to be <hi>ambiguous:</hi> He that ſaith
<hi>Although there ſhould be ſome Ambiguity in
them,</hi> ſuppoſes them <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>ambiguous.</hi>
And this is the caſe between <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and
the <hi>Doctor. Bellarmin</hi> only puts the <hi>caſe</hi> they
were ambiguous, and by <hi>ſo</hi> doing ſuppoſes
them <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>ſo:</hi> and the Doctor makes
him acknowledge them <hi>de facto</hi> to be <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous:</hi>
which is juſt, as if when the Doctor
himſelf ſays, (p. 111.) <hi>ſuppoſing there were the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48446:200"/>
ſame divine Revelation of Tranſubstantiation
and of Christ's Divinity,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhould infer,
that he acknowledges the <hi>Revelation</hi> to <hi>be</hi>
the <hi>ſame, de facto,</hi> in both. 'Tis manifeſt
then, that by <hi>this Tranſlation</hi> he hath <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi>
both the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Bellarmin.</hi>
And this not by <hi>miſtake,</hi> as appears but
too too plainly, for that himſelf makes the
words of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as he tranſlates them, <hi>to
be a plain Indication, that he thought Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
could not be proved from Scripture
alone;</hi> whereas had he <hi>reported</hi> them as
they ſtand in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> (LICET ESSET)
<hi>Although there were, (or ſhould be) ſome am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
in the words of our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. They
had been a plain <hi>Indication,</hi> that <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
for his part thought that he had ſufficiently
prov'd the <hi>Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation</hi> out
of <hi>Scripture.</hi> And now the Reader ſees what
the Doctor meant in his <hi>Preface,</hi> by <hi>his deſign</hi>
(as he calls it) <hi>to report faithfully:</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he intended to make uſe of it for his
<hi>advantage,</hi> yet it is <hi>a very plain Indication</hi> of
what <hi>ſhifts</hi> and <hi>artifices</hi> they are fain to avail
themſelves of, who will maintain <hi>a bad cauſe.</hi>
To conclude, I ſhall give <hi>him</hi> the Opinion
of Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in this Point more faithfully:
who in his <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Prophecying,</hi> Sect. 20.
n. 16. ſaith, that <hi>Catholicks have a Divine
Revelation, (viz.</hi> This is my Body.) <hi>whoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral

                        <pb n="317" facs="tcp:48446:200"/>
(is ſo clear and evident for Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
that it) <hi>would warrant them to do
violence to all the Sciences in the Circle.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Dr. Taylor's Argument in behalf of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
ſuppoſing them miſtaken, Un-anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Dr. St. His Parallel of ſuch a ſuppoſed
miſtake with that of Idolaters, ſhown to be a
real and very groſs mistake in himſelf.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§. 1. HAving ſhown in my</hi> Reply <hi>that
the</hi> Dr's Argument <hi>by which
he would prove the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi>
Rome <hi>guilty of</hi> Idolatry <hi>for adoring our</hi> Lord
Chriſt <hi>in the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>would be of equal
ſorce ſrom the Pen of an</hi> Arrian, <hi>againſt the</hi>
adoration <hi>of</hi> him, <hi>as</hi> God, <hi>wherever preſent;
I added, (p. 20.) that ſuppoſing</hi> Catholicks
ſhould be miſtaken in their belief, <hi>(And I hope
the Doctor will not infer from</hi> hence, <hi>that I
acknowledge them to</hi> be <hi>miſtaken,</hi> de facto,)
yet ſo eminent and learned a Man among the
Protestants, as Dr. <hi>Taylor, denies it would
follow from thence, that they were</hi> Idolaters.
<hi>And the words I cited were theſe, out of his</hi>
Liberty of Prophecying. Sect. 20. Numb. 16.
Idolatry, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> is a forſaking the true God,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48446:201"/>
and giving divine worſhip to a Creature, or to
an Idol, that is, to an Imaginary God, who hath
no Foundation in Eſſence or Exiſtence: And
this is that kind of Superſtition, which by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
is called, the ſuperſtition of an undue Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Now it is evident, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Catholick's Adoration (that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to them in their minds, their thoughts,
their purpoſes; and by which God principally,
if not ſolely takes Eſtimate of humane Actions)
in the B. Sacrament, is the only true and Eternal
God, hypoſtatically joined with his Holy Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
which Humanity they believe actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
under the Veil of the Sacramental Signs;
and if they thought him not preſent, they are ſo
far from worſhipping the Bread in that caſe, that
themſelves profeſs it Idolatry to do ſo, which is
a <hi>demonſtration,</hi> that their Soul hath nothing
in it, that is, Idolatrical. If this Confidence
and fanciful Opinion hath engaged them upon
ſo great a miſtake, (as without doubt, <hi>he ſaith,</hi>
it hath) yet the Will hath nothing in it, but
what is a great Enemy to Idolatry. <hi>Thus Dr.</hi>
Taylor, <hi>and I ſaid,</hi> I thought it would be a I ask
worthy Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s pains to ſolve this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if he would not abſolve us from being
Idolaters. <hi>But it ſeems, he either thought
it not</hi> worth his pains; <hi>or rather, that it
would be but</hi> labour loſt <hi>to go about it, and
therefore endeavours to</hi> ſhift <hi>it off:</hi> First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>By</hi>
returning Us the Opinion of ſome of our own
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48446:201"/>
                     <hi>Divines;</hi> And, <hi>2dly,</hi> By ſeemingly oppoſing
Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> to himſelf, though what he cite
out of him be nothing to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. The <hi>Divines,</hi> whoſe Opinions he
returns me, are <hi>Coſter</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Fiſher. If
the Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
be not true,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Enchir. Controv. c. 8. p. 308.</note>
ſaith <hi>Coſter, the Idolatry of
the Heathens in worſhiping
ſome Golden or Silver Statue, or any Images of
their Gods; or the Laplanders worſhipping a
Red Cloth, or the Aegyptians an Animal, is
more excuſable, than of Chriſtians who worſhip
a bit of Bread. And if there be nothing but
Bread in the Eucharist,</hi>
ſaith Biſhop <hi>Fiſher,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contr. Oecolamp. li. 1. c. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>they
are all Idolaters.</hi> Theſe
are the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> he
produces: And what follows from hence?
that becauſe they <hi>ſeem</hi> to ſay in effect what
he does, therefore the <hi>Reaſon</hi> alledged by Dr.
<hi>Taylor</hi> is ſolved? This is a <hi>new way</hi> of <hi>ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
arguments</hi> not unlike to <hi>his new way</hi> of
<hi>anſwering</hi> the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Fathers</hi> (I
ſhewed above, p. 46.) which was to ask
me, <hi>How I was ſure, the Fathers had not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their Judgment in their latter Writings,</hi>
when himſelf brings nothing to prove they
did. What I required of him in this point
was, to <hi>ſolve</hi> the <hi>Argument,</hi> or <hi>abſolve</hi> us
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48446:202"/>
from <hi>Idolatry.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> he <hi>cannot,</hi> the <hi>other</hi>
he <hi>will not do.</hi> Only he tells us that two of
our own <hi>Divines</hi> were of the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
as if becauſe <hi>Vaſquez</hi> holds an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
contrary to <hi>Suarez, that alone</hi> were a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ſolution to all his Arguments.</p>
                  <p>As for the Teſtimonies themſelves, they
are but the <hi>Opinions</hi> of <hi>Divines,</hi> and ſo I
might take the liberty of the <hi>Schools</hi> to deny
the conſequence, as Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> doth,
when he ſaith, that ſuch kind of expreſſions
in <hi>Catholick Divines,</hi> [viz. <hi>if there be nothing
but Bread in the Euchariſt, they
are all Idolaters,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epil. 3. part. p. 352.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhow what
confidence they would have the
World apprehend, that they hold
their Opinion with, but not that the Conſequence
is true,</hi> viz. that <hi>they are therefore Idolaters,
unleſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what I have ſaid above be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable.</hi>
And what was that, but the ſame
which Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> aſſerted? viz. <hi>That a Mans
miſtake in thinking the Elements to be away,
(which indeed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are there,) cannot make
him guilty of honouring thoſe Creatures as God,
which we know, if he thought they were there, he
must needs take for Creatures, and therefore
could not honour for God.</hi> And he repeats
the ſame again in his <hi>Juſt Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
c.</hi> 19. where he ſays, that <hi>they who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Hoſt, do not believe that the Elements
remain, nay, they ſay they muſt be flat Idolaters,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48446:202"/>
if they he there. Zeal to their Opinion makes
them ſay more than they ſhould ſay. But if
they were there, they would not take them for
God; and that is it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>(not ſaying that
they ſhould be Idolaters if the Elements did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main)
that mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t make them Idolaters.</hi> Thus
Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and juſtifiably enough, had
thoſe Divines proceeded in the Doctor's
ſuppoſition of formal Idolatry; which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the beſt judgment I can make of <hi>Coſterus</hi>
his words, I have reaſon to think they did
not, but only conſidered and compared the
<hi>Material</hi> Object (Bread) as leſs worthy of
adoration, with the Golden or Silver Statues
of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> &amp;c. And this I take to be
manifeſt from <hi>Coſter</hi>'s diſcourſe, (if entirely
ſet down) which is this, that <hi>if the true Body
of Chriſt be not in the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Chriſt hath dealt with his Church in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
much unbecoming his Goodneſs, which was
to leave her for 1500. Years together in ſuch
an Error and Idolatry, and that occaſioned by
his own words, as was never ſeen or heard of
in the World. For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Error of
thoſe who worſhip for God a Golden or a Silver
Statue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is more tolerable,</hi> (that is, leſs
abſurd to any Man's reaſon) <hi>than of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
who worſhip a bit of Bread.</hi> And upon
this account it is, he adds, that <hi>ignorance
could not excuſe ſuch wiſe and learned Men,
as Auſtin, Chryſoſtom, Hierom,</hi> &amp;c. for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48446:203"/>
the Hoſt (unleſs they were moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
aſſured, that it was <hi>not bread,</hi> but the
<hi>Body of Chriſt) and that the Heathens were
more excuſable from Idolatry, who adored their
Statues,</hi> (becauſe <hi>they</hi> muſt needs think them
much <hi>more worth</hi> than a <hi>bit of bread.)</hi> By
which it appears, that the whole force of
his argument lies upon the <hi>Indignity</hi> of the
<hi>thing,</hi> (which the Doctor omitted) <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> by his words ſhould give occaſion to
his <hi>Church</hi> to run into ſo <hi>abſurd</hi> an <hi>Errour,</hi>
(though but <hi>material</hi> only) for ſo long a
time together. And conſequently he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
not at all with the <hi>preſent Queſtion,</hi>
whether ſuppoſing <hi>Catholicks</hi> miſtaken in
their belief, they would be guilty (as my
Adverſary would make them) of <hi>Formal
Idolatry?</hi> From whence it follows that Dr.
<hi>St.</hi> hath neither ſolved Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by which he proves that <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
neither <hi>ought</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> be <hi>juſtly</hi> accuſed of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,</hi>
(that is, of <hi>formal Idolatry) ſuppoſing
them to be miſtaken in their belief of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
becauſe what is repreſented to them
in their minds, their thoughts and purpoſes,
(and by which God principally, if not ſolely
takes estimate of humane Actions) in the B.
Sacrament, is not Bread which they believe not
to be there at all, but the only true and Eternal
God:</hi> Nor yet in <hi>reality</hi> hath return'd us the
<hi>Opinion</hi> of our <hi>own Divines,</hi> who were not
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48446:203"/>
concerned in the Queſtion at preſent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
between us. For they did not conſider
the <hi>act,</hi> as it was the <hi>worſhipping God</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be in the place of <hi>Bread;</hi> but <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
only, as it was the <hi>worſhipping</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi>
for <hi>God.</hi> No relief then is to be had from
our Divines. Let us ſee whether the Doctor
ſpeed any better in what he cites out of Dr.
<hi>Taylor</hi> himſelf; for by his manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
he would make the Reader believe,
that he had anſwer'd his own Argument, when
he ſpeaks nothing at all of it.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. None, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> is ſo fit to anſwer Dr.
<hi>Taylor,</hi> as himſelf, after almost Twenty Years
time, <hi>(in which alſo he was</hi> advanced <hi>to</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
<hi>dignity)</hi> to conſider more throughly of
thoſe things, <hi>that is, ſuppoſing</hi> Catholicks <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in their belief, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> they are</hi> excuſed
<hi>from</hi> Idolatry, <hi>as having in their</hi> minds <hi>no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Object <hi>of</hi> Adoration <hi>in the</hi> B. Sacrament
<hi>but the only</hi> true <hi>and</hi> Eternal God. <hi>And what
is it that Dr.</hi> St. <hi>hath found in Dr.</hi> Taylor
<hi>himſelf</hi> after Twenty Years conſideration <hi>to
Anſwer his Argument? Marry this,</hi> that
Thou ſhalt not worſhip any Graven Images will
out-weigh all the beſt and faireſt Imaginations
of the Church of Rome. <hi>And again, that</hi> the
Second Commandment is plain and peremptory
againſt all the making and worſhipping any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
or likeneſs of any thing. <hi>And who
would not think here, that the Doctor had
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48446:204"/>
forgot, that we were not diſputing now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the</hi> worſhip <hi>of</hi> Images, <hi>but of</hi> Chriſt <hi>in
the</hi> Sacrament? <hi>Had
I cited Dr.</hi> Taylor <hi>when
I was treating the
matter of</hi> Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>of</hi> Proph. c. 20. Numb. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>to ſay, that</hi> the ordinary diſputes <hi>between</hi>
Catholicks <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants <hi>(of which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that of the</hi> Veneration <hi>of</hi> Images <hi>is</hi> one)
have to no very great purpoſe diſturbed the
Peace of Chriſtendome; <hi>and
that</hi> they are ſuperſtructures
ill built,<note place="margin">Ib. Numb. 3.</note> and worſe managed,
but yet they keep the Foundation—The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Faith, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> stands ſecure enough
for all their vain and unhandſome ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures;
<hi>the</hi> places <hi>he cites might have ſerv'd
for a kind of</hi> Recantation, <hi>(not to give it the
name of</hi> Contradiction) <hi>becauſe if it be</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
<hi>it deſtroys the</hi> Foundation. <hi>But to tell
us that Dr.</hi> Taylor <hi>anſwers his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
viz. <hi>(that</hi> Catholicks <hi>in caſe they ſhould
be</hi> miſtaken <hi>in the</hi> belief <hi>of</hi> Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>are</hi> not <hi>guilty of</hi> Idolatry, <hi>as having no
other</hi> Object <hi>of their</hi> Adoration <hi>in the</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>but the only</hi> true God) becauſe the ſecond
Commandment is peremptory againſt the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Images; <hi>is ſuch a trifling evaſion, as
nothing but</hi> deſpair <hi>of ſaying any thing to
the</hi> purpoſe <hi>could have caſt ſo</hi> ſubtil <hi>a</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſer
<hi>upon it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:48446:204"/>
But hath the Doctor nothing here to ſay
for himſelf, why he produced theſe <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
of ſo <hi>diſparate</hi> a temper to the preſent
purpoſe? Yes. For by theſe Aſſertions of
Dr. <hi>Taylor, it is clear,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he did not
think that Idolatry did lye only in
giving divine worſhip to a Creature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 133.</note>
                     <hi>or to an Idol, which is called the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
of an undue Object; but alſo will
have the ſuperſtition of a prohibited manner,
or way of Worſhip to be Idolatry. For he not
only makes the Second Command peremptory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Worſhip of the true God by an Image,
but elſewhere plainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins
this to be Idolatry;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Doct. dubitant. li. 2. c. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>as
when he ſaith,</hi> (and I pray
take notice what it is he
ſaith) <hi>that to worſhip falſe Gods, or to give
divine honour to an Image</hi> (which only they
who take an Image for God do) <hi>is all one kind
of formal Idolatry. If therefore,</hi> ſaith Dr.
<hi>St.</hi> (and we muſt grant him too, it is all
<hi>one,</hi> to worſhip <hi>God</hi> himſelf <hi>by</hi> an <hi>Image,</hi>
and to worſhip an <hi>Image</hi> inſtead of <hi>God)
they cannot be excuſed from Idolatry who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the true God by an Image, though the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their Adoration be right, and they
think the manner of it lawful; neither can they
who worſhip Chriſt upon the account of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
in the Sacrament.</hi> This is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
diſcourſe; and as it muſt coſt him no
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48446:205"/>
little pains to ſqueez ſo ſubtil an Inference
from Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s words: So I confeſs, it
coſt me ſome to reduce it into ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as might make it intelligible to the
Reader. But the miſchief is, that whilſt he
labours thus to <hi>ſolve</hi> the argument, he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms</hi>
it. For as for the <hi>firſt</hi> part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
Viz. <hi>the Superſtition of an undue Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
it is evident that <hi>Catholicks</hi> are not
guilty of <hi>it</hi> in Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s judgment, becauſe
(as D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf confeſſes) he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Catholicks Adoration</hi> to
be the <hi>only true God,</hi> who, I hope, is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Object of our Worſhip. And for the
<hi>Second,</hi> viz. <hi>the ſuperſtition of a prohibited
manner or way of Worſhip,</hi> he brings nothing
out of Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> to prove the worſhip of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> to be <hi>ſo;</hi> but only
tells us, (though Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s words, as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above, import no ſuch thing) that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
the <hi>worſhip</hi> of the <hi>true God</hi> by an
<hi>Image,</hi> to be <hi>Idolatry;</hi> Neither did Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
himſelf hitherto pretend any <hi>Prohibition</hi> to
worſhip <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but only
that there was no <hi>expreſs Command,</hi> p. 111.
for the doing it. So that upon the whole,
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> ſuppoſing they were miſtaken in
their belief, would not be guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi>
upon <hi>either</hi> of theſe <hi>accounts;</hi> that is; <hi>either</hi>
for that <hi>they</hi> had an <hi>undue Object</hi> of worſhip
in their thoughts, <hi>or</hi> for that the worſhip of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48446:205"/>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> was <hi>forbidden.</hi> But

<hi>ſaid that Christ was

                     <hi>and therefore worſhipped the Sun,</hi> and
would fain underſtand <hi>why they ſhould not be
as free from Idolatry, as thoſe who are ſuppoſed
to be miſtaken in the belief of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
But the <hi>diſparity</hi> between the <hi>one</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
and the <hi>other</hi> is ſo clear, that I ſhall
appeal to the Readers, whether I had not
juſt reaſon to call the <hi>not ſeeing it</hi> in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
a very <hi>groſs miſtake.</hi> For what St.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> relates of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> (as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
himſelf <hi>reports</hi> it) is, that <hi>they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi>
the <hi>Sun, whom they</hi> falſly <hi>thought to be
Chriſt:</hi> That is, what they had in their <hi>minds</hi>
and <hi>purpoſes</hi> to <hi>adore,</hi> was the <hi>Sun.</hi> But <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
(ſuppoſing a miſtake in their belief)
do not believe the <hi>Bread</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or
worſhip the <hi>bread</hi> which they believe to be
<hi>Christ.</hi> No: their miſtake (if there were
any) would be, that they believed the <hi>bread
not</hi> to be <hi>there</hi> at all; and therefore what
<hi>they</hi> would have in their <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>purpoſes</hi>
to <hi>adore,</hi> would <hi>not,</hi> nor <hi>could not</hi> be <hi>bread,</hi>

Where lies the <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Had the Doctor
held himſelf to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> which terms the <hi>Invocation of
Saints, a fond thing vainly invented and
grounded upon no warrant of Scripture;</hi> there
had been ſome colour for a diſpute againſt
the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of it. But to condemn us of
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> down-right <hi>Idolatry</hi> for deſiring the
<hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in Heaven to <hi>pray for us,</hi>
was to put the common ſize of Intelligent
Readers quite out of hopes of ever ſeeing it
proved. He ſays indeed in his Preface, that
<hi>He thinks it no great skill to make things appear
either ridiculous or dark:</hi> and here He gives
us a very pregnant Example, of what himſelf
can do in that kind.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. <hi>The Argument he made choice of to do
this</hi> Feat, <hi>that is, to prove the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi>
Rome <hi>guilty of</hi> Idolatry <hi>in the</hi> Invocation <hi>of</hi>
Saints, <hi>was this.</hi> If the ſuppoſition of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
excellency between God and us, be ſufficient
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48446:210"/>
ground for formal Invocation, then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
worſhip of their inferiour Deities could
be no Idolatry, for they ſtill pretended they did
not give to them the worſhip proper to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God; which is as much as is pretended
by the devouteſt Papiſts in Juſtification of the
Invocation of Saints. <hi>To this I anſwer'd
two ways in my</hi> Reply: 1. By ſhewing the
diſparity of Catholicks worſhip from that of the
Heathens, in two things: 1. In the Objects;
<hi>where I ſaid, that by</hi> Perſons of a middle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
we underſtand Perſons endowed with
ſupernatural gifts of grace in this life, and
glory in Heaven, whoſe Prayers by conſequence
are acceptable and available with God. But the
ſupreme Deity of the Heathens is known to be
Jupiter, and their inferiour Deuits, Venus,
Mars, Bacchus, Vulcan, and the like rabble
of Devils, as the Scripture calls th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m; and
therefore there can be no conſequence, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Heathens were Idolaters in the worſhip
of theſe though they pretended not to give them
the worſhip proper to Jupiter the ſupreme God;
therefore Catholicks muſt be guilty of Idolatry
in deſiring the ſervants of the true God to pray
for them to him. 2. In the manner of worſhip,
becauſe I ſaid, if any of the Heathens did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(as the Platoniſts) to the knowledge of the
true God, yet as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, they did not
glorify him as God, but changed his glory into
an Image made like to corruptible Man, ador<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>g
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48446:210"/>
and offering ſacrifice, due to God alone, to the
Statues themſelves, or the inferiour Deities they
ſuppoſed to dwell or aſſiſt in them; which <hi>St.
Auſtin,</hi> upon the 96. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> proves to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
or evil Angels, becauſe they required ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to be offered to them, and would be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
as Gods. What he meant by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Invocation, I ſaid I did not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
but Catholicks, I told him, underſtand
no more by it in this matter, but deſiring or
praying the Saints to pray for them. And if
this were Idolatry, we muſt not deſire the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of a just Man, even in this life, becauſe this
formal Invocation will be to make him an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Deity. 2. I anſwer'd, that the ſame
Calumny was caſt upon the Catholicks in <hi>St.
Auſtin</hi>'s time, and is anſwered by him, and
his Anſwer will ſerve as well now as then, in
his Twentieth Book againſt Fauſtus, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.
who himſelf held ſuch formal Invocation a part
of the Worſhip due to Saints, as is evident from
the Prayer he made to <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> after his
Martyrdome, l. 7. de Bapt. c. Donat. c. 1.
And <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf confeſseth it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
at that time to ſay, Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> or Holy
<hi>Peter</hi> pray for Us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This indeed was my Anſwer, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, he undertakes to ſhow two things:</hi>
1. That the diſparity between Catholicks wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Saints, and the Heathens wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of their inferiour Deities,<note place="margin">p. 139.</note> is not
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48446:211"/>
ſo great as to excuſe them from Idolatry. 2.
That the Anſwer given by <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> doth not
vindicate them now, as well as then.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. 1. Concerning the <hi>diſparity; 1. As
to the Object of Worſhip,</hi> he abhors from his
heart <hi>to parallel the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly Angels and Saints
with the impure Deities of the Heathens, as to
their Excellencies.</hi> No. He hath more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for them than not to think them <hi>more
excellent,</hi> than <hi>Devils,</hi> or <hi>wicked Wretches:</hi>
I ſuppoſe in caſe they have the teſtimony of
<hi>Scripture</hi> for their <hi>ſanctity;</hi> otherwiſe it may
go hard with the beſt of them, ſhould he
proceed in the ſame form with all the reſt,
as he doth a little below with St. <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
But ſuppoſing them at preſent to be <hi>more
excellent,</hi> than the <hi>impure Deities</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
yet <hi>if the Idolatry of the Heathens,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>lay not only in this, that they worſhipped Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
and Venus, and Vulcan, who are ſuppoſed
to have been wicked Wretches; but in this, that
they gave Divine Worſhip to any, beſides God,
then this diſparity cannot excuſe Catholicks
from being Idolaters.</hi> Behold here the <hi>ground</hi>
upon which he intends to <hi>build</hi> his <hi>Charge</hi>
of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Viz. <hi>That Catholicks give divine
honour to the Holy Angels and Saints.</hi> This
is what the Reader <hi>muſt ſuppoſe,</hi> otherwiſe
his Arguments are at an End; and having
laid this <hi>falſe</hi> and ſcandalous ſuppoſition,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48446:211"/>
inſtead of proving it, he undertakes to ſhow
out of the <hi>Primitive Fathers, that it was the
Property of the Chriſtian Religion to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worſhip to none, but God himſelf and his
Son Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> To this purpoſe he cites
<hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> to whom he ſays he might add,
<hi>if it were requiſite in ſo Evident a matter,</hi> the
teſtimonies of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,
Cyprian, Origen, Athenagoras, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Arnobius,</hi> (and who not, that ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the Name of Chriſtian?) <hi>who
all agree that Religious</hi> (by which he means
<hi>divine) worſhip is proper to the true God, and
that no created Being is capable of it;</hi> and in
this ſtrain he runs on for no leſs than Ten
Leaves together: and at length without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
proving that <hi>Catholicks do give divine
worſhip to the Holy Angels and Saints,</hi> he moſt
triumphantly concluded them to be <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
This is the ſumme of his performance,
and by it I underſtand that it had been no
<hi>great skill</hi> in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to have made any
of thoſe Perſons who <hi>honoured</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when they were upon Earth, or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
their Prayers,</hi> to be <hi>Idolaters.</hi> They
needed not any other proof, but only to <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
confidently, that <hi>they gave to them the
worſhip proper to God alone,</hi> and the work
was done; eſpecially if they had but cited
that Text of Scripture, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48446:212"/>
Lord thy God, and Him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
I confeſs when I ſaid, that I thought it would
be as eaſy to prove <hi>Snow</hi> to be <hi>black,</hi> as the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to be <hi>Idolatry;</hi> I did not reflect, that
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> might <hi>ſuppoſe Catholicks to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worſhip to the Saints,</hi> and ſo conclude
them to be <hi>Idolaters.</hi> But this, (as I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member)
is a Peculiar Topick, of which all
thoſe who oppoſe the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
are forced to make uſe; Viz. to ſuppoſe
<hi>her Doctrine</hi> not to be <hi>what ſhe affirms,</hi> but
what <hi>they would have her to affirm,</hi> and from
thence to make her guilty of what <hi>Crimes</hi>
and <hi>Enormities</hi> they p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>§. 4. Now although the Teſtimonies of
the Fathers he alledges, are ſo impertinent
to the preſent Queſtion, as I have ſhewed,
yet becauſe ſome of them, as they are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly</hi>
reported, or <hi>advantageouſly tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
by him, may give occaſion to an unwary
<hi>Reader</hi> to ſuſpect, that they meant to deny that
<hi>any worſhip at all was to be given to any beſides
God:</hi> I ſhal take the pains to unfold their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and free him from any ſuch Jealouſy, by
ſhowing that when they deny in general
terms <hi>worſhip</hi> to be given to a <hi>Creature,</hi> they
mean <hi>divine worſhip,</hi> which is due to <hi>God</hi>
alone; and not that <hi>worſhip</hi> which is given
to <hi>Men,</hi> upon account either of their <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:48446:212"/>
or <hi>Supernatural</hi> Endowments; or for the
<hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> they hold in the <hi>Church</hi> or
<hi>Common-Wealth.</hi> For as there is a worſhip
due to <hi>Men</hi> for the <hi>former;</hi> ſo alſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
for the <hi>latter.</hi> And we have an Example
of it in Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf, in his <hi>Irenicum,</hi>
p. 413. [Printed at <hi>London, An. 1662.]</hi>
Where, ſpeaking of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> he calls him,
<hi>Our Reverend and Learned Mr.</hi> Baxter:
<hi>Learned,</hi> I ſuppoſe for his <hi>knowledge;</hi> but
<hi>Reverend</hi> for his <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> in the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
and ſo worthy of <hi>double,</hi> if not of <hi>treble</hi>
honour.</p>
                  <p>Thus much premiſed of the <hi>different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi>
there are of worſhip, as alſo that it is
a thing notoriouſly known, that many of the
<hi>Heathen Emperors</hi> exacted to be worſhipped
as <hi>Gods,</hi> that is, with <hi>divine worſhip;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Teſtimony out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>
(p. 141.) anſwers it ſelf, becauſe where he
tells the <hi>Emperours, that Chriſt did perſwade
Men to worſhip God alone,</hi> &amp;c. He
preſently adds,<note place="margin">Apol. 2.</note> that <hi>the ſame
Chriſt commanded Christians to
give unto Caeſar the things which
are Caeſars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> of which <hi>Honour</hi> is
One, in the Judgment of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And the
like had been manifeſt of
<hi>Theophilus Antiochenus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theophil. ad Autol. li. 1.</note> if the
Doctor had fairly ſet down
his words, for he expreſly
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48446:213"/>
affirmeth, that although <hi>the King was not
ordained to be adored, yet He was to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
with that lawful worſhip, which belongs
to Him.</hi> And this is inſinuated in the very
words cited by the Doctor himſelf. [viz. <hi>as
the King ſuffers none under him to be called by
his Name, nor is it lawful to give it to any,</hi> but
<hi>himſelf, ſo neither is it to worſhip any but God
alone]</hi> for although the <hi>King</hi> will ſuffer none
under him to be called by his <hi>Name</hi> yet he
requires that <hi>reſpect</hi> be given to thoſe whom
he conſtitutes <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> under
Him, according to their degree and quality.
And <hi>God</hi> himſelf, although he forbid to give
his own <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Honour</hi> to any but Himſelf,
yet he commands us to give <hi>honour</hi> to whom
<hi>honour</hi> is <hi>due,</hi> Rom. 13. 7. And that this
was the meaning both of <hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>
we need no better Expoſitor than <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
who was neer upon
contemporary with them;<note place="margin">Scorpiac. c. 14.</note>
and tells us that <hi>the King
is then to be honoured, when he keeps <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

within his own Sphere, and abſtains from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
honours; Quum a divinis honoribus lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge

the Doctor meant by alledging theſe <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
of thoſe <hi>two</hi> ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> unleſs he
intend to deny <hi>any worſhip</hi> at all to be <hi>due</hi> to
<hi>any</hi> beſides <hi>God;</hi> or that he think it not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to worſhip a <hi>good</hi> Man for his <hi>vertue</hi>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:48446:213"/>
and <hi>ſanctity,</hi> but we muſt give him <hi>divine
honour.</hi> If he produc'd them for no other
End, but to ſhow that we ought not to give
<hi>divine worſhip</hi> to any created Being whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it is evident they are <hi>not</hi> at all to the
<hi>purpoſe,</hi> it being far from the minds and
hearts of <hi>Catholicks</hi> to give <hi>that honour</hi> to the
<hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. But then the old ſcruple returns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Why he may not as well honour God by
giving worſhip to the Sun, as to Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Loyola,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 143.</note> 
                     <hi>or St. Francis, or any
other late Canoniz'd Saint!</hi> (He
might have added, if he had pleas'd, or to
one not yet Canonized, <hi>his Reverend Mr.
Baxter?) For he is ſure the Sun</hi> (and why not
the moſt Reverend Sun?) <hi>is a certain Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God's Goodneſs, Wiſdome and Power,
and he cannot be miſtaken therein, but he can
never be certain of the Holineſs of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
he is to give divine Worſhip to.</hi> Thus
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> And certainly he muſt believe his
Readers to be all <hi>stark blind,</hi> who cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
the <hi>Reverence</hi> due to a Perſon for
his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> from <hi>Divine Worſhip:</hi> or that a
<hi>Saint</hi> is not a <hi>greater Monument of GOD's
Goodneſs, Wiſdome and Power,</hi> than the <hi>Sun.</hi>
But by his particularizing the late <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
Saints,</hi> it ſeems he is ſatisfied, that St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were greater <hi>Monuments</hi>
of the <hi>Divine Goodneſs, Wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:48446:214"/>
than the <hi>Sun;</hi> that <hi>more</hi> were raiſed to love
<hi>God</hi> by ſeeing the <hi>light</hi> of their <hi>example,</hi> than
by gazing upon that <hi>bright Planet:</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that we may much better honour
<hi>God</hi> by giving worſhip to <hi>them,</hi> at leaſt, than
to the <hi>Sun;</hi> and perhaps to St. <hi>Francis</hi> too,
becauſe he is ſo kind as to honour him here
with the title of <hi>Saint.</hi> But his quarrel, I
perceive, is particularly to <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi>
(as he irreverently calls him) <hi>who for ought
he can know,</hi> (he ſays) <hi>was a great hypocrite,
but he is ſure the Sun is none.</hi> And whether
will his <hi>ſpight</hi> againſt the <hi>Saints,</hi> at length
hurry him, if we may not <hi>honour</hi> a Man
for the great Vertue and Piety, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in him, becauſe <hi>for ought we can know,</hi>
he is a <hi>hypocrite?</hi> What if the like ſcruple
ſhould poſſeſs his mind in order to St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the reſt of
the Primitive <hi>Saints?</hi> It were but to ſay of
<hi>them,</hi> what he doth of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that <hi>for
ought he can know, they were great hypocrites:</hi>
For, <hi>He knows the beſt of Men have their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and to what degree it is impoſſible to
underſtand, but he is certain the ſpots in the Sun
are no moral impurities, nor diſpleaſing to God.</hi>
And may he not ſay the ſame of the <hi>Martyrs</hi>
too, that <hi>for ought he knows,</hi> they did not lay
down their lives purely for the <hi>truth</hi> of the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> but perhaps becauſe they were <hi>weary</hi>
of them, or for <hi>vain glory,</hi> or out of <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,</hi>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:48446:214"/>
not to yield to their Adverſaries? If,
I ſay, ſuch a <hi>ſcruple</hi> as this ſhould come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his mind, what poſſibility were there of
his ever being freed from it, but by <hi>Divine
Revelation?</hi> Yet ſome Aſſiſtance I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
give him, by letting him ſee the <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs</hi>
of the <hi>ſcruple,</hi> by the <hi>abſurdneſs</hi>
of the Conſequences, which muſt follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. For if it be not lawful to honour a
Saint, ſuppoſed to be in Heaven, becauſe <hi>for
ought he can know, he was a great hypocrite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth;</hi> it follows by the ſame <hi>Rule,</hi> that
we may not <hi>honour</hi> any Perſon in this Life;
for the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which ſhines in his <hi>life</hi>
and <hi>converſation,</hi> for fear we ſhould honour
an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> for a <hi>Saint.</hi> And I ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
<hi>him</hi> by <hi>no means</hi> to preach <hi>this Doctrine</hi>
to his <hi>Auditors,</hi> leaſt they ſhould entertain
the ſame <hi>ſcruple</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> which he doth of
the <hi>Saints</hi> now raigning with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Glory.</hi>
O, but they are the <hi>late Canonized Saints,</hi>
that he is not in perfect Charity with (for
if he were, he would never <hi>refuſe</hi> to <hi>honour</hi>
them, upon a <hi>meer whimſy,</hi> that <hi>for ought he
can know,</hi> they were great <hi>Hypocrites:)</hi> and
<hi>Philip Nerius,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>could not be miſtaken
in the ſhining of the Sun, although he might be
in the ſhining of Ignatius his face, which yet is
thought ſo conſiderable a thing,</hi> (it ſeems it was
not the only thing) <hi>that it is read in the Leſſons
of the Roman Breviary.</hi> But whoever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48446:215"/>
the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> uſed at this Day
by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in examining the
<hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> of thoſe
Perſons whom She <hi>Canonizes,</hi> ſhall find it
every way as great, if not greater than in the
<hi>Primitive</hi> times. I muſt confeſs the <hi>Dr.</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
ſcruple of <hi>For ought he can know—</hi>
is able to defeat the greateſt diligence Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:
and ſo no doubt it had the <hi>dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of that <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſome years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
in <hi>Memory</hi> of our late Royal Soveraign <hi>K.
Charles</hi> I. had it depended upon his deciſive
Vote. As for the <hi>ſhining</hi> of S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> his <hi>face,</hi>
he is <hi>not</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> vouchſafed to
honour with that outward <hi>ſign</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi>
which <hi>ſhined</hi> in his Soul; and although the
<hi>Roman Breviary</hi> make mention of it only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Teſtimony of <hi>Philip Nerius,</hi> yet that
<hi>Philip Nerius</hi> is known to have been a Man
of that <hi>ſanctity</hi> and <hi>integrity,</hi> that he would
not have <hi>ſtained</hi> his own <hi>Soul,</hi> to caſt a <hi>falſe
light</hi> upon another Man's <hi>face.</hi> I am ſure,
<hi>though the ſpots in the Sun are no Moral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities,
nor diſpleaſing to God;</hi> yet ſuch
<hi>groundleſs ſuſpitions,</hi> and <hi>raſh judgments</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Perſons of ſo <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>approved</hi>
Vertue, muſt needs be highly <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> to
him. What he adds of <hi>giving worſhip to
Kings and their ſtatues, as well as to Saints
and their Images,</hi> is altogether impertinent,
for if he mean <hi>divine worſhip,</hi> we deny it may
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48446:215"/>
lawfully be given to either of them; and if
he ſpeak of <hi>ſuch worſhip</hi> as may be given to
<hi>Men,</hi> I would willingly underſtand, why the
<hi>Saints</hi> may not be honoured as the <hi>adopted
Children of God,</hi> as well as <hi>Kings</hi> for that
they are his <hi>Vice-gerents?</hi> I would alſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
underſtand yet farther, whether he
allow any honour at all to be due to <hi>Princes</hi>
upon <hi>that account;</hi> for I do not remember
hitherto any paſſage in him, (though he
have had frequent occaſion to ſpeak of them)
from whence I could gather, that he holds
it <hi>lawful</hi> to give <hi>any worſhip</hi> either to their
<hi>statues,</hi> or to <hi>themſelves.</hi> And upon the ſame
Principles that he denies <hi>any</hi> to be due to
the <hi>Saints,</hi> a <hi>Quaker</hi> would prove that it
muſt be denied to <hi>Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 6. <hi>What hitherto hath been alledged
by the Doctor, to prove us guilty of</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<hi>it ſeems was not ſo full to the purpoſe,
as himſelf could wiſh it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will now come home to the
caſe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 145.</note> 
                     <hi>And this it is.</hi> The Heathens
were not ſuch Fools, as ſome would make them:
<hi>(nor yet altogether</hi> ſo wiſe <hi>as</hi> he <hi>would make
them, if we may believe the</hi> Fathers,) to
excuſe themſelves: For, though <hi>(ſaith he)</hi>
they gave worſhip to ſome, whom they conſider'd
as the greateſt Benefactors to Man-kind, yet
ſtill they acknowledged one ſupreme God, not
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48446:216"/>
Jupiter of Creet, but the Father of gods and
men: Only they ſaid, this ſupreme God being of
ſo high a Nature, and there being other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Beings between Him and men, whoſe
Office they conceived it was, to carry the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Men to God, and to bring down help from
Him to them, they thought it very fitting to
addreſs their ſolemn ſupplications to them.
Here now, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> is the very ſame caſe in
debate, (altering only the Names of Things)
which is between us and the Church of Rome,
and if ever they ſpeak home to our caſe, they
must do it upon this Point. And ſo they do,
but very little to their comfort. <hi>Here then we
muſt fix our</hi> Foot, <hi>and if we can ſhow the</hi>
caſe not <hi>to be the</hi> ſame, <hi>we ſhall by his own
Confeſſion ſpeak home to the Point; and we
ſhall more-over have this</hi> comfort <hi>at leaſt,
that we</hi> ſuffer this reproach <hi>(of being paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
to</hi> Heathens) falſly, <hi>for</hi> God<hi>'s ſake. In
order to this I ſhall ſhow, 1. What the</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God <hi>of the</hi> Heathens <hi>was. 2. What
were thoſe</hi> Intermediate Beings. 3dly. <hi>What
was their</hi> Office; <hi>And,</hi> 4thly, <hi>What kind of</hi>
ſervice <hi>they required.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. For the <hi>ſupreme God Jupiter,</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
ſays, <hi>it was not he of Creet, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of gods and men.</hi> And the <hi>Poets</hi> indeed
call him ſo, (of whom <hi>Horace</hi> confeſſeth, that
they took the priviledge to dare to fain and
ſay any thing.) But how <hi>glorious</hi> ſoever the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48446:216"/>
                     <hi>Title</hi> be, yet <hi>Origen</hi> tells us
in expreſs terms,<note place="margin">li. 5. contr. Celſ. <hi>p.</hi> 487.</note> that he
was not the <hi>true God,</hi> but a
<hi>Devil. We are ready to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>any torments rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
Jupiters to be God, for we do not believe
Jupiter and Sabaoth to be the ſame, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be any God at all, but a Devil, who is
delighted with the name of Jupiter, an Enemy
to Men and God. 2dly,</hi> For the <hi>Intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Beings,</hi> it is aſſerted by the ſame <hi>Origen,</hi>
that they were <hi>Devils</hi> alſo,
and according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently

                     <note place="margin">li. 8. cont. Celſ. <hi>p.</hi> 525.</note> in

The like is affirmed alſo by <hi>Theophilus Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochenus</hi>
above cited, and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon
the 96. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> But then becauſe <hi>the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God was conceived to be of ſo high a
Nature,</hi> that he knew not what paſſed in this
ſublunary World: Therefore, <hi>3dly,</hi> The
<hi>Office</hi> of theſe <hi>Inferiour Deities</hi> or <hi>Devils,</hi>
was <hi>to carry up the Prayers of Men to God</hi> (as
the Doctor himſelf cites
out of St.<note place="margin">li. 8. de Civ. Dei. <hi>c.</hi> 14. 18. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but very
inſincerely, for St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſaith, not to <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>ad
Deos,</hi> to the <hi>Gods,</hi> that is, to <hi>Devils,) out of a
ſuppoſition, that they cannot know the neceſſities
and prayers of Men, but by Intervention of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48446:217"/>
theſe Spirits; and ſo to bring down to Men the
bleſſings they prayed for:</hi> And, <hi>4thly,</hi> To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to perform this <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Nuncii</hi>
or Meſſengers, (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> calls them,)
they exacted of Men to give

<hi>Heathens Divinity</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> The Doctor's
<hi>Father</hi> of Gods and <hi>Men,</hi> was according to
the <hi>Fathers,</hi> an <hi>Arch-Devil;</hi> The <hi>Inferiour
Deities,</hi> were <hi>Inferiour Devils.</hi> Their <hi>Office</hi>
was to <hi>inform</hi> the <hi>Superiour Gods,</hi> of what

for this ſervice, was no leſs than the
<hi>Offering</hi> of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to their <hi>Devil-ſhips.</hi> And
now, was this the <hi>very ſame caſe (altering
only the Names of Things) which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is
in debate between Him and the Church of Rome
concerning the Invocation of Saints?</hi> Surely,
a more <hi>Injurious Calumny</hi> ſcarce ever dropt

                     </note> I

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48446:217"/>
that wiſe <hi>Father of Gods and Men,</hi> who was

are not <hi>Devils</hi> or <hi>wicked Wretches,</hi> but
the <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whom the
Doctor himſelf (as little reſpect as he hath
for them) acknowledges to exceed <hi>thoſe
other</hi> in <hi>excellency. 3dly,</hi> Their <hi>Office</hi> is not
to inform the <hi>Supream God</hi> of what he knows
not, but to be <hi>Joynt Petitioners</hi> with us, and
for us, to his <hi>divine Majesty,</hi> as other <hi>Holymen</hi>
are upon Earth. <hi>4thly,</hi> and Laſtly, We
do not procure, or buy this favour of them,
by offering <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to them; for as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>

ſame Holy Doctor there ſaith, <hi>We celebrate
their Memory with Religious Solemnity, both
to excite us to their imitation, and to become
partakers of their Merits and Prayers: but ſo
that we erect Altars not to any of the Martyrs
but to the God of Martyrs, although in Memory
of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now having ſpoken thus <hi>home</hi> to the
<hi>Caſe,</hi> I leave it to the Reader's Judgment,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48446:218"/>
whether the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Catholicks</hi> in <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Invocating</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi> be the <hi>ſame</hi>
with that of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> in the <hi>worſhip</hi> of
their <hi>Inferiour Deities?</hi> To make the Caſe
run Parallel on all four, the Doctor muſt
prove, either that the <hi>God</hi> we <hi>worſhip</hi> is not
the very <hi>true God,</hi> but an <hi>Arch-Devil;</hi> or that
the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> are not <hi>his friends</hi>
and <hi>ſervants,</hi> but <hi>inferiour Devils;</hi> Or that
we believe <hi>him</hi> to be <hi>ſo ignorant,</hi> that he
ſtands in <hi>need</hi> of <hi>them</hi> to <hi>inform</hi> him; or that
we offer <hi>ſacrifice</hi> and erect <hi>Altars</hi> to <hi>them.</hi>
And when he can do <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> of theſe, he
will ſpeak ſomething to the Point. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>theſe</hi> are none of thoſe <hi>things, which he
threatens largely to prove, if further occaſion
be given.</hi> And I have good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſo, by his preſent undertaking, which
is not to prove any of theſe things (in which
the <hi>Parallel</hi> muſt conſiſt, if there be any,)
but to caſt a <hi>miſt</hi> before his Readers eyes,

Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
is not whether <hi>divine worſhip</hi> be
to be given to the <hi>Saints,</hi> (for this is abhor'd

<hi>Queſtion</hi> between us, which the Doctor, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid

(he ſaith) <hi>inſiſt upon theſe two things.
1. That the Fathers did condemn all
ſuch kind of worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>ſuppoſing their
Principle true,</hi> that is, as far as I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it, ſuppoſing what they ſaid was <hi>true.
2. That they did not only condemn it, in thoſe
ſpirits, which the Heathens worſhipped, but in
good Angels themſelves.</hi> And before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
with Him upon the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48446:219"/>
                     <hi>Fathers,</hi> I muſt diſperſe the Miſt he raiſes by
his Egregious <hi>equivocating</hi> in the <hi>words, All
ſuch kind of worſhip.</hi> What kind of worſhip
is it the <hi>Fathers</hi> deny may be given to <hi>the
most excellent created Beings?</hi> He tells us,
(p. 145.) <hi>any Religious Worſhip.</hi> And what
doth he mean by <hi>Religious Worſhip? To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi>
(ſaith Mr. <hi>Thorndike)
whether we are bound to honour
the Saints or not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epil. part. 3. p. 353.</note> 
                     <hi>were to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
whether we are to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and to believe this or not. Whether this
be Religious or Civil, nothing but equivocation
of words makes diſputable, and the cauſe of that
equivocation the want of words; vulgar uſe
not having provided words properly to ſignify
conceptions, which came not from Common
ſenſe.—Plainly their excellence, and the
Relation we have to them, being Intelligible on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Chriſtianity, muſt borrow a Name from
that, which vulgar language attributes to God,
or to Men our Superiours.</hi> And then a little
after he ſaith. <hi>That the Relation which God
hath ſettled between the Church Militant and
Triumphant, may be reaſonably called Religious,
provided that the diſtance be not confounded
between the Religious honour of God, and that
Honour of the Creature, which the Religious ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God enjoins, being neither Civil nor
Humane, but ſuch as a Creature is capable of
for Religion's ſake, and that Relation which it
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48446:219"/>
ſettleth.</hi> By this it appears, that if the Doctor
mean by <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> that <hi>Honor</hi> which
is due to <hi>God</hi> alone, it is <hi>true</hi> what the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
ſay, that <hi>It is not to be given to the moſt
excellent created Beings,</hi> but nothing at all to
the Point in debate between us. If he mean,
<hi>that Honour of which a Creature is capable of

ſettleth,</hi> I ſhall ſhow it to be <hi>falſe</hi> that the
<hi>Fathers</hi> deny any <hi>ſuch honour</hi> to be given to
the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi> And if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

                     <note place="margin">de Civit. Dei. li. 10. c. 1.</note> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> will tell

honoured by Chriſtians, muſt find in his heart
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48446:220"/>
by conſequence, to wiſh that Chriſtianity had not
prevailed.</hi> Whether this Cenſure of Mr.
<hi>Thorndike</hi>'s be applicable to my Adverſary,
or no, depends upon his allowing, or not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
ſuch honour to the <hi>Saints,</hi> as is plain
was given them by <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but for the
diſtinction he makes between the <hi>Religious

Reader ſee, how he hath <hi>perverted</hi> their
meaning, and yet ſaid nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. The firſt he cites is <hi>Origen,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>the Scripture doth indeed ſtile God,
the God of Gods, and Lord of
Lords,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contr. Celſ. li. 8. in princ.</note> 
                     <hi>but withall ſaith, that
to us there is but one God the
Father, of whom are all things,
and One Lord Jeſus Christ by whom are all
things, and we by Him—And his mind aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
up to the ſupreme God who worſhips him
inſeparably and indiviſibly by his Son, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
conducts us to the Father. Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there are many Gods, and many Lords, we
endeavour by all means not only to carry our
minds above thoſe things on Earth, which are
worſhipped by the Heathen for Gods, but above
thoſe whom the Scripture calls Gods,</hi> by which
<hi>Origen</hi> means the <hi>Angels.</hi> To this I anſwer,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48446:220"/>
that it is plain from the very words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that the worſhip which <hi>Origen</hi> here
contends, ought not to be given to <hi>Angels,</hi>
is <hi>divine worſhip</hi> proper to God alone; for
he ſpeaks only of <hi>that worſhip,</hi> which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the <hi>Father inſeparably and indiviſibly
by his Son.</hi> And when-ever <hi>ſuch worſhip</hi> is
to be given, we muſt not only carry our
minds above thoſe things which were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
by the <hi>Heathens</hi> for <hi>Gods,</hi> but above
the good <hi>Angels</hi> alſo, becauſe they are not
<hi>inſeparably</hi> and <hi>indiviſibly One</hi> with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
as the <hi>Son</hi> is, who alone can conduct us
by his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Merits</hi> to the <hi>Father.</hi>
And this is yet more plain from the Reply,
which <hi>Origen</hi> gave to that Evaſion of <hi>Celſus,
viz.</hi> that <hi>None were to be honoured for Gods,
but thoſe to whom the ſupreme God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
it;</hi> for, denying any ſuch honour
to have been granted by God to the <hi>Heroes</hi>
or <hi>Daemons</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> he proves from
<hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and <hi>Precepts,</hi> that
this honour was given to <hi>Chriſt, Ut omnes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norent
Filium, ſicut Patrem honorant,</hi> that <hi>all
ſhould honour the Son, as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that is, that they ſhould honour him
as <hi>God,</hi> which the Doctor tranſlates <hi>that they
who honour the Father, ſhould honour the Son
alſo;</hi> tacitly inſinuating that no honour at
all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght be lawfully given, but to the Son.
And again, when <hi>Celſus</hi> objects, <hi>that by the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48446:221"/>
ſame Rule that Chriſtians gave honor to Chriſt,
he thought they might give it to Inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi>
The account which <hi>Origen</hi> gives of the
worſhip which <hi>Christians</hi> attribute to the
Son, [viz. <hi>becauſe it is ſaid, I and my Father
are One.]</hi> makes it yet more evident, that he
ſpeaks of <hi>divine worſhip,</hi> which cannot be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to any created Beings; and not of ſuch
an <hi>Inferiour Worſhip,</hi> of which Creatures are
capable upon account of their <hi>Holineſs</hi> and
<hi>Relation</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> For of <hi>theſe</hi> he ſaith (and
who will not wonder to ſee it cited, though
but imperfectly, by the Doctor
himſelf) <hi>that if Celſus had ſpoken
of the true Ministers of God after
his only begotten Son,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 148.</note> 
                     <hi>ſuch as Gabriel, Michael,
and all the Angels and Archangels, and had
contended that they were to be worſhipped:</hi>
(which laſt words, though very material,
are left out by Dr. <hi>St.) he acknowledges that
by explaining the notion of worſhip or reſpect,
and the Actions of thoſe that give it, perhaps
he ſhould have ſaid ſomething of that Subject,
as far as the dignity of ſo great a thing, and
the reach of his understanding would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
But <hi>this</hi> not being objected by <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
but only that they were by the <hi>ſame Rule</hi>
by which they worſhipped <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> to
worſhip in like manner the <hi>Inferiour Deities</hi>
of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> he thought it not neceſſary
to enlarge upon that Subject at preſent, but
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48446:221"/>
only to ſhow the different account upon
which they worſhipped <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as one with
his <hi>Father.</hi> By which it is manifeſt he held
a certain <hi>worſhip</hi> or <hi>reſpect</hi> due to the <hi>Angels,
inferiour</hi> to that, which is
due to <hi>God</hi> alone.<note place="margin">li. 5. contr. Celſ.</note> And all
that the Doctor hath to
ſay for himſelf, is that <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith elſewhere,
<hi>Although the Angels be called Gods in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
yet we are not to worſhip them with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worſhip:</hi> which is a plain conceſſion,
that when <hi>Origen</hi> denies <hi>worſhip</hi> to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Beings, he ſpeaks of <hi>divine worſhip,</hi> and
ſo nothing againſt that <hi>Inferiour worſhip</hi> or
reſpect which is given by <hi>Catholicks</hi> to the
<hi>Holy Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3. But now the Doctor would ſeem to
ſay ſomething to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<note place="margin">li. 8. contr. Celſ.</note> when he tells us, that
<hi>Origen utterly denies, that
our Prayers are to be offered to any but Chriſt
alone, and that any word which is proper to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
worſhip, is to be attributed to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
themſelves.</hi> But he does but ſeem to
come home to the Point;
for as Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> well
obſerves,<note place="margin">Epil. part. 3. p. 353</note> 
                     <hi>The terms of
Prayer, Invocation, calling upon, and whatever
elſe we can uſe, are or may be in deſpite of our
hearts, equivocal; that is, we may be conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unleſs we uſe that diligence, which common
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48446:222"/>
diſcretion counts ſuperfluous, to uſe the ſame
words in ſignifying requests made to God and
to Men.</hi> And a little a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter. <hi>Prayer, Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
calling upon, is not ſo proper to God, but
that whether you will or not, every Petition to a
Prince or Court of Juſtice, is neceſsarily a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and he that makes it, Invocates or Calls
upon that Prince or Court for favour, or for
Justice.</hi> The Notion then of <hi>Prayer</hi> may be
diſtinguiſhed, as well as that of <hi>Worſhip:</hi>
and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves when they <hi>pray</hi>
others to <hi>pray</hi> for them, uſe it in a quite
different ſenſe, than when they <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>God:</hi>
for as applyed to <hi>God,</hi> it imports a <hi>total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi>
upon him, as the <hi>Author</hi> of all
good; but as apply'd to <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Holy-men,</hi>
it implies no more, than a <hi>Communion</hi> of
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Society</hi> in the Members of the
<hi>Church Militant,</hi> with thoſe of the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi>
for the aſſiſtance of their <hi>Prayers,</hi> to
<hi>him,</hi> who only can give what we ask. And
in this ſenſe the words <hi>Prayer, Invocation,</hi> &amp;c.
are uſed by <hi>Catholicks,</hi> when they are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi> And that
<hi>Origen,</hi> when he denies <hi>that our Prayers are to
be offered to any but Christ alone,</hi> ſpeaks of
<hi>Prayer</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> ſenſe, and not in the <hi>latter,</hi>
is evident from what he had ſaid before in
the beginning of the firſt Book, where he
acknowledges that the <hi>Angels do offer up the
Prayers of Men to God,</hi> (and ſurely it can
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48446:222"/>
never be <hi>Idolatry</hi> in us to <hi>deſire</hi> them to <hi>do</hi>
what they <hi>do;)</hi> and much more from his own
practice, in his <hi>firſt Homily</hi> upon <hi>Ezechiel,</hi>
where he <hi>Invocates</hi> an <hi>Angel</hi> in theſe words,
<hi>Come Holy Angel, and receive Him who is
converted from his former Errour.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when he ſays, <hi>We are not to pray to them
who pray for us;</hi> He adds, (as the Doctor
cites him p. 149.) <hi>That we ought not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
our ſupplications between God and them;</hi>
By which he explains himſelf to mean, that
we ought not to <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>them</hi> in the <hi>ſame
manner,</hi> as we do to <hi>God;</hi> for that indeed
were <hi>to divide our ſupplications;</hi> But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
them to <hi>offer</hi> up our <hi>Prayers,</hi> or to <hi>pray</hi>
for us, is not <hi>to divide our ſupplications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and them,</hi> but to <hi>unite their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
to ours, as we do the Prayers of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uſt</hi>
Men upon Earth, whom we deſire to <hi>pray</hi> for
us. It is evident then, and moſtly out of the
very places cited by the Doctor himſelf that
the <hi>Invocation</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> which <hi>Origen</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to be given to <hi>Angels,</hi> is <hi>that</hi> which is
due to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. But now the Doctor, weary (it
ſeems) of being ſerious ſo long to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
thought fit to entertain his Reader with
an other Eſſay (for one <hi>Enterlude</hi> of this
kind we have had already in the <hi>1st.</hi> Chap.)
of the peculiar Faculty he hath in expoſing
the Saints to deriſion. <hi>Celſus</hi> (ſaith he, p. 150)
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48446:223"/>
                     <hi>yet further urges, that according to the doctrin
of the Aegyptians, every part of a Man hath a
particular Daemon or Ethereal God, and every
one of theſe being invocated, heals the diſeaſes
of the parts proper to themſelves; why then
may they not juſtly be invocated?</hi> ſaith <hi>Celſus.</hi>
And <hi>if one of the Church of Rome,</hi> ſaith Dr.
Still. <hi>had been to anſwer him, he muſt have told
him, that the thing was rational which he ſaid,

there were no difference between the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
daemons,</hi> or <hi>Ethercal Gods,</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi>
but in the <hi>Names:</hi> or between the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
addreſſes to thoſe <hi>Devils,</hi> and thoſe of
<hi>Catholicks</hi> to the Holy <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> but
in the <hi>language;</hi> and that there needed no
more, but to correct the <hi>Names,</hi> as you
would do faults eſcaped in Printing, <hi>viz.</hi> for

St. <hi>George,</hi> who otherwiſe muſt be left out.
But the <hi>ſport</hi> is not more <hi>pleaſing</hi> to thoſe
who <hi>mock</hi> at all <hi>Religion,</hi> than I ſhall make
it appear <hi>ridiculous</hi> to all <hi>ſober Readers,</hi> by
ſhowing Two things: 1. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Doctrine and Practice of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi>
and that of <hi>Catholicks.</hi> 2. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of the practice of making ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to one particular <hi>Saint,</hi> rather than
another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> then, That <hi>Catholicks</hi> look upon the
<hi>Saints</hi> with a different regard from what the
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> did their <hi>Daemons,</hi> is evident, in
that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> believed <hi>them</hi> to be <hi>Gods,</hi>
which is far from the hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of any <hi>Catholick</hi>
to believe of the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints:</hi> And it
is no leſs evident that the addreſſes they
make to them are <hi>different</hi> from thoſe the
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> made to thoſe <hi>Gods,</hi> becauſe as
<hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Invocation</hi> which <hi>Celſus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for, was <hi>Votiva illis ſacrificia reddere,
to offer ſacrifice to them,</hi> (which is due to
<hi>God</hi> alone) and that upon account that they
had power to heal the <hi>Diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſes</hi> of the <hi>Parts</hi>
proper to themſelves: But the <hi>Invocation</hi>
which <hi>Catholicks</hi> make to the <hi>Holy Angels</hi>
and <hi>Saints,</hi> is but to deſire them, as we do
Holy Men upon Earth, to pray for us. And
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48446:224"/>
therefore when the Doctor ſaith, that <hi>If one
of the Church of Rome had been to Anſwer
Celſus, he must have told him, that the thing
was Rational which he ſaid.</hi> I muſt tell him,
that what he ſaith is <hi>Irrational</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
both the <hi>Conceit</hi> they have of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
and <hi>Saints,</hi> and the <hi>addreſſes</hi> they make
to them, as I have ſhewed, are point blank
<hi>oppoſite</hi> to thoſe of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> But now
on the other ſide, ſuppoſing the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>
had the ſame <hi>conceit</hi> of their <hi>Daemons,</hi> which
<hi>Catholicks</hi> have of the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi>
and that they did no more but as <hi>Catholicks</hi>
do, deſire them to pray for them to the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
God;</hi> would it follow that <hi>Catholicks</hi>
may not deſire the Prayers of the <hi>Saints</hi> and
<hi>Angels?</hi> No more, than becauſe the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
erected <hi>Temples,</hi> and offred <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to
their <hi>great God Oſiris;</hi> therefore <hi>Catholicks</hi>
may not do the <hi>ſame</hi> to the very <hi>true God</hi>
himſelf: or, becauſe <hi>they</hi> made their <hi>ſolemn
ſupplications</hi> to a <hi>falſe God;</hi> therefore <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
may not offer up their <hi>Prayers</hi> to the
true <hi>One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The reaſonableneſs of making addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to one particular <hi>Saint</hi> rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ſome particular occaſions: And this
will appear from the Conſideration upon
which it is uſually done, which is not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of <hi>Offices</hi> among the <hi>Saints,</hi> every one
of whom may equally intercede without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48446:224"/>
upon the Propriety of another,
and their <hi>Interceſſion</hi> may be implored by us,
in all <hi>kinds</hi> of neceſſities whatſoever; but it
is grounded upon a <hi>Reflexion,</hi> which the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant
makes either upon ſome ſignal <hi>Grace,</hi>
which ſhined in that <hi>Saint</hi> above others, as
<hi>Patience, Humility, Chaſtity,</hi> &amp;c. (for which
reaſon the <hi>Church</hi> ſaith of every one of them,
<hi>Non eſt inventus ſimilis illi, that there was no
other found like to him)</hi> or upon the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>manner</hi> of his <hi>ſuffering Martyrdom,</hi> or
ſome particular <hi>Miracle,</hi> or ſuch like <hi>remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable</hi>
paſſage in his Life and actions; which
may ſerve to excite the <hi>Hope</hi> of the ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
to obtain redreſs by means of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
in a caſe which he conceives to bear
a ſuitableneſs or conformity to ſomething
acted or ſuffered by him. Now the efficacy
of <hi>Prayer</hi> being grounded on <hi>Hope,</hi> and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
natural to us to <hi>hope</hi> for redreſs where
<hi>others</hi> have found it, or where it may more
reaſonably be expected, by reaſon of ſome
particular qualification we apprehend in the
Perſon to whom we addreſs, it is manifeſt,
that as the aboveſaid <hi>Reflexion</hi> ſerves to erect
our <hi>Hope,</hi> ſo alſo it conduces to the end of
<hi>Prayer,</hi> that is, the <hi>obtaining</hi> of what we
pray for. Hence it is, that although all the
<hi>divine</hi> Attributes are <hi>really one</hi> and the <hi>ſame
indiviſible Perfection</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> yet for <hi>pardon</hi>
we fly to his <hi>Mercy;</hi> for <hi>knowledge</hi> to his
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48446:225"/>
                     <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> for <hi>Protection</hi> to his <hi>Power,</hi> &amp;c. And
St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſigns the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of our <hi>ſins</hi> to
the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but our <hi>Juſtification</hi>
(by which we riſe to <hi>newneſs</hi> of <hi>life)</hi> to his

to death for our ſins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>and
roſe again for our Juſtification.</hi>
The reaſon whereof he gives in the Epiſtle
to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> c. 2. v. 18. Where he ſaith,
that <hi>it behoved Chriſt to be made like unto his
Brethren in all things, that he might be a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful

ſins of the People; For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in that he
ſuffred himſelf being tempted, he is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them that are tempted;</hi> that is, by what
he ſuffred himſelf, he is made <hi>prompt</hi> and
<hi>ready</hi> to ſuccour thoſe who are in <hi>affliction</hi>
and <hi>Temptation.</hi> For it was true even of his

that by his own ſufferings he had learnt how
to compaſſionate the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of others.
And <hi>this</hi> was laid down by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful
Argument to perſwade the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
to put their Hope in <hi>Him</hi> for their reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
with <hi>God,</hi> becauſe he was ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>qualified</hi> and <hi>fitted</hi> for that Work by
what he had ſuffered. Why then may not
a like Conſideration of the fitneſs or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48446:225"/>
of <hi>one Saint</hi> above others, as ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by us, (either for his <hi>eminent</hi> Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in ſuch a particular <hi>virtue,</hi> or ſome other
<hi>Remarkable</hi> paſſage in his Life) be taken as a
<hi>Motive</hi> to invite us to addreſs for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what we ſtand in need of, to <hi>his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi>
before others? The Scripture we
know to perſwade us to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>
in <hi>Adverſity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 5. 10.</note> bids us
reflect upon the <hi>ſufferance</hi> of
<hi>Job;</hi> And why may not his <hi>eminence</hi> in that
virtue, as it ſerves for an <hi>example</hi> of our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
be alſo taken as a particular <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
of our having recourſe to his <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</hi>
And when <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed the two <hi>Sons</hi>
of <hi>Joſeph, Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> among ſo
many <hi>Angels</hi> whoſe aſſiſtance he might have
implored, he beggs for that <hi>Angel</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to be their <hi>Guardian,</hi> who had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him out of all his troubles. <hi>The Angel,</hi>
ſaith he; <hi>who delivered me
from all evils,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 48. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>bleſs theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
And why? but becauſe
he thought that <hi>he</hi> who had been ſo careful
to deliver <hi>him,</hi> would be as careful to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>them.</hi> And upon this account were I in
danger of being ſhip wrackt, I ſhould ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
fly to the Interceſſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had
ſaved by his Prayers all his Fellow-paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in the Ship from being drowned, than
to <hi>another</hi> who had never been in the like
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48446:226"/>
danger. Behold here then the <hi>Crime</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
in calling particularly upon the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
Raphael when they travel,</hi> becauſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
young <hi>Tobias</hi> in his Journey; upon
<hi>St. Roch against the Plague,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
was ſignal in aſſiſting thoſe who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected
with it: upon <hi>St. Nicholas against
Tempeſts,</hi> becauſe he ſaved ſome by his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who in a ſtorm at Sea invoked him,
while yet alive: upon <hi>St. Apollonia for the
Tooth-ach,</hi> becauſe all her Teeth were ſtruck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
out for her free Confeſſion of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and
upon St. <hi>Michael</hi> and St. <hi>George</hi> againſt <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
becauſe the latter was by <hi>Profeſſion</hi> a
<hi>Souldier,</hi> and a moſt valiant <hi>Martyr.</hi> And
the <hi>former</hi> is recorded in Scripture to be the
<hi>Protector of the People of God.</hi>
This is the <hi>Crime</hi> for which
the Doctor charges <hi>Catholicks</hi>
with <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 10. 21. &amp; 12. 1.</note> But if it be a
<hi>Crime</hi> in them, it is much like that of a
<hi>Beggar,</hi> who <hi>hopes</hi> to find <hi>relief</hi> at that <hi>door,</hi>
where he hears others have been <hi>relieved</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The Doctor perhaps to carry on his
<hi>ſport,</hi> will inſtance in ſome addreſſes that are
made to particular <hi>Saints</hi> upon ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
which ſeem to him <hi>ridiculous,</hi> or it
may be <hi>contrary</hi> to what happened to the
<hi>Saint.</hi> But while I defend the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi>
of the <hi>practice</hi> in it ſelf, I am not bound to
defend, that <hi>all</hi> who uſe it, take the <hi>hints</hi> of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48446:226"/>
their application to one <hi>Saint</hi> before another
from <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> Motives. This I
know, that what ſeems <hi>ridiculous</hi> to One
who ſcoffs at <hi>devotion,</hi> may ſerve to raiſe
affections in another who is <hi>truly devout:</hi>
And the <hi>Chananaean</hi> Woman, when <hi>our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>

good to take the Children's
bread and cast it to Dogs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 15. 26.</note>
drew an <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> from whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
who had not <hi>her Faith</hi> would have
taken a <hi>Motive</hi> of <hi>deſpair.</hi> In fine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Point, let us ſuppoſe that <hi>Martha</hi>
and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who are now <hi>glorious
Saints</hi> in Heaven, were again living upon
Earth, I would gladly know whether a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
guilty of <hi>Incontinency,</hi> might not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being guilty alſo of <hi>Aegyptian Idolatry,</hi>
conceive a greater <hi>Hope</hi> of obtaining God's
favour by the Prayers of ſo <hi>Exemplar</hi> a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,</hi>
than by thoſe of her <hi>Siſter,</hi> though more
<hi>Innocent?</hi> Surely the Parallel <hi>Example</hi> of her
<hi>Converſion,</hi> and the particular Zeal ſhe muſt
have for the <hi>Converſion</hi> of others, would
ſoon determin the devotion of the <hi>Penitent</hi>
to have recourſe to <hi>her</hi> Interceſſion? The
Caſe is the ſame now ſhe is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> for
ſhe hath not loſt her <hi>Charity</hi> by being there.
And the caſe is the ſame in addreſſes made
to other <hi>Saints,</hi> upon like accounts, as I
ſhewed above. When therefore the Doctor
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48446:227"/>
hath a mind hereafter to change the names
of the <hi>Aegyptian Gods,</hi> who according to
their doctrin preſided over the ſeveral parts
of Man; let him, if he pleaſe, tranſcribe
out of the <hi>Almanack</hi> the <hi>Anatomy of Mans
Body, as the parts thereof are govern'd by the
Twelve Signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,
Leo, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Characters</hi> at leaſt may ſtand
indifferently, as <hi>Hieroglyphical</hi> Notes either
of the <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> or <hi>Aegyptian De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities.</hi>
But nothing can be more ridiculous,
than to aſſert, that there is <hi>no diſparity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Aegyptians worſhip</hi> of thoſe <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and the <hi>honour</hi> which <hi>Catholicks</hi> give to
the <hi>Saints,</hi> but in the <hi>Names.</hi> Thus much
for <hi>Origen.</hi>

                  <p>§. 5. <hi>His</hi> ſecond <hi>Teſtimony is out of the
Commentaries, under the
Name of St.</hi> Ambroſe,<note place="margin">In Ep. ad Rom. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>where
that Authour ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi>
thoſe who neglecting
the true God, ſaid it was ſufficient for them
to worſhip only the things which are ſeen, <hi>ſays,
that</hi> they made uſe of a miſerable excuſe, which

                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that it is evident by the
Anſwer of that Author, as ſet down by the
Doctor, that he ſpeaks of <hi>thoſe who gave the
honour due to God, to a Creature, and forſake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, adored their Fellow-ſervants.</hi> Whom
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48446:227"/>
therefore he compares to <hi>thoſe who give the
honour due to the King, to any of his Courtiers;</hi>
which as <hi>he</hi> doth not, who only makes uſe
of a <hi>Courtier</hi> to <hi>recommend</hi> him to the <hi>King:</hi>
ſo neither do <hi>Catholicks</hi> give the <hi>honour</hi> due
to <hi>God,</hi> to the <hi>Saints,</hi> who only require the
favour of their <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> But here the
Doctor makes a terrible blunder by his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
tranſlating thoſe words of the Author,
<hi>[Suffragatore non opus eſt, ſed mente devota:]</hi>
To ſignify, that <hi>becauſe nothing is hid from
God, therefore we need no one to recommend
us to his favour; a devout mind is enough:</hi>
which if it were the <hi>Author</hi>'s meaning (as it
is the Doctor's) would make him to <hi>exclude</hi>
not only the neceſſity we have of the <hi>Prayers</hi>
of our <hi>Fellow-members,</hi> as well of the <hi>Church
Militant</hi> as <hi>Triumphant,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf: for, if <hi>a devout
mind be enough,</hi> and that <hi>we need no one to
recommend us to God's favour,</hi> what need we
the <hi>Prayers</hi> of others, or the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt?</hi> But it is manifeſt, that the Author
takes not the <hi>word</hi> in <hi>this ſenſe;</hi> but as thoſe
are called <hi>ſuffragatores,</hi> whoſe <hi>vote</hi> or <hi>advice</hi>
the <hi>King</hi> takes (for example) in the <hi>Election</hi>
of his <hi>Officers,</hi> becauſe as the Author there
addeth, <hi>being but a Man, he knows not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
whom to employ in publick affairs,</hi> without
being inform'd by others. This is the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
given by the <hi>Author,</hi> and this is what the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48446:228"/>
                     <hi>Heathens</hi> affirm'd of their
<hi>Inferiour Deities,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Civ. Dei. li. 8. c. 21.</note> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
reports, Viz. <hi>That the Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Gods who have care of
humane affairs, would not know what Men do,
unleſs the Aerial Daemons declared it to them.</hi>
By which it appears, that when the Author
ſays, <hi>Suffragatore non est opus,</hi> that <hi>becauſe
nothing is hid from God, there is no need of a
ſuffragator,</hi> he means, that <hi>GOD</hi> needs not
any one to <hi>inform</hi> or <hi>adviſe</hi> him what to do,
as <hi>Kings</hi> do, and as the <hi>Ethereal Gods</hi> of the
<hi>Heathen</hi> did; but not, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s
Verſion, that we <hi>need no one to recommend
us to his favour,</hi> that is, that <hi>we</hi> need not
the <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Interceſſions</hi> of <hi>just Perſons,</hi>
which the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, <hi>are available with

that <hi>if our minds can be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

and <hi>Saints,</hi> we need not their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi>
to recommend us to his favour.
Theſe are the ſhifts the Doctor is put upon,
to wreſt the <hi>Fathers</hi> to ſay what they never
mean't. But now he thinks he hath knockt
us on the Head with a down-right blow,
when he tells us out of the ſame
St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">li. 9. c. 15.</note> that <hi>thoſe who are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
do believe, that we need not
many, but One Mediator, and Him the very
Perſon himſelf, by whoſe participation we are
made happy.</hi> But here alſo his <hi>Pen</hi> (that <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Instrument</hi> by which he does us <hi>dead)</hi>
moved not ſo <hi>even,</hi> as not to ſlant a little
from the true tranſlation and meaning of
St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s words. For whereas St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
diſputing there againſt the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> who
made the <hi>Inferiour Deities</hi> to be <hi>Mediatours,</hi>
ſaid, <hi>Non multis ſed uno Mediatore opus erat,</hi>
that <hi>to bring us to happineſs, there needed not
many, but One Mediator;</hi> the Doctor firſt
makes a <hi>Preface</hi> of his own, as if it were
St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, that <hi>thoſe who are Chriſtians do
believe;</hi> And then turns <hi>[opus erat, there was
no need]</hi> (as <hi>Plato</hi> pretended) into <hi>we need
not many, but One Mediator;</hi> as if St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
were diſputing againſt Catholicks for deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Saints.</hi> To the
Teſtimony it ſelf, as it ſtands tranſlated by
the Doctor, I anſwer, that it is plain from
the very words of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that he ſpeaks
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48446:229"/>
of ſuch a <hi>Mediator, by whoſe Participation we
are made happy,</hi> that is, of a <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
and not a <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Interceſſion,</hi>
that is, ſuch an one as may recommend us in
his Prayers, to obtain God's favour <hi>through
his Son Jeſus Chriſt our only Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;</hi>
for theſe may be <hi>many,</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> well obſervs,<note place="margin">Epil. 3. Part. <hi>p.</hi> 355.</note>
when he ſaith, that <hi>if whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be accepted to pray for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
is neceſſarily by ſo doing his Mediator,
Interceſſor or Advocate to him, with whom he
is admitted to deal on his behalf by his Prayers,
then—Certainly neither could Job intercede
for his friends, nor Samuel for the Iſraelites,
nor Abraham for Abimelech or Pharaoh, nor
any of God's Prophets, for any that had or were
to have recourſe to them for that purpoſe, but
they muſt be by ſo doing Mediators, Interceſsors
and Advocates for them with God.</hi> And in
this ſenſe, (ſuppoſing that the <hi>Saints pray
for us,</hi> which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſaith, <hi>he will not deny
the Fathers did believe.</hi> p. 173.) He admits
that the <hi>Saints</hi> may be called <hi>our Mediators,</hi>
and <hi>Interceſsors</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>to diſpute
whether they may be counted ſo or no, is a meer
contention about words.</hi> Now that the word
<hi>Mediator</hi> is not ſo appropriated to <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
but that it may be and is applyed to ſome
other,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bible</hi> in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>London,</hi> 1610.</note> even in Holy Scripture,
the <hi>Annotations</hi> ſet forth upon

the <hi>Bible</hi> by <hi>Publick Authority</hi> tell us, when
explicating that place of St. <hi>Paul, Gal. 3. 19.
[The Law was ordained by Angels in the hand
of a Mediator]</hi> They affirm that the <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
there meant was <hi>Moſes.</hi> But however
the <hi>word Mediator</hi> may be uſed, the Doctor
ſays, <hi>it would be ridiculous here to diſtinguiſh
Mediators</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
all <hi>that the Heathens attributed to their
good ſpirits,</hi> (for ſo <hi>he</hi> will have them to be
in deſpite of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who calls them
<hi>Devils) was only Interceſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This he avoucheth here in the face of the
World, <hi>p.</hi> 156. but (as I ſuppoſe) in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that neither his <hi>Reader,</hi> nor his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
will be ſo rude, as to remember him
of what he told us out of <hi>Celſus,</hi> p. 150.
that the <hi>Aegyptian Deities</hi> at leaſt, I mean
<hi>Chnumen, Chnaachumen, Cnat, Sicat, Biu, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Every one of them healed the diſeaſes
of the parts proper to themſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might justly be invocated;</hi> nor yet of
what he told us ſo lately out of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
p. 155. that <hi>the Heathens ſuppoſed that the
Gods could not know the Neceſſities and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Men, but by the Intervention of thoſe
Spirits, and that the giving them divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
proceeded upon that ſuppoſition; Viz.</hi> that
it was their <hi>Office</hi> to inform the Superiour
<hi>Gods</hi> of what they could not know other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
For, if theſe things be <hi>true,</hi> it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48446:230"/>
                     <hi>falſe</hi> what the Doctor affirms at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
<hi>Viz.</hi> that ALL <hi>that the Heathens at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to their Inferiour Deities was only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion;</hi>
and conſequently, he not only
<hi>contradicts</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> but (what perhaps to
him is worſe,) <hi>Himſelf</hi> alſo. So <hi>dear</hi> doth
it coſt him, to make the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for deſiring the <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
of the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints;</hi> not to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi>
God of what he knows not, nor for

us to his favour, as we begg the <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>What kind of Worſhip of Angels was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by St. Paul, Theodoret, &amp;c. with
a farther diſplay of the diſparity between the
Heathens Worſhip of their Inferiour Deities
and that given by Catholicks to Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Saints.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1. THe <hi>Second Thing</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ſhow out of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
(p. 154.) was, that <hi>they
did not only condemn giving this worſhip to the
Spirits, which the Heathen worſhipped, but to
good Angels too.</hi> And here again he deludes
his Reader with that <hi>general</hi> term of <hi>this
Worſhip;</hi> as if the honour which <hi>Catholicks</hi>
give to the <hi>good Angels,</hi> by deſiring their
<hi>Prayers</hi> to the <hi>only true God,</hi> were the ſame
with <hi>that worſhip</hi> which the <hi>Heathen</hi> gave to
<hi>thoſe ſpirits whom they worſhipped</hi> with <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
as <hi>Gods.</hi> But we muſt give him leave to
cry <hi>whoop, all hid,</hi> in Generals, and find him
out if we can.</p>
                  <p>The firſt place he ſeeks to <hi>hide</hi> himſelf in,
(and he was ſo afraid to be diſcover'd, that
he would not ſet down the words) is that
Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 2. 18. <hi>Let no Man
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48446:231"/>
beguile you of your reward in a voluntary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
and worſhipping of Angels, &amp;c. and
not holding the Head</hi> (Chriſt.) Here he ſaith,
that St. <hi>Paul doth in the general condemn the
worſhip of Angels,</hi> that is, <hi>all</hi> kind of <hi>worſhip</hi>
of any kind of <hi>Angels,</hi> whether good or bad.
But if ſo, why did St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, in a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
humility,</hi> and <hi>not holding the Head</hi> Chriſt?
Theſe Clauſes ſufficiently intimate a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity
in the Worſhip, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
and <hi>this was,</hi> ſaith
St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>S.</hi> Chryſoſt. <hi>in</hi> Col. 2. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>that ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Coloſſians ſaid that
we ought to be recociled, and
have acceſs to the Father, not by Chriſt, but by
the Angels.</hi> And <hi>this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is that which
is ſaid (i. e.</hi> condemned) <hi>by the Apostle,</hi> that
they ſo admitted and worſhipped the <hi>Angels</hi>
for <hi>Mediators,</hi> as to <hi>exclude Chriſt;</hi> And the
reaſon why they did ſo, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by <hi>Theophylact,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theophyl. <hi>in</hi> Col. 2. 18.</note> becauſe
<hi>they eſteemed it a thing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

<hi>and far tranſcending Man's Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
or lowneſs</hi> on the other. This ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s petty Objections of St. <hi>Paul's
not diſtinguiſhing good Angels</hi> from <hi>evil</hi> ones,
and <hi>our ſetting up other Mediatours beſides
Chriſt,</hi> vaniſh into Air, becauſe <hi>good Angels</hi>
themſelves are not to be worſhipped, but
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48446:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in ſubordination to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Head,</hi> nor their
Prayers to be deſired as efficacious for us,
but through <hi>his merits.</hi> And when we have
recourſe to them upon <hi>this account,</hi> it is no
more to ſet up <hi>other Mediators beſides Chriſt,</hi>
than when we deſire the Prayers of <hi>Holy
Men</hi> upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. But <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon this Place of the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that thoſe who defended the Law,
perſwaded Men to worſhip Angels, becauſe the
Law was delivered by Angels; which practice,</hi>
he ſaith, <hi>continued a long time in Phrygia and
Piſidia; and therefore the Synod of Laodicea
doth forbid praying to Angels; And to this
day the Oratories of St. Michael are among
them. This they perſwaded Men to, as a piece
of humility, affirming that God the Creator of
all things could not be ſeen nor comprehended,
nor approached by us; and therefore we ought
to obtain his favour by the Angels.</hi> This is
what <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith, and the Import of it
amounting only to this, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (in his Judgment)
forbad the worſhipping or praying to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
upon account that the <hi>Law was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by them</hi> (and therefore, as <hi>Theophylact</hi>
ſaith, <hi>they brought us ſalvation)</hi> or that God
by reaſon that he is <hi>Inviſible</hi> and <hi>Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,
cannot be approached, but by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi>
The Reader ſees how unjuſtly this
Place is urged againſt <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who have
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48446:232"/>
recourſe to the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> for their Prayers,
not upon account that they <hi>brought us ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without Chriſt by delivering the Law,</hi> or
that <hi>God</hi> is ſo high we cannot have <hi>acceſs</hi>
to Him, but by <hi>them:</hi> but that they, as true
<hi>Friends</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> would intercede for us
through the <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our only Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and Redeemer: as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi>
declareth.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Theodoret</hi> will not do the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s
work, <hi>Baronius</hi> ſhall. <hi>No wonder,</hi> ſaith he,
(p. 155.) <hi>Baronius is ſo much diſpleas'd with
Theodoret for this Interpretation, for he very
fairly tells us, what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Baron. An. 60. 20. 21.</note> (and St. <hi>Paul</hi> too)
<hi>was the practice of the
Church of Rome, and thoſe
Oratories were ſet up by Catholicks, and not by
Hereticks.</hi> And I ſhall wonder more, if he
find any one who will believe him; that ſo
great a Champion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as <hi>Baronius,</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>ſtupid,</hi> as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the face of the World the lawfulneſs
of praying to <hi>Angels,</hi> as it is practiſed in
that <hi>Church,</hi> and yet confeſs that as ſo practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
it is condemned by <hi>Theodoret</hi> and St.
<hi>Paul</hi> too. Either <hi>Baronius</hi> was a very <hi>great
Dolt,</hi> or the Doctor does not deal <hi>very fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
by him. And this is but too too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
1. Becauſe the words as put by him
for the words of <hi>Baronius,</hi> Viz. <hi>[what Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48446:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
condemns</hi> (and St. <hi>Paul</hi> too) <hi>was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of the Roman Church]</hi> are not <hi>Baronius</hi>
his words, but the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s, for <hi>Baronius</hi>
ſaith there expreſly, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> as to the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Veneration</hi> of <hi>Angels, recta
ſenſit,</hi> that is, held the ſame which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church holds at this day. <hi>2dly,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Point in which <hi>Baronius</hi> differs
from <hi>Theodoret,</hi> is not that thoſe were not
condemn'd by <hi>him</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> too, who
worſhipped Angels upon the erroneous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Acceſs could only
be made to God by the Angels:</hi> (whether the
Authors of that Doctrine were <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi>
or <hi>Philoſophers;)</hi> but that <hi>Baronius</hi>
judged <hi>Theodoret</hi> miſtaken in aſſerting the
<hi>Authors</hi> of that Doctrine not to have been
the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> but certain <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
and much more in ſuppoſing the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories</hi>
of St. <hi>Michael</hi> in <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
to have been erected by thoſe <hi>Hereticks;
Incaute nimis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Baronius,
Too unwarily attributing to
them the erecting of thoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories
which had been of old
instituted by Catholicks.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Baron. An. 60. n. 20.</note> This is what <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
ſaith, grounding himſelf upon ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Records;</hi> And here lieth the depth of
the Charge, that becauſe <hi>Theodoret</hi> condemns
the <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> as he
thought it was practis'd by thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:48446:233"/>
in thoſe <hi>Oratories</hi> of St. <hi>Michael;</hi> and <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
thinks him miſtaken in the matter of
<hi>Fact,</hi> and that thoſe <hi>Oratories</hi> were indeed
erected by <hi>Catholicks,</hi> therefore <hi>Baronius</hi>
(ſaith the Doctor) <hi>very fairly tells us, that
what Theodoret condemns was the practice of
the Roman Church.</hi> Which is juſt, as if the
Doctor being to comment that
paſſage of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joſ. 22.</note> where the
Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> deſign'd War
upon the <hi>Reubenites,</hi> &amp;c. for erecting an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
beſide the <hi>Altar</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> ſhould tell
us, that <hi>they too unwarily aſcribed to a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
worſhip, what was intended for a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the true and lawful worſhip of God.</hi>
And another Author paſſing his judgment
upon this Comment of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s ſhould
affirm, that <hi>Dr.</hi> St. <hi>very fairly tells Us, that
what the Iſraelites condemned in the Reubenites,
was the worſhip of the true God.</hi> Would not
this be a <hi>fair tale.</hi> if well told by a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perſon of Dr. <hi>St.?</hi> If he would not
own it for <hi>ſuch</hi> himſelf; Why does he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſo <hi>foul</hi> a one upon <hi>Baronius?</hi> For as
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were miſtaken in the <hi>End,</hi> for
which that <hi>Altar</hi> was Erected, ſo was <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Baronius,</hi> in the <hi>uſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi>
of St. <hi>Michael;</hi> and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
no more in his Judgment, that what
<hi>Theodoret</hi> condemn'd was the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> as practis'd in the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48446:233"/>
                     <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> than that <hi>what the Iſraelites
condemn'd</hi> was the <hi>worſhip</hi> of the true <hi>God,</hi>
as exercis'd among them.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. But the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſaith yet further,
that <hi>Baronius very fairly tells Us, that not only
what Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>odoret condemn'd, but what St. Paul
too</hi> condemn'd, <hi>was the practiſe of the Church
of Rome.</hi> But this is yet <hi>fouler</hi> than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
for himſelf (p. 156.) tells us, that
what <hi>Baronius contended,</hi> was condemned by
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was the <hi>Idolatry of the Heathens.</hi>
And although Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will needs make the
<hi>Catholick Invocation of Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
worſhip of <hi>their Daemons</hi> to be the
ſame, yet a greater Authority than <hi>His</hi> is

Indication that it intended not to condemn
in this <hi>Canon</hi> the <hi>worſhip</hi> due to <hi>Angels;</hi> of
whom <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith,
<hi>That they are more to be

                     <note place="margin">Li. 3. de Angelis.</note> yet
not as <hi>ſecondary Gods,</hi> but as our <hi>Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> By this the
Reader may ſee, whether <hi>we had more reaſon
to fear the force of this Canon;</hi> or <hi>he</hi> the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi>
of what he ſo artificially <hi>concealed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. To his Teſtimony out of <hi>Origen,</hi>
p. 156. I have anſwered already, that he
ſpeaks of <hi>ſuch Prayers,</hi> as are offred only <hi>to
God;</hi> for he both acknowledges a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the <hi>worſhip</hi> due to <hi>God</hi> and the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48446:234"/>
                     <hi>Angels,</hi> and himſelf alſo directs his <hi>Prayer</hi>
to an <hi>Angel,</hi> as I have ſhowed above, <hi>p.</hi> 359.
What he cites out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> (de Civit.
Dei. li. 10. c. 1.) is not in the leaſt againſt the
<hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> as taught
and practis'd in the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> For
the <hi>Queſtion</hi> there in debate between Him
and the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> as it ſtands propos'd in
the very <hi>Argument</hi> of the Chapter, is, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Angels will that ſacrifice be offered to
God alone, or alſo to them?</hi> That they may
be <hi>honour'd</hi> with that kind of worſhip, with
which <hi>Holy Men</hi> or <hi>Bleſſed Souls</hi> are <hi>honoured</hi>
by us, he ſufficiently intimates in his <hi>20th.</hi>
Book againſt <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> c. 21. Where he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
denies the <hi>worſhip</hi> due to <hi>God,</hi> ought
to be given to <hi>any</hi> of them.
And elſewhere,<note place="margin">Tom. 4. ſup. Gen. 9. 61.</note> as if he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to prevent the <hi>Dr.</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
as to the worſhip of
<hi>Angels;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Neither let it move you, that
the Angel</hi> (Apoc. 19. 10.) <hi>forbiddeth St. John
to worſhip Him, and admoniſheth Him rather
to worſhip God; For the Angel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſuch,</hi> (that is, in ſo glorious a manner)
<hi>that he might</hi> (by miſtake) <hi>be worſhipped for
God, and therefore the Worſhipper was to be
corrected.</hi> And this he ſaith in reference to
what he had ſaid before, Viz. <hi>That it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
in the Precept [Thou ſhalt worſhip the
Lord thy God, and Him only ſhalt thou ſerve]
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48446:235"/>
that it is not ſaid, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord
thy God</hi> only, <hi>as it is ſaid, Thou ſhalt ſerve
Him only, which in Greek is</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: by
which it is plain, that in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
although <hi>Latria</hi> be due to <hi>God</hi> alone,
yet <hi>worſhip</hi> may be given to others. When
therefore he ſaith in the place now under
debate, that <hi>the Bleſſed ſpirits are not willing
we ſhould ſacra facere,</hi> that is, <hi>dedicate,</hi> (the
Doctor tranſlates it equivocally <hi>to perform
any ſacred Offices) and ſacrifice to them, or
conſecrate our ſelves, or any thing of ours to
them by the Rites of Religion,</hi> it is evident he
ſpeaks of the <hi>worſhip</hi> which is due to <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
that is, of ſuch <hi>Dedications</hi> and <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations,</hi>
as were performed by the <hi>Heathens</hi>
to their <hi>Daemons</hi> as <hi>Gods.</hi> And although in
his 61. <hi>Q.</hi> upon <hi>Exodus,</hi> he makes this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
(as the Doctor objecteth againſt us)
between <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Dulia,</hi> that <hi>Dulia is due
to God, as he is Lord; but Latria is not due,
but to God as he is God.</hi> Yet in the very place
cited here by the Doctor,
he affirms,<note place="margin">Li. 10. de Civ. Dei. c. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>that that ſervice
which is given by ſervants to
their Masters, is wont to be
called by another Name in Greek,</hi> that is, <hi>dulia.</hi>
But this the Reader was not to know, for
fear he might infer, that if ſome degree of
the ſervice called in Greek <hi>dulia,</hi> might be
given by <hi>Servants</hi> to their <hi>Maſters,</hi> then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48446:235"/>
a higher degree of it may be given to the
<hi>Holy Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. But now after all theſe endeavours
uſed by the Doctor, to hide himſelf in the
<hi>General</hi> terms, of <hi>ſuch worſhip, Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Prayer, Invocation,</hi> &amp;c. and ſome <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure</hi>
paſſages of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> He tells us,
that <hi>he knows very well</hi> (and I pray God, his
own knowledge may not riſe againſt him in
the Day of Judgment) <hi>by what Arts all theſe
Testimonies are endeavoured to be evaded,</hi> (or
rather, by what <hi>Light</hi> he will be diſcovered
to have ſaid nothing to the purpoſe,) Viz.
<hi>That theſe ſayings of the Fathers were intended
againſt the Heathens Idolatry who worſhipped
thoſe Spirits as Gods, and offered Sacrifices to
them: But the Church of Rome denie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Saints to be Gods, and aſſerts that the
worſhip by Sacrifice is proper only to God.</hi> This
Anſwer is indeed given by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> very
often, and others of the <hi>Fathers:</hi> And there
needed no other, to the Teſtimonies he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,
if all who read his Book, knew as
much as himſelf. <hi>But ſuch devices as theſe,</hi>
(for ſo he calls them, though prov'd to be
the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> out of the very pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
cited by him) he ſaith, <hi>can never ſatisfy
an impartial mind.</hi> And (to return him his
own words in a like occaſion) I muſt tell
him, that <hi>if ever he ſpeak home to our caſe, he
muſt do it upon this Point, And ſo he does, but
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48446:236"/>
very little to his comfort;</hi> as I ſhall make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
by ſhowing the <hi>nullity</hi> of the <hi>Reaſons,</hi>
with which he endeavours to make the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
Anſwer ſeem <hi>inſufficient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The Firſt is, becauſe</hi> The Fathers, <hi>he
ſaith, (p. 158.)</hi> do expreſly deny, that Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Prayer is to be made to the Angels, and
Saints. <hi>But this is but to ſay the ſame thing
over again, or to equivocate (as Mr.</hi> Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike
<hi>ſaith) in the terms of</hi> Prayer <hi>and</hi> Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which are not ſo proper to God, but that
in deſpite of our hearts, they may be uſed in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
requeſts made alſo to Men.</p>
                  <p>2. His ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>It would
be no more unlawful to ſacrifice to Saints or
Angels, than to Invocate them.</hi> And this
Reaſon clearly deſtroys it ſelf, becauſe it
ſuppoſes we hold it <hi>unlawful</hi> to <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to
the <hi>Saints,</hi> as the <hi>Heathens</hi> did to their <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Deities.</hi> But to let that paſs with the
reſt: If he take the word <hi>Invocation</hi> here to
ſignifie the <hi>Prayer</hi> we make to <hi>God,</hi> as the
<hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Giver</hi> of all Good, I grant it, no
leſs <hi>unlawful</hi> to <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi>
than to <hi>Invocate</hi> them. For what <hi>Catholick</hi>
ever taught or thought that it was lawful to
<hi>Invocate</hi> any <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Saint</hi> upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
But if the word <hi>Invocation</hi> on the
one ſide (as in deſpite of all oppoſition it
may be, and by the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> it
is uſed) be taken to ſignify the requeſts we
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48446:236"/>
make to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> to pray for us;
and on the other ſide the offering of <hi>ſacrifice</hi>
be not only by the cuſtome of the <hi>Church,</hi>
but of all <hi>Mankind</hi> (as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
teacheth) appropriated to
ſignify the <hi>abſolute worſhip</hi> due
only to God;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>De Civ. Dei.</hi> li. 10. c. 4.</note> Who ſees not
the <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> of offering it to any <hi>Saint</hi>
or <hi>Angel,</hi> may conſiſt with the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of
deſiring them to <hi>pray</hi> for us? The caſe is
plain in <hi>juſt Men</hi> upon Earth. For St. <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas</hi> accepted willingly the <hi>Prayers</hi>
which others made to them for their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but utterly <hi>refuſed</hi> to admit the <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
which the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> (Acts 14.) would
have offered to them: and it is as plain of
the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, becauſe we <hi>pray</hi> no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
to them, than we do to <hi>Holy Men</hi>
upon Earth, though more <hi>devoutly</hi> upon the
account of their unchangeable ſtate of Bliſs.
How then could the Doctor <hi>parallel</hi> theſe
two together, and not only <hi>parallel</hi> them,
but make it leſs unlawful to <hi>pray</hi> to the
<hi>Saints,</hi> than to offer <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to them? I'le
tell you. <hi>Catholicks,</hi> when they write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

is for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Heathens</hi> againſt St. <hi>Auſtin: Nay,</hi> ſaith he,
(p. 158.) <hi>The Heathens in St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>argued
very well, that ſacrifices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <note place="margin">li. 10. de Civ. Dei. c. 19.</note>

the more Inviſible the Deity was, the more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
the ſacrifices were to be, and the greater
and better the Deity, the ſacrifice was to be ſtill
proportionable.</hi> Thus the Doctor, to ſhow
<hi>that in all reaſon the duty of Prayer ought to be
reſerved as more proper to God, than any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſacrifice;</hi> or, as he va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than a <hi>meer outward ſacrifice:</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that <hi>Prayer</hi> was leſs communicable
to a <hi>Saint,</hi> than <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> But do you not
think the Doctor us'd the utmoſt of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
here, to own and maintain for <hi>good</hi>
(nay <hi>very good)</hi> an Argument of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
confuted by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in that very
place? <hi>The Heathen,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>St. argued
very well.</hi> I deny it, ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in ſo arguing they manifeſt <hi>that they
do not know (neſciunt) that viſible ſacrifices
are the ſigns of the Inviſible Sacrifices of the
mind; like as the words we ſpeak are the ſigns
of things. For as when we pray or praiſe, we
direct the words to him, to whom we offer in our
hearts the things themſelves, which we ſignify
by them: ſo when we ſacrifice, we know that the
viſible Sacrifice is to be offered to no other, but
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48446:237"/>
to Him whoſe Inviſible Sacrifice, we our ſelves
ought to be in our hearts. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
(he adds a little below) <hi>it is and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Devils require ſacrifice to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to them, becauſe they know it to be due to
God alone—endeavouring by that means to
hinder acceſs to the true God; that Man may not
be his ſacrifice, whilst ſacrifice is offered to any
but to him.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in Anſwer to
the <hi>Heathens</hi> Objection and the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s. By
which it appears, <hi>1st,</hi> That in the Judgment
of St. <hi>Auſtin, external ſacrifice</hi> being the
<hi>higheſt expreſſion</hi> of the <hi>higheſt part</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi>
which is the <hi>devoting</hi> and <hi>ſacrificing</hi> our
ſelves in our hearts to <hi>God,</hi> it ought of all
others <hi>to be reſerv'd as moſt proper and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to him:</hi> And <hi>that Religion</hi> which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
no <hi>external</hi> viſible <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> muſt needs
be deficient in the moſt <hi>ſignal part</hi> of the
<hi>Publick</hi> Worſhip of <hi>God. 2dly,</hi> That in the
Judgment of the ſame St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi>
(if he ſpeak as he thinks) <hi>knows</hi> no more
than the <hi>Heathens</hi> did what the true <hi>notion</hi>

them as Gods, or offer ſacrifice to them as
the Heathens</hi> did even to their <hi>Inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
Theſe are all ſuch known Truths, both
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48446:238"/>
from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
that nothing but a Prodigious deal of Zeal to

from which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation receiv'd the
Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> could occaſion the frequent

doth the Doctor ſo much as offer to prove

the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but only the <hi>laſt,</hi>
of <hi>not offering ſacrifice to the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>

But is <hi>this</hi> what the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſay of the

that they offered <hi>ſacrifices</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for <hi>their

<hi>and hath been at large refuted in the

Teſtimonies for a farther confutation of it,

is of S.</hi> Auſtin.<note place="margin">Li. 8. de Civ. Dei. c. 27.</note> We do not, <hi>ſaith he,</hi>
erect Temples, or ordain Prieſts,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48446:240"/>
nor make Dedications, nor offer ſacrifices to the
Martyrs, becauſe not They, but their God is our
God. We honour indeed their Memories, as of
Holy Men of God, who fought for the Truth,
even to the loſs of their Lives—But we do
not worſhip them with divine honours, as the
Heathens did their Gods, nor do we offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to them. <hi>The ſecond is of Biſhop</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,
<hi>in his Treatiſe of</hi> Invocation <hi>of</hi> Saints,
<hi>p. 60. Where he telleth all, who are or
will be concern'd for Truth, that the</hi> Doctors
of the Church of Rome do teach, that the Saints
are no Immediate Interceſsors for Us with God;
but whatſoever they obtain for Us at GOD's
hands, that they do obtain by and through Chriſt.

voice of every Romaniſt, Non ipſi ſancti, ſed

the Saints themſelves, but their GOD is our
Lord.) So, it muſt not be imputed which is not
deſerved. Were they worſe than they are, it is

Times.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1. THe Doctor having made uſe, in
his Anſwer to the two Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of the equivocal term of
<hi>Formal Invocation,</hi> to amuze his Reader, I
reply'd, <hi>I underſtood not well what He meant
by Formal Invocation,</hi> but withall I told him,
that <hi>what Catholicks understand by it in the
preſent matter, is deſiring or praying thoſe juſt
Perſons, who are in Glory in Heaven to pray
for them:</hi> To ſhew the <hi>palpable weakneſs</hi> (as
he calls it) of this Anſwer, he ſays he will
prove, that <hi>thoſe of the Church of Rome, do
allow and practice another kind of Formal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
from what I aſsert;</hi> and I think he
never betrayed more <hi>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>his</hi> own <hi>cauſe,</hi> than in this undertaking.
Let the Reader judge.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. Firſt then, he ſays, that <hi>Never any
Perſon before me imagin'd that to be the ſenſe
of Formal Invocation, which I do,</hi> when I ſay,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48446:241"/>
that what we underſtand by it, is <hi>deſiring or
praying the Saints to pray for us.</hi> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,
that <hi>he imagins</hi> the very ſame ſenſe of it that
I do, when he ſays, that <hi>the term of Formal
Invocation was purpoſely choſen by Him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
it from Rhetorical Apoſtrophes, Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Flouriſhes, and general wiſhes that the Saints
would pray for us, and from Aſsemblies at the
Monuments of the Martyrs; of all which,</hi> he
grants, <hi>there are ſome inſtances in good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
Viz.</hi> the Chief <hi>Fathers</hi> both of the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church. For what is this,
but to tell us, that he means by <hi>Formal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>
as I do, a real addreſs of our minds
to the <hi>Saints</hi> themſelves to help us with
their Prayers: 'Tis true indeed what <hi>He</hi>
would have his Reader to underſtand by it,
<hi>is,</hi> what he ſays <hi>is conſtantly practis'd in the
Roman Church to offer up our Prayers to Saints
and Angels, to help us in our neceſſities, as well
as to pray to God for us.</hi> But what doth he
ſay then to the <hi>Forme</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> uſed by us in
the Letanies, <hi>Holy Mary,</hi> or <hi>Holy Peter pray
for us:</hi> Is it only a <hi>Rhetorical Apoſtrophe, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical
Flouriſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or <hi>general wiſh, that the Saints
would pray for us:</hi> Or, is it more? If it be
no more, Why does he impugne what he
grants was uſed by thoſe <hi>good Authors.</hi> If it
be more, 'tis then a <hi>part</hi> at leaſt of <hi>Formal
Invocation,</hi> as defin'd by Himſelf. And if
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48446:241"/>
when we pray them to <hi>help our neceſſities,</hi> the
meaning be, that they ſhould do it <hi>by their
Prayers,</hi> the whole ſenſe of <hi>Formal Invocation</hi>
in this preſent matter, is <hi>to deſire them to
pray for us:</hi> ſo that though <hi>never any Perſon
before me imagin'd this to be the ſenſe of it,</hi> yet
now I have the Doctor himſelf concurring
with me in it. But to paſs on to the Proofs
of his Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. <hi>All the difficulty,</hi> he ſays, (p. 163.)
<hi>lies in this, whether Catholicks pray to the Saints
to help their neceſſities, as well as pray for them:</hi>
that is, whether beſides the uſual form of
ſaying, <hi>Holy Mary pray for us;</hi> we do not
ſometimes vary the <hi>Phraſe,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Help me,</hi>
or <hi>comfort and ſtrengthen me,</hi> O B. Virgin:
for, as for the meaning of the words, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet met with any <hi>Catholick</hi> ſo Ignorant,
as not to underſtand the ſenſe to be, to deſire
them to help us with their Prayers. Behold
then here the terrible <hi>Myſtery not to be made
known to Proſelites,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, <hi>until
they be firſt made ſafe and faſt enough! Viz.</hi>
                     <hi>that ſometimes they may uſe the like form
of words to <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi> as a <hi>Child</hi>
does to his <hi>Father,</hi> when inſtead of ſaying,
<hi>Pray Father, Pray to God to bleſs me,</hi> he ſaith
ſometimes <hi>Bleſs me Father.</hi> But <hi>Catholicks</hi>
he ſaith, (p. 163.) <hi>do this with all the ſame
external ſigns of devotion, which they uſe to
God Himſelf.</hi> And can he excuſe a <hi>Child</hi>
                        <pb n="400" facs="tcp:48446:242"/>
from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> when he <hi>kneels</hi> down with the
ſame external ſign of devotion, which we
uſe to <hi>God,</hi> and ſaith <hi>Bleſs me Father,</hi> becauſe
he ſaith it in a different ſenſe to his <hi>Father,</hi>
than he doth to <hi>God;</hi> and will he not upon
the ſame account be as charitable to us,
when with the like external ſign of devotion,
we ſay, <hi>Bleſs me, or help me, Mother of God?</hi>
Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> in all his diſcourſes ſhows
his unwillingneſs to free the</hi> Practiſe of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this matter from <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
yet convinc'd by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of Truth,<note place="margin">Epil. 3d. Part. p. 358.</note> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes,
<hi>that the Church of
England having acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
the Church of Rome, a true Church,
though corrupt, ever ſince the Reformation, he
is oblig'd ſo to interpret the Prayers thereof,
as to acknowledge the corruption ſo great, that
the Prayers which it alloweth may be Idolatries,
if they be made in that ſenſe, which they may
properly ſignify; but not that they are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
Idolatries. For, if they were neceſsarily
Idolatries, then were the Church of Rome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
no Church, the being of Chriſtianity pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing
the worſhip of one true God. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to confute the Hereticks, the ſtyle of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
devotion, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> leaves nothing to God,
which is not attributed to, and deſired of his
Saints, yet it cannot be denyed, they may be the
words of them, who believe that God alone can
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48446:242"/>
give that which they deſire.</hi> And if this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed, where is the Doctor's either
<hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Sincerity</hi> to interpret theſe or the
like words,<hi>Help me Mother of God,</hi>  in the
ſame ſenſe they carry, when we ſay <hi>Help me
GOD?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. But what do I do expecting <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
from Him, who makes
it <hi>ſuperſtitious Fanaticiſme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In his Preface.</note>
or at beſt but <hi>Fanciful ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi>
in others? The <hi>exceſs</hi> not of his
<hi>Judgment,</hi> but <hi>Zeal,</hi> (if we muſt call it ſo)
hath quite eaten up his <hi>Charity.</hi> And every
thing he meets with, that is not down-right
<hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> muſt now be <hi>Idolatrous</hi> or
<hi>Blaſphemous.</hi> Nay, it is enough he <hi>hath heard
of our Ladies Pſalter, a Blaſphemous Book,</hi> he
ſaith, <hi>never yet cenſured, wherein the Pſalms
in their higheſt ſtrains of Prayer to God are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the Virgin Mary.</hi> But what, or
whoſe Book ſoever that be, (which I firſt
had news of from Himſelf) his only <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of it, argues that it is no <hi>publick Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo not to be charg'd
upon Her: And did it contain <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> (as
he ſaith it doth,) and were publickly known,
no doubt it had been <hi>cenſured</hi> before this.
But then again, as we are not to take all for
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſo neither are we to take all for <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy,</hi>
which the Doctor calls ſo. <hi>Every
one,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aristotle, judgeth as he is affected,</hi>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:48446:243"/>
and nothing more ſubject to different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
than <hi>words.</hi> They are like thoſe
<hi>Pictures</hi> which repreſent a <hi>Man</hi> to one that
ſtands on the right hand, and a <hi>Beaſt</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who ſtands on the left; or like the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
of <hi>Cloud,</hi> which gave <hi>Light</hi> to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
but was <hi>darkneſs</hi> to the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> For
Example, thoſe words of <hi>Christ</hi> to his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
You are the Light of the World,</hi> if you
ſet a <hi>Jew</hi> on the one ſide, and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> on the
other: The <hi>Jew</hi> who owns <hi>Christ</hi> for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a <hi>Seducer,</hi> will call them <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;</hi>
but the Doctor, I hope, will not do
ſo, although <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay of Himſelf, that <hi>He
is the Light of the World.</hi> And the only
Reaſon he can give, is, becauſe though the
<hi>words</hi> be the <hi>ſame,</hi> yet the <hi>ſenſe</hi> in which
they are applyed to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apoſtles,
is very <hi>different.</hi> And poſſibly thoſe <hi>higheſt
ſtrains of Prayer to God,</hi> which he ſaith are
applyed in that <hi>Pſalter</hi> to the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi>
may, if examined, be found not chargeable
with <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> on the like account. For, if
it be not the <hi>dead</hi> words, but the <hi>Intention</hi>
of the Speaker that animates them, which
makes them to be <hi>Prayer</hi> (otherwiſe a <hi>Parrot</hi>
which ſhould be taught to ſay, <hi>Help me God,</hi>
would pray as well as a <hi>Chriſtian)</hi> it follows
that as the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Speaker is <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
ſo will the <hi>Prayer</hi> be alſo; that is, the
<hi>ſame words</hi> ſpoken to <hi>God</hi> will have reſpect
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48446:243"/>
to Him, as who alone can give what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
but applyed to the B. Virgin, will ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
only that we deſire her <hi>Prayers</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
for us of <hi>God,</hi> what we believe that he
alone can give; and conſequently no <hi>ſtrain</hi>
of <hi>Prayer,</hi> (properly ſo called) which is
made to <hi>GOD,</hi> will be applyed to the B.
<hi>Virgin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. <hi>But now the Doctor will be ſo juſt,
as not to</hi> inſist upon the Ancient <hi>Breviaries,
or</hi> Obſolete Forms, or Private Devotions, <hi>(a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

<hi>enough, he thinks,</hi> in the preſent Roman

of Her, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> follows, Give me strength
againſt thy Enemies: <hi>to which he adds thoſe
Ejaculations in the</hi> Hymn, Ave Maris stella.
<hi>Wherein</hi> ſhe is intreated to looſe the bonds of
the guilty, to give light to the blind, and drive
away our evils <hi>(but he leaves out,</hi> and to beg for
us all good things,) and to ſhew her ſelf to be

a Mother, (or as it is, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> in the Maſſe-Book
at Paris, 1634. Jure Matris Impera
Redemptori, As thou art a Mother, Command
the Redeemer.) <hi>But then again,</hi> leaſt the Hymn
ſhould be thought only Poetical, <hi>he ſaith, that</hi>
in the Feaſt of S. Maria ad Nives, a formal
Prayer, is made to Her to help the miſerable, to

<hi>And now, ſaith he,</hi> is all this only pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Saints to pray for us? <hi>Yes ſurely,
if it be the</hi> ſenſe <hi>which makes the words to

<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48446:244"/>
which the Doctor makes theſe other of the
<hi>Maſs-Book</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> correſpond, are not found
in any <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> at all, that I can hear of;
nor do the words cited by the Doctor, agree
in their number and meaſure with the reſt of
the Verſes of that <hi>Hymn,</hi> and conſequently
I have ſome Reaſon to believe him miſtaken
(at leaſt) in citing that <hi>Maſs-Book.</hi> But <hi>2dly,</hi>
Suppoſing the words, as cited by the Doctor,
to be found in that <hi>Maſs-Book,</hi> I confeſs they
expreſs a <hi>vehemency</hi> of Spirit, not unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the brisk and ſudden efforts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
to that Nation; but yet they are <hi>ſuch</hi> as
may admit of a fair <hi>conſtruction,</hi> if they meet
with a Reader who is not obſtinately bent to
be way-ward. There are even in Scripture
ſome expreſſions, which ſeem to carry with
them as great an <hi>exceſs</hi> as
this.<note place="margin">Joſ. 10. 12. 14.</note> For example, when
it is ſaid that <hi>Joſue ſpake to
our Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtood ſtill, <hi>God obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the voice of a Man:</hi> And when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſaith of Himſelf, that in Heaven he will
make <hi>his Servants to ſit down

                     <note place="margin">Luke 12. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>and will ſerve them.</hi>
Now, as the former of theſe
expreſſion doth not ſignify, a <hi>real Obedience</hi>
in <hi>God</hi> to the voice of <hi>Man,</hi> but his readineſs
<hi>to do the will of thoſe that fear him;</hi> nor the
latter, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will really <hi>ſerve</hi> the Elect
at Table, but only ſignifies the great <hi>care</hi> He

will take, that nothing ſhall be wanting to
the complement of their joy and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

to be the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the words, all
that the Doctor can ſay, is that the Author
was too <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> in the manner of his
Expreſſion; and in this I dare affirm he will
find very few <hi>Catholicks</hi> diſſenting from him.
Nay more, I have reaſon to believe, that
the <hi>Pariſian Miſſal</hi> of 1634. if there were
any ſuch words in it, hath been ſince cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected;
Otherwiſe my Adverſary would
doubtleſs have cited the <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> of 1670.
and not of 1634. And then the words he
objects, ought to have been caſt among the
Obſolete Forms, which he ſaid before, he
ſhould not inſiſt upon.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. But now again, if we uſe the <hi>ſame
form</hi> of words to the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> and other
<hi>Saints,</hi> as we do to <hi>God,</hi> as when we deſire
<hi>her to strengthen the weak, to give light to the
blind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>From whence,</hi> ſaith the Doctor,
<hi>muſt the People take the ſenſe of theſe Prayers,
if not from the ſignification of the words?</hi> I
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48446:245"/>
Anſwer, not meerly from <hi>Lilly</hi>'s Grammar
Rules, but from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
delivered in her <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> and
from the common uſe of ſuch words and
expreſſions among <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> If a <hi>Child</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taught by his Parents, that <hi>God</hi> alone can
<hi>give</hi> what we ask, when he ſaith to his
<hi>Father, Bleſs me,</hi> underſtands the meaning
of the words to be, that his <hi>Father</hi> ſhould
<hi>pray</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to <hi>bleſs</hi> him: then ſurely much
more muſt <hi>Catholick</hi> People, when they pray
to the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> to <hi>drive away all evils,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the <hi>ſenſe</hi> to be, that ſhe would <hi>pray
to God to deliver them from all evil;</hi> there
being beſides the common Doctrine of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>
(by which they are taught that <hi>God</hi>
alone is the <hi>Giver</hi> of all good things,) ſo
many <hi>Sermons, Catechiſms,</hi> and <hi>Explications,</hi>
both by word and writing daily made in the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Church, by <hi>Prieſts</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi>
and <hi>Parents</hi> to their <hi>Children</hi> in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Point. Well, but <hi>if this were all,</hi>
ſaith the Doctor, <hi>why in all this time that thoſe
Prayers have been complained of, (viz.</hi> by thoſe
who have <hi>revolted</hi> from the <hi>Church) hath
not their ſenſe been better expreſſed? Why have
they not been expunged all this while, after that
their Breviaries have been ſo often reviewed?</hi>
This I fear, if done, would not be enough
to keep them from telling us, <hi>Once upon a

Do we not <hi>do</hi> the ſame <hi>action</hi> ſometimes

<hi>For will any Man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in his Wits, ſay

And the Doctor Himſelf brings in Saint

                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1. TO manifeſt farther the weakneſs
of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Argument, I
added in my Reply, that <hi>if Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
muſt be guilty of Idolatry, for deſiring
juſt Perſons in Heaven to pray for them, upon
the ſame account we muſt not deſire the Prayers
of a juſt Man, even in this Life, becauſe this

that <hi>ſuppoſing this were all, yet this would not

to name it, the conſequence is ſo abſurd,
yet he would have his Reader believe, that
<hi>it would not excuſe them from Idolatry.</hi> And
the Reaſon he gives is, <hi>For their practice is
very different in their Invocation of Saints,

<hi>pray</hi> for <hi>us,</hi> as we do other <hi>Holy Men</hi> upon

and <hi>not</hi> the other? The difference, as far as
I can gather from his words, conſiſts in this,
that amidſt the Solemn Devotions of the
Church, after we have prayed to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> to <hi>have mercy on us,</hi>
remaining upon our Knees, we addreſs to
the <hi>Saints,</hi> and require the aſſiſtance of <hi>their
prayers,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Holy Peter and Paul pray for
us;</hi> and <hi>this without being ſure that they hear
us.</hi> This, together with a hint of our <hi>ſetting
up their Images in ſome higher place in the

the whole ſumme of his Argument. Theſe
circumſtances, he ſays, make the <hi>deſiring the

they were fighting in this.</hi> So that what we
do more to them in Heaven, than whilſt they
were upon Earth, in <hi>praying</hi> to and <hi>praiſing</hi>
of them, is an expreſſion of a greater devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them now, (than then) upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their <hi>ſecure</hi> injoyment of a ſtate of
Bliſs, which they can never loſe. <hi>But for
that Worſhip, which is call'd Latria, for as much
as it is a certain ſervice proper to the Divinity,
we neither worſhip them,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and
all <hi>Catholicks</hi> with him) <hi>nor teach them to be
worſhipped, but God alone.</hi> But to return to
the Doctor.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. The firſt thing he cavils at, is our
<hi>turning</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> with the ſame <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures</hi>
and expreſſion of devotion, to deſire
them to <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>us,</hi> after we have <hi>invoked</hi>
the <hi>Perſons</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity:</hi> And where
lies the <hi>Idolatry</hi> here, if we deſire them only,
as he ſuppoſes, to pray for us? Is the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a <hi>juſt Man</hi> to pray for us, to give him
the <hi>honour</hi> due to <hi>God?</hi> Why then were <hi>Job</hi>'s
Friends ſent to him for his <hi>Interceſſion?</hi> Or
is it the doing it upon our Knees? Why
then do <hi>Parents</hi> permit their <hi>Children</hi> to ask
them <hi>bleſſing</hi> in that <hi>poſture?</hi> Or, is it the
uſing that poſture in the <hi>Church?</hi> Are all
the People then <hi>Idolaters,</hi> for deſiring upon
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48446:250"/>
their Knees the <hi>Prieſt</hi> (nay one another) to
pray unto <hi>God</hi> for them? Theſe are ſuch
pitiful trifles, that they were not worth the
reciting, much leſs refuting, if (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
ſaith of the like) to <hi>recite</hi> them were not to
<hi>refute</hi> them. Well, <hi>but St. Peter,</hi> he ſaith,
<hi>who would not permit Cornelius to fall down
before him, and St. Paul who rent his Garments
and cryed out to the Men of Lyſtra, Why do
you theſe things? would no doubt have been
leſs pleaſed with this.</hi>
And why ſo,<note place="margin">Adverſ. vigilant. c. 2.</note> if <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
as St. <hi>Hierome</hi>
thinks, intended through Error, to worſhip
him with <hi>divine</hi> honour; and the Men of
<hi>Lyſtra,</hi> (as St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates) to offer ſacrifice
to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as to a God? But then again,
ſuppoſing the <hi>honour</hi> which <hi>Cornelius</hi> there
intended, to have been only an <hi>Inferiour</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
as to a <hi>Holy Man,</hi> and that St. <hi>Peter</hi>
(as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
refuſed it out of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hom. 21. in Act.</note> (or as the Doctor
terms it <hi>Modesty)</hi> Does that hinder, but
that upon <hi>another</hi> occaſion he might have
<hi>admitted</hi> it, without danger to his <hi>Modeſty,</hi>
and much more <hi>ſecurely</hi> now, that He is in
Heaven? For my part, I believe that the
Prophet <hi>Elizeus</hi> loſt nothing
of his <hi>Modeſty,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4. King. 4. 27.</note> or <hi>Humility,</hi>
when the <hi>Sunamiteſs fell down
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48446:251"/>
and held Him by the Feet, and He forbad his
Servant to thrust Her away.</hi> To accept, or
refuſe <hi>due</hi> honour is a matter belonging to
<hi>Prudence;</hi> and as ſometimes it may be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with <hi>vain glory,</hi> ſo at an other it may be
admitted with <hi>Humility.</hi> What a <hi>Caprichio</hi>
then was it to ſay, that <hi>if we impute it only
to St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Modesty, we will not allow him
to carry it to Heaven with him?</hi> as if St. <hi>Peter</hi>
could not, without forfeit forſooth of his
<hi>Modeſty,</hi> have ſeen <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do to him, what
they every Day do to one another in the
<hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3. The Second thing he hints at, is
that <hi>we can never be ſure that the Saints do
hear us,</hi> therefore it muſt be <hi>unlawful,</hi> or as
he would make it, <hi>Idolatrous</hi> to deſire them
to <hi>pray</hi> for us. To this I anſwer firſt, that
this can be <hi>no excuſe</hi> for him not to deſire
the <hi>Angels</hi> to pray for him, for it is certain
by many Texts of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> that they
know our neceſſities and prayers, as <hi>Dan. 12.
1. At that time ſhall Michael ſtand up, that
great Prince, which ſtandeth for the Children
of thy People.</hi> Zach. 1. 12. <hi>The Angel of the
Lord ſaid, O Lord of Hosts, how long wilt
thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem, and on the
Cities of Juda, againſt which thou haſt had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digration
theſe threeſcore and ten Years.</hi> Pſal.
137. 2. <hi>I will ſing unto thee in the ſight or
preſence of the Angels.</hi> Luc. 15. 7. <hi>There ſhall

Joy before the Angels of God, upon one Sinner
that doth Penance.</hi> Apoc. 8. 4. <hi>The ſmoke of
the Incenſes of the Prayers of the Saints aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the hand of the Angel before God.</hi>
All theſe places, and divers others do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
ſhow, that our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> are
not unknown to the <hi>Angels;</hi> And whereas
our Saviour himſelf ſaith, that <hi>the Juſt in
the Reſurrection ſhall be as the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
Matth. 22. 30. (the <hi>equality</hi> as to
<hi>knowledge,</hi> not depending upon the <hi>Body)</hi> it
follows by the <hi>Analogy</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that our
<hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>concerns</hi> are known alſo to the
<hi>Saints,</hi> now enjoying the ſame Bliſsful <hi>Viſion</hi>
with the <hi>Angels;</hi> and they no doubt rejoice
as much at the <hi>Converſion</hi> of a Sinner, as the
<hi>Angels</hi> do; and of <hi>them</hi> it is recorded alſo,
Apoc. 5. 8. as well as of the <hi>Angels,</hi> that
<hi>they had golden Vials full of Odours, which are
the prayers of Saints,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Faithful</hi>
upon Earth, who are here called <hi>Saints,</hi> as
they are often in other places of <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
alſo. To this I might add the <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
perfection</hi> of the <hi>knowledge</hi> which the
<hi>Bleſſed</hi> enjoy in <hi>Heaven,</hi> with many other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
both from <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
brought by <hi>Catholick Divines</hi> to prove this
<hi>Tenet.</hi> But becauſe the Doctor brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to prove the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the
Saints do not hear us,</hi> beſides his own, <hi>Ipſe
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:48446:252"/>
dixit;</hi> I ſhall not inlarge further upon this
Point, but give him all the fair play he can
deſire, which is to ſuppoſe with him at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that <hi>the Saints do not hear our prayers.</hi>
But will it follow from thence, that it is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
or Idolatrical to deſire their Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
I anſwer, <hi>(2dly,)</hi> with
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

although <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do cite ſome of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
themſelves doubtfully, <hi>whether the Saints

by many and great <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by <hi>God</hi>
upon Addreſſes made to the <hi>Saints,</hi> that <hi>thoſe</hi>
who call upon them are <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>obtain</hi>

only once, or twice, or five times in a year;
but we celebrate frequent Aſſemblies in
them; and often ſing praiſes every Day to
the <hi>Lord</hi> of thoſe <hi>Martyrs.</hi> Thoſe who are
in good health, <hi>begg</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation

with any <hi>diſeaſe, beg</hi> health. Thoſe who
are <hi>barren, pray</hi> that they may have <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi>
and thoſe who have Children, that
they may be preſerved to them. In like
manner, thoſe who <hi>travel, deſire</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
to be the companions, or rather Guides
of their Journey; and thoſe who return
ſafe, return alſo to give thanks for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

and <hi>pray</hi> the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as Heavenly
Men, to be <hi>Interceſſours</hi> to Him for them.
Now that ſuch as piouſly and faithfully
<hi>pray</hi> to them, <hi>obtain</hi> their <hi>deſires:</hi> The <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi>

of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> which thoſe

whom he had ſold the <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and knew what
had paſſed, gave him, with theſe words:
<hi>Behold how the Twenty Martyrs have cloathed
Thee.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> little thinking, <hi>then,</hi>

that <hi>God</hi> might be <hi>glorified in his Saints.</hi>
And upon the ſame account I ſhall not omit,
though it may add matter of new <hi>Merriment</hi>
to the <hi>ſcoffing</hi> humour of the Age, to ſet
down what I find related by <hi>John Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi>
of <hi>JERUSALEM,</hi> to have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in this kind with Saint <hi>John Damaſcen,</hi>
about the Year 728. He is known to have
been a ſtout Aſſerter of the <hi>Veneration</hi> of
<hi>Holy Images,</hi> and when the Emperour <hi>Leo
Iſauricus</hi> raiſed a Perſecution for that cauſe,
he wrote divers learned <hi>Epistles</hi> to confirm
the <hi>Faithful</hi> in the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church.
He was then at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where the <hi>Prince</hi>
of the <hi>Saracens</hi> kept his Court, and highly in
the favour of that <hi>Prince</hi> for his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48446:254"/>
                     <hi>Learning;</hi> And the Emperor <hi>Leo</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
otherwiſe how to execute his Fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, cauſes a Letter to be forged, as
from <hi>Damaſcen</hi> to Him, and to be tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by One who could exactly imitate his
hand; the Contents whereof were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
him to paſs that way with his <hi>Army;</hi>
with promiſe to deliver the <hi>City</hi> into his
hands. This Letter the Emperor, (as out
of friendſhip to an <hi>Ally,</hi> and deteſtation of
the <hi>Treachery,)</hi> ſent to the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi>
who no ſooner ſaw and read it, but in
a brutiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paſſion, commanded the right
hand of <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> which he ſuppoſed had
writ it, to be cut off. <hi>Dictum Factum.</hi> A
word and a blow. His <hi>hand</hi> was <hi>ſtruck</hi> off,
and hung up in the Market-place, till Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
when upon Petition that he might
have leave to bury it, it was commanded to
be delivered to him. He takes the <hi>hand,</hi> and
inſtead of laying it in the <hi>Ground, joins</hi> it to
his <hi>Arm,</hi> and proſtrating himſelf before an
Image of our <hi>B. Lady,</hi> which he kept in his
<hi>Oratory,</hi> humbly <hi>beſought</hi> her Interceſſion for
the reſtoring of his hand, that he might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it in ſetting forth her <hi>Son</hi>'s praiſes, and
<hi>Hers:</hi> This done, <hi>ſleep</hi> ſeiz'd on him, and he
beheld the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> looking
upon him with a pleaſant aſpect, and telling
Him, that his <hi>Hand was restored;</hi> which
when he awaked he found to be <hi>true,</hi> and a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48446:255"/>
ſmall <hi>Circle</hi> or <hi>mark</hi> only remaining in the
place where it had been cut off, to teſtify
the truth of the <hi>Miracle:</hi> This is recorded
by <hi>John Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the Life
of St. <hi>John Damaſcen,</hi> and to this I might
add many more of the like kind: But theſe
may ſuffice to ſatisfy an Impartial mind, that
whether the <hi>Saints themſelves hear us or no,</hi>
yet thoſe who implore their
Interceſſion are moſt <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Cura pro mort. Cap. 15.</note> and as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſaith, <hi>helped by them:</hi> And it
can never be <hi>unlawful,</hi> much leſs <hi>Idolatrous</hi>
to uſe <hi>that means</hi> for the obtaining our juſt
deſires, which <hi>God</hi> himſelf hath <hi>atteſted</hi> by
ſo many <hi>Miracles</hi> to be acceptable to him.
All that the Doctor brings to uphold his
ſlippery conſequence, is that <hi>it would be a
ſenſleſs thing to deſire ſome excellent Perſon in
the Indies, when we are at our ſolemn devotion
to pray for us.</hi> And ſo, no doubt he would
have derided thoſe <hi>three Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vita S. Nicol. apud Lipoman.</note> who (being unjuſtly

<hi>Conſtantine,</hi> commended

that time far from the Court,) for <hi>double In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents.</hi>
But <hi>God</hi> who is every where <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>
and to whom the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>World</hi>

the Holy Man to appear to the <hi>Emperour</hi> in
his ſleep, and divert him from executing the
<hi>Sentence.</hi> In fine, if the Doctor will needs
have it to be a <hi>ſenſleſs</hi> thing to call upon the
<hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> for the Aſſiſtance of their
<hi>Prayers,</hi> he muſt either <hi>condemn</hi> the <hi>Lights</hi>
both of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church (as Mr.

to be a convincing Argument, that <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Saints did hear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. The laſt thing he quarrels at, is the
<hi>ſetting up the Images of Saints in ſome higher
place of the Church, and burning Incenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them.</hi> And what he ſays to ſhow this
to be very <hi>Evil,</hi> is that which proves it to
be very <hi>Good,</hi> viz. That the <hi>Perſons,</hi> for whoſe
ſake this is done, are (as we ſuppoſe them)
truly ſuch, as for their <hi>aſsured ſanctity,</hi> would
deſerve to have it done to <hi>themſelves,</hi> though
perhaps <hi>Humility,</hi> or other <hi>Moral</hi> Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
might weigh both with <hi>them,</hi> and the
<hi>Church</hi> not to permit it to be done. Yet we
know, that <hi>Elias</hi> ſate upon the top of a Hill,
and call'd Fire from Heaven upon thoſe two
Captains, who came to <hi>ſeize</hi> him; but
condeſcended to go with the third, who <hi>fell
on his Knees before Him.</hi> And I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be inform'd what <hi>Evil</hi> at all it would be
to ſet a <hi>Saint</hi> (were he preſent) in ſome
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48446:256"/>
                     <hi>higher</hi> Place in the <hi>Church,</hi> (as we do a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop)</hi>
for the People to <hi>ſee</hi> Him, and deſire
his <hi>Prayers.</hi> Perhaps it is the ſmoke of the
<hi>Incenſe,</hi> which troubles his Eyes, that he
cannot diſtinguiſh between the <hi>uſe</hi> of it, as
applyed to <hi>God,</hi> and as applyed to his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
or other <hi>things</hi> relating to him. But
<hi>this</hi> being of its own nature an indifferent
<hi>Ceremony</hi> (as <hi>bowing</hi> and <hi>kneeling</hi> alſo are)
and not appropriated (at leaſt in the <hi>new
Law)</hi> to the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> it is in the
freedome of the <hi>Church</hi> to determine <hi>how</hi>
and <hi>when</hi> it ſhall be uſed. And as when we
<hi>kneel</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>poſture</hi> is a <hi>ſign</hi> of the <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
honour</hi> we give to <hi>him,</hi> as the <hi>Lord</hi>
of all things; but when we do it to a <hi>Holy
Man,</hi> or our <hi>Parents,</hi> it is but a ſign of an
<hi>Inferiour reſpect</hi> due to them. So likewiſe
the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Incenſe,</hi> when directed to
<hi>God,</hi> ſignifies the worſhip we owe to <hi>him;</hi>
but to <hi>Holy Perſons</hi> or things, an <hi>Inferiour
reſpect</hi> or <hi>veneration</hi> to
them for his ſake.<note place="margin">Li. 2. de Miſsa. c. 15.</note> The
<hi>uſe</hi> of it is very <hi>ancient</hi>
as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhows, and the <hi>ſignifications</hi>
many, and very fitly adapted to the <hi>Publick
Service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as well for the <hi>Reverence</hi> of
the <hi>Place;</hi> as to mind us of the <hi>Inacceſſible

God. This then being the <hi>Intention</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>

is anſwered by him, and his Anſwer will ſerve
now as well as then. That Himſelf held ſuch
Formal Invocation a part of the Worſhip due
to Saints, as is evident
from the Prayer he made
to St. Cyprian after his
Martyrdome;<note place="margin">Li. 7. de Bapt. contr. Donat. c. 1.</note> Let B.
Cyprian therefore help us with his Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.
And for a farther Confirmation of it, I add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that Calvin himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
at that time to ſay,<note place="margin">Instit. li. 3. c. 20. nu. 22.</note>
Holy Mary, or Holy Peter
pray for us.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dr.</hi> comes now, as he ſaith (p. 170.)
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:48446:257"/>
                     <hi>to conſider the Anſwer of St. Auſtin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it will ſerve to vindicate us now as well as
then:</hi> And I muſt deſire the Reader to take
the pains to peruſe attentively the words of
St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as they ſtand cited in the <hi>Reply,</hi>
and the Doctor's <hi>Conſiderations</hi> upon them
(for himſelf thought not fit to call them an
<hi>Anſwer;)</hi> that by his Performance in this
Point, he may ſee to what miſerable <hi>ſhifts,</hi>
and diſengenuous <hi>Arts they</hi> are put, who will
<hi>ſhut their Eyes,</hi> and fight againſt the <hi>light</hi> of
a <hi>Noon-day</hi> Truth.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. His <hi>firſt Conſideration</hi> is, that Sr.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> utterly denies that <hi>any Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was performed to the Martyrs.</hi> And how
could he affirm this, if he had not <hi>ſhut</hi> his
<hi>Eyes,</hi> when St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays expreſly in the
place cited, that <hi>it was the cuſtom of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
People in his time, to celebrate with</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<hi>Solemnity the Memories of the Martyrs?</hi>
That the Reader might not ſee this Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
he corrupts the words of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
by tranſlating them after his mode, Viz. <hi>It
was the Cuſtome of the Chriſtians in his time to
have their Religious Aſſemblies at the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres
or Memories of the Martyrs:</hi> As if
their <hi>Meetings</hi> were only to honour <hi>God</hi> in
Himſelf, and not his <hi>Martyrs</hi> for his ſake.
But this is both expreſly oppoſite to the
words themſelves; and is refuted by St.
<hi>Austin</hi> himſelf, when having admitted in
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:48446:258"/>
Anſwer to <hi>Fauſtus</hi> his Objection, that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
did celebrate the Memories of the Martyrs
with Religious Solemnity,</hi> he declares himſelf
not to ſpeak of that <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> which
is due only to God, but ſuch a kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
with <hi>which even Holy Men in this life
are worſhipped. We worſhip therefore,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>the Martyrs with that worſhip of Love and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>But we worſhip them ſo much more
devoutly,</hi> than we do Holy Men upon Earth,
<hi>becauſe more ſecurely, after they have overcome
all the Dangers and Incertainties of this Life.</hi>
He that hath but <hi>half</hi> an <hi>Eye</hi> open muſt ſee,
that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks here of the <hi>Worſhip</hi>
which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of his time gave to the
<hi>Martyrs themſelves.</hi> And that the <hi>Dr.</hi> doth
but <hi>Equivocate</hi> in the term <hi>[Religious worſhip]</hi>
which may <hi>reaſonably</hi> be applyed to the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
due to the <hi>Saints,</hi> as I ſhewed above in
the <hi>2d.</hi> Chap. And whereas he ſaith, that
I <hi>conveniently</hi> left out, what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> adds,
that <hi>not only Sacrifice was refuſed by Saints
and Angels, but any other Religious honour,
which is due to God himſelf, as the Angel for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
St. John to fall down and Worſhip Him;</hi>
had <hi>He</hi> not <hi>conveniently</hi> put thoſe words <hi>[any
other Religious honour]</hi> into the Text (for
they are not in St. <hi>Auſtin)</hi> he had had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to <hi>blind</hi> his Reader with; and yet as
himſelf cites the words, it is evident that
St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>ſuch Religious honour, as
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:48446:258"/>
is due to God himſelf.</hi> Whoever looks into
the Text (which I omitted only for brevities
ſake) will judge he had done much <hi>more
conveniently</hi> for his cauſe, had he left it out.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. <hi>His</hi> ſecond Conſideration, <hi>is, (p. 171)</hi>
that Invocation is expreſly excluded by St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,
as no part of the Worſhip due to Saints.
<hi>And how again without</hi> ſhutting <hi>his</hi> Eyes,
<hi>could he affirm this, when St.</hi> Austin <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſays, that</hi> Christians did celebrate the
Memories of the Martyrs with Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
not only to excite to the Imitation of
their Vertues, but alſo to be partakers of their
Merits, and to obtain help by their Prayers?
<hi>This he</hi> conveniently <hi>avoids the repeating of,
and ſlies for refuge to another place of St.</hi>
Auſtin, <hi>where he ſaith,</hi> We
raiſe no Altars on which to
ſacrifice to Martyrs,<note place="margin">De Civitat. Dei. li. 22. c. 10.</note> but to
One God, the God of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
as well as ours; at which as Men of God
who have overcome the World by Confeſſion of
Him, they are named in their place and order,
but are not invocated by the Prieſt who ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
<hi>And here he thinks he hath done our
work for us. For,</hi> This <hi>(ſaith
the afore-cited Biſh.</hi> Forbes)
is a Teſtimony in which all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
wonderfully exult,<note place="margin">Conſid. Mod. c. 4. p. 317.</note> and
even Triumph; But thoſe of the Church of
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:48446:259"/>
Rome, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> do anſwer, and indeed truly,
that St. Austin ſpeaks here of Invocation in
the Liturgy, and at the Altar, where foraſmuch
as Sacrifice is truly offered to God, <hi>(though
he think many of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in their Explication of it)</hi> Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be directed to God alone. <hi>And that
this was St.</hi> Austin<hi>'s meaning in that place,
would have appeared from the Reaſon he
gives, in the words immediately following
the</hi> Doctor<hi>'s citation, had he not moſt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
<hi>left them out, Viz.</hi> Becauſe the Prieſt,
<hi>ſaith St.</hi> Austin, ſacrifices to God, and not to
the Martyrs, although he ſacrifice in Memory of
the Martyrs, for he is the Prieſt of God, and not
of the Martyrs: <hi>Who ſees not, that St.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin
<hi>here ſpeaks of</hi> Invocation <hi>made by the</hi>
Prieſt <hi>at the</hi> Offering <hi>of the</hi> Sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>§. 4. But that He did allow at other
times the <hi>direct Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> I have
already ſhown in the <hi>4th.</hi> and <hi>5th.</hi> Chapters,
from the Examples of the <hi>devout Mother</hi>
exacting of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the reſtoring her Son
to Life; and of the <hi>poor Man,</hi> who <hi>prayed</hi>
to the <hi>Twenty Martyrs</hi> to be <hi>cloathed.</hi> Both
which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> highly commends, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
them no doubt as <hi>patterns</hi> for our <hi>Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
In his <hi>17th.</hi> Sermon <hi>de verbis Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoli,</hi>
he expreſly affirms, that <hi>it is an Injury
to pray for a Martyr, to whoſe Prayers we ought
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:48446:259"/>
to be commended.</hi> And in his Book of the
Care for the Dead, <hi>c.</hi> 4. &amp; 5. he ſaith, that
the Chriſtians of his time, did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the <hi>Souls</hi> of their <hi>deceaſed Friends</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> but to the <hi>Martyrs</hi> alſo, as <hi>their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons</hi>
to be helped by them: And this he
gives for the Reaſon, why they deſired to
have their <hi>Bodies</hi> buried neer the <hi>Shrines</hi> or
<hi>Sepulchers</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> Viz. <hi>That the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the Place where they were buried, might
excite their Friends to recommend them by
their Prayers to thoſe very Saints.</hi> Theſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
are ſo clear, that they cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be evaded by any ſhift, or pretence
whatſoever of <hi>Rhetorical Apoſtrophes,</hi> or <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Flouriſhes,</hi> or <hi>General Wiſhes</hi> that the
Saints would pray for us. And although
Biſhop <hi>Mountague</hi> with his piercing Wit,
being preſs'd with theſe Authorities, ſought
every chink to eſcape out at, yet Biſh. <hi>Forbes</hi>
(c. 4. p. 320.) confeſſes it was in vain; and
<hi>that he is very ſorry, that the ſaid Biſh. Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague
gave ſo juſt a cauſe to
Joannes Barclaius to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate
with Him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Paraen. li. 2. c. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon the credulity of his Soveraign, and
others in this matter.</hi> And had he been now
alive, he might with grief enough have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the ſame (as I doubt not but many
other learned <hi>Protestanas</hi> do) of Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet.</hi>
As for what he quotes to have been
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:48446:260"/>
obſerved by <hi>Lud. Vives</hi> (if his Obſervation
were true) that <hi>many Chriſtians in his time did</hi>
offend in <hi>re bona,</hi> in <hi>a thing good in it ſelf,</hi>
(which the Doctor leaves out) <hi>becauſe they
did,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>no otherwiſe worſhip Saints, than
they did God himſelf,</hi> (the contrary whereof
is aſſerted by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of
his time,) it imports at moſt but an <hi>Errour</hi>
or <hi>Abuſe</hi> in ſome <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> ſuch as
St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith (in the place above-cited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Fauſtus)</hi> that <hi>whoever falls into it, is
to be reproved by ſound Doctrine, that he may
be either corrected or avoided.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. From St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Teſtimony of the
<hi>cuſtome</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian People</hi> in his time, I paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his <hi>Practice,</hi> and for a Proof of it, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
in the <hi>Prayer</hi>
he made to St. <hi>Cyprian
after his Martyrdome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Li. 7. de Bapt. contr. Donat. c. 1.</note> in
theſe words; <hi>Let bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Cyprian therefore help Us with his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
&amp;c. This the Doctor calls an <hi>Apoſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe,</hi>
that is a <hi>Counterfeit Invocation,</hi> ſuch as
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaid, we <hi>Engliſh men make to a
Bowl, when we pray it, (globum rogamus) to
rubb or run;</hi> And the <hi>compariſon</hi> being ſo
<hi>Parallel</hi> between Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>'s <hi>Globum roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>

<hi>Sanctos rogamus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hom. 26. in 2 Cor.</note> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but wonder, that
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:48446:260"/>
                     <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> who are generally eſteemed the
<hi>beſt Invocators</hi> of <hi>Bowls</hi> in the World, ſhould
nevertheleſs be no better <hi>Invocators of Saints.</hi>
For, if the <hi>devotion</hi> be the <hi>ſame,</hi> it can be no
more <hi>Idolatry</hi> to call upon the <hi>Saints,</hi> than
upon the <hi>Bowls.</hi> But to ſpeak to the words
of St. <hi>Auſtin, [Let B. Cyprian therefore help
us with his Prayers]</hi> whoever conſiders the
<hi>Motive</hi> alledged by Him, why he addreſſed
himſelf to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which was for that
in Heaven, <hi>He ſaw more clearly the truth of
that Question,</hi> of which himſelf had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
doubted, and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was then treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of; and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> he had of his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>as being yet in this Mortal Fleſh, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
as in a dark Cloud;</hi> will eaſily ſee
that it was not <hi>a counterfeit,</hi> but a <hi>true</hi> and
<hi>ſerious</hi> addreſs to <hi>Him</hi> for the aſſiſtance of
his <hi>Prayers:</hi> And <hi>Chemnitius</hi>
no doubt underſtood it ſo,<note place="margin">Exam. part. 3. p. 211.</note>
when ſpeaking of this very
paſſage of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating</hi>
St. <hi>Cyprian: This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Auſtin
did, ſuffering himſelf to be carried away with
the Times, and Cuſtome.</hi> Well, but for all
this, the Doctor will have it to be a <hi>wiſh,
rather than a Prayer, and he doubts his ſaying
the like to</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin, Let Bleſſed Austin now
help me with his Prayers, would not be taken by
us for a renouncing the Proteſtant Doctrine,
and embracing that of the Church of Rome.</hi>
                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:48446:261"/>
To this I Anſwer, although the word <hi>Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi>
taken <hi>Grammatically,</hi> be of the <hi>wiſhing</hi> or
<hi>Optative Mood;</hi> yet taken with all the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi>
above-mention'd, and the <hi>cuſtome</hi>
of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> People of that time approved
by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> it imports as much a <hi>formal
requeſt,</hi> as if a <hi>Child</hi> ſhould ſay to his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Benedicat, Let my Father bleſs me:</hi> For
it is not ſo much the <hi>Mood,</hi> as the <hi>Mode</hi> (that
is, uſe and cuſtome) which determins the
<hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>words:</hi> And if the Doctor will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
a tryal of it, Let him but profeſs as St.
<hi>Austin</hi> did, that we ought to <hi>celebrate with
Religious Solemnity the Memories of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
to be aſſiſted by their Prayers;</hi> and that
it is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> to <hi>commend our ſelves
to their Prayers;</hi> and upon this account ſay,
as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let B. Cyprian help me with
his Prayers,</hi> I dare undertake his <hi>own Party</hi>
ſhall take it for <hi>renouncing the Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and embracing that of the Church of
Rome.</hi> But he is ſo far either from making
this <hi>Profeſſion</hi> with St. <hi>Austin,</hi> or ſaying to
him, <hi>Let B. Auſtin now help me with his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
that he would have the Reader to take it
for <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>ſuperſtitions,</hi> which he would
give us to underſtand, <hi>crept in after the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
Meetings at the Sepulchers of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
grew in requeſt. For</hi>
S. <hi>Auſtin himſelf,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contr. Fauſtum. li. 20. c. 21.</note> ſaith he,
<hi>affirmeth, that what they
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:48446:261"/>
taught was one thing, and what they did bear
with was another, ſpeaking of the cuſtomes uſed
at thoſe Solemnities.</hi> And is it poſſible he
could think ſo great a <hi>Forb</hi> as this could
paſs for <hi>current</hi> in the World? Is it poſſible
he could have <hi>courage</hi> enough to cite the
place, where thoſe words are to be found,
and not fear a <hi>Rat?</hi> Obſerve I pray: What
St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> condemns in that place is this,
that <hi>ſome</hi> who brought <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Meat</hi> to the
<hi>Sepulchers</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> took ſo plentifully
of them, that <hi>they made themſelves drunk.</hi>
His words are theſe, <hi>As for thoſe who make
themſelves drunk at the Sepulchers of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
how can they be approved by us, whom
ſound Doctrine condemns, even when they do it
in their own private Houſes.</hi> This was the
cuſtome of which St. <hi>Austin</hi> ſaith, that the
Governours of the Church <hi>did not teach it,
but bore with, till it could be amended.</hi> And
the Doctor had the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> by a ſubtil
Inſinuation, to make his Reader believe, that
what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> condemned, was the <hi>deſiring,</hi>
or, as he calls it, <hi>wiſhing</hi> the <hi>Martyrs to pray
for them.</hi> I ſhall leave him to make <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and proceed to
that which he calls the <hi>Queſtion between us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. <hi>The Queſtion between us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is
not how far ſuch wiſhes, rather than prayers,
being uttered occaſionally, as</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin doth
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:48446:262"/>
this to</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian, but whether ſolemn Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints in the duties of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
as it is now practiſed in the Roman Church,
were ever practiſed in</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin's time? This
he utterly denies, and here,</hi> ſaith he, (p. 174.)
<hi>we ſtand and fix our Foot againſt all oppoſition
whatſoever.</hi> Thus expiring <hi>Candle</hi> gathers
up its ſpirits, and forces it ſelf into a <hi>blaze</hi>
before it dies. Alas! that ſo many <hi>learned</hi>
Men ſhould all this while have been <hi>miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
in the Queſtion! that they ſhould have
ſpent ſo much <hi>oyl</hi> and <hi>ſweat</hi> to no purpoſe!
The great Queſtion hitherto controverted
between Catholicks and Proteſtants, was
held to be, <hi>Whether it be lawful to Invocate
the Saints to pray for Us?</hi> and <hi>whether this
were agreeable to the practiſe of the Primitive
times?</hi> But now, like a <hi>miſchievous Card</hi> that
will ſpoil the <hi>hand, this</hi> is <hi>dropt</hi> under the
Table, and all the <hi>ſhow</hi> above-board, is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it may be done in the <hi>duties</hi> (as he calls
them) <hi>of Religious Worſhip?</hi> He ſaw how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his <hi>Foot</hi> had <hi>ſlipt,</hi> whilſt he endeavoured
to <hi>ſtand</hi> upon the denial, of its being the
cuſtome of the <hi>Fathers</hi> to <hi>deſire</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi>
to pray for them; and therefore he catches
hold of this <hi>Twigg</hi> to ſave
himſelf,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conſid. Mod.</hi> p. 308.</note> but in vain; for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:48446:262"/>
he be loath to give it any other name
but that of <hi>wiſhing.</hi> But <hi>Chemnitius, (That

without mincing the
matter,<note place="margin">Exam. Conc. Trid. part. 3. p. 200.</note> acknowledges
freely, that <hi>Invocation of
Saints began to be brought
into the publick Aſſemblies of the Church by
Baſil, Niſſen, and Nazianzen, who lived in the
Century before St. Auſtin:</hi> and could little
doubt of the Continuance of it in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s

can tell us what the Doctor means by the

of Sermons,</hi> (which is ſo much cry'd up
by thoſe of his Party, as if it were the <hi>Pro</hi>

that,<note place="margin">De-reb. Eccl. c. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>that form</hi> of
<hi>Invocating</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> was
believed to be much more <hi>Ancient:</hi> Viz.
<hi>from the time that</hi> St. <hi>Hierom tranſlated the
Epitome of Euſebius his Martyrologe into
Latin:</hi> or, (as others explicate his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
before that time, but not in ſo great a
number. But then again, if he ſpeak of that
Part of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> which was anciently called
the <hi>Maſs</hi> of the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and ſerves as
a <hi>Preparatory</hi> devotion, both to Prieſt and
People, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> indeed before he aſcends
to the <hi>Altar,</hi> deſires the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> and the
reſt of the <hi>Saints,</hi> as alſo the <hi>People, to pray
to our Lord God for him,</hi> and in the <hi>Verſicles</hi>
between the <hi>Epistle</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> there are
ſome Inſtances (though very rare) of <hi>Holy
Mary,</hi> or <hi>Holy Paul pray for us;</hi> but as theſe
are not excluded by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who ſpeaks
only of the <hi>Prieſt</hi>'s directing his <hi>Invocation</hi>
to <hi>God</hi> alone in the <hi>offering</hi> of the <hi>ſacrifice;</hi>
ſo neither can the Doctor give any ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> why the <hi>Prieſt</hi> may not lawfully
uſe it then, (eſpecially being appointed by
the Church,) as in his private Oratory. But
if he mean that <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:48446:263"/>
from the <hi>Offertory,</hi> and was anciently
call'd the <hi>Maſs</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> in which the
Prieſt addreſſes himſelf expreſly to <hi>Offer</hi>
up the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> hath Inſtituted in his own <hi>Body</hi> and
<hi>Blood;</hi> Let him, if he can, (for, he ſaith, <hi>he
hath look'd into our Miſsals)</hi> produce any <hi>one</hi>
Inſtance of <hi>Formal Invocation</hi> to any <hi>Saint</hi>
or <hi>Angel.</hi> There they are <hi>named</hi> at this day
(as they were in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time) <hi>in their
place and Order,</hi> but are not <hi>Invocated</hi> by
the Prieſt that Sacrifices: So that in <hi>this,</hi>
which is the <hi>moſt proper</hi> and peculiar <hi>duty</hi>
of <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> (as I have ſhown in the
<hi>3d.</hi> Chap. it was accounted by St. <hi>Auſtin)</hi>
there is a moſt perfect <hi>Conformity</hi> between
the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Modern</hi> Church: and
the <hi>difference</hi> in other leſs ſolemn parts of
Devotion, <hi>not</hi> at all <hi>material,</hi> as hath been
ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. In the laſt place (p. 174.) the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
ſaith, <hi>He is ſent from</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin to Calvin,
whoſe Authority, (though never owned as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
by Him) he need not,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>fear
in this point;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Errand,</hi> (if
he will have it ſo,) could not be <hi>ungrateful.</hi>
I may well think his heart leap'd for joy to
hear <hi>Calvin</hi> alledged for a <hi>witneſs,</hi> that <hi>it was
the cuſtome in</hi> St. <hi>Austin's time to ſay, Holy
Peter pray for Us:</hi> and thereupon, as if the
<hi>day</hi> were his <hi>own,</hi> he ſays, <hi>He cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:48446:264"/>
that if I ſaw the words in Calvin, or Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,
that I would produce them.</hi> But hold:
Have not I more Reaſon to <hi>wonder</hi> at his
<hi>wonder,</hi> if it be true what Himſelf makes
<hi>Calvin</hi> to ſay, Viz. <hi>That the Council of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage
did forbid praying to Saints, leſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
prayers ſhould be corrupted by ſuch kind
of Addreſſes, Holy Peter pray for us?</hi> For
why, I pray, was ſuch a Decree made, and
why did the <hi>Fathers</hi> of that <hi>Council</hi> fear, leſt
the <hi>publick prayers</hi> ſhould be corrupted
with <hi>ſuch kind</hi> of addreſſes; if there were
<hi>no ſuch cuſtome</hi> at that time? Either the <hi>Dr.
corrupts</hi> the words of his dear <hi>Maſter Calvin;</hi>
or, it is manifeſt, they <hi>imply</hi> it was the <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>
at that time to ſay, <hi>Holy Peter pray for
Us.</hi> And to make this clearer, I ſhall ſet
down, 1. What <hi>Calvin really</hi> ſaith. 2. What
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> anſwers to him. And from both it
will appear, that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſuppoſes there was
ſuch a <hi>custome;</hi> and withall that <hi>Calvin</hi> hath
<hi>corrupted</hi> the words and meaning of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
and D. <hi>St.</hi> miſrepreſented thoſe of <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. What <hi>Calvin really</hi> ſaith, is this, viz.
<hi>That it was anciently
forbidden in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Carthage that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
prayer or Invocation be made to the Saints
at the Altar.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inſtit. li. 3. c. 20. n. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>And it is probable,</hi> the reaſon
was, <hi>for that thoſe Holy Men, when they could
not totally Repreſs the force of an evil Cuſtome,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:48446:264"/>
they thought good at leaſt to put this reſtraint
upon it, leſt the publick prayers might be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with this Forme; Holy Peter pray for
Us.</hi> This is what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith. And who
ſees not, that <hi>the cuſtome</hi> (no wonder if <hi>He</hi>
call it an <hi>ill</hi> one.) <hi>whoſe force,</hi> he ſuppoſeth,
<hi>the Council would, but could not totally Repreſs,</hi>
was <hi>this form</hi> of addreſs, <hi>Holy Peter pray for
Us?</hi> And He that ſees this, muſt ſhut his
Eyes, if he ſees not that in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Opinion,
it was the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of that time (however <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable</hi>
he would make it) to ſay, <hi>Holy Peter
pray for Us.</hi> For how could he make the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining</hi>
that <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> to be the reaſon of the
<hi>Law,</hi> if he did not <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> there was ſuch a
<hi>cuſtome,</hi> and that a <hi>forcible</hi> one too? But
then again, who ſees not, that for fear the
Reader ſhould ſee this, the Dr. moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
left out of his citation thoſe words
of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which were moſt material to the
preſent purpoſe <hi>[viz.</hi> that the <hi>Decree</hi> was
made <hi>to forbid direct praying to Saints at the
Altar, and the Reaſon in his Opinion, why thoſe
Fathers made that Decree, was to reſtrain the
force of an evil cuſtome, which they could not
totally Repreſs?]</hi> For had theſe words been
put down, the thing had been too clear to be
denied, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Calvin acknowledged there
was ſuch a cuſtome at that time:</hi> As in a like
caſe, if the <hi>Elders</hi> ſhould make a <hi>Sanction,</hi>
that hereafter it ſhall not be lawful for Dr.
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:48446:265"/>
                     <hi>St.</hi> to miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>report the words and ſenſe of their
<hi>Patriarch Calvin;</hi> and I ſhould ſay, that in
my Opinion, the Reaſon would be to <hi>reſtrain</hi>
the <hi>force</hi> of an <hi>evil cuſtom,</hi> which they could
not <hi>totally repreſs</hi> in him, of doing it in moſt
of the Authors he cites; I dare confidently
aver, he would not ſtick to charge me, that
I ſaid, he had <hi>ſuch a cuſtom:</hi> which if he think
good to do, the many <hi>inſtances</hi> I have brought
of his <hi>inſincere</hi> dealing in this kind, wil more
than ſufficiently acquit me.</p>
                  <p>2. What <hi>Bellarmin (de ſanct, beat. li. 1. c. 16.)</hi>
anſwers to this Objection of <hi>Calvin,</hi> is, that
<hi>Calvin</hi> corrupted the words and ſenſe of the
<hi>Council,</hi> when he ſaid, that what it forbad, was
<hi>to make direct Prayer or Invocation to Saints at
the Altar,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Council</hi> ſpeaks not at all
of <hi>praying to Saints,</hi> but only ordains that <hi>the
prayer of him that ſacrifices be directed to the
Father,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> to the <hi>Son.</hi> He ſays indeed,
that <hi>Calvin</hi> by <hi>his Logick</hi> deduces <hi>that,</hi> becauſe
<hi>prayer</hi> is to be <hi>directed</hi> to the <hi>Father,</hi> therfore
<hi>the Saints may not be Invocated:</hi> and then far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that <hi>the Council decreed, that that form of
Invocation, Holy Peter pray for us, ſhould not be
uſed.</hi> And this I can eaſily believe was <hi>Calvins
ultimate deſign</hi> in corrupting the <hi>Canon</hi> of the
<hi>Council.</hi> But where doth <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſay, that
there <hi>was no ſuch cuſtome</hi> in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time;
or that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid, there was <hi>no ſuch cuſtome</hi>
at that time? Why then is it made a wonder,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:48446:265"/>
that <hi>if I ſaw the words in Calvin or Bellarmin, I
would produce them?</hi> The <hi>Reaſon</hi> was, to make
the <hi>Reader</hi> believe, that <hi>himſelf</hi> could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be <hi>guilty</hi> at that very time of a <hi>crime,</hi>
which he imputed to his <hi>Adverſary.</hi> But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
conſiders the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> he hath
undertaken, will ſee <hi>no cauſe</hi> to <hi>wonder</hi> at this
procedure, becauſe it is the <hi>natural effect</hi> of
ſuch a <hi>cauſe,</hi> to put the maintainer upon the
deſperate ſhift of miſ-repreſenting the words
and ſenſe of Authors, and no Man wonders at
a <hi>natural</hi> effect, eſpecially if it be <hi>frequent,</hi> as
<hi>this</hi> of the Doctor's is.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. But now the <hi>blaze</hi> is ſpent, and there
only remains a little <hi>ſmoke,</hi> viz. that <hi>I may as
well the next time bring St. Auſtin's Teſtimony
for worſhipping of Martyrs, Images, and Angels,
becauſe he ſaith, he knew many who adored Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Pictures, and had tryed to go to God by
praying to Angels.</hi> What this <hi>[as well]</hi> relates
to, I cannot tell; but I am ſure he uſes the <hi>ſame
Art</hi> here, in bringing <hi>theſe Teſtimonies</hi> againſt
us, which he did before in alledging the <hi>cuſtom</hi>
of thoſe who made themſelves <hi>drunk</hi> at the
<hi>Sepulchers</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs.</hi> For either S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſpeaks here of the <hi>Errours</hi> of ſuch as were
profeſſed <hi>Hereticks;</hi> or, if any who profeſſed
themſelves <hi>Catholicks</hi> fell into them, they were
the <hi>Errors</hi> of particular <hi>Perſons,</hi> (though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,)
and juſtly <hi>reproved</hi> by him: Whereas
the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of <hi>Invocating</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> to pray for
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:48446:266"/>
us, was the <hi>Univerſal practice</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi>
at that time, <hi>not reproved,</hi> but <hi>owned, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi>
and <hi>abetted</hi> by the moſt Religious <hi>Biſhops</hi>
and <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> and by
St. <hi>Austin</hi> himſelf, as hath been ſhown: and
by <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>all after their time;</hi> as Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi>
confeſſes. Wherefore if the Doctor be
ſtill reſolved to keep his <hi>ſtanding</hi> againſt ſo
great a ſtrength of Authority, and give <hi>no
more ſatisfactory account</hi> hereafter, than he
hath already done, of charging the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> with <hi>Idolatry:</hi> It is manifeſt, that
his Foot <hi>ſticks faſt</hi> (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith)
<hi>in the deep Mire, where no ground is:</hi> or, to
ſpeak in Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi>'s language, in the
depth of <hi>Schiſm:</hi> From whence, that he
may be drawn out before <hi>the Flood run over
him,</hi> is the hearty wiſh of Him, who <hi>honours</hi>
his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> whilſt he detects his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry,</hi>
and refutes his <hi>Calumnies.</hi>
