            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
STATIONER
To the
Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>THe life of this
Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was a life
of Prayer; Five houres
in a day he spent in his
Devotions, and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
months before his
dissolution hee gave
himselfe wholy up to
converse with God;
<pb facs="tcp:119056:3"/>
It is most remarkable,
and may instruct Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
that when sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
had deprived
him of his <hi>voyce,</hi> yet
his eyes and <hi>hands</hi>
prayed; and when
both they failed, his
<hi>heart</hi> still prayed, till
it pleased God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it as his last Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
This testimony
and Character of his
holy Pietie, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from learned
Bishop <hi>Buckeridge,</hi>
who being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his life,
<pb facs="tcp:119056:3"/>
commended his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
memory to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in a funerall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
one of the last of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
which as men, and
christians, we are wont
to pay to Honour and
Virtue; In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his life hee was
seldome seene without
these devotions in his
hand; he penned them
in Greeke, and in that
language presented
them to his God; the
reason, it is not for mee
to determine; whether
it were for that the
<pb facs="tcp:119056:4"/>
clearest evidences of
our salvation are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to us in that
tongue, or whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those fifteene
he was Master of, he
chose this language as
the most copious to
expresse the fulnesse of
his soule. It appeares
not as yet who transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this manuall of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
some of his
learned Friends, (to
whom the world owes
much for the benefit of
of this publication) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
me, that they
<pb facs="tcp:119056:4"/>
found them written
with his owne hand,
from whence they had
the happiness to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
them; it is not
improbable that wee
are indebted to the
same hand for the
translation, to whom
we owe the originall;
since I could never yet
learne that any have
laid claime thereunto;
it being no new thing
in this ambitious age,
for men to indeavour
to translate fames, as
well as bookes, it may
<pb facs="tcp:119056:5"/>
seeme strange in these
<hi>ex-tempore</hi> times, for
me, to send these <hi>Set
formes</hi> to the presse,
since I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
how of late it
hath been hotly dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
whether it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to pray to God
with consideration, or
without, against this
wild fancy I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
I could not oppose
any argument above
the example of this
learned Doctor of our
Church.</p>
            <p>Who though he was
<pb facs="tcp:119056:5"/>
so universall in allholy
dimensions, you may
be pleased to observe
the reverentiall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
of his soule, in
these his approaches
to the highest Majesty;
hee well knew the
distance betwixt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth, betwixt
God and himselfe,
which I hope will be
a motive to every pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Christian, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
saith, not to be
rash with his mouth,
<hi>Ecles.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
            <p>I must clearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
<pb facs="tcp:119056:6"/>
when these Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
came first to my
hand, I resolved to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
them in my own
heart; but considering
with my selfe that no
man might better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the divulging of
so usuall a booke, then
one of my profession,
and withall that there
were divers manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and the Church
might be deprived of
this genuine Edition,
and I of mine owne
right, I thought this
<pb facs="tcp:119056:6"/>
publication absolutely
necessary, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that no man
could justly except
against this Reverend
<hi>Author,</hi> who both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
&amp; at home was
acknowledged for his
Pietie and learning, to
have been one of the
Oracles of the church;
much less against these
his devotions, which
are for the most part
selected out of the
holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>And whereas he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrot his controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
<pb facs="tcp:119056:7"/>
and Sermons for the
benefit of others, these
pieces I suppose cannot
be too well thought off,
which he kept peculiar
to himselfe, having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
and consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, to his private
use for the employment
of his owne soule.</p>
            <p>This treasure, so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
laid up in his life
time, I thought good not
to keep wrapt up in a
napkin from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
injoy it thankfully,
to the glory of that God,
who kindled these holy
<pb facs="tcp:119056:7"/>
fires in his soule, and let
the memory of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Author, in spight
of ignorance and malice,
be perpetuated and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by after ages, as for
mee, I shall never desire
any higher recompence,
then to be in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
serviceable to the
Church, and to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>

            <p>IN the handling of
which <hi>Particulars,</hi> that
the Word of God may at
this time obtaine in us the
end to which it was by
him ordained, and that
this our whole action may
be profitable, let us by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119056:94"/>
our Prayers <hi>hither</hi> invite
the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> Invoaking
to that end the <hi>Father</hi> by
the <hi>Sonne.</hi> And least wee
should be forgetfull of <hi>her</hi>
in <hi>our</hi> Prayers, which in
<hi>hers</hi> is never unmindefull
of us; let us make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Father,</hi> for his <hi>Church
Catholike,</hi> not <hi>Romane</hi> but
<hi>Universall, militant</hi> upon

face of the World. That
<hi>God</hi> would preserve unto
<hi>her, his Truth, now</hi> long
since recovered out of the
thickest darkenesse of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
that when it shall
seeme good unto him, her
<hi>Unity,</hi> now almost lost
through the dissentions of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119056:94"/>
the Christian world, may
be restored.</p>
            <p>And let us not without
groanes commend unto
<hi>God,</hi> that part thereof,
which besides and above
the rest, stands in speciall
neede of our supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
I mean our Brethren,
for what reason soever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and afflicted with
any kinde of crosse.</p>
            <p>Let us pray for an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
end of their tryals, and
while the issue is uncertain,
for so much patience as
shall be necessary to the
meeke and constant suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their troubles.</p>
            <p>For the portion of the

great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
