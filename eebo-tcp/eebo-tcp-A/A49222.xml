         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

full of moſt gracious conceſſions to Proteſtants.

            <p>
               <hi>LEWES,</hi> by the Grace of God, King of <hi>France</hi> and of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> to all Preſent and to come, Greeting. King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Great, Our Grandfather of Glorious Memory,
deſiring to prevent, that the Peace which he had procured
for his Subjects, after the great Loſſes they had ſuſtained, by the long
continuance of Civil and Forreign Wars, might not be diſturbed by
occaſion of the pretended Reformed Religion, as it had been during
the Reign of the Kings his Predeceſſors, had by his Edict given at
<hi>Nantes,</hi> in the Month of <hi>April, 1598.</hi> Regulated the Conduct which
was to be obſerved with Reſpect to thoſe of the ſaid Religion, the
places where they might publickly exerciſe the ſame, appointed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Judges, to adminiſter Juſtice to them; and laſtly, alſo by
ſeveral diſtinct Articles provided for every thing, which he judged
needful for the maintenance of Peace and Tranquility in his Kingdom,
and to diminiſh the Averſion which was between thoſe of the one and
other Religion; and this, to the end that he might be in a better
condition for the taking ſome effectual courſe (which he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to do) to reunite thoſe again to the Church, who upon ſo ſlight
occaſions had withdrawn themſelves from it. And foraſmuch as this
Intention of the King, our ſaid Grandfather, could not be effected,
by reaſon of his ſuddain and precipitated Death; and that the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the foreſaid Edict was Interrupted during the Minority of
the late King, Our moſt Honoured Lord and Father, of Glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
by reaſon of ſome new Enterpriſes of thoſe of the Pretended
Reformed Religion, whereby they gave occaſion for their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of ſeveral advantages which had been granted to them, by
the foreſaid Edict: Notwithſtanding, the King, Our ſaid late Lord
and Father, according to his wonted Clemency, granted them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Edict at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> in the Month of <hi>July 1629,</hi> by means of which
the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom being now again re-eſtabliſhed,
the ſaid late King, being animated with the ſame Spirit and Zeal for
Religion, as the King Our ſaid Grandfather was, reſolved to make
<pb facs="tcp:49845:3"/>
good uſe of this Tranquility, by endeavouring to put this pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in Execution, but Wars abroad, coming on a few years after, ſo
that from the Year 1635, to the Truce which was concluded with
the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> in 1684. The Kingdom having been only for
ſome ſhort Intervals altogether free from troubles, it was not poſſible
to do any other thing for the advantage of Religion, ſave only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
the number of places permitted for the Exerciſe of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Reformed Religion, as well by the Interdiction of thoſe which
were found erected, in prejudice to the diſpoſal made in the ſaid
Edict, as by ſuppreſſing the mix'd Chambers of Judicature, whichwer
compoſed of an equal number of Papiſts and Proteſtants, the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which was only done by Proviſion, and to ſerve the preſent
Exigency.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore at length it hath pleaſed God to grant, that Our
Subjects enjoying a perfect Peace, and We Our ſelves being no longer
taken up with the cares of protecting them againſt our Enemies, are
now in a condition to make good uſe of the ſaid Truce, which we
have on purpoſe facilitated, in order to the applying our ſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
in the ſearching out of means, which might ſucceſsfully effect
and accompliſh the deſign of the Kings, our ſaid Grand-father and
Father, and which alſo hath been our Intention ever ſince we came to
the Crown; we ſee at preſent (not without a juſt acknowledgment
of what we owe to God on that account) that our endeavours have
attained the end we propos'd to Our ſelves, forasmuch as the greater
and better part of Our Subjects of the ſaid Pretended Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
have already embraced the Catholick, and ſince by means
thereof, the Execution of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and of all other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
in favour of the ſaid Pretended Reformed Religion, is made
uſeleſs, we judge that we can do nothing better towards the entire
effacing of the memory of thoſe Troubles, Confuſion and Miſchief,
which the Progreſs of that falſe Religion, hath been the cauſe of in
Our Kingdom, and which have given occaſion to the ſaid Edict, and
to ſo many other Edicts and Declarations which went before it, or
were made ſince with reference thereto, than by a Total Revocation
of the ſaid Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and the particular Articles and Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
granted therein, and whatſoever elſe hath been Enacted ſince
in favour of the ſaid Religion.</p>

Exerciſed upon thoſe of <hi>Montauban,</hi>
and which continue to be put in Practiſe
in other places againſt thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion in <hi>France,</hi> for to make
them Renounce their Religion.</head>
            <p>ON <hi>Saturday</hi> the 8/18 of <hi>Auguſt 1685.</hi> the Intendant of the
Upper <hi>Guienne,</hi> who Reſides at <hi>Montauban,</hi> having
Summoned the Principal <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the ſaid City
to come before him, repreſenting unto them, that
they could not be Ignorant that the abſolute Will and
Pleaſure of the King was, to Tolerate but one Religion in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, and therefore wiſhed them
readily to comply with the ſame, and in order thereto, adviſed them
to Aſſemble themſelves and conſider what Reſolution they would take.
To this Propoſal ſome anſwered, <hi>That there was no need of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
themſelves upon that Account, foraſmuch as every one of them
in particular, were to Try and Examine themſelves, and be always in
a readineſs to give a reaſon of the Faith which was in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day the Intendant again Commanded them to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Town-Houſe, which ſhould be left free for them from
Noon till Six of the Clock in the Evening, where Meeting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
they Unanimouſly reſolved, as they had Lived, ſo to perſiſt
till Death in their Religion; which Reſolution of theirs, there were
ſome Deputed by them to declare to the Intendant; who preſenting
themſelves before him, he who was appointed Spokeſman, began to
Addreſs himſelf to the Intendant in theſe Words: My Lord, <hi>We
are not unacquainted how we are menaced with the greateſt Violence.
Hold there,</hi> ſaid the Intendant (interrupting him) <hi>No Violence.</hi> After
this the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> continued; <hi>But whatever Force or Violence may be
put upon us</hi>—Here the Intendant interrupting him again, ſaid, <hi>I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49845:6"/>
forbid you to uſe any ſuch Words:</hi> Upon which ſecond Interruption, he
contented himſelf to aſſure him in few words, <hi>That they were all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to Live and Dye in their Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day after the Battallion of <hi>La Fere</hi> conſiſting of 16 Companies,
entred the City, and were followed by many more. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
all this while Dreaming of no other Deſign they had againſt them,
but that of Ruining their Eſtates and Impoveriſhing them, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
taken ſome Meaſures how to bear the ſaid Tryal; they had
made a Common Purſe for the Relief of ſuch who ſhould be moſt
Burthen'd with Quartering, and were come to a Reſolution to poſſeſs
what they had in common: But alaſs, how far theſe poor Souls were
miſtaken in their Accounts, and how different the Treatment they
received from the <hi>Dragoons</hi> was, from what they had expected, I ſhall
now Relate to you.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, in order to their Executing the Deſign and Project
they had formed againſt them, they made the Souldiers take up their
Quarters in one certain place of the City, but withal appointed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Corp de Gards</hi> to cut off the Communication which one part of the
City might have with the other, and poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Gates,
that none might make their Eſcape. Things being thus ordered, the
Troopers, Souldiers and Dragoons began to Practiſe all manner of
Hoſtilities and Cruelties wherewith the Devil can Inſpire the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
and Reprobate Minds: They marr'd and defac'd their Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdſtuff,
broke their Looking-Glaſſes, and other like Utenſils and
Ornaments, they let the Wine run about their Cellars, caſt abroad and
ſpoil'd their Corn, and other Alimentary Proviſions: and as for thoſe
things which they could not break and daſh to pieces, as the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Beds, Hangings, Tapiſtry, Linnen, Wearing Apparrel, Plate, and
things of the like Nature, theſe they carried to the Market place,
where the Jeſuits bought them of the Souldiers, and encouraged the
<hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to do the like. They did not ſtick to Sell the very
Houſes of ſuch who were moſt Reſolute and Conſtant in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
It is ſuppoſed according to a Moderate Calculation, that in
the time of four or five days, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of that City were the
Poorer by a Million of Money, than they were before the entring of
theſe Miſſionaries. There were Souldiers who demanded 400 Crowns
a piece of their Hoſts for ſpending Money, and many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were
forced to pay down Ten Piſtols to each Souldier upon the ſame
account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49845:6"/>
In the mean time the outrages they committed upon their Perſons
were moſt deteſtable and Barbarous, I ſhall only here ſet down ſome
few of which I have been particularly Inform'd. A certain Taylor
called <hi>Bearnois</hi> was bound and drag'd by the Souldiers to the <hi>Corp de
Gard,</hi> where they Boxed and Buffetted him all Night, all which blows
and Indignities he ſuffered with the greateſt conſtancy Imaginable.
The Troopers who Quartered with Mounſieur <hi>Solignac</hi> made his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Room a Stable for their Horſes, tho the Furniture of it was Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
at 10000 Livers, and forc'd him to turn the Broach till his Arm
was near Burnt, by their continual caſting of Wood upon the Fire.
A Paſſenger as he went through the ſaid City ſaw ſome Souldiers
beating a Poor Man even to Death, for to force him to go to Maſs,
whilſt the conſtant Martyr to his laſt Breath, cryed, <hi>He would never
do it,</hi> and only requeſted they would <hi>Diſpatch and make an end of him.</hi>
The Barons of <hi>Cauſſade</hi> and <hi>De la Motte,</hi> whoſe Conſtancy and Piety
might have Inſpired Courage and Reſolution to the reſt of the Citizens,
were ſent away to <hi>Cahors.</hi> Mounſieur <hi>D' Alliez</hi> one of the prime
Gentlemen of <hi>Montauban,</hi> being a Venerable Old Man, found ſo ill
Treatment at their hands, as its thought he will ſcarcely eſcape with
Life. Mounſieur <hi>De Garriſon</hi> who was one of the moſt conſiderable
Men of that City, and an intimate Friend of the Intendant, went
and caſt himſelf at his Feet, imploring his Protection, and conjuring
him to rid him of the Souldiers, that he might have no force put upon
his Conſcience, adding, that in Recompence of this Favour, he beg'd
of him, <hi>He would willingly give him all he had,</hi> which was to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of about a Million of Livers; but by all his Entreaties and Proffers
he could not in the leaſt prevail with the Intendant, who gave order,
that for a Terror to the meaner ſort, he ſhould be worſe uſed than the
reſt, by dragging him along the Streets.</p>
            <p>The Method they moſt commonly made uſe of, for to make them
abjure their Religion, and which could not be the Product of any
thing but Hell, was this; Some of the moſt ſtrong and vigorous Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
took their Hoſts or other Perſons of the Houſe, and walk'd them up
and down in ſome Chamber, continually tickling them and toſſing them
like a Ball from one to another, without giving them the leaſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and keeping them in this condition for three days and nights
together, without Meat, Drink or Sleep; when they were ſo wearied
and fainting, that they could no longer ſtand upon their Legs, they
laid them on a Bed, continuing as before to Tickle and Torment them;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49845:7"/>
after ſome time when they thought them ſomewhat recovered, they
made them riſe, and walked them up and down as before, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
tickling, and other times Laſhing them with Rods, to keep
them from Sleeping. As ſoon as one Party of theſe Barbarous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters
were Tyred and wearied out, they were Relieved by others
of their Companions, who coming freſh to the Work, with greater
Vig<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap> and Violence reiterated the ſame Courſe. By this Infernal
Invention (which they had formerly made uſe of with ſucceſs, in
<hi>Bearn</hi> and other places) many went Diſtracted, and others became
Mopiſh and Stupid, and remain ſo.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who made their Eſcape were fain to abandon their Eſtates,
yea, their Wives, Children, and Aged Relations to the Mercy of theſe
Barbarous and more then Savage Troops. The ſame Cruelties were
Acted at <hi>Negrepliſſe,</hi> a City near to <hi>Montauban,</hi> where theſe Bloody
Emiſſaries committed unparallel'd Outrages. <hi>Iſaac Favin,</hi> a Citizen
of that place was hung up by his Arm-pits, and Tormented a whole
Night by Pinching and Tearing of his Fleſh with Pincers, tho by all
this they were not able to ſhake his Conſtancy in the leaſt. The Wife
of one <hi>Rouſſion</hi> a Joyner, being violently drag'd by the Souldiers along
the Streets, for to force her to hear Maſs, Dyed of this Cruel and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
Treatment, as ſoon as ſhe reach'd the Church Porch.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other their Deviliſh Inventions this was one, they made a
great Fire round about a Boy of about Ten Years of Age, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
with Hands and Eyes lifted to Heaven, cryed, <hi>My God help
me,</hi> and when they ſaw the Lad reſolved to Dye ſo, rather than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his Religion, they ſnatch'd him from the Fire, when he was
at the very point of being Burnt. The Cities of <hi>Cauſſade, Realville,</hi>
St. <hi>Anthonin,</hi> and other Towns and places in the Upper <hi>Guienne,</hi> met
with the ſame Entertainment, as well as <hi>Bergerac,</hi> and many other
places of <hi>Perigord,</hi> and of the Lower <hi>Guienne,</hi> which had a like ſhare
of theſe Cruel and Inhumane Uſages.</p>
            <p>The forementioned Troops marched at laſt to <hi>Caſtres,</hi> to commit
the ſame Inſolencies and Barbarities there alſo; and it is not to be
doubted, but that they will continue and carry on the ſame courſe of
Cruelties, where ever they go, if God in Pity and Compaſſion to his
People do not reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>It is to be ſeared (for it ſeems but too probable) that this dreadful
Perſecution in conjunction with thoſe Artifices the Papiſts make uſe
of to Diſguiſe their Religion, and to, perſwade Proteſtants that they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49845:7"/>
ſhall be ſuffered to Worſhip God as formerly, will make many to
comply with them, or at leaſt make their Mouths give their Hearts
the Lye, in hopes of being by this means put into a condition to make
their eſcapes, and returning to that Profeſſion, which their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hath made them deny.</p>
            <p>But alas! this is not all, for thoſe poor Wretches, whom by theſe
Deviliſh ways of theirs, they have made to Blaſpheme and Abjure
their Religion, as if this were not enough, muſt now become the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
and Tormentors of their own Wives and Children, for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
and force them to Renounce alſo, for they are threatned, that
if within three days time they do not make their whole Family Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
in like manner, thoſe rough Apoſtles (the <hi>Dragoons)</hi> ſhall be
fain to take further pains with them in order to perfect their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.
And who after all this can have the leaſt doubt but that
theſe unhappy <hi>Dragoons</hi> are the very Emiſſaries of Hell, whoſe very
laſt Eſſorts and Death-ſtruglings theſe ſeem to be?</p>
            <p>This Relation hath given a ſhort view of ſome of thoſe Sufferings,
the Reformed have undergone, but not of all: It is certain that in
divers places they have tryed to wear out their Patience, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their Conſtancy by applying Red-hot Irons to the Hands and
Feet of Men, and to the Paps of Women. At <hi>Nantes</hi> they hung up
ſeveral Women and Maids by their Feet, and others by their Arm-pits,
and that Stark-Naked, thus expoſing them to Publick View,
which aſſuredly is the moſt cruel and exquiſite Suffering can befall
that Sex, becauſe in this caſe their Shamefacedneſs and Modeſty is
moſt ſenſibly touched, which is the moſt tender part of their Soul.
They have bound Mothers that gave Suck unto Poſts, and let their
little Infants lye Languiſhing in their ſight without being ſuffered
to Suckle them for ſeveral days, and all this while left them crying,
moaning, and gaſping for Life, and even Dying for Hunger and Thirſt,
that by this means they might Vanquiſh the Conſtancy of their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hearted Mothers, Swearing to them they would never permit
they ſhould give them Suck till they promiſed to Renounce their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Goſpel. They have taken Children of Four or Five
Years of Age, and kept them from Meat and Drink for ſome time,
and when they have been ready to faint away and give the Ghoſt,
they have brought them before their Parents, and horribly aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that except they would turn, they muſt prepare themſelves to
ſee their Children Languiſh and Dye in their preſence. Some they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49845:8"/>
have bound before a great Fire, and being half Roaſted, have after
let them go; they beat Men and Women outragiouſly, they drag
them along the Streets, and Torment them day and Night. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way they took was to give them no reſt, for the Souldiers do
continually Relieve one another for to Drag, Beat, Torment and Toſs
up and down theſe Miſerable Wretches without Intermiſſion. If it
happen that any by their Patience and Conſtancy do ſtand it out, and
Triumph over all the Rage and Fury of thoſe <hi>Dragoons,</hi> they go to
their Commander and acquaint him they have done all they could,
but yet without the deſired ſucceſs, who in a Barbarous and Surly
Tone, anſwers them; <hi>You muſt return upon them, and do worſe than you
have done, the King Commands it; either they muſt Turn, or I muſt
Burſt and Periſh in the Attempt.</hi> Theſe are the Pleaſant Flowery Paths
by which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> allure <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to return to the Boſome of
their Church.</p>
            <p>But ſome it may be will object, you make a great noiſe about
a ſmall matter, all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have not been expoſed to theſe Cruelties
but only ſome few obſtinate Perſons: Well, I will ſuppoſe ſo, but
yet the Horor of thoſe Torments Inflicted on ſome, hath ſo fill'd the
Imagination of theſe Miſerable Wretches, that the very thoughts of
them hath made them comply; it is indeed a Weakneſs of which we
are aſhamed for their ſakes, and from whence we hope God will
raiſe them again, in his due time; yet thus much we may alledge
for their excuſe, that never was any Perſecution upon pretence of
Religion carried on to that pitch, and with that Politick Malice and
Cruelty that this hath been, and therefore of all thoſe which ever
the Church of Chriſt groan'd under, none can be compar'd with it.
True indeed it is that in former Ages it hath been common to Burn
the Faithful under the Name of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but how few were there
expoſed to that cruel kind of Death, in compariſon of thoſe who
eſcaped the Executioners hands? but behold here a great People at
once oppreſs'd, deſtroy'd, and ruin'd by a vaſt Army of Prodigious
Butchers, and few or none eſcaping. Former, yea late times have
given us ſome Inſtances of Maſſacres, but theſe were only violent
Tempeſts, and ſuddain Hurricanes, which laſted but a Night, or at
the moſt a few days, and they who ſuffered in them were ſoon out of
their pains, and the far greater number eſcaped the dint of them:
but how much more dreadful is the preſent condition of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
in <hi>France?</hi> And to the end we may take a true view and right
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49845:8"/>
meaſures of it, let us conſider, that nothing can be conceived more
terrible than a ſtate of War, but what War to be compared with
this? They ſee a whole Army of Butcherly Canibals entring their
Houſes, Battering, Breaking, Burning and Deſtroying whatever comes
to hand, Swearing, Curſing, and Blaſpheming like Devils, beating to
exceſs, offering all manner of Indignities and Violence, diverting
themſelves, and ſtriving to outvie each other in Inventing New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Pain and Torment, not to be appeaſed with Money or good
chear, Foaming and Roaring like Ravenous Raging Lyons, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Death, at every Moment, and that which is worſe than all
this, driving People to Diſtraction, and ſet ſeleſs Stupidity by thoſe
Deviliſh Inventions, we have given you an Inſtance of in the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Montauban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, this Perſecution hath one Characteriſtical note more,
which, without any Exaggeration, will give it the Precedence in Hiſtory
for Cruelty, above all thoſe which the Church of God ever ſuffered
under <hi>Nero, Maximinus,</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> which is the ſevere Prohibition
of departing the Kingdom upon pain of Confiſcation of Goods, of
the Gally, of the Laſh, and perpetual Impriſonment. All the Sea
Ports are kept with that exactneſs, as if it were to hinder the eſcape
of Traytors and common Enemies; All the Priſons of Sea Port
Towns are cram'd with theſe miſerable Fugitives, Men, Women,
Boys and Girls, who there are Condemn'd to the worſt of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for having had a deſire to ſave themſelves, from this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Perſecution and deluging Calamity; this is the thing which is
unparallel'd, and of which we find no Inſtance. This is that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
exceſs of Cruelty, which we ſhall not find in the Liſt of all the
violent and Bloody Proceedings of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> he Maſſacred,
he Beheaded, he Butchered, but at leaſt he did not Prohibit thoſe
that could, to make their Eſcape. In the laſt <hi>Hungarian</hi> Perſecution,
nothing was required of the Proteſtants, but only that their Miniſters
ſhould Baniſh themſelves, and Abandon and Renounce the conduct
of their Flocks; and becauſe they were unwilling to obey theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
therefore it is they have groaned under ſo long, and ſo terrible a
Perſecution, as they have done; But this <hi>Hungarian</hi> Perſecution is not
to be compared with that we are Speaking of, for the Fury of that
Tempeſt diſcharged it ſelf upon the Miniſters only, no Armies were
Imploy'd to force the People to change their Religion, by a thouſand
ſeveral ways of Torment, much leſs did it ever enter the thoughts
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49845:9"/>
of the Emperours Council, to ſhut up all the Proteſtants in <hi>Hungary,</hi>
in order to the deſtroying of all thoſe who would not abjure their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which yet is the very condition of ſo many wretched Perſons
in <hi>France,</hi> who beg it as the higheſt favour at the hands of their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs
Enemies, to have leave to go and beg their Bread in a Forreign
Country, being willing to leave their Goods, and all other outward
conveniencies behind them, for to lead a poor Miſerable, Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Life in any place, where only they may be ſuffered to Dye in
their Religion. And is it not from all this moſt apparent, that thoſe
Monſters who have Inſpired the King with theſe deſigns, have reſin'd
the Myſtery of Perſecuting to the utmoſt, and advanc'd it to its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
pitch of perfection?</p>
            <p>O Great God! who from thy Heavenly Throne doſt behold all
the outrages done to thy People, haſt thee to help us! Great God,
whoſe compaſſions are Infinite, ſuffer thy ſelf to be touched with
our extream deſolution! If Men be Inſenſible of the calamities we
ſuffer, if they be deaf to our cries, not regarding our Groans and
Supplications, yet let thy Bowels, O Lord, be moved, and affect thee
in our behalf. Glorious God, for whoſe Names ſake we ſuffer all
theſe things, who knoweſt our Innocence and Weakneſs as well as
the Fury and Rage of our Adverſaries, the ſmall ſupport and help we
find in the World; behold we Periſh if thy pity doth not rouze thee
up for our Relief. It is thou art our Rock, our God, our Father, our
Deliverer, we do not place our confidence in any but thee alone; let
us not be confounded, becauſe we put our Truſt in thee. Haſt thee to

I can ſcarcely perſwade my ſelf it is ſo indeed, becauſe I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it. It is no matter of ſurpriſe or amazement to ſee the
Church of Chriſt afflicted upon Earth, foraſmuch as ſhe is a ſtranger
here, as well as her Captain, Lord and Husband, the Holy and Ever-bleſſed
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was, and muſt like him, by the ſame way of Croſs and
Suffering, return to her own Country, which is above. It is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Aſtoniſhment to find her from time to time ſuffering the worſt
of uſage, and moſt cruel Perſecutions; all Ages have ſeen her expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſuch Tryals as theſe, which are ſo neceſſary for the Teſting of
her Faith, and ſo fit a matter of her Future Glory. Neither is it any
great wonder, if, amidſt theſe ſore Tryals, vaſt numbers of thoſe who
made Profeſſion of the Goſpel, do now renounce and forſake it: We
know that all have not Faith, and it is more than probable that they
who do not follow Chriſt, but becauſe they Thrive by it, and for the
Loaves will ceaſe to be of his Retinue, when he is about to oblige
them to bear his Croſs, and deny themſelves. But that which ſeems
Inconceivable to me, is, that our Enemies ſhould pitch upon ſuch
ſtrange ways and methods to deſtroy us, as they have done, and that
in ſo doing, they ſhould meet with a ſucceſs ſo Prodigious and doleful.
I ſhall as briefly as I can endeavour to give you an account of ſo much
as I have underſtood of it.</p>
            <p>All thoſe thundring Declarations, and deſtructive Arreſts, which
continually were Sued for, and obtain'd againſt us, and which were
Executed with the extremity of Rigour, were ſcarce able to move
any one of us. The forbidding of our Publick Exerciſes, the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of our Churches, and the ſevere Injunction that not ſo much
as two or three of us ſhould dare to Aſſemble in order to any thing of
Divine Worſhip, had no other effect upon the far greater part of us,
than to Inflame our Zeal, inſtead of abating it, obliging us to Pray
to God with greater fervor and Devotion in our Cloſets, and to
Meditate of his Word with greater Application and Attention. And
neither the great wants, to which we were reduced by being depriv'd
of our Offices and Imploys, and all other means of Living, and by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49845:10"/>
thoſe inſupportable charges with which they ſtrove to over-whelm us,
as well by Taxes, as the Quartering of Souldiers (both which were as
heavy as could be laid upon us) nor the continual trouble we were
put to by Criminal or other matters of Law, which at the Suit of
one or other were ſtill laid to our charge, tho upon the moſt frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and unjuſt pretences imaginable; I ſay all theſe were not
able to wear out our Patience, which was hardned againſt all Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
inſomuch as the deſign of forcing us to abandon the Truth of
the Goſpel, would Infallibly have been Ship-wrack'd, if no other
means had been taken in hand for this purpoſe. But alas! our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were too Ingenious to be bauk'd ſo, and had taken our Ruine too,
much to Heart, not to Study for means effectual and proper to bring
about their deſires; They call'd to mind what Prodigious ſucceſs, a
new kind of Perſecution had had of late Years in <hi>Poictou, Aunix,</hi> and
<hi>Xaintonge,</hi> which the Intendants of thoſe places had bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of, and they made no difficulty to have Recourſe to the ſame,
as to a means Infallible, and not to be doubted of.</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> That we had not the leaſt thought that ever
ſuch violent Methods as theſe would have been pitched upon, as the
means of our Converſion: We were always of Opinion, that none
but <hi>Dennuieux</hi>'s and <hi>Marillacs</hi> could be fit Inſtruments for ſuch like
Enterpriſes; neither could we ever have Imagin'd that Generals of
Armies, who account it a Shame and Reproach to Attack and take
ſome paultry Town or Village, ſhould ever debaſe themſelves to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
Old Men, Women, and Children in their own Houſes; or that
ever Souldiers, who think themſelves ennobled by their Swords, ſhould
degrade themſelves ſo far to take up the Trade of Butchers and Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
by Tormenting poor Innocents, and Inflicting all ſorts of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
upon them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we were the leſs in expectation of any ſuch thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
at the ſelf ſame time they Treated us in this manner, they
would needs perſwade us, <hi>That the Kings Council had diſapproved the
Deſign:</hi> And indeed it ſeem'd very probable to us, that all Reaſons,
whether taken from Humanity, Piety, or Intereſt, would have made
them Diſavow and Condemn a Project ſo Inhumane and Barbarous:
Yet now by experience we find it but too true, that our Enemies are ſo
far from rejecting the ſaid Deſign, that they carry it on with an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
Zeal and Application, without giving themſelves any further
trouble to effectuate their deſires, than that of doing theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49845:10"/>
The firſt of which was to Lull us aſleep, and to take away from us
all matter of Suſpition of the miſchief they were hatching againſt us;
which they did by permiting ſome of our Publick Exerciſes of Religion,
by giving way to our Building of ſome Churches, by ſetling Miniſters
in divers places to Baptize our Children, and by publiſhing ſeveral
Arreſts and Declarations, which did intimate to us, that we had reaſon
to hope we ſhould yet Subſiſt for ſome Years: Such was that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
by which all Miniſters were ordered to change their Churches
every three years.</p>
            <p>The other was to ſecure all the Sea-Ports of the Kingdom, ſo as
none might make their eſcape, which was done by renewing the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Prohibitions of departing the Kingdom without leave, but with
the addition of far more ſevere Penalties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After theſe precautions thus taken, they thought themſelves no
longer oblig'd to keep any meaſures, but immediately lift up the
hand, to give the laſt blow for our Ruine. The Intendants had order
to repreſent to us,</hi> That the King was reſolved to ſuffer no other Religion
in his Kingdom beſides his own, and to Command us all in his Name, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to Embrace the ſame, without allowing us any longer reſpite to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what we had to do, than a few days, nay hours; <hi>threatning us,</hi>
That if we continued obſtinate, they would force us to it by the extremity
of Rigour, and preſently Executing theſe their Menaces, by filling our
Houſes with Souldiers, to whom we were to be left for a Prey, and who
not content with entirely Ruining of us, ſhould beſides exerciſe upon our
Perſons all the Violence and Cruelty they could poſſibly deviſe: <hi>And all
this to overcome our Conſtancy and Perſeverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Four Months are now paſt and gone, ſince that began to make uſe
of this ſtrange and horrible way of Converting People, worthy of,
and well becoming its Inventors. The Country of <hi>Bearn</hi> was firſt
ſet upon, as being one of the moſt conſiderable Out-parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to the end that this miſchievous enterpriſe gaining ſtrength in
its paſſage, might ſoon after over-whelm, and as it were deluge all
the other Provinces in the ſame Sea of the uttermoſt calamity. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Foucaut</hi> the Intendant, went himſelf in Perſon to all the places
where we were in any numbers, and commanded all the Inhabitants
that were of the Proteſtant Religion, under the Penalty of great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercements,
to Aſſemble themſelves in thoſe places he appointed to
them; where being accordingly met together, he charged them in
the Kings Name to change their Religion, allowing them only a day
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49845:11"/>
or two to diſpoſe themſelves for it; he told them, <hi>That great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Souldiers were at hand to compel thoſe that ſhould refuſe to yield
a ready Obedience;</hi> and this threatning of his being immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the Effect, as the Lightning is by Thunder, he fill'd the
Houſes of all thoſe who abode conſtant in their reſolution to Live and
Dye Faithful to their Lord and Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with Souldiers,
and Commands thoſe Inſolent Troops (fleſh'd with Blood and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
to give them the worſt Treatment they could poſſibly deviſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not undertake, <hi>Sir,</hi> to give you a particular account of
thoſe Exceſſes and Outrages theſe enraged Brutals committed in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
the Orders they were charged with; The Relation would
prove too tedious and doleful, it ſhall ſuffice me to tell you, that
they did not forget any thing that was Inhumane, Barbarous, or
Cruel, without having regard to any Condition, Sex or Age, they
pull'd down and demoliſhed their Houſes, they ſpoil'd, daſh'd to
pieces, and burnt their beſt Moveables and Houſhold-ſtuff, they
bruiſed and beat to Death Venerable Old Men, they dragg'd Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Matrons to Maſs, without the leaſt pitty or reſpect, they bound
and Fetter'd Innocent Perſons, as if they had been the moſt Infamous
and Profligate Villains, they hung them up by their Feet, till they
ſaw them ready to give up the Ghoſt, they took Red-hot Fire-ſhovels
and held them cloſe to their bare Heads, and actually apply'd them
to other parts of their Bodies, they Immur'd them within four Walls,
where they let them Periſh for Hunger and Thirſt; and the conſtancy
wherewith they ſuffer'd all theſe Torments, having had no other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
but that of augmenting the Rage of theſe Furies, they never
ceaſed Inventing new ways of pain and Torture, till their Inhumanity
at length had got the Victory, and Triumphed over the Patience and
Faith of theſe miſerable Wretches. Inſomuch that of all thoſe many
numerous Aſſemblies we had in that Province, as that of <hi>Pau, d'
Arthes, de Novarre, &amp;c.</hi> there are ſcarcely left a ſmall number who
either continue conſtant in deſpite of all theſe Cruelties, or elſe have
made their eſcape into <hi>Spain, Holland, England,</hi> or elſewhere, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Goods and Families for a Prey to theſe Mercileſs and Cruel
Men.</p>
            <p>Succeſs having thus far anſwered their expectation, they reſolved
to looſe no time, but vigorouſly Proſecuting their work, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
turned their Thoughts and Arms towards <hi>Montauban;</hi> where
the Intendant having Summoned the Citizens to appear before him,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49845:11"/>
beſpeaks them much in the ſame Language, as was uſed to thoſe of
<hi>Bearne,</hi> whereunto they having returned about the ſame Anſwer, he
orders 4000 Men to enter the City, and makes them take up their
Quarters, as at <hi>Bearne,</hi> only in the Houſes of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Command to Treat them in like manner, as they had done
thoſe of <hi>Bearne:</hi> and theſe Inhumane Wretches were ſo diligent and
active in Executing theſe pittileſs Orders, that of 12 or 15000 Souls
of which that Church did conſiſt, not above 20 or 30 Families are
eſcaped, who in a doleful and forlorn condition wander up and
down the Woods, and hide themſelves in Thickets. The Ruine of
this Important place drew after it the deſolation of all the Churches
about it, which were all Enveloped in the ſame common Calamity,
as thoſe of <hi>Realmont, Bourniquel, Negrepliſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet was not the condition of the Churches in the Upper <hi>Guienne</hi>
more Sad and Calamitous, than that of thoſe of the Lower <hi>Guienne,</hi>
and of <hi>Perigort,</hi> which this horrible deluge hath likewiſe overwhelm'd.
Mounſieur <hi>Bouſters</hi> and the Intendant having ſhared the Country
between them, Mounſieur <hi>de Bouſters</hi> taking for his part <hi>Agenois,
Tonnein, Clerac,</hi> with the adjoyning places; and the Intendant hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken upon him to reduce <hi>Fleis, Monravel, Genſſac, Cartillon,
Coutras, Libourne,</hi> &amp;c. The Troops which they Commanded, in the
mean time carrying Deſolation to all the places they paſſed through,
filling them with Mourning and Deſpair, and ſcattering Terror and
Amazement amongſt all thoſe to whom they approached.</p>
            <p>There were at the ſame time 17 Companies at Saint <hi>Foy,</hi> 15 at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac,</hi>
and as many in proportion in all other parts; So that all places
being fill'd with theſe Troops, accuſtom'd to Licentiouſneſs and
Pillage, there is not any one of the ſaid Places, where they have not
left moſt dreadful marks of their Rage and Cruelty, having at laſt,
by means of their Exquiſite Tortures, made all thoſe of our Religion
ſubmit themſelves to the Communion of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as <hi>Bergerac</hi> was moſt ſignally Famous for the long
Tryals it had moſt Gloriouſly endured, and that our Enemies were
very ſenſible of what advantage it would be to the carrying on of their
Deſign, to make themſelves Maſters there alſo, at any price what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
they accordingly failed not to attempt the ſame with more
Reſolution and Obſtinacy than any of the forementioned places.</p>
            <p>This little Town had already for three Years together, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Patience and Conſtancy, endured a Thouſand ill Treatments
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49845:12"/>
and Exactions from Souldiers, who had pick'd them to the very
Bones: for beſides that, it was almoſt a continual paſſage for Souldiers;
there were no leſs than 18 Troops of Horſe had their Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
there, who yet in all that time had only gain'd Three Converts,
and they ſuch too as were maintain'd by the Alms of the Church.</p>
            <p>But to return, The deſign being form'd to reduce this City, two
Troops of Horſe are immediately ordered thither to obſerve the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and ſoon after 32 Companies of Foot enter the Town, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Bouſters</hi> and the Intendant of the Province, with the Biſhops of
<hi>Agen</hi> and <hi>Perigueux,</hi> and ſame other Perſons of Quality, render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
there at the ſame time, and ſend for 200 of the chiefeſt Citizens
to appear before them, telling them, <hi>That the Kings Expreſs Will
and Pleaſure was, they ſhould all go to Maſs, and that in caſe of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
they had order to compel them to it:</hi> To which the Citizens
Unanimouſly anſwered, <hi>That their Eſtates were at the diſpoſe of his
Majeſty, but that God alone was Lord of their Conſciences, and that
they were reſolved to ſuffer to the utmoſt, rather than do any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the motions of it.</hi> Whereupon they were told, <hi>That if they
were ſo reſolved, they had nought elſe to do but to prepare themſelves to
receive the Puniſhment their Obſtinacy and Diſobedience did deſerve;</hi>
and immediately 32 Companies more of Infantry and Cavalry enter
the City (which, together with the 34 Companies beforementioned, were
all Quartered with <hi>Proteſtants)</hi> with Expreſs Command not to ſpare
any thing they had, and to exerciſe all manner of Violence upon the
Perſons of thoſe that entertain'd them, until they ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
a Promiſe from them, to do whatſoever was Commanded them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Orders then being thus Executed, according to the deſires
of thoſe who had given them, and theſe miſerable Victims of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Military Fury, being reduc'd to the moſt deplorable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
condition; they are again ſent for to the Town-houſe, and once
more preſſed to change their Religion, and they anſwering with Tears
in their Eyes, and with all the Reſpect, Humility, and Submiſſion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
<hi>That the matter required of them, was the only thing they could
not do,</hi> the extreameſt Rigour and Severity is denounc'd againſt them;
and they preſently made good their Words, by ſending 34 more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
into the City, which made up the full number of a hundred,
who encouraging themſelves from their numbers, and flying like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Wolves upon theſe Innocent Sheep, did rend and worry them
in ſuch a manner, as the ſole Relation cannot but ſtrike with Horror
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49845:12"/>
and Amazement. Whole Companies were ordered to Quarter with
one Citizen, and Perſons whoſe whole Eſtate did not amount to
10000 Livres, were taxed at the rate of 150 Livres a day: when
their Money is gone, they Sell their Houſhold-ſtuff, and ſell that for
two pence, which hath coſt 60 Livres, they bind and fetter Father,
Mother, Wife and Children: Four Souldiers continually ſtand at the
door to hinder any from coming in to ſuccour or comfort them:
they keep them in this condition, two, three, four, five, and ſix days,
without either Meat, Drink, or Sleep; on one hand the Child cries
with the Languiſhing accent of one ready to Dye, <hi>Ah my Father!
Ah my Mother! What ſhall I do? I muſt Dye, I can endure no longer:</hi>
The Wife on the other hand cries; <hi>Alaſs! my Heart fails me, I Faint,
I Dye;</hi> Whilſt their cruel Tormentors are ſo far from being touch'd
with Compaſſion, that from thence they take occaſion to preſs them
afreſh, and to renew their Torments, frighting them with their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Menaces, accompanied with moſt execrable Oaths and Curſes;
crying, <hi>Dog, Bougre, What, wilt not thou be Converted? Wilt not thou
be Obedient? Dog, Bougre, Thou muſt be Converted, we are ſent on
purpoſe to Convert thee:</hi> and the Clergy who are witneſſes of all theſe
Cruelties, (with which they feaſt their Eyes) and of all their Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and abominable words, (which ought to cover them with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Confuſion) make only a matter of Sport and Laughter of it.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe miſerable Wretches, being neither ſuffered to Live nor
to Dye, (for when they ſee them ſainting away, they force them to
take ſo much as to keep Body and Soul together) and ſeeing no other
way for them to be delivered out of this Hell, in which they are
continually Tormented, are fain at laſt to ſtoop under the unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
Burthen of theſe extremities: So that excepting only a few
who ſaved themſelves by a timely Flight, preferring their Religion
before all Temporal Poſſeſſions, all the reſt have been conſtrained to
go to Maſs.</p>
            <p>Neither is the Country any more exempt from theſe Calamities,
than Towns and Cities, nor thoſe of the Nobility and Gentry, than
Citizens. They ſend whole Companies of Souldiers into Gentlemens
Houſes, who Treat them in the moſt outragious and violent manner
conceivable, inſomuch that not a Soul can hope to eſcape, except it
may be ſome few, who like the Believers of old, wander in Deſarts,
and lodge in Dens and Caves of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49845:13"/>
Furthermore I can aſſure you, that never was any greater conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
than that which we are in here at preſent, the Army, we hear,
is come very near us, and the Intendant is juſt now Arrived in this
City; the greater part of the moſt conſiderable Merchants are either
already gone, or caſting about how beſt to make their eſcape, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
their Houſes and Eſtates to their Enemies; and there are not
wanting ſome Cowardly Spirits, who, to avoid the miſchief they are
preparing for us, have already promiſed to do whatſoever is required
of them. In a word, nothing is ſeen or heard in theſe parts but
Conſternation, Weeping and Lamentation, there being ſearce a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of our Religion, who hath not his Heart pierced with the bittereſt
Sorrows, and whoſe Countenance hath not the Lively Picture of
Death Imprinted on it: and ſurely, if our Enemies Triumph in all this,
their Triumph cannot likely be of any long continuance.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I cannot perſwade my ſelf to entertain ſo good an opinion
of them, as to think that ever they will be aſhamed of theſe their
doings, ſo Diametrically oppoſite to the Spirit of the Goſpel, for I
know the Goſpel in their accounts paſſeth for a Fable: but this I dare
averr, that this Method of theirs will infallibly lay waſte the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which, according to all appearance, is never like to recover
of it, and ſo in time, they themſelves will be made as ſenſible of
theſe miſeries, as others now are. Commerce is already in a manner
wholly extinct, and there will need little leſs than a Miracle to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it to its former State. What Proteſtant Merchants will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
be willing to engage themſelves in Trade, either with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
without Faith, and who have ſo cowardly behav'd their Religion
and Conſcience, or with the Outrageous and Barbarous Perſecuters
of the Religion which they profeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who by theſe courſes declare
openly and frankly, that it is their Principle, not to think themſelves
oblig'd to keep their word with Hereticks? And who are thoſe, of
what Religion ſoever, that will Negotiate with a State exhauſted by
Taxes and Subſidies, by Perſecutions, by Barrenneſs and Dearth of
ſeveral years continuance; full of a deſpairing people, and which
infallibly will ere long be full of thoſe that are proſcrib'd, and be
bathing in its own Blood.</p>
            <p>And theſe miſerable Wretches who have been deceived, by thoſe
who have told them, that it would never be impos'd upon them to
abjure their Religion, and who are ſtupified by the extremity of their
Sufferings, and the terror of their bloody and cruel Enemies, are wrapt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49845:13"/>
up in ſo deep an aſtoniſhment, as doth not permit them to be fully
ſenſible of their Fall: but as ſoon as they ſhall recover themſelves,
and remember that they could not embrace the Communion of <hi>Rome,</hi>
without abſolutely renouncing the holy Religion they profeſſed, and
when they ſhall make a full reflection upon the unhappy change they
have been forced to make, then their Conſciences being awakened, and
continually reproaching their faint-heartedneſs, will rend them with
ſorrow and remorſe, and inflict torments upon them, equal to thoſe
the Damned endure in Hell, and will make them endeavour to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from this Anguiſh, and to find reſt in the conſtant profeſſion of
that Truth, which they have ſo unhappily betray'd.</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide, their Enemies will be loath to take the
Lye at this time of day, and therefore will endeavour through
fear of Puniſhments, to oblige them to ſtay in that Abyſs of horror,
into which they have precipitated them: but becauſe all the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
they can poſſibly threaten them with, will be no ways conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
when compared with thoſe Tortures their Conſciences have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Inflicted upon them, and wherewith they threaten them
in caſe of a Relapſe, they will be conſtrained to drag them to the
place of Execution, or elſe ſeek to rid themſelves of them all at
once by a general Maſſacre, which many good Souls have ſo long
deſired.</p>
            <p>I hope, <hi>Sir,</hi> You will not be wanting in your moſt Earneſt Prayers
to beg of God that he would be pleaſed to take pity of theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Wretches, and make the Heart of our Soveraign to Relent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us; that he would Convert thoſe who in their Blindneſs think
they do him Service by putting us to Death, that he would cauſe
his Voice to be heard by them from Heaven, as to St. <hi>Paul; Saul,
Saul, Why Perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> and make the reſt the Examples of his
Exemplary Juſtice; finally, that he would grant, that all thoſe who
have denied him, being touched with a true Repentance, may with
St. <hi>Peter Go out, and Weep Bitterly.</hi> I am,</p>

ſtript her Stark-Naked, in this manner led her throngh the Streets
of the City, where many a blow was given her, and Stones flung at
her. After this, they ſet her up to the Neck in a Tub full of Water,
where after ſhe had been for a while, they took her out, and put
upon her a ſhift dipt in Wine, which as it dry'd, and ſtuck to her

times; and when by this Inhumane uſage her Body was become
very Raw and Tender, they demanded of her, <hi>Whether ſhe did not
now find her ſelf diſpoſed to Embrace the Catholick Faith?</hi> for ſo they
are pleaſed to term their Religion: but ſhe being ſtrengthned by the
Spirit and Love of him, for whoſe Names ſake ſhe ſuffered all theſe
Extremities, undauntedly anſwered, <hi>That ſhe had before declared her
Reſolution to them, which ſhe would never alter; and that though they
had her Body in their Power, ſhe was reſolved not to yield her Soul to
them, but keep it pure and undefiled for her Heavenly Lover, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that a little while would put an end to all her Sufferings, and give a

beginning to her Enjoyment of Everlaſting Bliſs:</hi> Which words of hers,
adding Fuel to their Rage, who now deſpaired of making her a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
they took and faſtned her by her Feet, to ſomething that ſerved
the turn of a Gibbet, and there let her Hang in that Ignominious
poſture with her Head downwards, till ſhe expired.</p>
            <p>The other Perſon I would Inſtance in, and whom I pity the more,
becauſe (for ought I know) he may yet Survive, and ſtil continue
under the Tormentors hands, in an Old Man, who having for a great
while been kept cloſe Priſoner (upon the ſame account as the former)
in a deep Dungeon, where his Companions were Darkneſs and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and filthy creeping things, was brought before his Judges with
Vermine and Snails crewling upon his Mouldred Garment, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in that Loathſome condition, ſaid to him, <hi>How now Old
Man, does not your Heart begin to Relent? and are not you willing
to Abjure your Haereſie?</hi> To which he anſwered; <hi>As for Haereſie,
I profeſs none; but if by that Word you mean my Religion, you may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your ſelves, that as I have thus long Lived, ſo I hope, and am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by the Grace of God to Dye in it:</hi> With which anſwer they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little pleaſed, but furiouſly Incenſed, beſpoke him in a rougher
Tone: <hi>Doſt thou not ſee that the Worms are about to Devour thee?
Well, ſince thou art ſo reſolved, we will ſend thee back again, to the
Loathſome place from whence thou cameſt, that they may make an end
of thee, and conſume thy Obdurate Heart;</hi> to which he reply'd, with
the words of the Holy Patient <hi>Job; Novi poſt quam vermes confoderint
(Corpus) iſtud, in carne me a me viſurum eſſe Deum. I know that after
Worms have Eaten this Body, that in my Fleſh I ſhall ſee God;</hi> and
having ſo ſaid, he was ſent back to his Loathſome dark abode,
where if he be ſtill, I pray God to give him Patience and ſtrength to
hold out to the end, that ſo he may obtain the Crown of Life.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be too tedious in giving you all the particulars of their
Cruelty, and of the Sufferings of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> yet I cannot well
forbear acquainting you with what lately I am moſt credibly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
off, which take as follows; Some <hi>Dragoons</hi> who were Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with a Perſon, whom they could by no means oblige to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his Religion, upon a time when they had well fill'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Wine, and broke their Glaſſes at every Health they drank,
and ſo fill'd the Floor where they were with the Fragments, and by
often walking over, and treading upon them, reduced them to leſſer
picees and Fractions, and being now in a Merry humour, they muſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49845:15"/>
needs go to Dance, and told their Hoſt that he muſt be one of the
Company, but withal, that he muſt firſt pull off his Stockings and
Shoes, that he might moove the more nimbly; in a word, they forc'd
him to Dance with them bare-footed upon the ſharp points of Glaſs,
which when they had continued ſo long as they were able to keep
him on his Legs, they laid him down on a Bed, and a while after ſtript
him Stark-Naked, and roled his Body from one end of the Room to
the other upon the ſharp Glaſs, as before-mentioned, which having
done, till his Skin was ſtuck full of the ſaid little Fragments, they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turned
him again to his Bed, and ſent for a Chirurgeon, to take out
all the ſaid pieces of Glaſs out of his Body, which you may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
could not be done without frequent Inciſions, and horrible and
moſt extream pain. Another Perſon being likewiſe troubled with the
unwelcome Company of theſe <hi>Dragoons,</hi> and having ſuffered extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at their hands, without the expected ſucceſs of his Converſion, one
of them on a time looking earneſtly upon him, told him, <hi>That he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
himſelf with letting his Beard grow ſo long;</hi> but he anſwering,
<hi>That they were the cauſe of it, who would not let him ſtir out of door, for
to go to the Barber;</hi> the Dragoon reply'd, <hi>I can do that for you as
well as the Barber,</hi> and with that told him, <hi>he muſt needs try his Skill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him,</hi> and ſo fell to work, but inſtead of ſhaving him, flea'd all the
Skin off his Face: one of his Companions coming in at the cry of this
poor Sufferer, and ſeeing what he had done, ſeemingly blam'd him
for it, and ſaid, <hi>He was a Bunglar,</hi> and then to his Hoſt, <hi>Come your
Hair wants Cutting too, and you ſhall ſee I will do it much better than
he hath ſhav'd you:</hi> and thereupon begins in a moſt Cruel manner, to
pluck the Hair, Skin and all, off his Head, and flea'd that as the other
had done his Chin. Thus making a Sport and Merriment of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Suffering of theſe miſerable Wretches.</p>
            <p>By theſe Inhumane, and more than Barbarous means, it is that they
endeavour to overcome the moſt reſolved Patience, and to drive Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to deſpair and Faint-heartedneſs, by their more then Deviliſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.
They refuſe to give them Death, which they deſire, and
only keep them alive to Torment them, ſo long till they have Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd
their Perſeverance, for the Names of Martyrs and Rebels are
equally odious to their Enemies, who tell them, <hi>That the King will
have Obedient Subjects, but neither Martyrs nor Rebels, and that they have
received Orders to Convert them, but not to Kill them.</hi>

            <p>BEcauſe in the Edict of the <hi>French</hi> King, the perpetual and
irrevocable Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> is recall'd and aboliſhed, I thought
fit (becauſe the whole Edict would be too long to be inſerted
here) to give you ſome paſſages of the Prefatory part of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may appear what ſtreſs was laid on it by <hi>Henry</hi> the IV.
(called the Great) Grandfather to the preſent <hi>French</hi> King, and
how much he judged the exact maintaining of it would conduce
to the Settlement, Peace, and Proſperity of his Kingdom.</p>

               <q>—Now it hath pleaſed God to give us a beginning of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome Reſt, we think we cannot employ our ſelves better,
than to apply to that which may tend to the Service and Glory
of his holy Name, and to provide that he may be Adored and
Prayed to by all our Subjects; and if it hath not yet pleaſed
him to permit it to be in one and the ſame Form of Religion,
that it may at the leaſt be with one and the ſame Intention,
and with ſuch Rules, that may prevent amongſt them all Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Tumults; and that we and this Kingdom may always
conſerve the glorious Title of <hi>Moſt Chriſtian,</hi> and by the
ſame means take away the Cauſe of Miſchief and Trouble,
which may happen from the actions of Religion, which of all
others are moſt prevalent and penetrating. For this cauſe,
acknowledging this affair to be of the greateſt Importance,
and worthy of the beſt conſideration, after having conſidered
the Papers of Complaints of our Catholick Subjects, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo permitted to our Subjects of the Reformed Religion,
to aſſemble themſelves by Deputies for framing their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and making a Collection of all their Remonſtrances,
and having thereupon conferred divers times with them, we
have upon the whole judged it neceſſary, to give to all our ſaid
Subjects one General Law, clear, plain, and abſolute, by
which they ſhall be regulated in all differences, which have
heretofore riſen among them, on which may riſe hereafter,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49845:21"/>
wherewith the one and the other may be contented, having
had no other regard in this deliberation, than ſolely the Zeal
we have to the Service of God, praying that he would hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
grant to all our Subjects a Durable and Eſtabliſhed
Peace: And we implore and expect from his Divine Bounty
the ſame Protection and Favour he hath always beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Kingdom from our Birth, and that he would give our
ſaid Subjects the Grace to underſtand, that in obſervation of
this our Ordinance, conſiſteth (next to their Duty towards
God and us) the principal Foundation of their Union, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
Tranquility, Reſt, and the Re-eſtabliſhment of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
in its firſt Splendor, Opulency and Strength, as on our

any contravention. And for theſe cauſes, having with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Princes of our Blood, other Princes and Officers of
our Crown, and other great and eminent Perſons of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
