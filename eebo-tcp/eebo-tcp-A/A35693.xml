         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

uſe in the ſum of 50<hi>l.</hi> as will appear by
Record in the <hi>Guild</hi> Book, <hi>September,</hi> 1649.
and this neceſſitates <hi>Robert Dentons</hi> humble
Requeſt of a lawful favor of the Major, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs
and Burgeſſes of the Corporation of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
aforeſaid, as followeth;</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Pelham Carew</hi> (deceaſed) in his life time
became debtor in a Bond of 150<hi>l.</hi> real debt
to <hi>Robert Denton,</hi> but taken in the name of the
Major, Bayliffs and Burgeſſes of <hi>Berwick</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
becauſe ſome part thereof by the
ſaid <hi>Robert Denton,</hi> was deſigned towards the
building of the aforeſaid Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65593:8"/>
His Relict the Lady <hi>Mary Carew,</hi> now wife
to Mr. <hi>George Palour</hi> living in the Tower of
<hi>London,</hi> is lyable to this debt, and able to pay
it, having an eſtate of her late husbands worth
90<hi>l. per annum,</hi> in <hi>Horſham</hi> in the County of
<hi>Suſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Bond is for the preſent in the hands of
the Widow <hi>Daviſon,</hi> delivered by <hi>Robert
Denton</hi> as a pledge or Engagement for his
faithful performance of his promiſes and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Miſtreſs <hi>Daviſon</hi> denies to deliver the Bond
without a ſpecial Proxy from the <hi>Guild,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
made in their name.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſaid <hi>Robert Denton</hi> humbly
deſires that the <hi>Guild</hi> would by a Proxy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Bond out of the ſaid Miſtreſs <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſons</hi>
Cuſtody, and that the Honorable the
Governor, the Worſhipful the Major, Bayliffs
and Burgeſſes, would be pleaſed to write effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
and prevalently to the Lady <hi>Mary
Carew,</hi> without further delay or trouble to pay
the foreſaid 150<hi>l.</hi> having been now due about
Ten years, by which payment he ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,
not onely to pay the 50<hi>l.</hi> which he
owes to the Town, but alſo to perform the
free Deſign of his heart as a contribution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this ſo religious a work; beſides, it will
help towards the payment of Mr. <hi>Yong</hi> (the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65593:8"/>
Maſon in this work) to whom the ſaid <hi>Robert
Denton</hi> is indebted in 100<hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the Lady <hi>Mary Carew,</hi> report
(and her own converſation juſtifying that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
ſpeaks her to the world as the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
moſt pious, and withal exactly juſt in
her dealings: Therefore, it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that ſhe will ſo derogate from her native
worth and nobleneſs, as to deny the payment
of that debt, which her conſcience cannot but
dictate unto her is moſt juſtly due and payable
by her, in relation to the Noble Knight her
Husband deceaſed; but eſpecially, ſeeing it
will advance ſo religious a work, and that in
her Native Town, when ſhe ſhall hear the
work is begun.</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>To all,</salute>
I take not upon me to adviſe, much leſs to
preſcribe to ſuch Honorable and Worthy perſons,
in ſo great and high imployments: Theſe
are onely humble Repreſentations of that ſervice
which is due to them, and deſires, which are with
humility requeſted of them, by
<signed>Their faithful Servant,
Robert Denton.</signed>
