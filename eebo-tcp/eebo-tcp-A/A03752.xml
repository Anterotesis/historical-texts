            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T fortun'd not long since, that <hi>Trees</hi> did speake, and locally move, and meet one another; Their ayrie whistlings, and soft hollowe whispers became Articulate sounds, mutually intelligible, as if to the soule of <hi>vegetation,</hi> the sensitive faculties and powers of the intellect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, had been co-infus'd into them: They traveld to strange Countries, crossd Seas, made peace and warre, alliances and leagues, assumed names and Characters of distinction, and discharged all the functions of Rationall creatures.</p>
            <p>In the sacred Oracles wee read of one that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19794:5"/>
discernd <hi>men</hi> to walke like <hi>Trees,</hi> but here cleane contrary, you shall see <hi>Trees</hi> walke like <hi>men.</hi> We read also there of a mighty <hi>Monarck,</hi> that was meant by a <hi>Tree</hi>; And it is no new Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of man, that, <hi>He is a Tree revers'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great <hi>Sicilian Antiquary</hi> leaveth upon record, that in the nonage of the world, mens voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were indistinct and confus'd; And sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning chiefly in <hi>VVoods,</hi> by a kind of assimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and frequent impressions in the eare, they resembled those soft susurrations of the <hi>Trees</hi> wherewith they conversd; untill <hi>Time,</hi> (which <hi>ripeneth</hi>) and <hi>Art</hi> which <hi>perfecteth</hi> all things, &amp; hath a greater interest in speech then <hi>Nature</hi> her selfe, did distinguish these mishapen sounds into syllables, and so by degrees into language.</p>
            <p>At that time, when this <hi>parley of Trees</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, I my selfe was but a little, little <hi>Plant</hi> newly <hi>sprung</hi> up above ground; And passing through the terrible <hi>Birch</hi> to <hi>Boetia,</hi> where I tooke in my best <hi>Sap,</hi> and came by <hi>degrees</hi> to a consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>growth</hi> (which was not very high, in so much that some thinke I was <hi>set</hi> in the wane of the Moone) I was <hi>transplanted</hi> from <hi>Boetia</hi> to <hi>Tamisond,</hi> And thence as my Genius strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led me, <hi>I often</hi> crossed the Seas, and <hi>rangd</hi> up and down through most of the <hi>Forrests</hi> of the <hi>lower</hi> world; And as I passed along, I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19794:5"/>
the motions, and studied the properties of sundry sorts of <hi>Trees,</hi> as well forren, as <hi>home sprung,</hi> and of them I intend to relate some passages; In the narration whereof I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to goe between the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>Tree,</hi> as neere as possibly I can with safety, to sift out, and set down the truth of things, for <hi>the prime vertue of story is verity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I hope to obtaine a candid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of this <hi>rough hewen, ill timberd</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and that the Reader will be pleased as he shall passe along through these <hi>woods,</hi> to affoord mee somtimes his second thoughts, and observe also the constant veine of impartiality, which runnes through the whole worke, which he shall find to be such, that it will infranchise his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment everywhere: And such, I know will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with my errors and slips, for it is very hard but one passing through so many <hi>Forrests</hi> as I intend, may meet with some <hi>stumbling blocks</hi> in his way.</p>

               <p>There is no Region on Earth so daintily watered, with such great navigable Rivers, whereof some are

said to bee <hi>pav'd</hi> with Troutes, <hi>borderd</hi> with crevices, and <hi>imbroderd</hi> with Swannes; And upon these multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of brave Cities stand, and all her great ones stand so; but amongst them the midland townes are most flourishing and abounding in wealth, which shewes that her riches are interne and domesticke; For as it is the marke of a good housewife to be more <hi>Vendax,</hi> then <hi>Emax,</hi> rather a seller then Buyer, so is it of a good Countrey; And such a one is <hi>Ampelona,</hi> which sends forth far more, then she fetcheth in. The War-like <hi>Vine</hi> swayeth here in the most absolute forme of suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that may bee, for Hee not onely makes Peace and Warre, summons and dissolves generall meetings, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth, naturallizeth, ennobleth, stamps, and layeth value upon coynes, but also enacts lawes, executes ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and layeth impositions at pleasure; and He may thanke <hi>Druina</hi> for this boundlesse power, for when she by the strength of her <hi>horned Yew</hi> had feld downe a great number of the <hi>strongest Trees</hi> that were in <hi>Ampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi> and made such firme invasions into her very bowels, that there could be no universall assembly, the necessity of the times cast the power of the three estates upon the <hi>Vine</hi> himselfe, that his mandats should stand for lawes, whereby he layd what taxes, and made what leavies he pleased; His successors made vertue of this necessity, which though temporary at first, continueth ever since; For soveraignty where she gets an inch, stickes not sometimes to stretch it to an ell. But that which made it more passable was, that the burden lighted chiefely upon the poore <hi>coppices</hi> and <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods;</hi> so that ever since, the <hi>Vine</hi> himselfe with the <hi>taller</hi> sorts of <hi>Trees,</hi> specially the <hi>holy Yews</hi> (who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse more than all the rest, and are thought by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to have the third part of the <hi>Forrest,) sucke</hi> all the <hi>sappe,</hi> and leave the poore <hi>shrubs</hi> to dry up, fade

away, and wither; and when they have got any moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, they serve but as spunges for others: Out of which disproportion ariseth this inconvenience, that they become pusillanimous, and almost uselesse for military services, being so often <hi>peeld,</hi> that they never come to be <hi>perfect and firme timber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alwaies a mixd government twixt Peace and Warre, which finds perpetuall employment for many of her stirring spirits, having the advantage thereby to bee furnished upon all occasions with experienc'd martiall instruments; for <hi>Ampelona</hi> having open fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires contiguous every where with some <hi>Alien,</hi> She can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not joyne Peace and security together, nor fetch a sound sleepe, but <hi>Hercules</hi>-like with <hi>clubbe</hi> in hand. She is the greatest one knot of strength in the Western world, and for the situation fittest to disjoyne or unite her neighbours forces, and consequently to be Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratrix and compoundresse of any quarrell that may intervene: And never, since she woare the Imperiall diademe, was <hi>Ampelona</hi> so potent, nor then, so well knit and compacted as now she is; so that it is held a maxime, <hi>If Ampelona combat not her selfe, she is invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible;</hi> And this shee hath too often done, turning the sword of civill broyles into her own bowels, so farre that the bell hath often told, but never yet rung quite out for her liberty, which was thought not long since to be upon point of expiring; and no wonder, shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds so with <hi>quicke sets and wildings,</hi> and a world of boyling volatil spirits, impatient of peace any longer then they are recovering the ruines of warre; present danger magnanimats them, and inflames their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but expectation makes it languish; so that the <hi>Forrest of the South</hi> (which is ever emulous of <hi>Ampelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) compareth their valour to a squib, or fier of flaxe, which burnes and crackles for the time, but suddenly

extinguisheth; Indeed fury when the first blast is spent turnes commonly to feare, and they that are possessed therewith may be said to be <hi>like the moneth of March, which entreth like a Lion, but goeth out like a Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ampelona</hi> is one of the chiefest climes of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and courtship under heaven, which puts so large a distance twixt the tongue and the heart, that they are seldome relatists. Most of her <hi>Plants</hi> have the Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropian quality of the <hi>Marigold</hi> and <hi>Tulip,</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the motion of the Sunne opening and shutting with him; The <hi>fancy</hi> predominates more than the <hi>judgement,</hi> but they in whom both these concurre are admirable, as there is amongst them at present a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>example,</hi> which serves for a mighty <hi>proppe</hi> to the <hi>Vine,</hi> and 'tis well knowne no <hi>Tree</hi> needs <hi>props</hi> more. For friendship, love commonly flames there, before it burnes, and so cannot be long lasting, for though first affection maketh deepest impression, yet that love is held most permanent, which dives into the soule by soft degrees of mutuall society, and is matur'd by time; very acute they are, and cautelous in treating, &amp; therin have prov'd (more than once) too hard, for plain down right dealing <hi>Druina;</hi> finally some say, one shall best discerne an <hi>Ampelonian,</hi> and most to his advantage, if one looke upon him, as we use to doe upon scarlet (his prime colour) the dye whereof is better discernd by quicke glances, and a passing eye, then by a fixd.</p>
               <p>I write not this to derogat from noble <hi>Ampelona,</hi> for I honour her in a most high degree, having practically found her better sort of <hi>Trees</hi> though allowed their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, (and that they participate somewhat with the <hi>Corke,</hi> and are subject to be <hi>shaken with incertaine winds</hi>) to be the most generous, daring and ventrous spirits, and fullest of resolution and mettall for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and honour, of any upon the surface of the earth,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19794:9"/>
and what was said before must be understood, as the Philosophers use to restraine many propositions in their Schooles, <hi>Non de singulis generum, sed de generibus singulorum</hi>: No where are there more quicke inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and penetrating capacities, fraught with all kind of scientifiall knowledge; Not any are more generally imitated for fashion, comportment and garb, which many of her neighbours doe follow to a forc'd kind of affectation, thinking they are not refin'd till then; not any have more of the Cavalier then they, the Levant parts ring more of them, and their martiall atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then of any other Nation.</p>
               <p>But I have sojourn'd too long in <hi>Ampelona,</hi> I will now crosse the Hils to <hi>Elaiana,</hi> whence if a meridian wind bloweth, I am sure to know when I am neere her, by those sweet fragrant odours she casts from her very <hi>shrubbes,</hi> for the bruite animals there make themselves beds of Rose-mary and Thyme.</p>
               <p>But strange it is, and indeed very strange to me, that there being but a hill, yea a small bridge of partition twixt <hi>Ampelona,</hi> and <hi>Elaiana,</hi> there should bee such an antipatheticall and quite differing genius in their <hi>plants;</hi> I know, Nature delights, and triumphs in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitudes, but here she seemes to have industriously studied it: The nature of the one is debonnaire and aco'stable; of the other retird and supercilious: The one quicke and spritefull; The other slow and satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine; The one <hi>bushy</hi> and <hi>tufted</hi> on the top; The other <hi>lop'd short</hi>: The one delights in a <hi>close thicke rind</hi>; The other goes thin and <hi>scarified</hi>; The one gay underneath, the other without, which makes some of them to bee compared to the <hi>Cinnamon</hi> Tree, whose <hi>Rind</hi> is more worth than the body; The one takes the ball before the bound; The other stayeth for it, and commonly fetcheth a surer stroake; The one in the cariage of his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19794:10"/>
designes is like the <hi>Wind,</hi> the other like the <hi>Sunne</hi> in the fable, when they went to try their strength upon a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers cloake The one knowes how to shuffle the Cards better; the other playeth his game more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly; The one disgests all he swallowes; The other is subject to cast it up againe; The one contracts and enchaines his words speaking pressingly and short; The other delights in long breathd accents, which he prolates with such pauses, that before he be at a period of his sentence, one may reach a second thought.</p>
               <p>In fine <hi>Saturne</hi> swayeth o're the one, and <hi>Mercury</hi> o're the other, with whom the <hi>Moone</hi> also hath a great stroake, so that some thinke the <hi>bush</hi> which the man in the Moone carrieth on his backe, did <hi>grow</hi> first in <hi>Ampelona,</hi> and that the <hi>wheele</hi> of fortune was made of a peece of her <hi>timber</hi>; Out of these various premisses you may inferre that there is a <hi>politicall, morall</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> opposition and difference twixt these so neere neighbours; both in their comportment, garb, fancy and humour, so farre, that one may say, what the one <hi>is not,</hi> the other <hi>is</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> insomuch that if you would fetch one from the remotest parts the Sunne displayes his beames upon, yea from the very Antipodes; he will agree with either, better then they one with another; yet they both symbolize in this, that they love to look upon themselves through multiplying glasses, and the bigger end of the prospectife.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND now I am come from Gods blessing to the warme Sun, who is a little too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of his beames here, which makes the soyle lesse fruitfull, and to be a kind of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse in comparison of <hi>Ampelona,</hi> being like a Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards skinne, here a spot, and there a spot inhabited; she swels so every where with huge hils; And some would make a question whether the <hi>minds</hi> of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants or her <hi>mountaines</hi> be highest; the tops whereof by reason of the tenuity and clearenesse of aire, (for sometimes you shall not see in the whole hemisphere from morning to night as much cloud as would line a Monmoth Cappe) you may discerne above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles off, and some of them periwigd with snowes all the yeare long, And on some, one shall find more difference in point of temper of ayre, twixt bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome and top, then twixt Sommer and Winter in other places; But where <hi>Elaiana</hi> hath valleys, there she is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously fertile, <hi>such blessings humility carieth alwaies with her;</hi> Her rivers having for the most part high bankes, and shallow bottomes, serve not for Navigation, but are wheeld up into small Cataracts, and so divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sluces, to humectat the bordering soyle, and make it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19794:11"/>
wonderfully productive: A cheap Country to travell in, for one will hardly find <hi>meat</hi> for money, (but <hi>sawce</hi> good store) the conveyance of provision being so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, yet this scarcity carieth with it a notable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for Military uses, wherewith nature seemes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence her, for her <hi>Plants</hi> are the <hi>tougher</hi> thereby, and can endure more then they that <hi>sprout</hi> forth of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton soft soyles; Moreover her abruptnesse, barrenes and heat, carry with them another mighty benefit, for she cannot be so easily overrunne by forren force, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that besides the difficulty of passage, an army would either starve for want, or miscarry, for the unusuall heat of the clime, which I beleeve was the reason, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles could hardly fly over her in <hi>nine score</hi> yeares, whereas they flew through and through <hi>Ampelona</hi> in lesse then <hi>nine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>quality</hi> every thing she beares is passing good, only she failes in the <hi>quantity,</hi> And did she abound in <hi>plenty,</hi> as she excels in <hi>perfection</hi> of all things (by reason of the full concoction the Sunne makes) specially had she Corne proportionable to her greatnesse, she would prove terrible to all her neighbours.</p>
               <p>The mighty Olive who now swayeth, thrives well, and <hi>fructifieth</hi> by <hi>ingrafting</hi> upon the lovely <hi>Ampelonian Vine.</hi> Hee keepes his Court neere the very centre of <hi>Elaiana,</hi> like the Sunne in the Heavens, which being in the midst, equally communicats his beames to all. And a spacious kingdome is like a great Indian hide, plant your foot on one side or corner, the other will bound up against you, tread on the middle, all parts will lye flat; so some hold it a maxime in policy, for the Prince to reside in the very navill of his kingdome, to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all insurrections with the more celerity, that may arise in any other part.

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:19794:11"/>
and breaking out into this criticall discourse of <hi>Elaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> That the time was when <hi>Elaiana</hi> did containe and content her selfe within the circumference of her own boundaries, without any further encroachments, but of late yeares she hath <hi>shot</hi> up, and <hi>spread</hi> her <hi>branches</hi> farre and neare into all parts of the habitable earth, whereby shee is <hi>growne</hi> up to so monstrous and giant-like a proportion, that she is become formidable to all her neighbours, in such sort, as she puts every one to stand upon his gard, and have a continuall larum-bell in his eares; they stand gazing at her vast <hi>bulke,</hi> and wonder when she will leave <hi>growing</hi>; for in her poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall designes she differs from all her Neighbours, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that whereas they do only labour and cast about how to conserve and secure what they have already, and keep the scales even, her counsels tend still to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large and augment her territories. The discovery of <hi>Columbina,</hi> I confesse, together with the conquest, was a worke of hers; yet it is observ'd those vast treasures she transports thence thrive little, in regard of the Ocean of humane, though savage blond, she spilt there; so that some affirme the bloud would overpoise all the gold shee had ever thence, if they were counter-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd; And as that treasure was first got by such effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of bloud, so the greatest part of it, hath beene spent ever since in bloud, for most of the broyles of the Westerne world have beene fed and fomented by it.</p>
               <p>But that immense tract of earth she holds under that clime, is preserv'd rather by the conceipt and report of her greatnesse, then by any intrinsicke strength: yet I cannot deny but her dominions are very spacious, that the Sun never forsakes her quite, perpetually shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in some part or other above her hemisphere: a grandeza, I confesse, that none of all the foure Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19794:12"/>
could vaunt of, no not the <hi>Roman,</hi> whose greatnesse was said to have no horison, though falsly, for he could never crosse <hi>Ganges,</hi> or clime over <hi>Cauca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> Insomuch that <hi>Elaiana</hi> glorieth, <hi>Apollo</hi> only with his chariot can measure the extent of her territories: And they speake of certaine Ambassadours that came not long since to the now regnant <hi>Olive</hi> from a Pagan Emperour, upon whose credentiall letters was endors'd this superscription; <hi>To the King who hath the Sunne for his helmet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Publike fame hath long given out that <hi>Elaiana</hi> ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at the fift Monarchy, but that is a fond conceipt of hers and building of <hi>Castles</hi> in the ayre; for she hath beene told long since by the Oracle, that she shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attaine it, because all other soyles reject her <hi>plants,</hi> and fly from under their <hi>shadow</hi> as the Serpent from the <hi>Ash,</hi> who will leap sooner into a fire: in so much that from those places to which she gives <hi>protection,</hi> she seldome hath any <hi>affection</hi>; for the <hi>Elaianians</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to partake of the nature of <hi>Oile</hi> in divers quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, therefore most properly are they governd by the <hi>Olive.</hi> First, <hi>Oyle</hi> is observed to swimme still on the top, and the reason the Naturalists give, is, because aire doth most predominat in it, so are they lifted up with an ayrie conceipt (for ambition is nought but ayre) that they are only design'd to be Lords Paramount of the world.</p>
               <p>Oyle will hardly or never (unlesse it be well bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) mingle and incorporat with any other liquid thing: so they, wheresoever they come, doe very hardly agree, and sympathize with any other Nation. Oyle hath a dilating quality, that by soft insensible degrees it spreads and still gaines upon the body where it fals, so they by politicke close wayes use to eat into, and incroach upon their neighbours, or more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19794:12"/>
for this subject they are like the <hi>Tartarian plant Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneth,</hi> which growing up to the visible forme of a <hi>LAMBE,</hi> insensibly eates up all the grasse round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Oyle is slow, smooth and solid, so are they observed to be in their motion, though it be a question yet unresolved, whether their affected gravity and slownes in their negotiations have tended more to their prejudice or advantage: And they would bring all others, that have to doe with them, to follow their pace, it being one of their maximes, <hi>that policy must move after the motion of Saturne,</hi> the highest of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: yet although they are long in consulting, they are quicke and sudden in executing their designes, and therein are rather of the nature of the <hi>Mulberry,</hi> which the <hi>Arbolists</hi> observe, to be long in begetting and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his <hi>buds,</hi> but the cold seasons being pass'd, hee <hi>shootes</hi> them all out in a night.</p>
               <p>Another obstacle to <hi>Elaiana's,</hi> pretended Monarchy may be, that it is observ'd, the Soveraigne Ministers she employeth abroad in the highest kind of trust, are so intentive for the improvement of their owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, that it is growne to a proverbe, some of them <hi>gnaw,</hi> others <hi>eate,</hi> and some <hi>devoure</hi> in those places, wherein they are deputed to beare Soveraigne sway; Adde hereunto that her forme of government is none of the pleasingst, for shee chooseth to rule rather by <hi>feare</hi> than <hi>love,</hi> And where shee gets any love, it is drawne as threed through a needles eye, out of the apprehensions of feare, it being one of her principles,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That obedience derived from such a love is surest, in reward that feare as the carefullest and greatest house-wife of our passions, swayeth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19794:13"/>
more powerfully o're all the rest, and keeps them still in centinell, And so makes good subjects, as it did Gods at first,</hi>
                  <q>Primus in orbe Deos fecit Timor—</q>

               <p>Besides all this, as <hi>one</hi> hath lately observed, <hi>Elaiana</hi> hath beene a good while troubled with a fastidious issue, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> she caused to be made at first for a dizzines in the head that proceeded no doubt from that huge <hi>height</hi> she is mounted unto; It was cauterizd at first by <hi>Itelia,</hi> who fetch'd her iron from <hi>Druina and Ampelona</hi>; at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it purg'd only the <hi>grosse humours,</hi> but afterwards it exhausted her very <hi>radicall moysture,</hi> (which she suckd chiefly from <hi>Columbina,</hi>) and her <hi>naturall heat</hi> (the <hi>two</hi> columnes of life) began to decay. She was often with <hi>Apollo</hi> to have this issue stop'd, but there after a long debate, she was positively advis'd, by the unanimous vote of the most exquisit Doctors assembled of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to know the nature of her disease, for to continue the issue still open, for if she stop'd it, she was like to fall into a worse malady, <hi>viz.</hi> a dangerous dropsie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there appear'd in her some symptomes, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable thirst shee hath of domination and rule.</p>
               <p>Moreover it is lately given out that she intends a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pilgrimage to <hi>Delphus,</hi> for a cordial against the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of her stomacke, in regard the concocting heat seems to be somwhat impair'd; for whereas before she never used to disgorge, what she had once swallowed, she hath lately cast up some good bits, yea the most <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> and <hi>sweetest</hi> she had, when she cast up the last, <hi>all her Saints</hi> were a while taken away from her, so that she had not one left to pray unto; whereby it appeares though her appetite be as good as ever it was to like all she seeth, yet the retentive vertue of her stomacke is not so strong as formerly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:19794:13"/>Lastly, the Regions o're which the <hi>broad spreading Olive</hi> signorizeth, are squared up and downe, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd by such an unsociable distance (which makes him receive baffles sometimes from petty compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that except <hi>Elaiana</hi> her selfe, and not all she nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that <hi>part</hi> which gives the Castle for its crest, together with <hi>Columbina,</hi> and some trienniall donatives she hath from <hi>Hipparcha,</hi> the in-come doth no where countervaile the charge of garrisons and governors. Yet I must confesse, the two benefits that accrue to him by this diversity of territories are very considerable, First the opportunity to propagat piety; Secondly, to have choice of imployments for his subjects, and meanes thereby to breed up wise, undertaking and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke spirits;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For great commands elevate the minde to great thoughts, which being conversant with weighty, and high passages, the soule is inlargd thereby; whereas inferiour states by their pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie employments and slender rewards impoverish and abase the fancy, rendring it too narrow for high undertakings. Countries of conquest cannot bee conserv'd without continuall expence, nor their service usd with like assurance, specially by</hi> Elaiana,</p>
               <p>which can relye no where upon meere love and fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary obedience, unlesse it be at her owne home, where I cannot deny but she is exemplarily loyall to her selfe in a high exact obedience. Touching other places she may be said to hold them, as one should do a Wolfe by the eares; nor will I speake now of the crazines of her title to many of them: So, that she is never in perfect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19794:14"/>
tranquillity abroad; and she esteemes her selfe to be in a manner in perfect peace, if shee hath onely to doe with that huge <hi>Bramble</hi> of <hi>Alclarona</hi>; so that it may be hence infer'd, that the <hi>Olive</hi> is of late yeares much degenerated from his Primitive nature, for whereas he was used to be the Embleme of <hi>peace,</hi> he now ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleth in a continuall course of <hi>armes</hi>; And this is the reason I beleeve, that the <hi>branch of Olive,</hi> which at the beginning was the ancient cognisance of <hi>Elaiana,</hi> is turn'd of late yeares to the <hi>Ragged staffe.</hi>

               <p>For my owne particular, let AMPELONA tattle what she will against <hi>Elaiana,</hi> I professe to honour her for sundry reasons, I very much honour her for the solidnesse and secrecy of her Counsels; For her loyalty to her Prince, her patience and admirable phlegme, her painfull and long moulded consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (<hi>proles tardè erescentis Olivae</hi>) her deepe prudence and circumspection, and indeed the <hi>Olive</hi> being sacred to Pallas is an Embleme of prudence as well as of peace; she deserves honour for her constancy, though with infinite expence and numberlesse inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the recovery of her own; And without doubt it was a singular blessing from heaven, that the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Columbina,</hi> with the conquest thereof was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd for her; I respect her for her perpetuall profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed feud against the common enemy, That her <hi>plants</hi> never rove abroad to beare armes for any strange Prince, whereas others receive pay, and serve under the banners of Infidels, and oftentimes against their owne naturall Princes; And as for <hi>Warres,</hi> so for <hi>Wares</hi> they goe not abroad any where to trafficke but into the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of their owne Prince, which makes the <hi>Olive</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:19794:14"/>
to have no small advantage of his neighbours upon any sudden breach.</p>
               <p>Amongst other places where the <hi>Martiall Olive shoots</hi> forth his imperious <hi>boughs, Leoncia</hi> is one, and thither I am bound next, but the worst is, that I must passe through the very heart of <hi>Ampelona</hi>; a mighty incommodity. For she being in perpetuall diffidence, or actuall enmity with her, but alwaies emulous and suspectfull of her, I am afraid to be stop'd or searchd, if not strip'd in the way; And if I passe by Sea, I may chance fall from the trying pan into the fire, I meane into the hands of the Italians, who of all other are most skilfull in rummaging and pillaging; Besides I use to have a squeazie stomacke on salt Water, for I doe nothing but tell what <hi>Tree</hi> the Shippe is made of.</p>

degenerated lately to <hi>Trees</hi> of a tougher <hi>bulke,</hi> yea into <hi>stubborne poplars;</hi> so that if occasion were offered, the <hi>Oke</hi> and the <hi>Vine</hi> would find it a harder taske to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse them, then ever they had to raise them; That in her negotiations with <hi>Druina</hi> and <hi>Ampelona</hi> shee hath turnd <hi>entreating</hi> to treating: That she hath beene the Incendiary directly or collaterally of all the combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions that have happened this side the line, ever since her revolt from the <hi>Olive</hi>; That she is a forge of false Coynes, whereby she hath damnified <hi>Elaiana</hi> as much as any other way, by importing counterfait stampes: that shee hath rare inventions to export Gold and Silver, to raise or depresse their rates, and abase the allay; That she hath reaches beyond <hi>IEVVE,</hi> or <hi>GENOWAY</hi> in new wayes of <hi>Vsury,</hi> in <hi>Bankes, Lotteries,</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> in <hi>bargaining</hi> and <hi>bartering, for shee will make the Fox tayle pay for the whole skinne</hi>; That she marr's her neighbours Markets abroad, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derselling them in their owne commodities; That shee is growne extraordinary witty in devising new tortures, by fire and water, as she made tryall lately upon the <hi>Druinians in Baymona</hi>: In fine that She is a nest of Water Ratts, a mount of Pismires, the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar Cankar and Cobwebbs that infects the <hi>Olive</hi> and hinders his further growth, the verminet that corrodes his mines.</p>

and Itelia</hi> with this motto, <hi>Si concutimur, frangimur,</hi> carieth with it a great deale of truth.

               <p>And now that <hi>Itelia</hi> is come to so convenient and settled subsistence, it were no unwholesome advise that she would take for her motto,
<q>—Nil ultra, hic terminus esto.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A true maxime it is, and ever hath beene, that, <hi>that state which goeth out of the lists of mediocrity, passeth also the limits of safety</hi>: there is a cloud of examples to this purpose: while <hi>Sparta</hi> kept her selfe within those boundaries that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> prescrib'd unto her, she was both safe and flourishing; but attempting to enlarge her territories by new acquests of other Cities in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> shee went every day declining: But what need I rake the ashes of antiquity for instances so farre off? Let <hi>Adriana</hi> her sure friend and confederat fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne her, who no longer then <hi>one age agoe,</hi> thinking by offensive undertakings upon her neighbours to <hi>spread her wings wider, was like to mewe all her feathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Itelia</hi> should doe well, to stand now chiefly upon the defensive, specially neere home, <hi>for it is no lesse prudence, to preserve then purchase,</hi> And if she thinks to grapple more, I feare it will weaken her hold, and must needs prejudice some places which now <hi>flourish</hi> with commerce under her, that have risen out of the ruines of these she goeth about to fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>This is shee that performd such costly expeditions and Martiall pilgrimages to the upper world, and in her voyage thither (as a revenge for inhospitality) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querd the <hi>Citherean Isle,</hi> and for her exemplary prowes was offered the Crowne of the <hi>holiest of Citties,</hi> and more then once the Imperiall diademe of the westerne world; Her Monarques living in that sublimity and largenesse of repute, that they were taken to bee the common Arbiters of Soveraigne quarrells up and downe the world.

one said, <hi>if they had been practis'd in Hell they would have turnd up tupsiturvie the very kingdome of Satan,</hi> Some of <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarckes made voyages thither in their own persons; and many of the royall <hi>stemme</hi> were sent to governe, but alwayes one of her <hi>prime Elmes,</hi> to whom I read of foure generall submissions that were made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the conquest could not bee consummated till of late yeares, which may be imputed to some errors in the course of civill and martiall policy.</p>
               <p>It was the practise of that <hi>selfe admiring mistresse</hi> of the last Monarchy, into all Countries where she tooke footing, with the <hi>lance</hi> to bring in her <hi>language,</hi> and lawes; This was not done here, but the Natives were left still incapable of <hi>Druinas</hi> lawes, which only exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to her owne <hi>plantations</hi>: So that the law of the Conqueror, did neither protect their lifes, nor revenge their deaths, for it was no felony to <hi>fell downe</hi> any of them, yea in time of peace: Nor in civill causes could they implead or commence sute against any of the <hi>Druinians,</hi> or <hi>imbud, ingraffe, insoliat</hi> or <hi>inoculat</hi> upon any of them unlesse he were formerly infranchizd by char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of denization; so that the meere <hi>Luranians</hi> were reputed, out-lawes, enemies and <hi>Aliens</hi> in their owne soyle; But this may be ascrib'd not so much to the policy of <hi>Druina,</hi> as to the great ones that came thither from her to <hi>plant</hi> themselves and push on a fortune, who disswaded the communication of <hi>Druinas</hi> lawes to the natives, because they might oppresse, spoyle, rob, <hi>peele, proyne,</hi> and <hi>grubbe</hi> them up at pleasure; In these unsettled times many of <hi>Druina,</hi> and of late yeares of <hi>Cardenia</hi> also tooke firme rooting in the best and <hi>fattest soyles</hi> of <hi>Lurana,</hi> so that they are growne since to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>height;</hi> Amongst whom (now that I treat of <hi>Trees</hi>) the <hi>Corke</hi> did thrive wonderfully, and no doubt but by a singular benediction from above, the <hi>dew of

               <p>Another reason that hindred a settled peace, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of this conquest, was those vast proportions of lands which were distributed among <hi>Druinas</hi> Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, which were such, that the whole <hi>Forrest</hi> was in a manner cantonizd amongst a very few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of whom some had regall rights, there being eight County Palatines at once where the royall writ could not runne; They had also implicit Commission left to discretion, and not tied to any regular forme of <hi>plantation</hi>; And those huge tracts of ground they lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over begat <hi>wealth,</hi> wealth usherd in <hi>pride,</hi> and pride tumultuary <hi>contentions</hi> amongst themselves, which gave the <hi>Luranians</hi> advantage to fish in those troubled waters for their liberty, and make often encroachments upon them; <hi>But had the Oke himselfe gone to the Forrest, the inferior Trees had not shot up so high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another mistake was, that the first undertakers made ill choice of the seates of their habitations; for they erected forts and houses in the open plains, turning the Natives into the Woods and places of fastnesse, whence they made eruptions and retraicts at pleasure, and whereas <hi>Caesar</hi> sometimes spake of the <hi>Scythians, Difficilius erat invenirc, quam vincere</hi>;</p>
               <p>These were the over-sights in civill policy, now there were also some in the conduct of the martiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; first, the small handfulls of Souldiers <hi>Druina</hi> sent, which came either unseasonably, or ill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated and payed. Then the cold pursute of the maine designe, which like fire newly kindled under <hi>greene wood,</hi> was often made to flash a little, and so left to goe out. So that for the reduction of this spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19794:27"/>
                  <hi>Forrest</hi> to a perfect rule of obedience, <hi>Druina</hi> stood all this while in her owne light, and could <hi>not see the Wood for Trees</hi>: untill there <hi>sprung</hi> up a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Virago</hi> a Princely female, for whom it seemes the high hand of providence had as it were pointed out, and reservd this exploit; who besides the suppression of some intestine rebellions in her owne <hi>Forrest,</hi> the raysing of <hi>Itelia</hi> to a free and faire <hi>Grove</hi> of <hi>Willowes,</hi> and reaching her Princely <hi>boughs</hi> to settle the Crowne of <hi>Ampelona</hi> upon the right royall <hi>Vine,</hi> besides the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall wars with <hi>Elaiana,</hi> and sundry other costly diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, yet she made a full and finall conquest of <hi>Lurana</hi>; And this worke was done in a fulnesse of time, and concurrence of all felicity, when her <hi>royall successor</hi> was to bring <hi>another</hi> Soveraigne Crowne to aggrandize, and adde to the Imperiall and triumphant glory of <hi>Druina.</hi> Her predecessors in their course of governement did but sometimes cast up the ground, and so leaving it fallowe, it became quickly oregrowne with <hi>weeds</hi>; But shee like a great houswife did cast <hi>seed</hi> into it, sowing therein her owne lawes, and utterly extirpating all other; she did <hi>ingraffe</hi> all upon one <hi>stocke,</hi> making no difference twixt the <hi>Luranian</hi> and them of <hi>Druina,</hi> by which coalition she received all alike into her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat protection under the safe <hi>shadow</hi> of her Royall <hi>branches,</hi> making the beames of justice to bee equally displayed upon all with like lustre. Yet for all this there was little returne of the vast expence of treasure that might have served to purchase as great a Crowne, which was imployed to compasse these ends, nor could <hi>Lurana</hi> though a most copious Countrey of her selfe, bee brought by any parsimonious policy to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her selfe, but still <hi>Druina</hi> must part with her very radicall moysture, and wast her owne vitall spirits to preserve her authority there, untill that of late yeares the

and punctually paid; And whereas before, all places of profit and honour were either ingross'd or forestalld by <hi>reversionary grants (the bane and bug-beares of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry)</hi> or confer'd upon unwor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But I have <hi>wandred</hi> too long in this <hi>Forrest,</hi> I will now hoise sayle, and returne to <hi>Druina,</hi> where I shall fixe my selfe a while, but in regard the wind is not faire, I will stay a little, and spend the time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of what hath beene spoken this short Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollarie.</p>
               <p>Touching the relation that <hi>Druina</hi> with her united Crownes, hath to other states, it is to be considered, that the power of this part of the world, is balanced betweene the <hi>Oke,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> and the <hi>Olive</hi>; as for the <hi>CEDAR</hi> and others, they shall come in hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elaiana</hi> hath the advantage of both the other in treasure, but shee is <hi>thinne planted,</hi> hath diverse <hi>nurse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> to supply, many irons perpetually in the fire, wants Corne, her dominions lye scattered, hath bold accessible coasts, and the conveyance of her Bullion from <hi>Columbina</hi> subject to bee intercepted in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; And should <hi>Druina</hi> breake out againe into any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19794:28"/>
traverses of Warre, and serious Hostilitie with her, <hi>Druina</hi> hath lately got no small advantage of her, by acquest of those Islands which lye in the Carreere to <hi>Columbina,</hi> which she colonizeth, and fortifieth dayly more and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ampelona</hi> is <hi>thick set,</hi> and abounds with stirring Spirits, lyeth close together; and being roundish and passable, no one part is farre from succouring each other: Shee super-abounds with Corne; which is quickly convertible to Coyne; and being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mart and Thorow-Faire, lying in the middle of so many great Neighbours, can never want Money: Insomuch, that if you goe to the intrinsique value of things, shee will not, in regard of these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, want much in weight, of the huge <hi>bulke</hi> of <hi>Elaiana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Druina</hi> being surrounded with the Sea, and having alwayes so many <hi>moving</hi> invincible Castles in Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell, is hardly to be invaded; her King being sayd to keepe <hi>as a Tortoise in his shell,</hi> and having many other Insularie advantages. So that it may be very properly sayd of the <hi>Oke,</hi> as the holy <hi>Prophet</hi> speakes of another great <hi>Tree; That the Waters make him great, and the Deepe sets him on high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Druina</hi> would hardly be able to deale with any of the other single, unlesse upon the Defensive; but joynd with <hi>Itelia,</hi> she can give them both Law at Sea; and confederating with either of the other two, she is able to oppresse the third.</p>
               <p>Now, the onely entire Head that confronts <hi>Elaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> greatnesse, and is the <hi>Remora</hi> that stops her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, is <hi>Ampelona</hi>: Therefore, that saying carryeth with it a great deale of Truth, and no lesse Caution; <hi>That the day of the ruine of</hi> AMPELONA, <hi>is the Eeve of the subversion of</hi> DRUINA. Therefore, from the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19794:29"/>
time the <hi>Olive</hi> grew to be so great, <hi>Druina</hi> for strong reasons of State, hath inclind ever since, rather to maintaine <hi>Ampelona,</hi> then any way to enfeeble her. And <hi>once,</hi> when the adventrous <hi>Vine</hi> was taken prisoner by the <hi>Olive,</hi> which was about the time that the <hi>Olive</hi> began first to <hi>shoot</hi> out his <hi>branches</hi> so wide, the <hi>Oke</hi> did contribute to ransome him.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in <hi>that</hi> memorable great <hi>Incendium,</hi> which rag'd so long by intermissive fitts through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Body of <hi>Ampelona</hi>; to quench which, <hi>Elaiana,</hi> out of pretence of zeale to Religion, sent great Barrels of Water, though some say they were filld with Pitch and Oyle, which did rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and feed the Fire: I say, at that time, when there was a Designe to Provinciate the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <hi>Druina,</hi> though offerd a Canton, would not accept of it.</p>
               <p>So then, this linke of mutuall conservation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaining them, the <hi>Oke</hi> may be presumd to be a sure Confederate of the <hi>Vine</hi> and the <hi>Willowes</hi> also, all the while they containe themselves within those bounds they are in, at present. But if they should over-master the <hi>Olive</hi> in <hi>Leoncia,</hi> it would much alter the case.</p>
               <p>No addition could make <hi>Ampelona</hi> more dangerous and suspectfull to <hi>Druina,</hi> then <hi>Leoncia</hi>; for so it were farre worse then if the <hi>Olive</hi> had all <hi>Leoncia</hi> solely to himselfe, in regard they would fall into one continued and entire peece.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, there cannot be a truer Maxime, for the safetie of <hi>Druina</hi> and her Confederates, then this of a <hi>late great States-man:</hi>
                  <q>Decrescat <hi>OLIVA,</hi> nec crescat <hi>VITIS.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:19794:29"/>And thus have I finished the <hi>perambulation</hi> of <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina,</hi> with all her <hi>Pourliews,</hi> and <hi>Perquisits,</hi> together with her next transmarine neighbours, with whom she hath most pratique and necessarie intelligence. I should now passe to <hi>Rhenusium</hi> (and so o're the Mountaines, to <hi>Bombycina)</hi> but that I am afraid to loose my selfe in so vast a <hi>Forrest,</hi> before I should begin my promised Storie: Therefore I will deferre their Character to some emergent occasion out of the matter it selfe, and in the <hi>interim</hi> resume my subject, and returne to my first <hi>Epoche.</hi> But before I proceed, I will give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this short touch, that I doe not purpose, by this discourse of <hi>Trees,</hi> to bring him into a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> or impervious darke <hi>Thicket</hi>; for I know some, under borrowed Names and Types, have affected obscuritie, of purpose to amuse the Reader, and make themselves admired for profound Reaches, when oftentimes their Fancies prove flat Impertinencies, and Non-sense: No; the <hi>Woods</hi> that I will lead him into, shall be faire and open (as he may partly perceive, by what hath preceded) so that he may easily distinguish twixt the <hi>kinds of Trees</hi>; it shall be <hi>lucus à lucendo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And imagine I am now returned to <hi>Druina</hi>; where I find all things <hi>flourishing,</hi> in a rare conjuncture of Peace, Securitie, Honour, and Plentie, under the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> of the stately <hi>Caledonian Oke,</hi> newly settled in his triumphant Throne, begirt with <hi>Cions</hi> of his owne royall <hi>Stemme,</hi> and encircled with multitudes of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and nobly extracted <hi>Elmes,</hi> holy and reverend <hi>Yewes,</hi> learned <hi>Laurels,</hi> stout <hi>Poplars,</hi> with other goodly <hi>Trees</hi>; the <hi>Lillies</hi> and <hi>Roses</hi> White and Red, did <hi>bourgeon</hi> round about him, the Muses and Graces made Festivals, the

               </p>
               <p>All the neighbouring <hi>Forrests</hi> stood at a gaze, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this high felicitie: The <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Firre,</hi> the <hi>Myrtle,</hi> the <hi>Willowes,</hi> sent to congratulate and comply with <hi>Druina</hi>; but above all other, the <hi>Olive,</hi> so shrewdly <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> before by her.</p>
               <p>To performe which worke, the prime <hi>Officer</hi> of Honour <hi>Elaiana</hi> had by Land, was sent Ambassadour, and that in a most high and courtly manner, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the newly enthroniz'd <hi>OKE</hi> with a <hi>Branch of Olive,</hi> the Embleme of Peace, and <hi>Elaiana's ancient Cog<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nisance</hi>: Which being accepted, <hi>Druina</hi> in correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of State, sent her <hi>prime Officer</hi> at Sea, her <hi>Thalas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siarcha,</hi> in such a splendid equipage, that <hi>Elaiana</hi> rings of the renowne of it, to this day. The parts adjoyning to <hi>Elaiana's</hi> royall Court did so strayne themselves to entertaine and welcome him, with his numerous Traine, that some yeares passed, before they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themselves many miles about: for so gratefull was his Errand, being an Embassie of Peace, and so bitter were the resentments and fatall effects of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Warre, that young and old did blesse him as he passed; deeming he had beene some Angell descended from Heaven, and that his attendants were some kind of <hi>Seraphins,</hi> they so admir'd their comelinesse; which did unbeguile the vulgar of the odde opinion the <hi>Loyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> had formerly infused into them, by their concio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorie Invectives, That the <hi>Druinians,</hi> since they left <hi>Petropolis,</hi> were transform'd into strange horrid shapes; some having Dogs heads, others Swines countenances, others huge tayles hanging behind them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:19794:30"/>Such Ceremonies as these being mutually performd twixt <hi>Druina</hi> and her Confederates, and some other domestique Triumphs ended; the royall <hi>OKE</hi> (as well to expresse his Princely acknowledgement for his free and peacefull reception to <hi>Druina's</hi> Throne, without the least motion of opposition or murmure, which usually happen at such Changes, (whereat the neighbouring Princes, specially <hi>Ampelona's</hi> then War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Monarch, stood in a kind of admiration) which reception was accompanied also with unparallell'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of Epidemicall joy, as also for redresse of divers Grievances, rectifying of Enormities, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling wholesome Lawes) sent out Summons for a generall Assembly, where his Royall Majestie, with all the noble <hi>Elmes,</hi> the grave and learned <hi>Yewes,</hi> and a selected number of the choisest <hi>Poplars,</hi> should meet in one Body, to consult of the common Good; and here you might behold a goodly sight, the Epitome of all <hi>Druina.</hi>

               <p>For the discovery of this prodigious plot, specially the quality of it, it seemes by some secret supernaturall instinct, <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarque himselfe, when all his great Sages were at a stand, hit right upon it, for it being fore-threatned, and advertisement being fortunately lighted upon, that a sudden blow should bee given, which should bee no sooner doing, then a peece of paper burning, His Majestie entring into the secret Cabinet of his owne deepe and free-borne thoughts positively avouch'd, that it must bee some project of <hi>nitre,</hi> then which nothing is more sudden and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, more violent and irresistible: and herein hee prov'd as much <hi>Prophet,</hi> as <hi>Prince.</hi>

               <p>Not long after a notorious high act of Treason, drawing to a neare analogie with this, for the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was led by the same ill spirit, except that the one was single, yet upon the person of a publique person, the other of multitudes, if you consider the Agents or Patients; The one was crushed in the shell, as it was upon poynt of hatching, and so most happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, but this was fully perpetrated upon the body ot the great Martiall <hi>Vine</hi> which swayed the Scepter of the then most <hi>flourishing Ampelona;</hi> And Religion that holy and harmelesse Matrone, must be made to sharpen the poynt of that fatall steele which did <hi>scarifie</hi> and penetrate him to the very heart, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly <hi>fell'd</hi> him to the ground; It was done when hee had a potent Army so fam'd and feard farre and neare, composed of choice Veteranes upon a great mysticall designe in perfect equipage, which continueth a riddle to this day: And in the midst of those triumphs that were prepared for his Queene who had her Temples newly begirt with <hi>Ampelonas</hi> royall diademe. And her fancies it seemes the night before were propheticall, having dream'd that those Diamonds wherewith her Crowne were embellishd, did turne to Pearles, which are accounted the Emblemes of teares.</p>
               <p>But most remarkable it is what one of his owne Confidents did forewarne him of twenty yeares before, who told him being newly come to the Crowne, and forced to comply with the times in point of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall

               <p>Sir, <hi>You see how just and punctuall</hi> GOD Almighty <hi>is in his Iudgements, for I hope you have denied the Religion you were first nurtured in, but from the teeth outward, so he hath struck you there, but take heede your heart goe not from it, for hee will strike you there the next time, which proved precisely true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not unlike this prophetique judgement was that which fell upon one of his predecessors not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who being so incensed against the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> that he vowed <hi>to plucke out one of their eyes to stigmatize and distinguish them from others;</hi> He was thrust the very same day into the eye himselfe by an <hi>Eusebian,</hi> whereof hee breathed his last.</p>
               <p>A hard fate it was that three of <hi>Ampelona's</hi> Royall Monarques should fall within so narrow a compasse of time by such mortall stroakes. The last the most accomplished of all the rest, was the most lamented, who out of his cold Vine seemes, me thinkes, to send this mournefull caveat to the greatest potentats on Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they are but weake penetrable things, and though somewhat refind and kneaded from that courser sort of stuffe, which goeth to the composition of the Cittizens of the world, yet they are so much the more brittle ware, onely they differ in ther office, which neverthelesse makes them to have farre lesse to hope for, then to feare.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:19794:33"/>A greater example hereof there could not be then in this great <hi>Puissant</hi> Prince, a Prince in whom nothing of worth was wanting, a patterne of all heroique ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, except that he was transported sometimes too far by that Sexe, which overcame the <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>strongest,</hi> and <hi>wisest,</hi> that ever were of humane race.</p>
               <p>Wonderfull he was in acts of peace and warre, hee had bin victorious in foure maine battailes, before he could peaceably weare the Crowne, hee weeded the Kingdome of such as were devoted to <hi>Elaiana,</hi> and manumizd it, from that most dangerous confederacy which was fermenting many yeares, weakning it by armes, but dashing it to peeces by wit.</p>
               <p>For his Acts of peace, he inrichd <hi>Ampelona</hi> with a greater proportion of silke and wooll, he beautified her in many places with sumptuous structures, cut passages twixt great Navigable Rivers, and was like to do the like twixt Sea and Sea. And some say he had a designe to erect such a spirituall independent dignity in <hi>Ampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi> that his subjects should not neede to clammer the hills so often to <hi>Petropolis;</hi> he dismorgagd the Crowne demeanes, made an increase of munition, armes and treasure, and left behind a masse of Gold that surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the height of a Lance; And all this may be ascribd to his owne activenesse.</p>
               <p>For, as for the outward windowes of his Soule, he was rarely quicke and perspicacious, so was hee inwardly Eagle-eyed, and perfectly versd in the humours of his subjects. And such a great Artist hee was in government, that he preservd <hi>Ampelona</hi> (which abounds more then one part of the Earth besides with boysterous spirits and hot working braines) twenty yeares together without the least tintamarre or noise of commotion:</p>
               <p>A brave sprightfull Prince hee was, composed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19794:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of such a mould, that though hee wanted but very few yeares of his grand Climacterique, when the mortall Stab was given him; yet the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists adjudgd, That if Nature had beene sufferd to have runne her owne course in him, without this fatall interruption, hee might have doubled his Age.</p>
               <p>Never was there Monarch, that Lorded more over his Subjects hearts: Which, as in many pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of his Life, so after his Death it appeard; when by the universall Vote, hee was eternizd to future Ages with the Title of <hi>GREAT,</hi> and that his Statues should be erected in all the Mart Townes of <hi>Ampelona.</hi>

               <p>The Martiall <hi>Vine</hi> being thus <hi>cut</hi> downe, <hi>Ampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> fell under a Female Government, (a Female of rare endowments and Princely worth) untill the succeeding young <hi>royall Cion</hi> should come to <hi>matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi>: And they speake of an old Law, <hi>That the Heire of</hi> AMPELONA'S <hi>Crowne is adjudgd then to have passd his Minoritie, when he is growne to the height of a Sword.</hi> So that during this Government, it may be sayd (notwithstanding the contrarie Proverbe:)

               <p>Not long after the <hi>Vine,</hi> the mightie <hi>Olive</hi> his neighbour fell, who with his <hi>Beades</hi> was sayd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all his time his spacious Dominions, as his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Grandsire did by the <hi>Pike,</hi> and his Sire, that great <hi>Magus</hi> of his dayes, by the <hi>Pen;</hi> who, for some rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that dwelt in him, I cannot pretermit with silence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:19794:34"/>He was the greatest Conqueror of himselfe, and King of his owne affections, that ever was; being alwayes at home within himselfe, in an admired equall temper of humors: No change at all was found in him at good or bad Events, or any sudden tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie Chance; whereof I will give a few notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>After that memorable great Battaile and Navall Expedition against <hi>Alcharona,</hi> (when all <hi>Bombycina,</hi> with the adjacent Islands, were at the stake) was wonne, the relation being brought him, what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Victorie was got, and with what difficultie, and how long she fluttred upon the wings of doubtfull successe, he was not surpriz'd a whit with any exulting motions of joy; onely he sayd, That <hi>his Brother, who was Generalissimo in the service, had venturd very farre</hi>: And it was the first time that he ever daignd to stile him <hi>Brother,</hi> though they were of the same <hi>Stock,</hi> but he a <hi>Branch of the wild Olive.</hi> These were the most important and gladsomst tidings that possibly could be brought him, both concerning himselfe and all the Westerne world, as the case then stood.</p>
               <p>For ill newes also, he was the same: For, in that mightie Expedition against <hi>Druina,</hi> when the very Virgin newes was brought him of the most disastrous miscarriage of his Fleet, that monstrous Sea-Giantesse, the hugest that ever spread sayle upon salt water, take Bulk and Building together; when all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were punctually related unto him, he was not mov'd a jot from himselfe, but calmely sayd, <hi>He had sent them to fight against</hi> DRUINA, <hi>not against the Deitie of Heaven.</hi> And these were the saddest newes that possibly could come. This having beene an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise so much ruminated upon, so moulded and matur'd by time, with infinite expence; the Legalitie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19794:34"/>
of the Act confirmd and animated by a speciall Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction from the great <hi>Arch-Flamin,</hi> and puffd up with such a certitude and infallibilitie of hopes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, that in <hi>Petropolis</hi> there were Bonefires al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie made, in joy of the Conquest of <hi>Druina.</hi> Yet, at the sayd long expected relation, there appeared not in him the least alteration or resentment in the world, for the miscarriage of this Mightie Action, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Fleet, as she was tearm'd; which prov'd, as one sayd, but a kind of Morrice-dance upon <hi>Druina's</hi> Waves.</p>
               <p>Another time, being shut up a whole day in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, to dispatch some private instructions for <hi>Leoncia,</hi> about the time of her first revolt; and bringing them forth fairely written, to be dryed, his then <hi>Secretarie</hi> (that famous minister of State) being with the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennesse of his comming surpriz'd, pour'd the Ink-box all over the Writings, and so defac'd them, that they were made altogether illegible: This did not a whit stirre him, but calmely call'd for more Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to rescribe them; shewing him the difference twixt the Ink-box and Sand-box, against the next time.</p>
               <p>Thus in Eclipses and Sunne-shine, in Calme and Tempests, at ill or fortunate Occurrences, he was immoveably the same; nor could any sudden inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected contingencie, were it of never so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, distract, much lesse divorce him from himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Philosophers teach, That in naturall Bodies, all things decay by the inward conflict of their Principles, and reluctancie of the predominant Elements: for, if a Body were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19794:35"/>
eavenly balanced by the foure Elements whence the humours are derived, it would bee unperish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manners of the minde often follow the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of these humors, therefore in this Prince it seemes, there were the sedomst and weakest struglings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them that could be; A serious reservd specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Prince he was, and could see farre and neare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Spectacles or Prospective, and as it was said of <hi>one</hi> of <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarques, <hi>hee was used to stand in the darke to others, but he made all the world to stand in the light to him.</hi> He would often complaine against his Sister of <hi>Druina,</hi> in that she fomented the <hi>Itelians</hi> his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Subjects against him, that shee intercepted his Treasure, and countenanced her Captaines to robbe him in <hi>Columbina,</hi> and all this without provocation as he thought, pretending that hee had deservd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of her, by being once the chiefest instrument of saving her life, and restoring her to liberty, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Ambassador resident then at her Court, when these traverses of Enmitie happened. Hee was a great example of PIETIE in his kinde, and that in so intense a degree, that he was used to say, <hi>If he knew the Princely plant which first sprung out of him did but brandle or haesitat in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, hee would have his breast ripped up, and those thoughts plucked out of him, nay he would gather stickes himselfe to burne him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cause of the so earely fall of that Prince is a riddle to this houre, but one time in a gay humour he wished in the hearing of his Sire, hee had <hi>Elaiana's</hi> Crowne upon his head but onely one day; And this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19794:35"/>
extravagant wish (as 'twas thought) did him no good; for not long after, he was <hi>transplanted</hi> into the other World by an immature Fate.</p>
               <p>Another Argument, or rather Monument, of the Pietie of this <hi>Platonique</hi> Prince, was <hi>that Worke of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that glorious Structure, which with expence of eight Millions of Treasure, and twentie three yeares of Time, (he himselfe enjoying the contentment of it twelve whole yeares after it was finishd) he causd to be erected, in memorie of <hi>that</hi> famous Battaile he got against <hi>Ampelona,</hi> being then in <hi>Leoncia:</hi> And not as much in honour of the day, as of the <hi>Martyr,</hi> whose day it was; proportioning the Fabrique to the shape of that Instrument he suffered upon. The Handle of it, makes a Magnificent Royall Palace; the Body, an huge Assembly of Cloysters, which make up a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and an Academie. And so intentive were his thoughts upon this Piece of Pietie, that when the long-longd for tidings were poasted to him, of the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the fore-mentioned Fleet, which sayld at first with the wings of such confidence against <hi>Druina;</hi> he then having his eyes fixd upon a Mason, who was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Corner-Stone, he would neither aske, heare, or reade one syllable, untill he saw that Stone settled. Such a vast Pile was never reard up by Scaffold: and I subscribe to them that hold, the World hath not the like, in one entire Piece. And built it is with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall solidnesse, and moderate height, that it seemes in his first thoughts he intended to make a Sacrifice of it to perpetuitie, and to contest with the Iron Teeth of Time. It hath a Quadrangle for every Moneth in the Yeare: and whosoever will take an exact survey of it, must goe above 30000 paces forward, about and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, within the circumference of the Walls; and the very keyes of this huge Edifice, poise above 1000 weight.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19794:36"/>
This great <hi>Magus</hi> being seizd upon by the hand of Death, he sayd none should carry him to his owne Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, meaning that mightie Monument, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: Where he was no sooner come, but this huge <hi>Olive,</hi> which flourishd so long, (though shaken with many shrewd stormes) fell, as they say, of vermicula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being all worme-eaten within.</p>
               <p>The succeeding Princely <hi>Olive,</hi> though in profound reaches of <hi>Policie</hi> he came short of him, yet in <hi>Pietie</hi> he rather exceeded him. He relyed more upon the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power then the Temporall, holding it the safest course: And indeed, it was one of the Cardinall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions his expiring Sire left him; and the other was, that <hi>he might warre with all the world, if he were in peace with</hi> DRUINA. A little after, he yeelded to treat with the <hi>Itelians</hi> as with Free-States; from which words, they ever since derive their independencie, though <hi>Elaiana</hi> denie, that she ever pronounc'd them positively free, but retorts the argument upon them: For, if she condescended to treat with them <hi>as</hi> with Free-States, the Hypothesis must be, that they were not free: for the Topique Axiome is, <hi>Nullum simile est idem;</hi> but whether it will hold in Policie, I will not determine.</p>

               <p>Hence the Imperiall <hi>Cedar</hi> shot out his <hi>warlike bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> farre and neare for many ages, untill the <hi>Ivie clasping</hi> and clinging close about him, suckd out of him much of his very <hi>radicall moisture</hi> to <hi>vegetat</hi> and quicken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so that those twinings and embracements of the <hi>Ivie</hi> proved but as <hi>Iudas</hi> kisses, and this mongst many others is one of the causes of the <hi>Cedars</hi> decay, out of whose ruines the <hi>Ivie</hi> did climbe up to a monstrous <hi>height;</hi> And if it be lawfull to passe from <hi>Trees</hi> to <hi>Birds,</hi> that memorable comparison which one publikely preached in the very Court of the <hi>Ivie,</hi> when hee was Residentiarie upon the skirts of <hi>Ampelona</hi> three Ages since was not improper, at which time that renowned <hi>Poet Laureat</hi> did so bitterly inveigh against the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies of <hi>Petropolis,</hi> calling her the <hi>mother of heresie, shop of vice, and forge of falsehood;</hi> which comparison was,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19794:38"/>
                  <hi>that this so high growne Ivie was like that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse bird, which went about to begge plumes of other birds to cover his nakednesse, they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with commiseration clad him with part of their owne, to which worke the Eagle did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much; This Bird having his barenesse coverd with those adventitious feathers, did thrive wonderfully, and grew so gay that they all turned to Peacocks plumes, into whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Bird himselfe did also degenerat, and it is well knowne what the Peacocke is Embleme of. He began to pecke at, and prey upon those Birds that were his benefactors, untill he made some of them stark buzzards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others have compard the <hi>Ivie</hi> to the Stagge in the fable, which shrowded himselfe under the <hi>branches</hi> of the <hi>Vine</hi> in a time of necessity, which being passed, hee fell a <hi>browzing,</hi> and to eate those <hi>leaves</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served him; Thus the <hi>Ivie</hi> is sayd to use the <hi>Cedar,</hi> with others of his Patrons, who out of a high conceipt of sanctity they held of him, because he was the <hi>great Arch Flamin,</hi> protected him upon all occasions, and would not stand out with him in any thing: But pitty it is, that the fruits of Piety should bee so abused; and that, that high degree of honour, that great Arch-Flamin-Ship which at first <hi>was ordained to bee a spurre to holinesse, should after become a stirrop to pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Petropolis</hi> at her first rise, when shee came to bee Mistresse of the fourth Monarchy, and was at her highest <hi>flourish,</hi> used to clip the wings of victory, that shee should not fly away from her; so shee would

have done to Religion also, since the <hi>Ivie</hi> came to be her Lord, that it should be found no where else, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her walls; which made all the World to have recourse to her, as to the sole Oracle of sacred Truth, the Source of saving Knowledge, and Consistorie of Mercie: and going about to monopolize Religion by these steps, she made meere Merchandize of holy things, and grew to be an excellent Chymist, that could trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute Lead into Gold; perswading the silly Client, that out of that Lead he might make Keyes to open Heaven Gates. Thus Religion got wealth, Piety begot Policy, then the Daughters were sayd to devour their Mothers.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto, that it was the practice of the <hi>Ivie,</hi> to su<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thus the <hi>Ivie clinging</hi> so close to the Conscience, brought the <hi>Cedar,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> and the <hi>Oke,</hi> with all the Westerne Potentates, to bow unto him, and doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to his very <hi>Trunke,</hi> and in a manner to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize him, and <hi>tremble</hi> as the <hi>Aspe</hi> before him.</p>
               <p>He qualified the <hi>Cedar</hi> with the Character of his <hi>first Sonne</hi>; the <hi>Vine,</hi> of his <hi>younger</hi>; and the <hi>Oke,</hi> of his <hi>adopted</hi>; though I know no reason, why the <hi>Oke</hi> may not challenge the right of Primogeniture above all the rest, in regard his Crownes were first irradiated with the gleames of sacred Truth; and, as <hi>some great Clerks</hi> avouch, before <hi>Petropolis</hi> her selfe: and touching that <hi>Title,</hi> which doth peculiarize <hi>Druina's</hi> Monarch from all other, it is much more ancient then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion holds it.</p>

But it is observd, that that brave prauncing Courser, which <hi>Hipparcha</hi> gives for her Crest, being formerly so full of mettle, that he would scarce brooke Bridle or Saddle, hath beene so broken and brought low by her, that he will now very patiently take the Bitt, and beare a Pack-saddle or Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, if need require, which they lay on him once <hi>every three yeares.</hi>

But there is one shrewd brand on it, that his greatest <hi>Patron</hi> opened a way to the Empire by a black way of perfidiousnesse and Treason, in <hi>felling</hi> downe that <hi>Cedar,</hi> which was his liege Lord and Master; and to comply with the <hi>Ivie,</hi> condescended to give him, among other benefits, <hi>Petropolis</hi> for his Court. Ever since, the great <hi>Arch-Flamin</hi> hath wonderfully thriven: for proceeding to domineere over, and captivate the noblest part of the intellectuall Creature, he assumd power to <hi>depose</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Princes, to <hi>dispose</hi> of their Diademes, and to

               <p>And the <hi>Ivie</hi> came to doe these Feates by force and terror, a course very disagreeable to his Calling: <hi>For the Temporall and Spirituall Power should have an analogie with those two faculties of the Soule, the Will, and the Vnderstanding: The Will dealeth with the Vnderstanding by way of power and peremptorie command, but the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, after a sweet way of meekenesse, conducts the Will by perswasions and strength of Reason, and so leads him along in a Golden Chaine.</hi>

Which Opinion, though it carry with it an hot kind of Zeale, it hath little Charitie, I am sure, with it: For, besides those Myriads of <hi>Plants</hi> which <hi>grow up,</hi> and <hi>fall,</hi> under the <hi>Oke,</hi> the <hi>Firre,</hi> the <hi>Ash,</hi> and the <hi>Willowes,</hi> and are <hi>thick set</hi> with <hi>Petropolitans</hi> in <hi>Rhenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium</hi> and <hi>Ampelona,</hi> with sundry other <hi>Forrests,</hi> which have long since shaken off the still-encroaching <hi>Ivie</hi>; that vast Tract of Earth which <hi>Volgania</hi> containes, and those numberlesse multitudes which are up and downe <hi>Alcarona</hi>; nay, those which are in and about the holyest of Cities, with that <hi>immense Region,</hi> which some hold to extend from one Tropique to the other, Lorded over by <hi>Iochan Belul,</hi> who tearmes himselfe also the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> and <hi>Touchstone of sacred Truth,</hi> and <hi>Tree of Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>For in those Ages, a great many of her blessed <hi>Arch-Flamins</hi> creeping lowly upon the ground, yeelded themselves to be made <hi>Bonefires,</hi> for the maintenance of Truth; and out of their ashes, <hi>sprung</hi> up more and more innumerable holy <hi>Plants,</hi> which did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>propagate,</hi> and they were all indued with the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the <hi>Palme;</hi> the more they were <hi>oppressd</hi> and <hi>overset</hi> with the weight of <hi>Persecution,</hi> the <hi>faster, stronger,</hi> and <hi>streighter</hi> they <hi>grew up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In those dayes, the light of Divine Knowledge did streame from <hi>Petropolis,</hi> in beames of Innocencie, Simplenesse, and Humilitie; but afterwards (<hi>helas</hi>) it came to be offuscated and halfe choakd up with Fogges of humane Fancies.</p>
               <p>Some presume to affirme, that if the Almightie would assume a visible externe shape, it should be compounded of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> they are so essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall unto him: <hi>Petropolis</hi> was once adornd with both these; but long since, the one hath beene shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>dimmd,</hi> the other <hi>depravd,</hi> though neither quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishd (as some affirme in her.)

But for his imaginarie Exchequer, wherein were hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the redundancie of good workes, nothing must open that, but Keyes of massie Gold; Arguments were turnd to Armes, and Miters to Helmets: which made the World, in stead of being rectified, to run headlong into strange obliquities of Schisme and Confusion. As much, if not more affiance and conceit of comfort began to be had in them, who once were sinners, and but yet supposed Saints, then in the Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: Vowes and Orisons were made to them, that knew nothing of the heart; and amongst such a number of pettie Deities, God was halfe forgotten.

And the blessedst of mortall Wights, that ever breathd the Ayre of this lower Region, now questionlesse the highest Saint in the Celestiall Hierarchie, began to be so impertinently importund, that a great part of Divine Liturgie was addressd solely to her, in such a way that she questionlesse detests. They came so farre in this point, that to make a perfect Salve for a sick Soule, they held there must be a mixture and compound made of Milke and Bloud, and that they are both of equall vertue.</p>
               <p>Traditions and the <hi>Ivies</hi> Decretalls were made of equall force, and as authenticall as the sacred Charter it selfe, and as much obliging the Conscience; and his Commands observd with more terror, then those which were delivered by the Voice of the Almightie, in Thunder and Lightning.

                  <hi>And whereas at the beginning, Man was made after Gods image, which must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the interne graces of the Soule, it grew a common practise, to make God after mans image in externe grosse corporeall shapes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the incomprehensible Majestie of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty can neither bee circumscribd in place, nor represented in Picture, but darkely describd by an aggregation of his Attributes.</hi>

               <p>And whereas Hee being a Spirit ought to bee servd in spirit, and chiefely with interne worship, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven onely in the Tables of the heart, most of His service came now to bee externe in shewes and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, His Temples being filled with certaine kindes of Antique faces and great Puppets in every corner; so that <hi>Petropolis</hi> became (as a little after her first foundation she was) <hi>a meere Grove of Idolls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover the minde was caried away with such a fond conceipt, that Heaven, and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of glory which is reserved there for the Blessed, might be over-merited by surplusage of works; <hi>Whereas there was never any proportion yet twixt infinity and things finite; nor was this Earth ever held but an indivisible point, and a thing of no dimension at all in respect of the Heavens; and there should be alwayes a kind of proportion twixt the worke and the reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they thought to climbe up to Heaven, upon the <hi>Tree</hi> of their owne Merits, whereas they should have observed that the <hi>Publican</hi> was bid to come <hi>downe the Tree,</hi> before Grace could descend upon him.</p>

               <p>Yet all this cannot deprive <hi>Petropolis</hi> of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a true Church, (I cannot say <hi>adverbially</hi> true (<hi>and God is a lover of adverbs</hi>) she still hath the essentiall grounds, with the externe profession and exercise of saving knowledge. Though <hi>Tares</hi> repullulat, there is <hi>Wheate</hi> still left in the Field, the <hi>Foundation</hi> is good, though some odde <hi>Superstructures</hi> have been raisd upon the first story; And he that pries into her with impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall eyes, will find that shee is not so corrupt in her <hi>positions,</hi> as in her <hi>practise,</hi> for many who have beene <hi>allured</hi> by her Bookes, have beene <hi>averted</hi> againe by her Churches, and the sight of her ceremonies, and antique formes, which in some places are such, that whereas Divinity should goe clad like a Grave <hi>Venerable Matron,</hi> shee may bee sayd to bee accoutred rather like a <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>some</hi> there are who doe prosecute <hi>Petropolis</hi> with such a blacke irreconcileable malice, that whatsoever hath beene once practised in her, though arbitrary and indifferent in it selfe, tending happily to decency and externe Ornament onely, they hold it to be flat Idolatry; They thinke they can never fly farre enough from her, whereby many of them striving to fly from <hi>superstition</hi> fall into flat <hi>prophanesse,</hi> holding this hatred of <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> to bee a poynt of holinesse; so that they may bee sayd to hate her <hi>Religion</hi> rather, then the <hi>corruption</hi> which depraves it; Nay such is their malignancy in this kind, that it extends to the very inanimat Creatures of Stone, Wood and Glasse, so farre, that had they their

wills, there should not a Roofe, Wall or Window stand which was once consecrated by <hi>Petropolis.</hi> And he was well servd for his <hi>blind</hi> Zeale, who going to cut downe an ancient white <hi>Hauthorne-Tree,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she <hi>budded</hi> before others, might bee an occasion of <hi>Superstition,</hi> had some of the <hi>prickles</hi> flew into his eye, and made him Monocular.</p>
               <p>Yet for all the specious fruits of sanctity these <hi>Dotard Trees</hi> outwardly beare, they are found commonly rotten at the heart, they are like <hi>putrified Wood</hi> shinining in the darke; And their fruit like that which is sayd to growe hard by the <hi>Sodomitique Lake, fayre and goodly without, but hanled, crumbleth to Ashes;</hi> So injurious they are to Prayer (being <hi>the very Marrow into which the Soule melts in her Dovotion to Heaven</hi>) that the would thrust her out of her <hi>owne House</hi> (the Temple) at least give her a small roome that may be (unlesse she prove the extemporall issue of their owne shallow braines) har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed over with such impertinent Tautologies, and bold Expostulations.</p>
               <p>Such a deadly feud they have to hierarchy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in holy Functions, that they account those high <hi>Luminaries</hi> which from all times have beene appoynted for the Guidance and Goverment of the Church, to be nought else but <hi>Comets,</hi> and ill boding Starres.</p>
               <p>In their Conventicles they doe commonly <hi>bella cum personis magis, quàm peccatis gerere.</hi> Seldome doe they give their Flockes any <hi>Milke,</hi> but <hi>strong Meates;</hi> they still thunder out Lighning and Tempest, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Curses of the Law, which must needs whoorry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a poore Conscience upon dangerous Rocks, and doubts, and fits of Despaire, and seldome do they apply the sweet, and Soule-solacing Lenitiffs of the Gospell, wherewith the corresives of the Law should be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whence it may be inferd, that they thinke oftner of Hell then Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:19794:44"/>Adde hereunto, that some of these great <hi>Santons</hi> will not stick to expound the sacred Text, upon the warrant of their owne private spirits, as if God Almightie appeard to them out of a <hi>Bush;</hi> but hereby they usually worke themselves into some odde illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an egregious dotage: For they should learne,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in holy things, he that strikes upon the Anvill of his owne Braine, is in danger to have the sparkles flye into his Face, which must needes dazzle him: nor is he unlike him, who layeth together hot burning Coales with his naked Fingers, in stead of a paire of Tongs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could wish, that these sciolous <hi>Zelotists</hi> had more <hi>Iudgement</hi> joynd with their <hi>Zeale,</hi> that they would not runne away so farre from their Text; it were well, that they would suffer Reason to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade</hi> them, before she <hi>invades</hi> them, as commonly in Argument shee doth: That they had more of the spirit of Conformitie and Obedience, to the Constitutions and Commands of lawfull Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; which commonly every ignorant and shallow mechanique spirit amongst them, will presume to censure or demurre upon, and upon every triviall Cavill rayse Clamours. As in <hi>Itelia,</hi> where these fanatique spirits most swarme, not long agoe two of their <hi>greatest Clerks</hi> kept a mightie adoe, <hi>Whether</hi> AARONS <hi>Ephod was of Sea-greene, or Sky-colour</hi>: and this disturbd a while the whole Assembly, there being hot abetters on both sides. And indeed, these <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streperous Sceptiques</hi> are the greatest bane of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who are so full of the spirit of Contradiction,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19794:45"/>
that they raise daylie new disputes, and multiplie Controversies, so that they are almost without number.</p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Loyolists</hi> on the one side, and they on the other were quite grubd vp (<hi>For they are but Brambles in the Lords Vinyard</hi>) or cut downe (and there is a strong warrant <hi>that every Tree which beareth not good fruit should be cut downe</hi>) or that they were sent to <hi>plant</hi> in <hi>Vtopia,</hi> it were no great matter. For with their extremes they blow the Bellowes, and are the common Incendiaries of all combustions wheresoever they come; For the <hi>One,</hi> they have it from their <hi>first Planter</hi> who had beene of the profession of bloud; therefore they would propagat Pietie as <hi>Alcharona</hi> doth hers, with the sword, and so make Religion to bee <hi>Gladij pedissequa,</hi> and which is worse, the Mantle, to palliat all their designes, so that if one should prie narrowly into the carriage of their actions, it would put him in mind of that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tenet of the Atheist, <hi>In nomine Domini fit omne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And betweene these two, the Westerne Church, yea, <hi>Faith</hi> her selfe, that sacred Ladie, doth suffer as twixt two Malefactors, the one disturbing her peace, the other depraving her doctrine; but the time will come that they shall be both crushed to peeces, on both sides, and not a bone of hers broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But nothing is so naturall to the humane Creature, and which he longs after, and delights in more, then novelty and change, yea in holy things; And as long as hee is compounded of the foure Elements, whose very being consists in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie, his braine must still fluctuate with new fancies; As long as there are diversitie of Climes,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19794:45"/>
whence the Celestiall bodies send downe their influences, and make impressions upon the mind in different degrees of temper, there must be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Idea's and conceptions of the Deity, as well as of all other things; And as time doth worke a revolution in it selfe, so it doth in all sublunary matters; We grow weary of old things, of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Politique Lawes, of the most exact and regularst Languages, of outward habits, yea the inward habitudes are subject to this; nay Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion her selfe is not exempt, but like the</hi> Moone <hi>hath Eclipses, Changes and Spots; But as some</hi> Astronomers <hi>affirme those Specks which are discerned in the body of the</hi> Moone <hi>to be causd, by the shadowy reflections of</hi> Rocks <hi>&amp;</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines <hi>which are upon the surface of the Earth; So the swelling vaine conceipts, that arise, and puffe up the mind, are the causes of such blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes in Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An undenyable principle it is, that there is but one</hi> Truth, <hi>and one</hi> Tracke <hi>which leadeth to the right notion of the</hi> Almighty: <hi>And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely Hee being a Spirit and the most simple of essences, they approach nearest this</hi> Track, <hi>who serve Him, as I sayd before, in Spirit and simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of thoughts, with the least mixture of externe Rights and humane inventions: for as in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldry, tis held a rule, that the plainer the Coat
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19794:46"/>
of Armes is, the more ancient it is: so in the blazon of true Religion, the more simple and plaine the forme is, (yet I alwayes presuppose decencie) the nearer it comes to the old Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore, that Religion which hath least of the outward object, to avoyd all occasions of Idolatrie, but worships the God-head by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative act of the Vnderstanding, and goeth directly to Himselfe: That Religion which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from the Creature, and ascribes most glory to the Creator: That which transferres not his Honour, (whereof he is most jealous) or mis-applyeth it to any other: That which makes the poore peccant Soule relye onely upon the Riches of his Mercie, and so by a necessarie recourse to enbosome and endeare her selfe unto him; That Religion surely is most agreeable to the invisible and omniscious God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And my heart trembleth, when I thinke how few there are of this, upon the surface of the Earth: For, as one who had conversd farre and neere with the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the world, doth avouch, if the Globe of the Earth were divided into thirtie parts, they would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make up three parts of thirtie.</p>
               <p>But whither am I thus transported? I hope to be dispensd withall, for the qualitie of the subject, which is the <hi>unum necessarium,</hi> which made me dwell so long upon it.

               <head>A CHARACTER OF ADRIANA.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd here behold a thing of wonder, <hi>Adriana</hi> sited upon an assembly of Islands, in the very jawes of <hi>Neptune:</hi> where being planted at the very first a Christian (a prerogative she worthily vaunts of above all other) she hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a Virgin ever since, neere upon twelve long Ages, under the same forme and face of Government, without any visible token, or least wrinckle of old Age.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Arch-Flamin</hi> espousd her once to <hi>Neptune</hi>; and a Prophecie there is, That she shall continue a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, untill he forsakes her: and he, of late yeares, is observd to shrinke, and grow weaker about her, as if she had made him over-labour himselfe too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. And it is well knowne, no place swimmes more in all manner of wanton pleasure; witnesse those mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>Medlars</hi> which make their <hi>Beds,</hi> and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>grow</hi> about the <hi>Myrtle,</hi> for which she is so much spoken of all the world over.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:19794:47"/>Most renowned <hi>Adriana</hi> hath beene, for brave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits up and downe the World, having wrestled with the greatest of Earthly Potentates; She re-establishd the Easterne <hi>Cedar</hi> more then once, in his Throne; she restord the <hi>Ivie</hi> twice in his holy Seat, being chasd out of <hi>Petropolis</hi>: which made the great <hi>Arch-Flamin</hi> of late yeares to be foulely taxd of a kind of ingratitude, in offering to cause her Armories to be defacd in his Court, having so well deservd of him: But it is thought, since she expelld the <hi>Loyolists</hi> out of her Territories, <hi>Petropolis</hi> hath still a grudge to her, which lyeth yet indigested, and is in her like Lees in the bottome of a Tub of Wine, which at the least stirring of the Vessell is readie to rise up.</p>
               <p>By the Charter of her Saint, she is to have in her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senall as many warlike Vessels, as there be dayes in the yeare; and in the Summer season, as many in course as there be houres in the naturall day, to scoure three hundred miles of Sea, whereof she is Protectresse. And some kind of Vessels she hath, which knew not how to be beaten, untill of late yeares that top of <hi>Druina's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers</hi> (one that hath spirit enough to actuate that goodly tall Bulke) receiving from them some affronts, met with them handsomely, and bangd them to good purpose.</p>
               <p>In that dangerous <hi>League,</hi> when most of the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall Potentates were banded against her, and in a manner conspird to sinke her, shee bore up above water, against them all. But her custome hath beene, to piece the <hi>Lyons</hi> skinne with a <hi>Fox</hi> tayle, and so to supply the weakenesse of Force, by wilinesse of Art, and advantage of Treatie. And it is well knowne, how the <hi>Myrtle</hi> hath taught the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes</hi> of late yeares part of her Cunning; betweene whom, there is an irrefragable Confederacie, to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19794:47"/>
bayt <hi>Elaiana,</hi> and stoppe the further <hi>growth</hi> of the <hi>Olive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongst other things, <hi>Adriana</hi> is much cryed up for, her rich Treasure is one, which <hi>Elaiana</hi> hath often attempted to exhaust: And one of her Embassadours desiring on a time to see it, seemd to slight it, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of his great Masters Treasure, which is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <hi>growing,</hi> and hath no bottome, as that had: Which made one say, That <hi>Adriana,</hi> in relation to the foure Elements, hath her Citie in Water, her Treasure in the Ayre, her Vertue in Fire, which makes the Earth so to flye away from her.</p>
               <p>True it is, that of late yeares the <hi>Myrtle</hi> hath beene at a stand, in improving the Treasure of her <hi>Saint,</hi> since <hi>Elaiana</hi> hath crossd the Equinoctiall, and found out a Track by Sea to <hi>Levantina</hi>; whence <hi>Adriana</hi> did use to receive, not farre from her owne home, and dispense through all the Westerne world, those aromatique and daintie Fruits the <hi>Indian</hi> Trees affoord: but she gives out, that the losse of that Trade is recompenc'd, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine singular Immunities she hath through some of the Dominions of <hi>Alcarona:</hi> So that of late yeares she is shrewdly suspected to be a Concubine to the huge <hi>Bramble,</hi> who hath often <hi>loppd</hi> her <hi>Myrtle,</hi> and cut off the onely <hi>Regall Branch</hi> she had: And against him it must be confessd, shee is the greatest Rampart, and best Securitie all the Westerne Princes have any where by Sea.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Myrtle</hi> flourisheth still: And truly, a rare and wonderfull thing it is, that for so long a tract of Time, considering the violent stormes that have sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her so often, she should still continue fresh, and without <hi>warping,</hi> or any considerable change, or the least symptome of old Age, as I sayd before. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other Politicall Bodies, of a farre greater <hi>Bulk,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:19794:48"/>
have met with their Grand Climacterique, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Changes, in a farre shorter Revolution of Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Politicall Bodies, as well as Naturall, have their degrees of Age, Declinings and Periods; which I cannot so properly tearme Periods, as Successions or Vicissitudes. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales have often turnd to Kingdomes, and Realmes have beene cut out into Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; the ruine of one, being still the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the other; as one foot cannot be lifted up, till the other be downe: Witnesse those foure mightie Monarchies, which were as Spokes upon Fortunes Wheele, or as so many Nayles driving out one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And so is it also in Naturall Bodies; the corruption of one, is still the generation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so that, it seemes, Nature hath her Wheele also, as well as Fortune; and these Changes and Chances, tend to preserve the whole from decaying. So, that the opinion of that</hi> Adrianian, <hi>since much enrichd by a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> Druinian, <hi>is farre from deserving to be exploded for a Paradox,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Vniverse doth not decay or impaire at all in the whole, but in its individuals and parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For, as the preservation of the World, is a continuall Production; so in this Production,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19794:48"/>
as I sayd before, the corruption of one, fore-runnes the generation of another: Therefore, to beare up the whole, if there be a decay in one place, 'tis recompencd in some other: so that one may say, Nature danceth in a Circle, and by this Circulation, preserves the visible World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Meteorologists observe, that amongst the foure Elements, which are the ingredients of all sublunarie Creatures, there is a notable kind of correspondencie: the Fire, by conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation looseth to the Aire; the Aire, by rare-faction looseth to the Fire; Water attenuated, becomes Aire; Aire thickned, becomes Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Earth, by secret conveyances, lets in the Sea, and sends it back fresh; her Bowels serving, as it were, for a Lymbique. So that wee see hereby, there is a punctuall retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a kind of mutuall compensation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, which, doubtlesse, tends to the propagation and encrease of all compounded Bodies; amongst which, there is also a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and restlesse succession of Individuals, to keepe the whole from fayling. For, as a Shippe (as</hi> one <hi>made a very apposite compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison) riding at anchor, tosseth and tumbleth up and downe perpetually, yet cannot goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the length of the Cable to which shee is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19794:49"/>
tyed, and so in this turbulent motion sheweth a constancie: so is it with the Vniverse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all things hang by the Plummets of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore, I cannot subscribe to their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, that thinke the World hath beene long since in a Hectique Feaver, and so drawing on to a Consumption: That neither Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Sensitive, nor Rationall Creatures, are in that height of perfection, as in former times: That Vertue shines not with so strong a lustre: That Invention is farre shallower, and Age shorter: That the Moderne World, compard with the Ancient, is as a Dwarfe upon a Gyants shoulders, or as Noone shadowes compard to the Mornings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I must confesse, Antiquitie is venerable; which makes us extenuate things present, and extoll things passd, and make it still the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of our Song,</hi> VVell fare the old Times; <hi>implying thereby, a palpable decay or dotage in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet we find, that the two great Luminaries of Heaven, and the rest of the Celestiall Bodies, have still the same vertue and operation, without the least imaginarie diminution; all Elementarie Bodies receive vigour and strength from their influence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:19794:49"/>
                  <hi>Therefore I doe not see, how the present can be so farre inferiour, in point of perfection, to them of former Ages, considering the virtuall Causes remaine still in the same strength: and as for Invention, Wisedome, and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I doe not see, but the second thoughts of latter Ages, may be as wise as those of elder Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know, the time must come, that Heaven and Earth shall passe away, and that there will be a finall Dissolution, though no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of the Matter, but a destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Old Forme, and introduction of a New.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And of late yeares, some would be so foole-hardie, as to presume to be more of the Cabinet Counsell of God Almightie, then the Angels themselves, (by whose ministerie, some say, he created the World) as to point at the precise Time of this Dissolution: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other arguments, they fetch downe one from Heaven it selfe; which is, that the Polar Starre, which is in the tayle of the lesser Beare, was in</hi> Ptolomey's <hi>time twelve De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from the Pole of the</hi> Equator; <hi>this Starre hath insensibly still crept nearer the Pole, so that now 'tis but three Degrees off, when it comes to touch or make the nearest
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19794:50"/>
approach that can be to the Pole, which may well come to passe in</hi> 500 <hi>yeares;</hi> Nature <hi>her selfe, they say, must expire, or some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Period.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt it is high time for mee to returne now to my <hi>Rhenusian</hi> Prince <hi>Altapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> newly arrivd in <hi>Druina</hi> upon a high designe of love, and no lesse then to the fairest <hi>branch of the Royall Oke,</hi> that Mirror of all perfections; The <hi>Itelians</hi> and the old Fox of <hi>Ardennes,</hi> with <hi>Druinas</hi> greatest <hi>Arch-Flamin,</hi> did mainely advance the worke, together with the Princely <hi>Orenge,</hi> and the <hi>Willowes;</hi> but the Royall <hi>Firre</hi> of <hi>Elatena,</hi> and that great Queene from which she <hi>sprang,</hi> gave but cold consent thereunto, and it was thought it lessened some part of her naturall affection towards her ever after. Yet <hi>Altapinus</hi> was admitted a Suitor, and as he was in hot pursuite of this brave attempt of love, behold a most mournefull acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of fate intervenes; the fall of that brave <hi>Standell,</hi> which should have immediatly succeeded the Royall <hi>Oke,</hi> in all his Dominions; This strucke an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake into all hearts for the present, which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with various passions of griefe, feare, amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19794:52"/>
and darke suspitions, that in regard his fall was so immature and sudden, it could not bee without some sinister practise of violent meanes, nor can some bee wean'd from that conceit to this day, imputing the cause of it to a precocitie of Spirit and valour in him, and that therefore some infectious Southerne Aire did <hi>blast</hi> him. But this is certaine that there was intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of it in <hi>Elaianas</hi> Court amongst the <hi>Luranian</hi> Loyolists a prety while before his fall.</p>
               <p>This incomparable Prince was so lamented, that all kind of <hi>Trees</hi> throughout the whole <hi>Forrest</hi> hung downe their heads, and seemd to be turnd to <hi>Cypresses</hi> for the time, which being expird, the nuptialls of Prince <hi>Altapinus</hi> were consummated, and when the conjugall knot was a tying, the Princely Bride was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd to bee possessd with a sudden apprehension and eruptions of joy, which as the iron decree of fate would have it, turnd after into many pangs, God wot, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and sorrow.</p>
               <p>For being but a few yeares settled in <hi>Rhenusium,</hi> during which time all the neighbouring Princes envied their high felicity; Behold the <hi>Cedar,</hi> by the instigation of the Loyolists, fell out with the <hi>Homebians</hi> who had elected him to be their King, provided that he would keepe their priviledges inviolable, but they alleadging hee had infringed them, they would continue no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger under the shelter of his <hi>boughs,</hi> but shooke him off, tore his Seales, and resumd liberty to choose ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King.</p>
               <p>Hereupon they made a proffer of their Crowne (I cannot say it was the mayden proffer) to Pr: <hi>Altapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who consulting upon it, though not so maturely, as the disastrous events shewd afterwards, accepted it. Many there were which animated him thereunto, and amongst other motives of incitement they usd, one was,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19794:52"/>
that <hi>if he had courage enough to adventure upon the fairest branch, and sole of that kind of</hi> Druinas <hi>Royall</hi> Oke, <hi>he might very well venture upon a Crowne when it was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he went triumphantly to <hi>Homebia</hi> where hee was inaugurated and crown'd king with many high expressions of joy and triumph.</p>
               <p>About these times behold a fatall torch appeared in the Heavens, placed there by the great Architect of the world, to forewarne Mortals of their miseries, And the direfullst effects it produc'd were under that clime:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Those blazing lampes which in this latter age had appeared in the asterismes of Cassiopaeia, the Serpent and Swan brought not forth such horrid events as this in the</hi> VIRGIN <hi>signe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It were to digresse from the scope of this discourse, to make disquisition whether</hi> these unusuall lights be <hi>hospites</hi> or <hi>Indigenae,</hi> new-come guests or old Inhabitants <hi>in Heaven, or whether they bee meere meteorologicall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions not transcending the upper Region, or whether</hi> to bee rank'd amongst celestiall bodies; <hi>I leave the indagation of this high cause to the Disciples of</hi> Iohannes de sacro bosco <hi>of</hi> Iohn <hi>of</hi> holy bush, <hi>it being not the subject of my</hi> Trees <hi>at this time. But these hairie lampes have beene noted to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the fatall Vshers of calamity and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in states; And as upon earth prodigious births portend no good, so these new engendred

                     </gap>, warres, pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or famine, all which have most miserably rag'd through poore Rhenusium ever since, and cease not to this very houre; and that with such fury, that in many places the bed cannot privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the sick, nor the cradle the suckling, nor the great belly the Embryo, nor the Tribunall the Magistrate, nor the Altar the Priest:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chiefe grounds of all which, was imputed to this revolt of the <hi>Homebians,</hi> from the <hi>Cedar.</hi> For the heavens bright eye had scarce run one whole carreere through the Zodiake, but towards that season of greatest mirth throughout the whole yeare, The <hi>Cedar</hi> had capitulated with the <hi>Elder,</hi> (who from that time forward fell sicke of the <hi>gall,</hi> (a disease incident to old <hi>trees)</hi> against <hi>Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus,</hi> though he was the principall <hi>branch</hi> of his <hi>stock)</hi> to muster up certaine military forces to his use, for the expence of which service he engag'd part of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to him, with which forces, though fewer in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and tyred with long marches, he suddenly assailed <hi>Altapinus</hi> his royall army, and got the day. The <hi>Elder</hi> pursued his victory to the very walls, where <hi>Altapinus</hi> with the Princely <hi>Carbasilis</hi> raignd, and being surpriz'd were constrain'd to flye in confusd manner with halfe bag and baggage.</p>
               <p>Thus the Inconstant <hi>goddesse</hi> turnd her wheele about, and for this shadowy Crown made him loose the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>viz.</hi> his Princely inheritance, the brave territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Baccharia.</hi> Some there are which thought it much that <hi>Altapinus</hi> appeard not himselfe in the field, the day of this battaile, in regard his newly worne
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19794:53"/>
Crowne stood upon the fortune of it; And that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good store of treasure in cash hee suffered his Souldiers to bee heartlesse, and ready to mutiny for pay, most of that treasure falling afterwards a bootie to the enemy.</p>
               <p>The infortunate <hi>Altapinus</hi> traversing up and down <hi>Rhenusium</hi> came at last with the Princely <hi>Carbasilis</hi> to <hi>Itelia,</hi> where the martiall <hi>Orenge</hi> well-comd her with high demonstrations of joy, and his first congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, <hi>that if she had beene the</hi> Masculine Plant, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebias Crowne had never beene lost so slightly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And good reason they had to be welcome to <hi>Itelia,</hi> for it is more than conjecturd, that t'was she who put Prince <hi>Altapinus</hi> upon this fatall enterprise to advance her owne ends. For the truce with <hi>Elaiana</hi> being then upon point of expiring, she had no hope to draw <hi>Drui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> Monarke, whose genius was so strongly bent for peace, but by these meanes, into military engagements, that so part of <hi>Elaianas</hi> strength might fall upon him: but <hi>Itelia</hi> reckond without her host in this point.</p>
               <p>For the first tydings being brought him of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, Hee calls his sages together, and in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found sence of sorrow, and a kind of propheticke spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (and the <hi>Oke</hi> of all other <hi>Trees</hi> is only <hi>fatidicall</hi>) told them, what a fearefull infortunate businesse this would prove; <hi>And that the youngest there amongst them should not see the end of it</hi>; which by sad experience hath provd too true, &amp; yet continueth. Moreover he was usd to say that the <hi>Homebians</hi> made use of <hi>Altapinus, as the Fox did of the Catts foot to pull the Apple out of the fire for his own eating:</hi> And from that day to his last, he disavowed the Act, nor would he affoord <hi>Altapinus</hi> the title of King, alleadging that it would bee a dangerous president to justifie the tumultuary uprisings of subjects in that kind against their King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:19794:54"/>And as this disastrous businesse begun with an omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Comett, so there hath an ill planett, hung over it ever since, for scarce any enterprise hath prosperd in the procedure of it, but one calamity still usherd in another. <hi>Finis unius mali, Gradus est futuri.</hi> As if some ill-boding <hi>Mandrake</hi> had beene found out, and grubd up in <hi>Baccharia,</hi> at the beginning of this fatall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. The <hi>Cedar</hi> having thus debelld the <hi>Homebians,</hi> to are the labells of most of their ancient lawes, made new ordinances, and put some of them to exquisite torments, pretending that, that Crowne belongd no more to him by <hi>Election,</hi> but that he was their proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Liege Lord by <hi>Conquest.</hi> Nor did he hold this to be an equall reparation for the indignity he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Altapinus,</hi> but made his recourse to his Nephew the <hi>Olive,</hi> whom he partly intreated as being the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest of his <hi>stocke</hi> (and therefore should be sensible of the affront) and partly summond him as being Prince of the Rhenusian Empire, and holding <hi>Leoncia</hi> and other territories in homage of him, to assist him with some auxiliary forces, to vindicat this high disgrace, which was done him by <hi>Altapinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon the <hi>Olive</hi> lent him his great Captaine the <hi>Thorne,</hi> with the flower of his forces in <hi>Leoncia,</hi> who shortly after invaded <hi>Baccharia (Altapinus</hi> his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent patrimony, and <hi>Carbafilis</hi> joynture) whereof hee impatronizd himselfe without scarce one stroake gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; though at that time the Princes that were his confederates, had in a ready martiall equipage twise the number the <hi>Thorne</hi> had: But it seemes they all prov'd <hi>stupid unweldy blockes,</hi> and they colourd their cowardise with some presumptions they had, that <hi>Dolus versabatur in Generali;</hi> that their chiefe leader was corrupted before hand with <hi>Elaianas</hi> gold. Thus that great body of <hi>logges</hi> disbanded in part, yet some
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19794:54"/>
kept still together, as shall bee said hereafter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cedar</hi> upon this new acquest, disingag'd his owne territory that he had transmitted to the <hi>Elder,</hi> and gave him part of <hi>Baccharia</hi> for caution for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursments; And to the <hi>Olive</hi> he transferrd the <hi>tenablest</hi> and strongest places there to hold them as Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under him.</p>
               <p>While these feates were a doing in <hi>Rhenusium,</hi> a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Cavalier,</hi> as hee hath given notable proofes both at Sea and shoare, was sent from <hi>Druina</hi> against the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauranians</hi> at the request of the royall <hi>Olive,</hi> and this was done by the negotiation of <hi>Mordogan</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table engin of policy; And it was done of purpose, as it appeard afterwards, to weaken and divert the strength of <hi>Druina,</hi> while the <hi>Thorne</hi> invaded, and seizd upon <hi>Baccharia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Cavalier complaind he was sent to fight with his armes tied behinde him, for his Commission be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so strict (<hi>and strength without Commission sufficient, is like a match without fire</hi>) that could not meddle with any thing upon the land, <hi>Elaiana</hi> also failing of that kind of supply shee had promisd to joyne to his, hee could not doe those exploits which might have bin atchievd with such a power; yet his attempt before <hi>Galeri</hi> was brave, had the Heavens continued propitious, and to speake the truth of any publike expedition, <hi>Druina</hi> made abroad ever since, this redounded least to her prejudice; For he met with no passive encounter, at all, but was master of the Sea, and securd traficke all the while; But as the foresaid attempt in <hi>Galeri</hi> roade for fyring all kinde of bottomes wherein (her offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive strength only consists) was prevented and dash'd, by sudden still perpendicular cataracts of raine: so an Age since when that <hi>restlesse Martialist Elaianas</hi> King and Emperour had an enterprise to destroy <hi>Galeri,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:19794:55"/>
being in sight of shoare, with a most powerfull fleet, one of her Flamins went upon a rocke hard by, and after some kind of exorcising speeches and postures, he tooke a long white <hi>wand,</hi> and strooke the waves thrise, And going thereupon to the Towne, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the inhabitants thereof with notable exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerations of confidence, that they should be of good cheere, for before night there should be <hi>Elaianians</hi> in <hi>Galeri</hi> market as cheape as birds.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Heavens did suddenly change hue, and a most fearefull tempest fell, In so much that the Emperour himselfe escaped with extreme difficulty; And it fell true that his Souldiers were sold by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes in <hi>Galeri's</hi> Bannier towards the evening a little after the shipwracke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will not presume to pry into the secrets of the Almighty disposer of all things whose hand-mayd nature is, how farre hee lets loose the reines to the ill spirit of the ayre, to cause such sudden impressions upon the Elements, whereof there are daily wonderfull examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst this crue of Corsaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know Philosophy and strength of art can doe much, and by connexion of naturall Agents and patients fittly applied can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such effects that may seeme admirable to those that know not the cause; but for these extemporall meteors, I beleeve it is beyond the reach of humane skill, unlesse the ill spirit hath a hand in it.</hi>

               <p>Hereupon He, with his new Consort, being after an exact Scrutinie, found by the Sages of the Law to be privie to this black Act, were adjudgd to be struck off by the stroake of Iustice: but by the clemencie of the <hi>Royall Oke</hi> (who never quite forsooke any whom he once favourd) they were still permitted to live; but for ever removd, from being any more so neere, under the shadow of his pure and Vice-detesting <hi>boughs.</hi>

               <p>Nor did the first act of this, doe any good to the honour of the Civill Lawes of <hi>Druina.</hi> Yet a notable piece of exemplarie Iustice was acted upon the <hi>Guardian</hi> of <hi>Druina's</hi> prime Fortresse; who being found onely privie to some of these passages, was doomd to death, to the terror of others, for betraying that high trust that belongs to that Office: And his death was the more

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He treaty of an alliance twixt <hi>Druina</hi> and <hi>Elaiana, (a peece long hammered upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of policy, and nationall wisdome)</hi> did now openly appeare and advance it selfe; To which end the <hi>Royall Oke,</hi> to remove all <hi>blockes</hi> that might lye in the way, ridde himselfe of those places he held <hi>in deposito</hi> of the <hi>Itelians</hi> to prevent any request or proposition that should happily come that way from <hi>Elaiana</hi>; And considering the daily expences <hi>Druina</hi> was at, and the vast sommes she was out upon them, and that most necessary dependency of conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and community of danger, that was and still must bee twixt her and <hi>Itelia,</hi> this Act was not such a great <hi>soloecisme</hi> in policy, as some Criticks would have it, who in regard they were the very keys of <hi>Itelia,</hi> and her associated <hi>Groves,</hi> observd, that while <hi>Druina</hi> kept them in her hands, she was more awed and respected by the <hi>Willowes</hi> then she hath beene since.</p>
               <p>At the close of this businesse, the royall <hi>Oke</hi> did an act full of Majesty by forbearing much of those
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19794:58"/>
huge sommes which might have beene demanded; And it was in recognition of those rich presents, <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basilis</hi> receivd, when she passd through the <hi>Willowes</hi> to <hi>Baccharia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To negotiat this great businesse of alliance twixt <hi>Druina</hi> and <hi>Elaiana,</hi> Earle <hi>Mordogan</hi> a shrewd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Instrument, was employed, and going to have his first audience, a peece of the royall palace fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him which could be no good <hi>omen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mordogan</hi> had studied the <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Druinas</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke so exactly, that he seldome departed from him with refusalls, hee had such a rare faculty by facetious wayes to dispatch the most important affaires of state; Hee employed all his art (and I beleeve his heart also went along) and left no stone unrolld to bring this mighty worke to passe; yet so infortunate hee was, that his endeavours prov'd plausible neither in <hi>Druina</hi> nor <hi>Elaiana</hi>: But for my part, I am clearely of opinion, that he really wishd well unto, and lov'd the <hi>Druinians</hi> next to them of his owne soyle best of any other, and so much he protested being arrested, by the iron mace of fate, a little after he had beene designd to returne to <hi>Druina,</hi> when summond to his last end, it was no time for him to boggle with the world; And the gracious <hi>Oke</hi> now regnant (to whom the <hi>Olive</hi> did churlishly put over young <hi>Mordogan</hi> for a reward of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold services of his dead sire) did not onely resent his fall, but vindicat him from those aspersions that were malevolently cast upon him to have alwayes played with a staffe of two ends, the one of <hi>Olive,</hi> the other of <hi>Oke.</hi> Yet he received divers outrages in <hi>Druina,</hi> and one time when he had beene rudely usd and assaulted as he passd through the streets of <hi>Thamisond,</hi> and news thereof being posted, though not by his means, to <hi>Elaianas</hi> Court, where the Royall <hi>Oke</hi> had then two
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19794:58"/>
Soveraigne Ministers representing himselfe, yet there was no violence at all offerd them or theirs; which made <hi>Elaiana</hi> take the advantage to arrogat to her selfe more civility in this kinde then <hi>Druina</hi> This causd him to say, <hi>that Druinas bran was very course, but her flowre wondrous fine;</hi> for the <hi>taller sort of Trees</hi> who could looke over into the true state of things, highly esteemd him, though the <hi>poplars</hi> who see no further then the <hi>rind,</hi> contemnd and vilified him, bringing him often upon the stage, and making him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon subject of their <hi>pasquils,</hi> wherein he rather glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, then grew discontented.</p>
               <p>Amongst other facetious passages of <hi>Mordogan,</hi> I cannot omit one which happend upon his last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Druina,</hi> At which time being magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently feasted by the chiefest Magistrate of <hi>Thamisond,</hi> In the midst of these jollities, he askd leave to begin two healths; The <hi>first,</hi> was to the KING his Masters mistresse, The second to his Wife; the healths being gone round, he thus expounded himselfe. <hi>That his great Masters mistresse was</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantina, <hi>and none are so fond of a Mistresse, but if a friend hath a private favour of her, he will winke at it; and such was</hi> Levantina, <hi>who though she properly belongd to his Master, yet he suffereth the brave adventurers of</hi> Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina <hi>(whereof many were there present) to have a bout with her, and he passeth it by, and takes not much exception at it; But his Masters Wife was Columbina whom he desired to have wholly to himselfe, and therfore that none should meddle with her; (But the Willowes of late
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19794:59"/>
have gone about to make him a notorious Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old, and have had ready money to lye with her.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Like to this was that, when a little after the going of <hi>Altapinus</hi> to <hi>Homebia</hi> he was invited to a solemne meeting, where that flexanimous and golden toungd <hi>Orator</hi> (then gardian of the Kings conscience) began the King of <hi>Homebias</hi> health, he pleasantly pledg'd it, and passd it over, saying <hi>it was the first time that ever he pledged the Cedars health in Druina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his opinion in holy things, he had a charitable conceipt of <hi>Druina's</hi> Religion, and seemd to slight many things in that of <hi>Petropolis,</hi> as will appeare by these few instances following. In a serious discourse once of holy orders, when many things were can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasd <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> hee said,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That hee feared the same doome, and destiny attended the Loyolists that befell in times passd, another great Religious order of Cavaliers, who were growne so excessively rich, that they were utterly suppressed with a strange kind of suddennesse every where, and so became a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon booty to their Princes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Guic.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Another time when that sappy and <hi>fruitfull Tree</hi> (out of whose stocke sprouted that comely Elme which grevv so high under the <hi>branches</hi> of the <hi>Royall Oke,</hi> and did <hi>flourish</hi> long in his sole favour) had such a vogue at Court, that shee hoisd up, and tumbled downe some great Officers at pleasure, and that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary recourse vvas had to her for matters of grace, Earle <hi>Mordogan</hi> dispatching a post to <hi>Elaiana,</hi> sent advise <hi>that there were never better hopes of</hi> DRV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INAS <hi>conversion to Petropolis then then, for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19794:59"/>
they began to worship the</hi> Mother <hi>more than the sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, when that long flourishing <hi>Favorit</hi> in <hi>Elai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> had fallen, and to shelter himselfe from those stormes which he foresaw, would thunder upon him from the temporall power, did cover himselfe with a scarlet robe (the highest of spirituall dignities) <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogan</hi> was askd by <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarke, whether he had sent for a benediction from his new elected Cardinall, He answered, <hi>There was once in Elaiana one who had a Plum Tree in his Garden which was winde fallen, and there being a statue made of the</hi> Trunke <hi>of this Tree and placed in the Church for adoration, he was asked why he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to worship that statue as hee did others, He answered, that he knew that statue from a plant, and what kinde of fruit the Tree had borne, therefore hee thought there was no ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration expected from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of these instances you may inferre that he was an Anti-Loyolist, and liked not all things in <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was that noble <hi>Elme Count Sophronio</hi> whom <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarke employed to <hi>Elaiana</hi> to this end, lesse dextrous and discreet, who although he was not so nimble and Mercuriall as <hi>Mordogan,</hi> yet he rather excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in solidity and a high reach of understanding. He made a rare discovery of certaine <hi>plants,</hi> that were <hi>rotten at the heart,</hi> (yet daily servd about the <hi>Royall Oke</hi>) that were devoted by pensionary obligations to the <hi>Olive.</hi> He went bravely attended to the <hi>Cedar's</hi> Court,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19794:60"/>
and so to the <hi>Eldars,</hi> with whom he was not behind hand. Hee engagd his owne argentry to make up a somme of treasure to preserve those troupes from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding, which were then in motion for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Baccharia</hi> under CAMPANTHROPO, <hi>That admired Captaine of his time, who was said to make Souldiers spring up out of the very earth to follow him, though he had not a crosse to pay them salary; And although hee had beene put many times to the foyle and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme exigents, yet he never fell sans resource, but still rallied his squandred squadrons, and made offensive head againe, And most brave was that Retrait (and honourable retrait is the difficultst thing in the feat of armes) which hee made, when by the point of the sword, hee pass'd through the very heart of</hi> Leoncia <hi>to his intended rendezvous, where he caus'd the</hi> Thorne <hi>to burne his tents and rayse the cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly siege hee had then a foot, before one of the prime townes of the</hi> Itelians.</p>
               <p>And this was the greatest cloud that ever fell upon the <hi>Thorne,</hi> since hee entred into <hi>Elaianas</hi> service, but hee dispelld it not long after, and made his honour to shine with a greater lustre then ever, by taking in that <hi>Towne</hi> whereof the <hi>Orenge</hi> was proprietary Lord, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that the <hi>Oke,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Firre,</hi> and the <hi>Ash</hi> appeard, some more, some lesse in that action for the <hi>Willowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some say this sunk so deep into the Princely <hi>Orenge,</hi> that it did accelerat his fall, which hapned not long after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:19794:60"/>And he being gon, the <hi>Thorne</hi> wisely retired to <hi>Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bycina</hi> the Soyle whence hee first <hi>sprung,</hi> fearing that <hi>fortune who being a Female loves Youth best, would frowne, and turne her backe towards him now in his declining times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a strong emulation twixt these two great Martialists, And the ORENGE derogating one day from the THORNE, because hee was <hi>sprung</hi> out of a Marchants <hi>stocke,</hi> and consequently was not capable of competition with him who came of a PRINCELIE <hi>Extraction;</hi> He sent him word <hi>that it was a more glorious thing for a</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant <hi>to have command over</hi> Princes, <hi>then for a</hi> Prince <hi>to be commanded by</hi> Marchants.</p>
               <p>A brave quarter-giving Enemy the <hi>Thorne</hi> was, but the service of the <hi>Olive</hi> (unlesse you throw into the Scales the high honour and fame hee purchased thereby) provd over precious to him, for hee spent not onely the vigour of his dayes therein, but exhausted much of that great estate he brought with him so farre, that his owne <hi>plants,</hi> some of them, are forced to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist meerely by Pensions from <hi>Elaiana.</hi> But that which was worse being before a <hi>Towne</hi> in <hi>Bombycina</hi> neare his owne home, which he had so blockd up and stormd, as that he had her as a Bird in a Cage, he was suddenly commanded by inexpected order from <hi>Elaiana</hi> to raze his workes, and raise the siege, notwithstanding that the Warre continued longer; This they say he resented so deepely, that retyring to his owne naturall Soyle, he presently after <hi>fell.</hi> But it is no new tricke in policy, for diverting the least dishonour that should fall upon the State, to destroy some Instruments, and make them Sacrifices for the publique. This great Captaine had so
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19794:61"/>
highly deservd of the <hi>Olive</hi> (and <hi>Cedar</hi> also by taking in of <hi>Baccharia</hi>) that his services seemd to transcend all reward; And by him one may learne this lesson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That supererogatory services, and too great benefits from Subjects to</hi> Kings <hi>are of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous consequence, when they make the mind more capable of merit then duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those fearefull Fires which were kindled through all parts of poore <hi>Rhenufium,</hi> had now rag'd extreamly, to quench which, the Royall <hi>Oke</hi> sent sundry of his Noble <hi>Elmes</hi> in many costly legations from time to time, but good King, <hi>While he laboured for peace, they made themselves ready for battaile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And herein the <hi>Cedar</hi> proved very ingratefull to him, considering the fairenesse of his proceedings; And touching the <hi>Elder,</hi> what could be expected from him but <hi>knotty and crooked hollowhearted dealings?</hi> Yet by his high credit with the <hi>Olive,</hi> he often asswagd the fury of those conflagrations, by suspension of Armes and cessation of all acts of hostility, and preservd <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charia</hi> a long time from invading; And hee proceeded so far by treaty, that he was profferd to have the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Ban taken off, of <hi>Altapinus</hi> upon his conformity to a submission, that so hee might bee rendred capable to treat, and travell through <hi>Rhenusium</hi>; to have also an entire surrender made of his possessions to his Eldest <hi>Graff,</hi> which should be affianced to one of the <hi>Cedars branches,</hi> and in the interim to be brought up in <hi>Druina's</hi> Court. Moreover hee should be restored to his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity after that old decayed <hi>Elder</hi> should fall, upon whom the sayd Dignity had beene in a shuffling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect manner conferrd, yet with this <hi>proviso,</hi> that the <hi>next Heire should not be prejudiced.</hi>

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:19794:61"/>These propositions being sent to AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAPINVS, <hi>hee replied, that whereas the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse party, requird a Personall submission, and that this should precede all other things, by naturall order usd in like cases, the restitution of his Country which was a thing materiall should goe before, and then the other which is but a poynt of Ceremony, should follow; And whereas hee had already complied with the</hi> Cedar <hi>to signe an Instrument for the conditionall resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Crowne of</hi> Homebia, <hi>and done other acts of Conformity, and no performance at all on the</hi> Cedars <hi>side; If these intentions of his were reall, the sayd submission might bee done as well by a Deputy.</hi>

               <p>From <hi>Ampelona's</hi> Court <hi>Rocalino</hi> flew upon the wings of love towards <hi>Elaiana,</hi> and it was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that season, that the Lady <hi>Flora</hi> useth to cloath our <hi>Grandame</hi> Earth, with a nevv livery diapred vvith various flovvers, and chequerd with all delightfull objects; <hi>a season that was usd to bee no lesse proper, than propitious to lovers.</hi> The pretty songsters of the spring with their various notes did seeme to welcome him as he passd, the woods put forth their blossomes, the earth her Primeroses and <hi>daiseyes to behold</hi> him, the aire blew with gentle Zephires.

That night and next day after there were darke whispers up and down, but towards the evening <hi>Villerio</hi> went privately to the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all palace where he had audience, and whence <hi>Chenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra the sole ingrosser of the Olives favour,</hi> did accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him backe to wellcome Prince <hi>Rocalino,</hi> who magnifying that brave journey, and discovering won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull motions of joy,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee said the Olive and the Oke should part the world betweene them, and that it should bee a match presently, for he doubted not but hee came thither to be of their Religion;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto answer being made, that <hi>hee came not thither for Religion, but for a Wife; Chenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> replied short, <hi>that there must bee then a dispensation procurd from</hi> Petropolis.</p>
               <p>That night <hi>Elaianas</hi> Monark himselfe came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate Prince <hi>Rocalino</hi> to <hi>Sophronio's</hi> dwelling, but he mett him halfe way, and with much complement and mutuall embraces parted for that time.</p>
               <p>The next day he brought forth in a solemne stately kinde of march the LADY AMIRA (the jewell which should have beene the prize and guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of that heroicke adventure) to bee seene of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by <hi>Rocalino</hi> in transitu; But it being divulgd abroad it was Prince <hi>Rocalino</hi> that was come, all were transformd into a kind of amazement, which broake
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19794:63"/>
out after into incredible acclamations of gladnesse, every one extolling to the very starres, the bravery of the action, And the generall vote was, <hi>that it were great pitty but the Lady Amira though she were a goddesse, should be throwne into his armes that very night, hee had so well deservd every inch of her;</hi> They said further <hi>that all the Angels in Heaven came along with him,</hi> for the Country having extreamely suffered by a long unusuall drowth, upon his comming there fell downe most wholsome fructifying showers, wherein t'was said, the <hi>Earth dranke healths to congratulate his comming thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning the Royall <hi>Olive</hi> sent some prime <hi>Elmes</hi> to attend Prince <hi>Rocalino</hi> in quality of Officers of state, and a little after he was brought to the royall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in the same state <hi>Elaiana's</hi> Kings use to be attended the day of their Coronation. The Royall <hi>Olive</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe accompanied him, with all the flower of his Court, and alwayes from that day to the very last he stayed there, he gave him still the precedency, transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him all petitions and matters of grace; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of prisoners were releasd, and indeed there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing that might be added to the very height of all externe honour and ceremony.</p>
               <p>But let us looke a little into the interiour carriage of the maine businesse, and there you shall finde that,
<q>Quercus connubium, connubia tractat Oliva.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Rocalino</hi> arrivd, matters were brought to that perfection by the strenuous negotiation of <hi>Sophronio,</hi> that there wanted nothing for the consummation of all things, but a dispensation from <hi>Petropolis,</hi> which at last came, and before that time <hi>Rocalino</hi> was not admitted to speake with the <hi>La: Amira</hi> in quality of a <hi>Sutor,</hi> but a <hi>Prince</hi>; Now the said dispensation came cloggd with an unhappy inexpected clause, thrust in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19794:64"/>
of purpose, as it appeard, to retard the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of things, which was, that whereas there were <hi>Certaine Articles condescended unto by</hi> Drui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's <hi>Monarke in favour of the</hi> Petropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans <hi>that were in that kingdome, and other Crownes under his dominion, the great</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamin' <hi>demanded caution for the performance of them;</hi> The Royall <hi>Oke</hi> answered, that <hi>he could give no other caution then his word and oath, and</hi> Rocalino <hi>should doe the like, which should be confirmd by his Counsell of state and exemplified under</hi> Druinas <hi>broad Seale;</hi> but this would not satisfie unlesse some Petropolitan Soveraigne Prince would engage himselfe for them.</p>
               <p>Hereupon all matters were like to goe off the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and a buzze went out, that <hi>Rocalino</hi> intended to get away covertly.</p>
               <p>In these traverses <hi>Chenandra</hi> steps forth, and said <hi>there were three wayes to conclude this businesse; two good, and one bad; The first good way was, that Prince</hi> Rocalino <hi>should become a</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second was, that as</hi> Elaiana <hi>was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to him for his free comming thither, so Shee might as freely deliver him the</hi> LADY AMIRA, <hi>trusting him without further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ill way was, not to trust</hi> Rocalino <hi>at all with any thing, but binde him as fast as they could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:19794:64"/>While matters were thus a canvasing, and gathering ill bloud, <hi>Elaianas</hi> King steppd out, and profferd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himselfe by oath, for the satisfaction of the great <hi>Archflamin,</hi> but with this proviso, that hee must first consult with his ghostly fathers, whether he might do it <hi>Salva conscientia</hi> or no. Hereupon the businesse was referrd to a comittee of the <hi>learnedst Yewes;</hi> and the state of the question was,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether the Olive might with safety of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence take an oath in behalfe of</hi> Druinas <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke, and</hi> Rocalino, <hi>for performance of such and such Articles that were agreed upon in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the</hi> Petropolitans, <hi>throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Royall</hi> Oke.</p>
               <p>This assembly long demurrd and dwelt upon the question, and after a long protraction of time, they concluded at last affirmatively; <hi>And in case the Oke faild to execute what was stipulated, the Olive was to vindicate his Oath, and right himselfe by the sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This difficulty being surmounted, there was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great joy, and all the Capitulations were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably sworne unto both by the <hi>Oke</hi> and <hi>Olive,</hi> and as <hi>Chenandra</hi> said in <hi>Elaiana,</hi> so the Royall <hi>Oke</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was so confident, that he said;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the devills in hell could not now breake the match; whereunto a blunt facetious Knight being by, answerd, that there was never a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill now left in hell, for they were all gone to</hi> ELAIANA <hi>to helpe to make up the match.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But matters being scrued up to this height, the

                  </gap>ll; Vpon <hi>which tydings the Royall</hi> Olive <hi>came to Prince Rocalino</hi> and told him <hi>that he had receivd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill newes, which was, that the holy Sire, who was so great a friend to the intended alliance (who had formerly writ unto, and sent to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit Prince</hi> Rocalino) <hi>was taken away by the hand of fate, and in regard there was yet no contract but a treaty only a foot, hee could not proceed further in this businesse without a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the former licence by Melissanus the newly chosen</hi> Archflamin, <hi>which by reason of his indisposition of health, and the large distance of place, could not bee dispatchd with that celerity that was wishd: But now that his highnesse was pleasd to stay so many years for a wife, might well stay a few months longer, and he would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to negotiat and procure that dispatch from</hi> Petropolis <hi>with all the expedition that might be; And if he pleasd to give way that the</hi> La: Amira's <hi>journey to</hi> Druina <hi>might be defer'd, untill the next ensuing spring, he would give him a blanke to write his owne conditions, touching the surrendry of</hi> Baccharia, <hi>which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence his so long stay</hi>: Prince <hi>Rocalino</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this answerd, that <hi>he was infinitely bound to his Majesty for all those transcendent favours hee had receivd since his arrivall to his Court,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19794:65"/>
and the reasons that inducd him to undertake so hazardous a journey were two; One to streigthen the league of amity with his Majesty in his owne person; the other was, to give the world a greater testimony of his love to the</hi> Lady Amira <hi>to whom hee had already transmitted his best affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; And hee had thought the Soveraigne Agents of his Royall sire, had brought mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to that ripenesse, that hee needed not to have come thither to treat of a mariage, but to fetch home a Wife; Now since his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty alleadgd that the late holy</hi> Archflamin <hi>bring go<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, hee cannot proceed further with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the approbation of Melissanus the newly Elect, hee desird him to consider that if his Majestie had a spirituall sire to comply withall, hee had a naturall sire to obey, which was</hi> DRUINAS <hi>Royall Oke, whose toppe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already periwiggd with snowy age, was sickly and impotent and subject to many indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, therefore hee feard that hee being his sole Masculin plant, and the staffe and comfort of his age, it had already wrought some ill impressions in him, that he wanted him so long beyond the proposed time. Besides the eyes of all</hi> DRUINA <hi>were fix'd upon him, and hee being their next succeeding hopes, this his so long absence might produce ill effects,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19794:66"/>
and dangerous consequences of state at home; Adde hereunto that there was a Royall fleet alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy floating on the Seas for his transfretation, and the season, if hee retarded his voyage any longer, would grow rough and dangerous. Moreover his Majesty was not ignorant, that the Capitulations which his Royall Sire had signd and sworne unto, and were confirmd by his Counsell of state, were done with this proviso, that if hee be not returnd in Druina by such a time, all that was passd should be</hi> pro non facto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Olive</hi> hearing this, stood a while at a stand, and after said, <hi>Since his Highnesse had pressd the necessity of his departure with such pregnant reasons; if he feard any commotion in Druina, by reason of any thing that might reflect upon these proceedings, hee would send an army with him of purpose; And since matters were so, his Highnesse might thinke fit to leave a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive power, with whom he pleasd to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to the</hi> La: Amira, <hi>which should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely done ten dayes after the confirmation should come from</hi> Petropolis; <hi>And if hee pleased to repose that trust in him, he would faithfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, and esteeme it a singular favour, and then hee might send when, and whom hee pleasd for her, for ever after she should be at his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:19794:66"/>Prince <hi>Rocalino</hi> replied, <hi>That touching his first proposition, for an army to goe with him, the remedy would be farre worse than the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, though there should bee tumults in</hi> Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the second, he made semblance to bee mightily taken with it, saying, that of all the Grandezas he had received since his comming to his Royall Court, this surmounted all the rest, therefore he would leave a power behind in</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronio's <hi>hands, to that end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being done, <hi>Rocalino</hi> without the least om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of discontentment, prepares for his journey backe, leaving behind him Gemmes of invaluable <hi>esteeme,</hi> and such as was confessd, never to have beene seene the like in that Court, as presents for the <hi>Lady Amira,</hi> which were, I cannot deny, very honourably returnd by <hi>Elaiana</hi> after the rupture of the treaty, and publike declaration of warre.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Olive</hi> himselfe with the rest of the royall stemme, accompanied him a dayes journey of, and never were seene streighter embracements, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward arguments of love and reiterated endearements betweene any, then betweene the <hi>Olive</hi> and <hi>Rocalino</hi> at their departure.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Villerio</hi> and <hi>Chenandra</hi> parted not so lovingly, <hi>Villerio</hi> telling him, <hi>That hee acknowledged himselfe unmeasurably obligd, to the royall Majesty of the</hi> Olive, <hi>and the rest of the Princely branches in an eternall tye of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and that therefore he would mainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

in what in him lay, to nourish and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then still the peace twixt the dominions and subjects of both Crownes, But for your selfe Count Chenandra, you have so many wayes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged me, that I cannot make any profession of future friendship to you without flattery; Chenandra answered very short, that h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of what hee had said, and so they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Rocalino</hi> taking his leave of the <hi>Lady Amira,</hi> was desird by her to see a <hi>Vestall Saint</hi> in his way as he passd, who was then cried up for miracles; In some divine exercises she was reported to be often lifted up in the aire, and appeare as fresh as a rose, though she was so furrowd with age, that she lookd like a spirit kept in a bagge by some conjurer.</p>
               <p>But hee comming thither, and shee mingling dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him a long time, the substance whereof was for the most part, that he should bee good to the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> in <hi>Druina,</hi> and to bestow an alme amongst her poore vestall sisters, there could no elevations be discernd, or any sudden changes at all in her, or any other miraculous feates, though shee could have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shewd them in better company. Prince <hi>Rocalino</hi> being conveniently attended to the Sea side, and with extreame hazard embarkd, a private instrument was dispatchd in his name to <hi>Elaianas</hi> Court with instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>Sophronio</hi> to stay the delivery of the proxy, till further directions from him; But these instructions were not to bee delivered untill the Ratification had come from <hi>Petropolis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the interim great preparations were made against the celebration of the nuptials, The <hi>Lady Amira</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19794:67"/>
her selfe daily to learne <hi>Druinas</hi> language, the Soveraigne Ministers which represented the person of <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarke, carried themselves rather like sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects towards her, then Ambassadours; Many rich accoustrements and presents shee had provided for Prince <hi>Rocalino,</hi> Her family was assignd her, her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers distinguishd, And (which weigheth much with me, for the reality of the thing) <hi>Sophronio</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a great number of brave liveries for his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, as rich as any that ever were worn in that Court, and matters were cryed up with such a certitude, that the mart went twenty to one, the businesse would take.</p>
               <p>At last the Ratification came plenary, and absolute from <hi>Petropolis,</hi> but a cunning rumor went out, it had come some weekes before, upon which the private instructions which were sent in Prince <hi>Rocalino's</hi> name were anticipated by <hi>Sophronio,</hi> who while he remaind anxious and fearefull to preferre a private order to the prejudice of the high Commission of <hi>Druina's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke under the greatest seale, <hi>which none can counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund or suspend but the same power that give's it,</hi> hee proceeded still untill new instructions came from the <hi>Royall Oke</hi> himselfe to stay the delivery of the said proxy;</p>
               <p>And that <hi>whereas before he treated singly of a match, hee should now joyne the Restitution of</hi> Baccharia <hi>with it, for he would not marry</hi> Rocalino <hi>in joy, and leave Carbasilis in teares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophronio</hi> solliciting the royall <hi>Olive</hi> upon the new Commission, and not receiving a satisfactory positive answer, had order to depart that Court, and so all was dashd to peeces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:19794:68"/>VVhence I learne, that <hi>in politicall affaires, as well as mechanicall, it is farre easier to pull downe, then build up; for that structure which was above tenne sommers a building, and that by no meane</hi> Artists, <hi>was destroyd in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the world adjudged <hi>Elaiana</hi> to be well apayed for the hard measure she had offerd Prince <hi>Rocalino,</hi> to tantalize him so long with dilatory hopes, and let him returne at last without his errand: For upon the very point, when the businesse should have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated, and the <hi>Lady Amira</hi> tendred, the motion may bee said to have beene rejected as it were by <hi>Druina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many obstacles concurrd to hinder this great worke.</p>
               <p>The maine of all, difference in Religion; for so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and blockish were they of <hi>Elaiana,</hi> that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon voice was, <hi>Prince Rocalino came thither to make himselfe a Christian</hi>; And happy had it beene for that businesse, if he had never lodgd in the Royall Palace, but had taken one of his owne, wherein <hi>Druinas</hi> litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and the rites of her Church might have openly appeard to unbeguile those silly wretches.</p>
               <p>The clashings twixt <hi>Villerio, Sophronio,</hi> and <hi>Chenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> who opposd it as long as t'was safe for him, the exceptions that were taken at <hi>Villerios</hi> Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>But pitty it was, that the intendments of Soveraigne Princes, specially such an action as that, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernd the incolumity and peace of all the Westerne world, the quenching of those fires in <hi>Rhenusium,</hi> the reinvesting of <hi>Carbasilis in Baccharia,</hi> which as it was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19794:68"/>
then given out, should be redelivered at the instance of the Lady <hi>Amira</hi> after the Match, to ingratiat her selfe thereby the more to the <hi>Druinians,</hi> besides a mighty advantage of commerce, <hi>for no Country is able to doe</hi> DRUINA <hi>more good and lesse hurt then Elaiana</hi>; I say what pity it was, that all this should bee frustrated by privat passions and interests.</p>
               <p>Another rub in the way, was the disaffection of those Ministers that were sent last to <hi>Druina</hi> to finish all things, especially <hi>one of them,</hi> and he the chiefest, whose heart did not go along with the businesse.</p>
               <p>It was also discovered that the <hi>Luranians</hi> (of whom multitudes subsist by the <hi>Olive,</hi> who if the businesse had taken effect had beene dismissed, and that Crowne disburdened of those Pensions they received, but they preferring to sticke there rather to a certaintie, then to seeke new fortunes, and begin the world againe in their owne Soyle) did no good offices in the conduct of this businesse.</p>
               <p>Besides 'twas thought the <hi>Ampelonian,</hi> and the <hi>Myrtles</hi> Ambassadors, with others there Resident, were not idle.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it had beene wished that some had had more <hi>Discretion</hi> joynd with their <hi>Zeale</hi> to this great businesse, which should have made them more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and reservd in their speeches and behaviour, and complied better with the humour of the <hi>Elaianians,</hi> against who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the poverty of that countrie, they would openly inveigh and gibe at, even in the Royall Palace.</p>
               <p>Some sayd, <hi>if they had left an eye behinde them in</hi> Elaiana, <hi>they would not come thither to fetch it againe</hi>; Others, <hi>that they would never returne thither unlesse it were to Conquer her</hi>; Others,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19794:69"/>
                  <hi>that they would never see her againe unlesse twere in a Mappe</hi>; Others would say, <hi>they thought there was no Resurrection out of her ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which puts me in mind of that <hi>boysterous Buffon,</hi> who sayd in the Royall presence of <hi>Elaianas</hi> Monarque, <hi>that his Master was nearest and likest to</hi> God <hi>Almighty of any King upon Earth, and being asked why? Hee answered that</hi> God <hi>Almighty had but onely one Sonne, and Hee was sent to bee Crucified by</hi> Iewes; <hi>And</hi> Druinas <hi>King also having but one, hee sent him to bee crucified by</hi> Elaianians.</p>
               <p>But for <hi>Rocalino</hi> himselfe, as <hi>Elaiana</hi> rings of the renowne of that <hi>heroique Enterprize,</hi> and will doe, to all Posteritie, so to this day his memorie and fame is fresh in that Court, for his sage and Princelie comportment, mixd with such a becomming gravitie, that it suted with the very genius of that Nation, where <hi>a Prince without gravitie, is said to be like a Peacock without a Tayle.</hi> Whence it may be inferrd, that though the maine busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse tooke not (which continues a darke kind of riddle to this day) yet <hi>Rocalino</hi> gaind much in poynt of honour, besides the mighty experience (<hi>which is the great Looking-glasse of Wisdome</hi>) he purchased thereby.</p>
               <p>Never was Lady so gallantly courted, no not <hi>Daphne</hi> her selfe (whom the amorous god converted to a <hi>Laurell</hi>) was woo'd with that braverie, and strength of affection, which was shewed with that fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, that <hi>Elaiana</hi> very poorely made use of it, to gaine time &amp; get stricter conditions; for as I heard one of them say, <hi>Love is like a P<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>e of Charcole, which meeting
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19794:69"/>
with the wind its contrary, makes it turne more ardent; Or like a rapid torrent which jusling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a damme swells higher; so love meeting with opposition growes hotter and stronger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a most unworthy thing it was, and which all the world cryed out at, to make this his heat of love, and comming thither, two acts which should have accelerated the businesse, to turne to his disadvantage. But it hath thriven with them accordingly, for it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd that their affaires up and downe the world ever since have thriven but very odly.</p>
               <p>After his departure it was disputed <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that affection whereof he had shewed such brave testimonies, was reall or no; howsoever it was granted by both sides, that <hi>Rocalino</hi> had purchased a high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of honour by it; for if it was reall, hee shewed himselfe to be a great master of his affections, that he could checke and call them home so soone; If it was otherwise, it discovered a high poynt of wisedome, to act the part of an Amorist so lively and pathetically<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Had that <hi>blind Greeke,</hi> one of the Muses first Priests, bin contemporarie to this heroique adventure, how proud had hee beene of so sublime a subject to heighten his fancie, a subject indeed <hi>adaequate</hi> to <hi>Apollo</hi> himselfe and his whole quire of Daughters; And I cannot wonder enough, that none all this while to whom <hi>Ex meliore luto finxit praecordia Titan,</hi> have not employed their Talent to this taske, considering the rarenesse, and richnesse of the matter.</p>
               <p>But to resume my discourse, <hi>Sophronio</hi> having received that foresaid new command from the Royall <hi>Oke,</hi> went to propound the entire &amp; speedy surrender of <hi>Baccharia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The OLIVE answered, that if a treatie
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19794:70"/>
would bee commencd with the</hi> Cedar, <hi>who was now Lord of it, and Hee, with the Elder, (but his Commisioners,) if hee came not to termes of conformity, hee would joyne armes with</hi> Druina <hi>to recover it, and for caution hereof hee would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage that rich Citie whither his fleet of treasure arrives yearely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this not satisfying, hee went to take his leave of</hi> Elaianas <hi>King, who had commanded Chenandra a little before to tell him in his name, that hee had receivd advise of his Revocation, and understood also by diverse advertisements, what clouds were engendring in</hi> Druinas <hi>Court, and in regard the envie which was drawne upon him proceeded from the labours and endeavours he had employed to finish the match, therefore he would hold himselfe much touchd in honour, if for this cause any should so prevaile against him as to cause his ruine or disgrace. Therefore he would write to</hi> Druina's <hi>King, and send a particular Ambassador, if neede requird, to represent the true state of things, in regard that</hi> Sophronio <hi>had servd him with that exactnesse of fidelity which was well knowne to the world, and to</hi> Elai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, <hi>in particular, that it deservd not onely to be assisted with all good offices, but it was fit to be rewarded, and published; And that the Royall</hi> Olive <hi>for the example of his owne subjects, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19794:70"/>
encouragement of those that did or hereafter should serve other Princes with that punctuality as</hi> Sophronio <hi>had done, had commanded him to offer him a blanke signd by the Royall</hi> Olive <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, wherein he might set downe his owne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both in point of title and fortune; And this hee did in no way to oblige another Prince his subject, but only as an encouragement to honest and faithfull proceedings, and therefore he would not make these offers in private but justifiable to the world, and would accompany all hee should doe, with a declaration, that this hee had done, was for the service hee had done his owne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophronio</hi> replied, that <hi>he was much afflicted to heare such language; and that hee desird it might be knowne and understood, that</hi> Elaiana <hi>was not any way beholden to him, for what ever he had done, he did it, for that he thought it fittest, for his Masters service and his own honour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any relation to Elaiana; And that he servd a Master from whom he was assurd of justice and due reward: And for those who were thought his enemies, hee knew their power to bee great, but hee servd so just a Master, that hee doubted not, but his innocency would prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any wrong, they should intend him; And though his own integrity would not give him leave
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19794:71"/>
to apprehend any kind of danger or disfavour from his said Master, and were he assured to runne into eminent danger, yet would he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe home to cast himselfe at his feete for mercy, and thereby comply with the duty and honour of a faithfull servant, then to bee the greatest of Elaianas Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I leave this mighty businesse for a Riddle (as I said before) both to the present and all future ages; <hi>For the bookes of Kings are written in darke Characters which few can uncypher, and their Actions like deepe foords, wherein Elephants may only swimme; Or as great Rivers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we see the course of the streame, but know not the source.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I leave also <hi>Sophronio</hi> preparing for his journey, and inexpressible it is, what a blacke kind of obstupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and regret all the world was possesd withall in <hi>Elaianas</hi> Court, specially the <hi>La: Amira,</hi> who, wee thought, would have turnd into one of the <hi>Heliades</hi> (those amber weeping-trees) for sorrow. Many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a reall love appeard from her towards <hi>Roca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino,</hi> amongst others one was, that she caused many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine duties to be performed for his safety in his returne to <hi>Druina;</hi> where being landed he fell down and kissd the very earth for joy; And being come to <hi>Thamisond,</hi> one would have thought that huge body composd of such numberlesse peeces had beene all one fire, and turnd to one flame from those huge piles of sacrifices of universall joy, notwithstanding those huge cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts of water that powrd downe from the meteors; But greater farre, and more ardent were those inward
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19794:71"/>
flames of gladnesse, wherewith all hearts did burn and sparkle to see their <hi>Rocalino</hi> againe. All mouths were full with <hi>Oken leafs and in the Wood so wide,</hi> &amp;c. with other such songs and catches of airie mirth; The very inanimat creatures as steeples and walles, did shake with joy, yea the very pavements and channels pledgd healths for this happie returne.</p>
               <p>Amongst other forren congratulations which came from farre and neare, <hi>CARBASILIS</hi> suddenly sent, but with this Complement,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That next to the hand of divine providence, he might thanke her, and her numerous graffs, that hee came so safely and freely backe,</hi> so that I cannot but deride their shallownesse, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of judgment, who thinke <hi>Elaiana</hi> had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to detaine him there.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Royall Oke</hi> summond hereupon a generall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, wherein by the relations of <hi>Villerio</hi> (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he for his own particular had little reason to love <hi>Elaiana</hi> ever after for some disrespects that had passd,) the two treaties, touching the alliance with <hi>Elaiana,</hi> and restitution of <hi>Baccharia</hi> were quite dissolvd by the unanimous vote of that great Assembly, not one dissenting from it, which made his Majestie say, <hi>That he thought they were led by one spirit, as the seventy Interpreters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And nothing could be more pleasing to the <hi>Drui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> then the rupture of these treaties, as the case then stood, for they were extreamely nettled to see the <hi>Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly standell</hi> of their Royall <hi>Oke</hi> returne from <hi>Elaiana</hi> with a <hi>branch of willowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor indeed did the <hi>poplars and coppices</hi> and vulgar sort of <hi>Druinas Trees,</hi> specially <hi>Thamisond,</hi> ever affect this match, for they were transported with such a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19794:72"/>
aversenesse to it, that whosoever did speake but in favour of it, or discoverd any good wishes to it, hee was presently held a Petropolitan, and to have <hi>swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a leafe of the Ivie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Petropolitans</hi> throughout all <hi>Druina</hi> were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly dejected and crest-fallen at these proceedings, and that matters went so crosse in <hi>Elaiana</hi>; And as it was observed to be an ill favourd augury, that a peece of the royall tarrasse fell under <hi>Mordogan</hi> at his first audience, when he came <hi>Hoc agere,</hi> when the treaty of alliance begun to be in serious agitation; so a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this dissolution of it, another fatall accident, or rather tragique presage fell out in <hi>Thamisond</hi>: For as the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> were in midst of divine exercise, and some say inveighing against the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> the Oratory suddenly tumbled downe, so that a great number of them were quashd to death by the very inanimat crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of stones and rubbish to the consternation of all the world.</p>
               <p>And this happened when they were a gogge and building of Castles in the aire, and at the height of their hopes, that by vertue of the said alliance, they should have a kind of liberty of conscience equall to a Toleration.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Royall Oke</hi> following the advise of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said great Counsell prepared for a warre, which quite <hi>turnd the match, to powder; Mars thrusts Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men out of dores, and Ianus gates flew wide open;</hi> Then which nothing could bee more thwarting and opposite, the one to his disposition, the other to his desires which had beene so vehemently carried that way for many yeares;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They promised to make him belovd at home, and feard abroad as much as any Prince that was,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:19794:72"/>
to which end they gave him round sommes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; A <hi>polemicall Counsell</hi> was erected for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the martiall affaires, and by the gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descent of Majesty they were to dispose of the pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary levies that were made to that end.</p>
               <p>As matters were reducd to this passe, behold a notable peece of machiavillianisme, formd and complot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against <hi>Villerio</hi> by the Soveraigne Ministers <hi>Elaiana</hi> had then in <hi>Thamisond;</hi> who in a private audience they desird to have of <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarke, undertooke to discover unto him a notable conjuration intended both against his royall dignity and person, which was; <hi>That</hi> Villerio <hi>with some of the Prime of his Counsell had consulted of the arguments and meanes that were to be taken for the dissolving of the forementioned treaties; And that their consultations passd so farre, that if the Majesty of</hi> Druinas <hi>King would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodat himselfe to their Counsels herein, he should have a house of pleasure where hee might retire himselfe to his sports, in regard that prime</hi> Rocalino <hi>had now yeares and parts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable for the publike governement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The royall <hi>Oke</hi> upon this imperfect overture, made many instances unto them that they would give him the Authors of so pernicious a conspiracy; but they instead of confirming the great zeale they pretended to beare him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the answer they made consisted of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments against the discovery of the Conspirators. Hereupon his Majesty commanded some of his <hi>secretst Counsellors,</hi> with others to be examind and sworne, and that such interrogatories should bee propounded unto
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19794:73"/>
them that were most pertinent to the accusation; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there was found in <hi>Villerio,</hi> and the rest who were impeachd a very cleare and sincere innocency, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these foule imputations.</p>
               <p>This being so, new instances were made to the said Ambassadors, that they should not prefer the discovery of the names of the conspirators to the security of his royall Majesty, the truth and honour of themselves; and the hazard of an opinion to be held the tracers of a plot of such malice, sedition and danger; But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers continued in a knobby kinde of obstinacy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving still to conceale the names of the Authors.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarch sent <hi>two of his sages</hi> to tell them, <hi>that they being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of an accusation so pernicious, had rendred themselves incapable to treat further with him, and were it not for the respect he bore to</hi> Elaiana's <hi>King whose person they did represent, hee would and could by the law of Nations and the right of his owne Royall Iustice proceed against them with such severity as the offence deservd, but for the reason aforesaid hee would leave the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof to the justice of the Royall Olive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of whom he would demand and require it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon the Soveraign Minister who was then employed in <hi>ELAIANA was commanded to require refaction and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction against the Informers or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors and forgers of the aforesaid mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information, which was of that quality,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19794:73"/>
that it was sufficient to put impressions in him of perpetuall jealousies, in regard that through</hi> Villerio, <hi>they did wound Prince</hi> Rocalino, <hi>and the best of his subjects; for it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that</hi> Villerio <hi>would have hurld himselfe into such an enterprise without communicating of it first to him, yet notwithstanding the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> Oke <hi>would not mingle the correspondence and friendship he holds with the Majesty of the</hi> Olive, <hi>with the faults and offences of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, but leave them, and restraine them to themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things being represented to <hi>Elaianas</hi> King, he seemd then to be somwhat sensible of them; but when the aforesaid Ministers were returnd, they were onely confind for a few daies: but afterwards instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension they were rather rewarded and further em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Royall <hi>Oke</hi> who all his life time had continued in a constant calme of tranquillity, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that al the circumjacent <hi>Forrests</hi> were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in fearefull combustions about him, and had beene the gracious Vmpire of so many Soveraigne quarrels (glorying in the attribute of peacefull (and might bee said to have bin the <hi>Caducean Rod</hi> which composd and charmd all dissentions twixt other Princes) was feld by the dire hand of fate, being newly plungd in a war against <hi>Elaiana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the very time that hee <hi>sprouted</hi> first above ground, he was pursued with treasonable practises, and his tutelar Angell still mervailously garded him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor was there ever any Monarke upon earth

               <p>Never any Country flourished more in the <hi>Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> part of justice, as did <hi>Druina</hi> in his time, specially the first tenne yeares, in which space, besides other places, <hi>THAMISOND</hi> did so enrich her selfe, that shee gathered more than she had done in thirty yeares before.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi>A Prince endued with such a strength of vertue, that he seemes to strike malice dumbe; A Prince of whom it may be sayd, that he hates the very names of those vices that are incident to Princes, more then other Princes hate the vices themselves. He was well balancd, and of a growth just ripe for this mighty burden, having newly taken the vest of virility, and being reard up to a comely cleane timbred strong bulke, wonderfull active and patient of toyle; And if forren travell begets wisedome in regard the eye, which hath a more immediate commerce with the soule, and is a faithfuller witnesse then the eare; Hee is the best traveld Prince by the Sea and Land of any, and therein hath the advantage of his neighbours.</hi>

                  <hi>Most tenacious he is, of his purposes, when they have beene pondred, and layne long in the ballance of mature deliberation, and winnowed by the debate of his sages. But above all things else (and indeed all things else are but bables to this) hee is most punctuall in his pietie to heaven; so that take all this together, this inference will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, that if hee were, but one of the ordinary vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar plants, they that know aright, would judge him to be one of the compleatest, and most vertuous of all</hi> Druina.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:19794:76"/>But the Crown which descended upon him was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed with so many difficulties, that it might be justly calld a Crowne of thornes for many yeares; For after a long calme of peace, hee was left newly engagd in a war against one of the greatest of earthly Monarchs, and (as it was said of one of his progenitors) <hi>with a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie sword, and empty purse,</hi> the Crowne being fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bottomlesse pit or gulph of debt, besides his own former arreares;</p>
               <p>The moving fortresse which are the chiefe strength of <hi>Druina</hi> were in slender repaire, his magazines of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition ill supplied; The Lady <hi>Carbasilis</hi> with her numerous issue were to bee provided for, and hee was left to seeke for a spouse for himselfe.</p>
               <p>But by the speciall favour of heaven, hee hath sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all these difficulties and brought the glory of <hi>Druinas</hi> diademe to cast a greater splendor then ever it did. Touching a royall Consort, the high hand of providence, reservd for him such a one, that there <hi>never sprung up above ground a more beauteous or approaching nearer some celestiall deity; for through those starry casements of her soule, one may discerne in her a kind of divinity trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending the race of mortals, so that in this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian Vine, the saying of the wisest of Kings may be verifyed, That a good Wife, is a Tree of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This young royal <hi>Oke</hi> being now setled in his throne, he sends <hi>Villerio</hi> to visit the disconsolat <hi>Carbasilis,</hi> and to confirme a league defensive and offensive with the <hi>Willowes his fast friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He suddenly sends a mighty fleet against <hi>Elaiana,</hi> but the Critickes of those times abroad, said, <hi>this fleete so
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19794:76"/>
quickly riggd shewd rather the power then providence of Druina,</hi> yet she returnd without any passive encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all.</p>
               <p>He employes two of his <hi>noblest Elmes</hi> to treat of an alliance with that peerles peece of natures rarities, the <hi>Lady Aretine,</hi> which great businesse by their wise and successeful negotiation was concluded in fewer <hi>months,</hi> then <hi>Elaiana</hi> spent <hi>yeares</hi> in her treaty; so that the <hi>La: Aretine</hi> was entitled by holy rite, QUEENE of <hi>Druina,</hi> which shee would not accept of, unlesse shee had the title of <hi>Ampelona's</hi> QUEENE also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>youngest spray</hi> of the great martiall <hi>Vine</hi> came to <hi>Druina,</hi> with a great masse of ready treasure, and a <hi>row</hi> of her owne Country <hi>Graffes</hi> for her first <hi>sett</hi> of servants; But they misdemeaning themselves by some fond fopperies of superstition in prejudice of the <hi>La: Aretine</hi> her health, and for other morall mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariages were suddenly dismissd and sent backe to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona</hi> with bagge and baggage, all their salaries being punctually payed them to a penny, and many of them parted with rewards;</p>
               <p>Though a very <hi>moderne Chronicler</hi> traduceth <hi>Druina</hi> in this point, to have dismissd them without their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as in this, so in many other relations hee takes up things upon trust; and imperfect partiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A grosse defect in a royall Chronologer, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can it be judgd whether his faults in this kind, or flatteries throughout the whole body of his story, bee grosser; And whereas history should bee the torch of truth, hee makes her in diverse places a fuliginous linke of lies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:19794:77"/>The renvoy of the <hi>Ampelonians</hi> was ill taken by the <hi>Royall Vine,</hi> and the suddennes of the action did much aggravate the businesse, with the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, being for the most part <hi>younger Graffes,</hi> having parted with what they had in their owne soyle to take <hi>rooting</hi> and grow up in <hi>Druina</hi> about the <hi>Lady Aretine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon these distasts the voyaging Marchants pillage one another, as they found advantage, yet the two Kings stirrd not a good while after; <hi>For it is with Kings sometimes, as with Porters, whose packs may justle one against the other, yet they remaine good friends still.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after <hi>DRVINAS</hi> Monarke convokes an universall Assembly;</p>
               <p>To whom, <hi>He declard to have calld them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the safety of Religion, for securing his kingdomes and subjects at home, having two such mighty Monarkes his actuall enemies, for the assisting of his Allies and Confederates abroad, specially the Royall Firre, who had lately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkd himselfe very far in open war against the Cedar principally in behalfe of Prince</hi> Altapinus, <hi>and was reducd to wonderfull streights, being chasd out of a great part of his dominions, by the</hi> Cedars <hi>Generall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For these with other important motives hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a supply of Treasure.</p>
               <p>These things at first overture were well resen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the lower assembly, who with much alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie agreed to a good round supply, and indeed <hi>it was the greatest gift that ever subjects gave KING,</hi> but before it was brought to any sound perfection,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19794:77"/>
this good worke was unluckily disturbd by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of questions concerning the <hi>priviledge</hi> of the subject, and <hi>prerogative</hi> of the Soveraigne; by which delayes the reality and reputation of that great <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> was much lessened, and the forren actions, the <hi>Royall Oke</hi> was engagd in abroad receivd much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Yet he did formally confirme unto them all their ancient priviledges, and gave two most gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to their petitions tending to this end: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving complied with them thus to their hearts desire, as also in two former Assemblies wherein were delivered them as sacrifices some of the <hi>Crowne Officers,</hi> and done them sundry other Acts of Princely grace, yet some extravagant spirits given over to fancy, and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, disturbd the calme of these proceedings.</p>
               <p>They fall like thunder upon <hi>Villerio, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging that he was the cause of the incongruity in government at home, and of disasters abroad; That he was the first that deflourd the Virgin ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, making her a kinde of prostitut, and meere marchandise salable for white and redde earth, which is too base a price for her, that should be the prime guerdon of vertue, through whose temple only, there should be a passage to hers. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of his exorbitant power, having in his hands the privatst and most reposefull offices of trust, by sea and land, &amp; such as were incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and never known in the person of one subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They cry out that none received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement but his progeny, which they termd the tribe of fortune, with other high clamours:</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:19794:78"/>
Thus hee who in their former meetings was a great subject of their commendation, when for dissolving the two Treaties with <hi>Elaiana</hi> they said he had done so well, that <hi>he deservd to have his statue publikely erected in the midst of Thamisond,</hi> became now the chiefe subject of their complaints and grievances.</p>
               <p>But the rayes of Royall Majesty reverberated so strongly upon <hi>Villerio,</hi> that they dispell'd all those clouds, which did hang over and thus obumbrat him, and the rather because <hi>Evidence, which is the lanterne of of the Law,</hi> was wanting, these accusations having no other proofe but publike fame.</p>
               <p>In these times a warlike fleet was prepar'd against <hi>Ampelona,</hi> in regard the <hi>Vine</hi> had not performd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine capitulations, that were promised the Royall <hi>Oke</hi> in favour of the <hi>Eusebians</hi> there, besides one moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Lady Aretines</hi> dower was not sent according to Article, with other provocations and secret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
               <p>The enterprise fayling, though the first Invasion (and would heaven had pleasd the retreat had beene answerable) was made with as brave a resolution as any martiall attempt could possibly be, and in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Souldier <hi>Villerio,</hi> with the rest, shewed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable assurances of valour: yet the Royall <hi>Oke</hi> was not a whit daunted hereby, but presently commanded a greater number of vessels of warre to bee riggd and made ready in pursute of the same designe, upon which <hi>Villerio</hi> was to goe <hi>Generalissimo</hi> againe; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon point of embarking, this great Commander having at his becke such a multitude of martiall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits was suddenly cut off, to the consternation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of all the world, by a fatall stroake which was given him with a small contemptible instrument, and with such an admirable advantage, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19794:78"/>
either by slight or art, or strength of engine, to dispatch one sooner out of this world; And which made the act more tragicall, his noble Consort, then pregnant, beheld him thus felld, and weltring upon the ground presently after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus fell that procere goodly faire timberd Elme in the fulnesse of his strength, who had so long flourish'd under the gracious branches of two Royall</hi> Okes, <hi>having led halfe his life in that height of fortune, and affluence of all earthly pleasure; who being thus fallen, many infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Trees grew great out of his boughs, In so much that the saying of the</hi> Philosopher, <hi>who being askd, what was a doing in heaven, answerd,</hi> Magnae ollae franguntur, &amp; ex frustis ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum minores fiunt, <hi>mought have beene not improperly applied to what then passd in</hi> Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina. <hi>Out of this sad Catastrophe may bee drawne this lesson, That great ones may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselves from guilt, but not from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, which like the Sunne-beames beates upon rising grounds, and towring high Trees, when the shrub is safe.</hi>

                  <hi>He had a concurrence of all those gracefull parts, that might attract Princely love, and conduce to the accomplishment of a Courtier, and had hee containd himselfe still in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19794:79"/>
hee might happily have lasted untill time had covered him with hoary mosse.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Royall Majesty which first tooke him into favour, agenid and traind him up for his own turne by certaine degrees in the most pertinent affaires and Mysteries of State, observing therein the progresse of nature which suffereth no motion to passe from one extreme to another, but by intermediat spaces, as she useth to passe from Winter to Summer by the interposition of the spring, and so returne to Winter by Autumne: so that Platonike Prince servd himselfe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pawses to advance and employ him; And hee was no improper peece to worke upon, having so pliable and gentle a genius, that he grew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pregnant and dextrous in the art of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Among other maximes of policy he proposd to himselfe in the conduct of his affaires, one was to neglect apologies, whereof he said, he saw no other fruit then to multiply discourse, and humour the vulgar, nor did he ever value any pasquils that were dropd up and downe, so farre, as to thinke them worthy of his revenge, which questionlesse was a well</hi> settled <hi>Rule,</hi> for <hi>Libels neglected quickly finde their owne graves; and dissipat to ayre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee was none of those Idolaters that worship
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19794:79"/>
the beast with many heads, that use to burne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to the vulgar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as herein, so in many other things, great abilities appeard in him, for extraordinary must be the wisdome of him who floateth upon the streame of Soveraigne favour, wherein there is seldome any sistence, twixt sinking and swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. A sure friend he was, and a resenting foe, a brave Master to servants, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrer of the least good office; For his stocke; he transplanted most of them to plentifull soyles. And doubtlesse hee had a brave soule to actuat that comely composure; And an innated valour appeard in him, when hee put himselfe upon the Souldiers defense as he receivd the mortall stabbe. I will conclude with part of a Character that a judicious</hi> Cavalier <hi>gave lately of him; Hee was a great example of Sobriety and temperance, but not of continency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Assassin</hi> that feld him found oftentimes strong and strange reluctancies in himselfe, nor could hee give any other reason that pushd him forward to this black attempt, but <hi>that he was blasted by the great Assembly, and so thought it an act agreeable to heaven to take away the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall betweene the King and his people, and make him a sacrifice to the publike, though with an unavoydablenesse of his owne destruction,</hi> confronting thereby death in the face; Whereby was verified that saying, that he <hi>who is carelesse of his owne life, is master of another's.</hi> But Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forbid that this custome which hath such a vogue
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19794:80"/>
in other parts, should take footing in <hi>DRVINA.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This tragedie being acted, the Royall <hi>Oke</hi> pursueth his designe for supporting of <hi>Petrina,</hi> with the <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> in <hi>Ampelona,</hi> but this disaster as it bred confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the time, so it causd a stand in the procedure of that great action, which gave the <hi>Vine</hi> respit to finish those stupendous circumvallations and barricadoes hee had reard up by sea and land to begirt <hi>Petrina</hi>; In so much that when another noble <hi>Elme</hi> was sent with strength sufficient to have achievd a greater exploit, he found her passd cure.</p>
               <p>This some say went to the very heart of <hi>Elaiana,</hi> who in regard of that notable advantage, and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of united power the <hi>Vine</hi> got hereby, would have found some way or other to have relievd <hi>Petrina,</hi> had she thought <hi>Druina</hi> would have missd it.</p>
               <p>The great Assembly aforesaid rejoynd, and mett againe in one body, and now he that was supposd to be the cause of the tempest being throwne overboard, there were great hopes a calme should ensue, but the storme continued as furious as ever, and unlucky pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions blustred as much, if not more, than they had done formerly in <hi>Villerios</hi> time.</p>
               <p>They flew a fresh upon other great Officers and questiond a duty, that for garding of the seas, and common defence of the realme had beene indisputab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted to so many preceding Kings for a <hi>bene esse,</hi> which they made difficulty to affoord the Royall <hi>Oke</hi> regnant, unles he would first renounce alright to it, and so receive it meerely from them. Thus they <hi>choppd lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke</hi> with Soveraigne Majesty who movd with these traverses, resolvd though to his unutterable griefe to dismisse this great Counsell, but upon the point when this was to be done in forme, the lower assembly in a strange tumultuary manner adjournd themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19794:80"/>
they had receivd his royall pleasure. They <hi>denied him his Officers at armes, violated the prolocutor, being twise sent for, delayed to let in his messenger, and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments</hi> turning thus to a strange kind of <hi>disobedience,</hi> they broake up in confusion.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto that notwithstanding there was another peculiar Assembly of <hi>Reverend Yewes</hi> of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for the regulating and sweeping cleane of the house of the Almighty, yet the <hi>poplars</hi> must make it their office to tamper with the constitution of holy things; And indeed this is one of the greatest scandals and brands, that not only <hi>Petropolis,</hi> but other Forre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (who have with her forsaken <hi>Petropolis</hi>) cast upon <hi>Druina. viz.</hi> that her Ecclesiasticall Ordinances are the commands and injunctions of this secular power, and members of this Assembly, who not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme (which may become them well enough, and is necessary for a generall obedience) but take upon them to be <hi>Iudges</hi> herein. So that one being askd what they did in that lower great Assembly, hee was answerd pleasantly, <hi>That they were making of a new Creed;</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was over-heard to say, <hi>that hee could not bee quiet in his Conscience, untill the holy text should be confirmd by an Act of theirs.</hi> Whence may bee inferrd, that some of them beleeve, it belongs to them to make <hi>sanctions,</hi> as well as <hi>statutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This inducd the Royall <hi>Oke,</hi> though he be respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to none for an account of his actions but to the high Majestie of Heaven, to publish an open protest unto the world, for the satisfaction of his better sort of subjects, of the causes of these disorders, declaring <hi>that while</hi> Villerio <hi>liv'd, hee was intitled to all the distempers and ill events of former as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, therefore much endeavour was usd to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19794:81"/>
demolish him as the only wall of separation twixt their Soveraigne and them, but he now being cut off, no alteration was found amongst them at all, or calmenesse in their proceedings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was pleasd to declare further, <hi>that he imputed not these commotions to the whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, knowing that there were amongst them, many religious, grave and well minded Patriotts, but the sincerer and better part of them being over-borne by the clamours and practises of others, who carelesse of their duties, and taking advantage of the times and his necessities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straind him to breake off that meeting, which had it beene answerd with like duties on their parts, as love on his, might have prov'd happie to all</hi> Druina.</p>
               <p>These fatall distempers as they did much hurt to the body politicke at home, <hi>for they were like humours stirrd in the naturall body without evacuation,</hi> so did they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce disadvantagious effects abroad, and better had it been that the Raysers and fomenters of them had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>sprang</hi> up in <hi>Druina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Royall Firre</hi> had engagd himselfe in the quarrell of <hi>Altapinus</hi> against the <hi>Cedar,</hi> and he had proceeded so far as to the imminent and actuall danger of his owne person. And expecting from <hi>Druina</hi> those monthly supplies which were promised by capitulation, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for want of them, the one halfe of his territories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already over-runne and plundred, hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straind to shuffle up a peace with the <hi>Cedar</hi> (without <hi>Druinas</hi> privity.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:19794:81"/>And it was high time for him, for <hi>whereas the Firre was usd to bee a dwelling for the stork, the Eagle was like to build his nest there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The foresaid great expedition to relieve <hi>Petrina</hi> did also suffer hereby, and indeed the whole party of the <hi>Eusebians</hi> every where up and downe the world, who had their eyes fixd upon <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarke <hi>their defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</hi> Who so much labouring to take the old wonted great <hi>trodden</hi> way, for supplies towards the support of such publike designes, was constraind at last to take the <hi>higher roade,</hi> by having recourse to his Soveraigne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to ballast the common purse of the state;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And a kingdome is like a Shippe at Sea, whose ballast should be the Princes Coffers; which if they be light and emptie, she will do nought but tumble up and downe, nor can she be made to run a direct and steddy Course.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time fell one of the noblest <hi>Elmes</hi> in the whole <hi>Forrest,</hi> extracted of the ancient stocke of the <hi>Monticolians,</hi> that bore the smallest, yet chiefest <hi>staffe</hi> of office and command in <hi>Druinas</hi> Court; And his fall was the more remarkable, because the night im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before he was discoursing of, and slighting the art of those foolish Astrologers, and <hi>Genethliacall Ephemerists,</hi> that use to pry into the horoscope of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities, whereof one had much tampred with his, and positively affirmd he should not reach 51. yeares, And now said hee, I have liv'd (thankes bee to Heaven) fiftie one yeares and a day compleat, But the next morning hee was taken with an Apoplexie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he presently died; much lamented hee was, for <hi>his noblenes, and mervailous candor of dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19794:82"/>
and other brave endowments, and therefore generally belov'd in Citie, Court, and Country.</hi> And being a long time averse to the match with <hi>Elaiana Mordogan</hi> put a shrewd pernicious complement upon him; For being at a private audience in discourse with <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarke, hee fell to magnifie the greatnesse, loyalty, and wealth of his subjects; and specially of this noble <hi>Elme, who had such rooting in the hearts of the poplars, that upon any faction, or tumult, he</hi> verily thought <hi>he could draw after him all the Trees of the Forrest.</hi> But this was spoken of purpose to make some impression of jealousies in the breast of Majesty.</p>
               <p>As these traverses happened in <hi>Druina,</hi> behold <hi>Bumelias King the Martiall Ash, holding himselfe to bee much affronted by the</hi> Cedar <hi>in that he would vouchsafe no audience to his Ambassadors, and that hee encroachd upon the Territories of his ALLIES;</hi> As also for some preventive reasons of state; He cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth those cold Seas, and rusheth into <hi>Rhenusium</hi> like a whirlewind, carrying all before him though with small numbers at first, not exceeding 7000. Yet like a ball of snow tumbling downe a hill, hee still gatherd strength as he passd: and made <hi>Chips</hi> of all the <hi>Trees</hi> he met withall. Hee restored <hi>two</hi> of his said <hi>Allies</hi> to their entire possessions, and proceeding further, and being dared as he was a Cavalier by that great <hi>Veteran Captaine</hi> then the <hi>Cedars</hi> Generall (who the day before had shrewdly shaken the <hi>plane) to meete him in pitchd field;</hi> He answerd <hi>that he was something more than a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, and that he had thousands under him as good as that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19794:82"/>
Generall himselfe, therefore he would not fayle to finde him out speedily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day he kept his word and gave him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, where hee carried away as faire and compleat a victory as possibly could be, and thereby he freed the <hi>Planes</hi> Country from the impendent dangers that hung over it.</p>
               <p>He marchd still on, making his passage by the point of the sword every where, He crosseth the great River that denominates <hi>Rhenusium,</hi> upon whose bankes hee kept his festivals in an admired triumphant manner in one of the chiefest <hi>Archflamins townes,</hi> whither Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours resorted unto him from farre and neare, as if he had beene some <hi>Cesar.</hi> The Royall <hi>Vine</hi> being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasd that he had crossd that great River, and invaded the Territories of the Church (whereof he had taken the protection) without his privity, sent to tell him by his Ambassador;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That if he did not stand to his Articles, he had an Army of</hi> 80000. <hi>to enter into</hi> Rhenusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um <hi>when hee pleased. The magnanimous Ash answerd, that he had not infringd the least tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of what was articled, that they aymd at one marke, and their ends were concentrike, and he knew how to make his way in</hi> Rhenusium, <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he could tell him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And touching the</hi> Archflamin <hi>in whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis hee then kept his Court, hee had broke promise both with the Royall</hi> Vine <hi>and him, by ceasing to bee neutrall; As for the menace hee sent, if</hi> Ampelona <hi>had</hi> 80000. <hi>to rush in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19794:83"/>
to</hi> Rhenusium, <hi>be had</hi> 20000. <hi>and with them he would be sooner at the walles of Tutelia, then those</hi> 80000. <hi>could be on the frontiers of</hi> Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusium.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he made himselfe master of <hi>Baccharia,</hi> but to re-invest <hi>Altapinus</hi> there, hee would have tied him to hard, and indeed to very harsh termes; first, <hi>That hee should make no leavie of Military forces, without his consent. That he should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with so many thousands upon his owne charge during these warres; that hee should still reserve</hi> two <hi>of the chiefest Townes of</hi> Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria <hi>in deposito, where hee might put in garrison to be maintaind by the contributions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; That hee should make no league or confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with any other, without his privity and consent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there should bee free exercise of the Bumelian Religion throughout all Baccharia, and an Academy, and Schooles erected to that end. That he should acknowledge, under God, to have receivd his Country from him; with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse other such restrictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that <hi>noble stout Elme</hi> whom the Royall <hi>Oke</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at that time in <hi>Rhenusium</hi> in a high quality, of purpose to observe his motions, would not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend hereunto.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Bumelias</hi> King breakes his way to the <hi>Elders</hi> Court, where he <hi>shooke</hi> him ill favouredly for the time, ranging through the very bowels of his Country, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19794:83"/>
plundring all wheresoever he came, as farre as his very cells and clossets.</p>
               <p>But as no violent course lasteth long, this irresistible torrent of his tropheys was stoppd by the dire hand of destiny, so that in the throng of his owne victorious troupes, this martiall <hi>Ash</hi> was felld, the <hi>greatest</hi> of his <hi>enemies</hi> whom hee most redoubted for his valour, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before in his sight. So that, as in life, so at, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death he provd a Conqueror, falling upon the <hi>bed of honour and victory both at once, in a party colourd field Gules and Argent, but the crest Sable, so</hi> that it was impossible for a Souldier to bid the world farewell, in a braver manner.</p>
               <p>His fall for the present strucke an earth quake into all minds, nor could the vulgar bee inducd a great while to beleeve that he was feld, thinking him to bee impenetrable, and above the stroake of fate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Heroicke Prince he was, and in such a height, that it was said the soule of</hi> Caesar <hi>had entred into him; So that some thinke he sprung of the race of that</hi> Tree, <hi>whereof</hi> Achilles <hi>speare, and</hi> Hercules <hi>Club were made, only hee was taxd to bee over-ventrous and head-strong; besides there were some, that observd him, to bee somewhat elated by that monstrous course of conquering, but as</hi> Adrianas <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour apologizd for him, He had been more than a mortall wight, if he had not been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what altered at the successe of such high feates, which were such, that considering the quality of the Country, Townes, and enemies, none of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19794:84"/>
the twelve</hi> Caesar <hi>acts, paralleld his in so short a time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will relate a thing worthy of wonder; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others who receivd contentment at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>Warlike Ash, Melissanus</hi> the great <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamin</hi> would be often inquisitive, and well pleasd to heare of any successefull encounter of his against the <hi>Cedar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some thinke the reason was, in regard the <hi>Cedar</hi> had a little before disturbd the peace of <hi>Bombicina,</hi> and joynd with <hi>Elaiana</hi> to kindle a new fire in her, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was well contented to see him a little shaken. Others say, there was some secret tye, that if the <hi>Ash</hi> should compasse his designes in <hi>Rhenusium,</hi> he should assist <hi>Melissanus</hi> to recover <hi>Hipparcha,</hi> (which the <hi>Olive</hi> hath so long detaind from <hi>Petropolis)</hi> as a reward for his neutralitie: Hereupon when there was a great Contracto in the holy Senat, at the time when the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars</hi> and <hi>Olives</hi> Embassadors demanded pecuniary sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies out of the holy treasure for the support of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in <hi>RHENVSIVM</hi> and preventing the further <hi>spreading of the ASH,</hi> the <hi>IVIE</hi> himselfe answered, <hi>That he was satisfied Religion was neither the subject nor scope of those Warres; And that the holy treasure, was to bee reservd, and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued for holy uses, and not misapplied to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto one of the prime members of that high Senat, replying, <hi>That the Ivie for his coldnesse in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars quarrell was traducd abroad for halfe an Hereticke,</hi> he was taken up very short, and adjudgd corrigible for such presumptuous language.</p>
               <p>Amongst many others, which had obligations to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19794:84"/>
the martiall <hi>Ash,</hi> the <hi>Plane</hi> receivd no small benefit by him; for hee preservd his Country three severall times from impendent and actuall danger; but it seemes he quickly forgot him, for after his fall hee shuffled up a peace with the <hi>Cedar</hi> in which the <hi>Bumelians</hi> were quite excluded: And it had beene wishd, that the princely <hi>plane,</hi> (though allowed his sprincklings of wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the <hi>Arbolists</hi> observe <hi>it is more naturall to him, and makes him thrive better than any other Tree)</hi> had in these traverses beene lesse wavering, and not suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be <hi>shaken with such incertaine blasts: for I cannot tell how often he put in, and pulld out his pin from the stake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the adventrous <hi>Ash</hi> survivd that fatall, yet victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, day he fell on, many think the <hi>Cedar</hi> was so far <hi>shrunk</hi> that he had beene put to very hard shifts to have made head against him to any purpose againe. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his progresse was such, that both sides stood at a stand, gazing and doubting where his conquest would terminat. And had he brought his intents home to his ayme, he would have cast the policy of the lower world into a new mould, and happily have put his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to stand upon their gard; And as for many others, so had it not been wholesome for <hi>Druina,</hi> that his acquests had extended further, which makes mee, that I cannot wonder enough at the shallownesse and impertinent zeale of the vulgar sort in <hi>Druina,</hi> who were still so eager, and joyfull to heare him still goe on, and carried away with such an ignorant devotion for his successes, when it little concernd their religion or security. Amongst divers others who rejoycd and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphd at the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>war-like Ash,</hi> the <hi>Elder</hi> lifted up his hollow <hi>boughs,</hi> so high, that a little after he took heart of grace to court one of the <hi>youngest</hi> sprayes of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall <hi>Cedar</hi> for his Consort, though in point of age he quadrupply exceeded her, being cauterizd in foure
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19794:85"/>
severall places about his body to have vent for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humors, wherewith it seemes he much aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, specially towards Prince <hi>Altapinus,</hi> who was one of the nearest to him in <hi>stocke;</hi> Besides his young Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort was <hi>sprung</hi> as close to him, and as neare as could be out of his own <hi>stemme.</hi> Yet neither disparity of yeares, nor propinquity of stocke, could hinder the designe policy had herein, but he carried her cleare away;</p>
               <p>And what fruit can be expected of this <hi>inoculation, but blacke unsavourie berries,</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> onely to make the tartest <hi>Viniger,</hi> such as the <hi>ELDER</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beares.</p>
               <p>And what fruit also the <hi>beech</hi> will produce by his late <hi>ingrafting</hi> upon the other <hi>spray,</hi> though in a farre ignobler way, (having by letters and instruments) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted a <hi>Princely Graffe,</hi> which as farre precels her, which hee hath lighted upon, as a <hi>Damaske Rose doth the Couslip</hi> in natures workemanship, <hi>quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi,</hi>) I had rather expect then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
               <p>But these kinde of <hi>infolliations</hi> wresting so farre the lawes of nature, have seldome prov'd prosperous; I know not what they may doe upon this moderne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke race, which as she pretends to have mounted to this might and largenesse by these meanes, so shee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on, to ciment her designes, and fortifie her selfe still by this course; But some of the best <hi>geneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liacall Arbolists</hi> observe, that though these unequall <hi>imbuddings</hi> may flourish for a time, they will <hi>fade</hi> away at last by a fate, that unavoydably useth to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them.</p>
               <p>Before the lowest of the celestiall bodies had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishd her monthly course, <hi>ALTAPINVS</hi> also fell, who had beene a companion to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Ash</hi> in many of his exploits through <hi>Rhenusium;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19794:85"/>
A Prince who by a hard destiny, became a tennis-ball a long while to the blind Goddesse; A Prince in whom many vertues did co-habit. He was free from that vice</hi> Rhenusium <hi>is so naturally addicted unto, where the custome is so generall that it takes away the conscience to be peccant therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Very sedulous hee was in the pursute of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, parsimonious and wonderfully indulgent of his young Cions, and the glory of her sexe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basilis, who though</hi> Homebias <hi>Crowne was lost, yet by her Princely comportment, shee got then another kingdome which shee retaines e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since, as may bee inferrd out of her name;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For at the beginning of these unlucky traverses, shee wisely turnd her selfe (though <hi>sprouted</hi> naturally of the <hi>Oke</hi>) into a <hi>palme,</hi> and with a more than feminine cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage tooke for her motto ever since,
<q>—Sub mole resurgo.</q>
For it can hardly bee judgd, whether her various sorts of pressures, or patience were greater.</p>
               <p>Many brave adventrous spirits fell for love of her; amongst others I cannot forget, the high-hearted martialist <hi>Brunonio, who first lost his lands, then one of his chiefest limbes, and lastly his life in her quarrell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can I omit here a <hi>Noble Elme</hi> sprung up in the streets of <hi>Tamisond,</hi> who hath beene a most constant and resolute Adventurer, and conversd with danger a great while for her, though with extraordinary expence, the late losse of his libertie,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19794:86"/>
and many traverses of apparant hazard, even to the admiration of the <hi>Ash</hi> himselfe, and envie of others.</p>
               <p>Not long before these times, there being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable overtures made on all sides; The <hi>Royall Oke</hi> renewed a peace both with the <hi>Vine</hi> and the <hi>Olive,</hi> twixt whom there passd many shockes; for the <hi>Olive,</hi> the worst that <hi>Druina</hi> suffered was, that she exchangd <hi>Coales for Sugar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now behold a glorious serenity of peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in <hi>Druina,</hi> having had two of her potentst neighbours upon her backe at once.</p>
               <p>It hath beene a maxime often verified in policy; <hi>That Kings may marry, but not their Crownes,</hi> and never was this more exemplified, then by the alliance of those Princely <hi>sprayes</hi> that <hi>sprung</hi> of the last great Martiall <hi>Vine,</hi> who notwithstanding that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves there were never any in whom sweetnesse of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and vertue her selfe was more resplendent in such a degree, as if the three graces had contributed their utmost power to make them good; yet I know not by what fate or fortune t'is come to passe, there have fallen out diverse traverses of Warre, since the <hi>inarching</hi> of those <hi>graffes,</hi> upon the <hi>Olive, the Pine, and the Oke;</hi> Which yet continueth, and is daily exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twixt the <hi>Olive</hi> and the <hi>Vine,</hi> who though at first, they crossd one anothers designes by sending auxiliary forces in collaterall wayes, they doe now directly and in good earnest, <hi>clash their branches one against the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the justnesse of their quarrell, I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake here to debate it; nor determine whether a just feare without any active invasion or offence bee sufficient grounds to <hi>Ampelona</hi> for a warre, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may deserve the name of a defensive. I have reade that the true cause of the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> Warre
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19794:86"/>
(though they were blanchd with other specious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours) was the over-growing greatnesse of <hi>Athens,</hi> which did as it were impose upon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> a necessity of armes; Preventive Warres have beene practised by the best policied states, they <hi>rid the Forrest</hi> oftentimes of <hi>superfluous plants</hi>; and are as a purge for the body politicke: And in all ages it hath beene held a maine part of providence, to have an eye,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That their confining neighbours, should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by too neare an approach, or encrease of territory , or enfeebling of confederates, nor by ingrossing of trade, or stopping of passage, receive any addition of strength, And in point of wealth to beare up still in equall proportion, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enhancement of the rates of coyne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescence of demeanes, or imposition of tolls;</hi> This makes the <hi>Vine</hi> so <hi>Salt</hi> his subject, and the <hi>Olive pepper</hi> his so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The lawfulnesse of warre in the generall was never questiond,</hi> so it have a Soveraigne head, <hi>not otherwise. For the Almighty is the God of Hosts and armes, as well as of peace; And warres well grounded are nought else but sutes of appeale to the consistory of heaven, when there is no superior on earth to determine the cause:</hi> And besides the lawfulnesse hereof, there seemes to bee a kinde of inevitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and necessitie in it; <hi>Some Philosophers were of opinion, that the world doth subsist by a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19794:87"/>
perpetuall strife in some part or other, I goe not above the concave of the Moone, where the celestiall bodies, though in relation to us (poore mortals) they seeme to strange, and have their contrary motions, eclipses and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet amongst themselves they are in a most regular, and constant sweet course of concord; But for the elementary world, all things are in a kind of restlesse conflict; The Elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which are the primitive ingredients of all bodies, are in perpetuall combat, they still encroach one upon another, and labour to repell each other, but amongst the rest the fire is most vigorous and ravenous, the earth hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fits of the Palsie, the Sea is never still, the aire is agitated with winds, and new monsters and meteorologicall impressions are hourely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred; so in humane bodies composd of this stuffe, there is an incessant warfare amongst the humours for predominancy, and while this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall war lasteth, the earth cannot be without civill and politicall preliations, the mind fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing most commonly the temper of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a madde tenet it was of the <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> (in that divine and high soaring Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher) <hi>that peace is but a naked and empty name, a kinde of</hi> Chymera, <hi>and that every
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19794:87"/>
state expects but its advantage to set upon the skirts of the other, whence hee concludes, that there is alwayes a kinde of fermentation of warre, and no kinde of reall love and league betweene Princes, but only an impuissance or inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to doe hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An age there was, and t'was the last, when <hi>Druina, Ampelona, and Elaiana</hi> were so circumspect, and Eagle eyed, that scarce an acre of ground, could bee gotten by either of the three, but the other two would bee sure to doe their best, to set the scales even again. And the like diligence hath beene practised in diverse other Regions, and it seemes is now by <hi>Ampelona,</hi> by reason of the late new acquests the <hi>Olive,</hi> and his race in <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusium</hi> have made; which induceth her to sticke more close then ever to <hi>Itelia,</hi> as also to the <hi>Bumelians,</hi> who else I beleeve had gone neere to have quite disbanded long before now.</p>
               <p>The Princely <hi>Sycomore</hi> which stood as a <hi>screene</hi> twixt <hi>Ampelona and Rhenusium</hi> hath smarted for this, being fallen just under the same fatall predicament, as <hi>Altapinus</hi>; both exulating from their owne patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Territories.</p>
               <p>But a hard case it seemes to bee, that the Princely <hi>spray</hi> which was of the selfe same <hi>ancient stocke</hi> with the <hi>Sycomore,</hi> being <hi>branches</hi> of the same <hi>Tree,</hi> should in the <hi>verdantst</hi> season of her virginity, bee coupled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true rites of sacred law, with <hi>Ampelonas</hi> apparant heire, and then, poore Lady, to bee aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned without the least imaginary fault of hers;</p>
               <p>And more strange it seemes to the world, that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona,</hi> specially that now her prime Minister of state is of a holy function, should goe about to preferre a particular temporary custome of hers, <hi>viz</hi> that her
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19794:88"/>
Heire apparent should not any wayes dispose of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to marriage, without the privity and consent of the State, to the prejudice and flat breach of the eternall law of the Almighty: And so to attempt the nullifying of that act, and loosning of that knot which by divine Ordinance should bee indissoluble; And so make a kinde of <hi>medlar</hi> of that Princely <hi>Sycomore,</hi> shee being every way superior to his first Consort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true, policy is warrantable, yet but as a hand-maid to divinity, and absurd it is to make the Mistresse stoope and give place to the servant; Policy is like the Apocrypha, which is allowed to be digested into one volume, and read with the sacred Text, but when it thwarts any thing that is Canonicall, away with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ravishing of the <hi>Sycomore's</hi> Country, hapned in an unlucky time for young <hi>Altapinus,</hi> for, I beleeve, it rendred the Treaty for a restitution of <hi>Baccharia</hi> more knotty and difficult; In so much that some think they must be put in Counter-scales hereafter, <hi>and move both upon one hinge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A much famed statist Elaiana</hi> had halfe an age since, was usd to say, that if <hi>Ampelona</hi> had three things fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, she were eternall, viz. <hi>Petropolis, the Sea, and Counsell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the first, <hi>Melissanus</hi> who now swayes the great <hi>Archflaminship,</hi> is mightily devoted to her, having beene so long rooted in her, that it seemes he naturally affects her soyle and plants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And oftentimes we finde that nature her selfe yeelds to custome, that great Giant, who is so prevalent, that oftentimes, wee shape the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19794:88"/>
discourse of reason, and course of nature to the inbred notions and preconceptions it hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in our minds, besides, habituall frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of conversation is one of the greatest load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones of love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Sea, Itelia</hi> serves her for her docke and Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, nor was shee ever so improv'd and potent that way; And I wish <hi>Itelia</hi> may never have cause to rue the time she did it.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Counsell,</hi> she hath lighted upon an <hi>Instrument of a mervailous contriving and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous spirit, as solid as hee is subtile, which is rare under that Clime, In so much that some have termd him the prodigie of prudence, others have soard higher, and calld him the grand Genius, and tutelar Angell of</hi> Ampelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>others flie yet higher, and call him the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Intelligence, the spirit that moves the heavens and the starres, the Phoenix of the earth, and such like superlatives, and Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is so strongly <hi>rooted</hi> in the opinion of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Vine,</hi> that hee post-poseth <hi>filiall,</hi> and <hi>fraternall love,</hi> to his favour towards him.</p>
               <p>Some give other Characters of him, and call him the <hi>Incendiary of Ampelona, that his mind is of the colour of his habit, sanguine</hi>; That he is indued with the same spirit, that sometimes a famous <hi>Archflamin</hi> in <hi>Elaiana</hi> was, who said <hi>that Gunpowder in the field gave as sweet a perfume, as Incense at the Altar</hi>;</p>
               <p>This makes him keepe such a stirre with Drum and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19794:89"/>
trumpet up and downe in many places; yet though that humour sutes with the colour of his <hi>Coat,</hi> it doth not I am sure with his calling. Nor because hee hath got a <hi>peculiar title</hi> to distinguish him from others, should hee be so farre elated with that <hi>Eminency</hi> as to expect priority of place of such high Ministers, who immediately represent Soveraigne and independent Majesty, and if hee be <hi>stout</hi> in this point, he must give them leave to be <hi>stately.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for his intermedling with armes, hee is the more excusable, because many others of his Coat in these times are not only martiall directors, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Actors in open field, making <hi>Tents</hi> their <hi>Temples,</hi> and singing <hi>Te Deum</hi> with the noise of the Canon, so that those Warres which are now in motion, may be calld <hi>The holy Warres,</hi> being directed and managed most, by such Ministers.</p>
               <p>And here I will insert a late passage of a great <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Governor, and the oldest Martialist of Ampelona,</hi> who comming to visit a great <hi>Archflamin,</hi> that is now a Navall Generall, <hi>Hee sent to desire him to have a little patience, for hee was dispatching some Captaines and other Officers, who were to goe presently to Sea upon a designe of consequence.</hi> The provinciall Governour staying not, the <hi>Archflamin</hi> went the next day to excuse himselfe to him. The <hi>Veteran</hi> Governour hearing hee was there, sent <hi>to desire him to stay a little, for he was newly entred into a peece of</hi> Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> de Civitate Dei, <hi>and as soone as he had read it over, he would attend his Reverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to give <hi>Ramundas</hi> this prime Minister of state in <hi>Ampelona</hi> (for that's his title) his due, (and I honour him the more, because the first great act hee did when hee came to the helme was the alliance with <hi>Druina</hi>) The Royall <hi>Vine</hi> hath done notable feates by the strength of his Counsell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:19794:89"/>He hath debelld the <hi>Eusebians</hi> who formerly stood upon the strength of their own gard, having sundry maritime and inland Forts, and places of fastnesse for their security, but they are brought to subsist now meerely by his mercy, having no other assurance for their safety, but his pleasure.</p>
               <p>And it seemes hee easily dispenseth with himselfe to performe, what his two immediate predecessors were bound by sacred tie, and Article to observe. For hee hath declard long since,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That what the one did, hee did it out of feare; what the other, his great sire, did, he did it out of love (though he had his eares often stoppd with Cotton at their petitions) but for his part, hee neither lov'd them, nor feard them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it must bee granted, this was one of the greatest weakenesses <hi>Ampelona</hi> had, for foren Princes and some of her owne Grandees, servd themselves of the <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> as of <hi>matches</hi> to set her on fire within dores at pleasure.</p>
               <p>The ancient <hi>Elmes</hi> that lifted up their heads so high in their governments, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> some held as confidently as if it had bin their inheritance, and so lessened the opinion of the vassall to the Soveraigne, he hath remov'd, and placd therein <hi>inferiour Trees,</hi> not of so ancient <hi>a stocke,</hi> whereof some are trienniall, others during pleasure.</p>
               <p>Hee hath mervailously enhanc'd the revenues, and perquisits of the Crowne, to many millions more than it was, though with a pitifull excoriation of the poorer sort, so that from 14. they are mounted to 20. millions in the last estimat that was made.</p>
               <p>He hath clammerd over the huge neighbouring hils, making his way by the swords point, and setled one of his owne vassals, though opposd by the <hi>Cedar</hi> and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19794:90"/>
                  <hi>Olive</hi> to be one of the Soveraigne Princes of <hi>Bombyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and in the passage seiz'd upon the territories of the Princely <hi>Pine</hi> who made halfe resistance, but having effected his purpose, he freely surrendred it, yet reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving still to himselfe a <hi>key to enter Bombycina</hi> at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Hee hath disturbed the passage <hi>Elaiana</hi> had got through the <hi>vale,</hi> from <hi>Bombycina</hi> to <hi>Rhenusium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath so scourgd the <hi>Sycomore,</hi> who had offended him, that hee hath sent him to wander up and downe for another soyle to <hi>plant</hi> himselfe in.</p>
               <p>Hee hath regaind, though with infinite toyle and treasure those <hi>Islands Elaiana</hi> had a while <hi>rooted</hi> her selfe in neere <hi>Bombycina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, to bring you nearer home, he gave the <hi>Olive</hi> many smart <hi>knockes</hi> when hee thought to have <hi>planted</hi> himselfe in the <hi>confines</hi> of his Country, which provd too hot a soyle for the <hi>Elaianians,</hi> which made one of them to leave <hi>behind</hi> this motto upon the walls of a forsaken Fort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Ampelonians, if we had been such as the world takes us to be, and you such as you have beene wont to; be our deeds had beene yours, and yours ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These high feates the <hi>Vine</hi> hath done since he was <hi>proppd</hi> by this <hi>Genius</hi>; And behold lately a mighty blessing droppd downe from heaven upon him, and all <hi>Ampelona, viz.</hi> a rare masculine <hi>branch</hi> sprung out of him, and the lovely <hi>Olive,</hi> his Royall mate, after twenty three yeares <hi>inoculation,</hi> which hath transformd all the world to wonder. So that <hi>Ampelonas</hi> great Queene may answer her teeming neighbours as the Lionesse did the Fox, who reproaching her of sterility and such slownesse in breeding said, t'is true, I breed
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19794:90"/>
slowly, but what I bring forth is a Lion; the application is obvious; And I hope the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> will be graciously pleasd to make this inexpected regall late offspring a <hi>Prince</hi> of peace, that his birth may quash all farre fetchd reaches of ambitious policy, and put Christendome in a new mould of peace, least, besides those parts wherein she is already stucke, shee feele in other of her members, the <hi>prickles</hi> of that huge <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> who hath it for the prime part of his Letany, <hi>That intestine warres bee still fomented twixt Christian Princes</hi>; And good reason hee hath to pray so, <hi>for the greatest armes hee ever usd against them were their owne divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is <hi>Druinas</hi> Monarch destitute of prudent and strenuous Counsell, though he need it not so much, for he can see better without spectacles; Nor is his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour like that of the <hi>Vine,</hi> and <hi>Olive's</hi> ingrossd all by one, but every one of his prime independent Ministers is his Favourite within the bounds of his own Office; Hee hath an Intelligence to every spheare, amongst whom he diffuseth his beames, according as they shall move in a regular motion every one in his owne Orbe, and stand subordinate to him their <hi>primus Motor; And indeed, as the systeme and symphony of musicke is not made by one or two, but diversity of strings and notes, so politicall harmony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the correspondence of the greatest Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and their unanimous resolution after some conflict of opinions, for as fire breaks out of flint by concussion, so wisdome and truth issueth out of the agitation of argument.</hi>

                  <hi>Tamisond</hi> never flourished more with <hi>building</hi> and <hi>bullion,</hi> and bravery of all things. Her great Sanctuary, the greatest take all dimensions together, of any in the <hi>Europaean</hi> world, which by the iron teeth of time and injury of the meteors had so mouldred away, that she was upon point of being reducd to her first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, a confusd <hi>Chaos</hi> of stone and rubbish, is like to looke as youthfull as ever she did;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the Eagle built his nest, every bird brought in a feather; And certainely a good spirit cannot dwell in him, who grumbles to send a stone towards the bearing up of the House of the Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth <hi>Tamisond</hi> encrease this way by houses, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces or streets onely, but she hath a whole <hi>new Towne</hi> reard up lately to enlarge her skirts; And whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, her walls were of light combustible matter, they are now of a new solid structure and stuffe.</p>
               <p>Though some would thinke, <hi>that in regard she drawes on in this kind so much to the West, she is towards her decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning times; and they</hi> ground this augury upon the height of bravery and profusenesse shee is come to, which commonly bring with them, luxury and softnesse, and <hi>they have beene alwaies observed to be symptomes of a wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing state.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For navall strength, since <hi>Druina</hi> sate in <hi>Thetis</hi> lap, and had her white cliffs washd with her waves, she was never so well appointed; Not long since, the world thought shee had beene fallen to so low an ebbe, that she was not able to set out a fleet Royall to Sea, which made some so insult over her, that they questiond her Soveraignty, yea in her owne waves; But lately shee hath appeard like her selfe, and put them all to silence,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19794:91"/>
unbeguiling the world of this erroneous opinion.</p>
               <p>The late <hi>moving Castle</hi> she hath built, hath already purchasd such renowne; that it is confessd by all her neighbours, there never floated the like upon salt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>She hath restord a <hi>Forren Emperour</hi> to his right; <hi>And it is the duty of Soveraigne Princes, to see wrong vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and right take place though amongst Barbarians being sought unto</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And besides the glory of that action, there is a speciall benefit accrues thereby to <hi>Druina,</hi> for that nest of base ravenous birds which so much impeachd her commerce is pulld down, and many of her own <hi>plants,</hi> who languished in that hot scorching soylein most miserable slavery, brought home.</p>
               <p>They cannot therefore have their hearts well planted in them, who repine at such contributions which the sages of the law have once avouched legall, since they daylie see such necessary and glorious effects thereof;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the (legall) leavies the Soveraigne raysers of the subject, are as vapours which the sunne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hales up into the middle Region (the wombe of the Meteors) which fall downe afterwards in sweet silver showres to fructifie the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The golden chaine of policy hath beene alwayes held to be, That the defense of a kingdome is the <hi>office of the Prince, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Peeres, the service of the Souldier, and the charge of the subject, for</hi> Qui sentit commodum, sentire debet &amp; onus.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto, that <hi>alleageance is an act of reciprocation; as it bindes the King to protect,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19794:92"/>
so it ties the subject to contribute, and by this correspondence there is a</hi> quid pro quo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But as in</hi> Druina, <hi>so in all other Forrests, it is usuall for the Poplars to clash their bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and still make a noise at the present times and soloecismes, in government, though they know neither the disease, nor the remedy. They think to discerne the least moat in the body politicke, building certaine fantasticke formes of ruling, and soothing their shallow imaginations, that they could set the state in such frames, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application whereof would prove absurd and grosse impertinencies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching <hi>eminent</hi> or <hi>imminent</hi> danger, though there be some <hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> in every state, which the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and his sages should onely know and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse amongst the vulgar, It was apparently visible, how the fairest <hi>flower</hi> of <hi>Druinas</hi> diademe, the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Seas was aymd at, and like to be pluckd off, was it not high time then for her to rigge her ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and put her selfe upon an extraordinary gard?</p>
               <p>Moreover they are far wide who think <hi>Druina</hi> can joyne security and peace together, as long as the <hi>Olive</hi> with the <hi>Cedar</hi> and the <hi>Vine</hi> are up in actuall armes by Sea and Land hard before her, for a peace may bee clapd up betweene them with that suddennesse, that some of those forces which are now in motion may inexpectedly fall upon her skirts. Touching <hi>Ampelona</hi> some have beene over-heard to say that the late invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon her Islands for reliefe of <hi>Petrina</hi> stickes still in her stomacke but halfe disgested, thinking she hath not repaird her honour to the height, nor taken equall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19794:92"/>
according to the rules of retaliation, by that successefull repulse only.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Elaiana</hi> some hold (though I do not) never yet made hearty peace with any <hi>Eusebian</hi> Prince, and the peace she makes proceeds either from <hi>disability</hi> or <hi>unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonablenes</hi> to hurt. And since she holds the <hi>Canons</hi> of the last great <hi>Counsell</hi> (whither t'was said <hi>the holy Ghost was usd to be sent in cloake-bagges from Petropolis</hi>) in so much reverence and authority as the sacred Oracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves which were immediately inspird from heaven, of which Canons one was, that <hi>Haereticis (meaning the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebians) non est tenenda fides</hi>; since I say that <hi>Elaiana</hi> stands so readily appointed and so neare, it would very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the policy of <hi>Druina,</hi> to let her vessels lye rotting upon the Carine, and not to be ready upon a preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive gard, least she re-incurre that aspersion which in former ages stuck fowlly to her, <hi>which was to be wise, a posteriori, after the blow was given, when Hannibalis</hi> Ante Portas.</p>
               <p>And now that all the neighbouring Forrests, which had been formerly <hi>shaken,</hi> and <hi>riven</hi> with the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts of war, did admire and envie the sweete peace and serenity of <hi>Druina,</hi> her Royall <hi>Oke</hi> being onely

Behold an unhappy <hi>mist</hi> did rise in the North in <hi>Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> (and <hi>Cardenia is knowne to bee much subject to mists.</hi>) Some say <hi>Cardenia</hi> hath the same quarrell to her <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,</hi> that she hath to the <hi>Sun</hi> for dwelling too far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from them: but it was discovered that this cloud was engendred of the exhalations of divers disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted spirits, specially some of the great ones, who did sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citat the inferior sort of <hi>Flamins,</hi> that depended upon them for their subsistence to vent seditious doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and chiefest governours in holy things, fearing that by a post-liminous way something
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19794:93"/>
should bee re-annexd both to Church and Crowne, which had alwayes beene possessd by them time out of mind.</p>
               <p>These obstreperous Sermocinators (who in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denia</hi> sway as much, if not more, upon the conscience then the <hi>Loyalists</hi> else where doe) make easie impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the minds of the vulgar, specially the femalls who first broak out into acts of violence, <hi>so that it may be said this sedition came in, as sin did first into the world, by the female sexe,</hi> who relying upon the immunity of their kinde, did many unbefitting and strange barbarisms, little tending to the honour of <hi>Cardenia,</hi> And with these the meaner sort of mechanikes concurd, and at last the <hi>tallest Elmes</hi> appeard, so that the whole <hi>Forrest</hi> was in a fearefull combustion, and the Bels every where rung backward, the <hi>Regalia</hi> seizd upon, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thrust quite of the <hi>hinges.</hi>

The meaner sort of the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of sacred Oracles (who of all other, were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test monsters of ingratitude to their Soveraigne (who had found out a way not long before to augment and a scertaine their stipends, and free them from that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile kinde of clientele they stood in to the seculars) in lieu of pious documents and wholesome doctrines tamper chiefly with matters of state, and out of a fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique zeale minister more fuell to encrease the flames;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>they cryed out that the ready way to return to</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis,

                  <hi>was, to passe by</hi> Druina; <hi>that her forme of publike prayer (though they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the first Compilers thereof to bee glorious Martyrs) was meere Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This little tended to the honour of <hi>Cardenia,</hi> for all her neighbours cryed out against her, that shee should cast such a brand upon the <hi>Eusebian Religion,</hi> as to loose all respects of <hi>passive obedience,</hi> if need had bin, (<hi>for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects should be willowes, and not Okes)</hi> and to stand in open defiance and armes against their naturall liege Lord; And where people runne together and joyne in armes (bee it for defence or offence) without a Soveraigne head, I know what <hi>terme</hi> it deserves, all the world over. The sages of <hi>Druina</hi> consult how to quench these flams. Some were of opinion, that, all the while they broak not out into incursions by land, or depredations at Sea, nor tooke in forren force, nor did any externe act of violence; it was not dishonourable for <hi>Druina,</hi> to look on a while, yet pinch them in commerce every way, and to be sure to keep them at the staves end. <hi>Bombycina</hi> hath a saying, That <hi>the Prince, who upon every commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the subject, rusheth presently into open war, is like him who sets his owne house a fire to roast his egges.</hi> Kings have many wayes to meet with their people, besides <hi>effusion</hi> of bloud, and <hi>profusion</hi> of treasure, they have long reaches.

               <p>And now will I put a period to this parley, this Iargon of <hi>Trees,</hi> for I can find them no further matter of discourse, unlesse I should make them to prophecy, and so out-runne their <hi>Epoch.</hi> Many more things could have beene couchd here (as a discerning Reader may well perceive) which I leave to future ages, and transmit to the post-Nati, <hi>when the times shall be enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizd, and posterity manumitted: For there be some Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall truths, which are like the Medlar not ripe enough (to be written) till they be rotten</hi>: Nor was this shadow of <hi>Trees</hi> darke enough for them, it being my intention at first not to pursue or presse this <hi>allegory</hi> so farre as to inslave my matter unto it, and so put it in a kinde of <hi>stockes,</hi> but that I did obtaine leave of my selfe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by obvious and easie expressions to comply with the Readers capacity; Otherwise hee might have

thought it to have beene some senselesse phantasticke Romance, which might have brought him to that passe, that he could not have beene able as hee went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to have seene the <hi>Wood</hi> for <hi>Trees;</hi> No, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that I labour to bring him often into the <hi>Plaines,</hi> and that I was very carefull to shunne the <hi>bogs,</hi> for they are dangerous, and <hi>there is no state without them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I hope this <hi>knotty ill twisted</hi> peece, will passe current without <hi>exception, offence</hi> or <hi>calumny;</hi> and that my impartiall dealing will serve for a <hi>Pale</hi> to <hi>fence</hi> out the Goats from my <hi>Forrest,</hi> though I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse there may some few criticismes or graines of browne salt, and small dashes of vineger be found here and there, to make the discourse more sapid, but this tartnesse is farre from any <hi>gall</hi> or <hi>venome,</hi> wherewith the pages of some <hi>Moderne Authors</hi> of our next trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marin <hi>neighbours</hi> do usually swell, and are yet exposd to vent by publicke authority though they writ flat and plaine without any disguise at all; I presume you have tasted no such bitternesse here, albeit I might have done it with more priviledge and good manners, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under <hi>types.</hi> No; you shall find no <hi>blacke</hi> satyres range in my woods; if there bee any, they are <hi>white</hi> harmelesse ones, and drawing neere to the nature of Fayries.</p>
