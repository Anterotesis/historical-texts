            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </head>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have now perused, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Manuscript you sent me; it had contracted many and great Errours in the Transcription, which I have corrected: I was enabled to do it by a written Copy of the same Discourse which I have had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years in my Hands. The Subject is of great and weighty
<pb facs="tcp:34594:4"/>
importance, and the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Truths here asserted and made good, will lay a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for right conceptions in the Doctrines that concern the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God, For the first Errour, which is the ground of the rest, is, That things are good and just, because God Wills them so to be; and if that be granted, we are disabled from using the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken from natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Attributes and Perfections of the Divine Nature, against the Blackest and most Blasphemous Opinions that ever were entertained concerning Gods proceedings with the Sons of Men. If there be no settled Good and Evil, Immutable and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on any Will or understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then God may have made
<pb facs="tcp:34594:4"/>
his reasonable Creatures on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to damn them for ever. He may have absolutely decreed that they should sin, that he may damn them justly; He may most solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earnestly prohibit Sin by his Laws, and declare great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against it; and yet by his ineluctable Decrees Force men to all the sin that is committed in the World: He may vehemently protest his unfeigned desire of their Life and Happiness, and at the same time, secretly resolve their Eternal Destruction; He may make it his Glory and Pleasure to triumph eternally in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of poor Worms, which himself hath by his unalterable and irresistible Will made mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; yea (as the discourse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth) he may after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
<pb facs="tcp:34594:5"/>
concerning the Salvation of the Elect, after the death of his Son for them, and the missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Spirit to them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the promises he hath made to assure them; thrust <hi>them</hi> also at last into the dreadful Regions of Death and Woe; I say if there be no immutable respects in things, but Just and Vnjust, Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Dishonourable, Good and Cruel, Faithful and Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are respects made by meer arbitrarious will, it will be in vain to dispute from Them against any such dismal Opinions: yea it will be great folly to argue for the Simplicity of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture against the vile conceits of the old <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> and the Blasphemies of the present <hi>Muggletonians,</hi> of God's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:34594:5"/>
a Corporal shape, Parts and Members, if there be no necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Independent Connexion, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity, Spirituality and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but this being establish'd, that there are immutable respects in things, and that such and such are Perfections, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Defects and imperfections, hence it will follow, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible the forementioned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines can be true concerning God, who <hi>cannot lye,</hi> cannot <hi>deny himself: viz.</hi> He being Absolute and Infinite Perfection, cannot act any thing that is Evil or imperfect; But all the expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions in Scripture, that at first sight look towards such a sense, must be interpreted by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Analogy</hi> and course of them, which declares his Infinite, Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:34594:6"/>
Excellencies; and these No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of himself, which he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the Souls of Men.</p>
                  <p>So that the Subject of this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Discourse, is of vast Moment, and the truth asserted in it, is, I think confirmed with an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable Strength and force of Reasoning; and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by it, will argue either great weakness of Vnderstanding, in not perceiving consequences that are so close and plain, or great obstinacy of Will, in being shut up by prejudices, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiv'd Opinions against Light that is so clear and manifest.</p>
                  <p>The Author was a Person with whom I had the Honour and Happiness of a very particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; a man he was of a clear Mind, a deep Judgment
<pb facs="tcp:34594:6"/>
and searching Wit: greatly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the best sorts of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, old and new, a thoughtful and diligent Enquirer, of a free Vnderstanding, and vast Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, join'd with singular Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and unusual Sweetness of Temper, which made him the Darling of all that knew him: He was a Person of great Piety and Generosity; a hearty Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of God and Men: An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Preacher, a wise Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a profound Philosopher, a quick, forcible, and close Reas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and above all, a true and exemplary Christian. In short, he was one who had all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of a <hi>Primitive</hi> Bishop, and of an extraordinary Man-This I say not out of kindness to my Friend, but out of Justice
<pb facs="tcp:34594:7"/>
to a Person of whom no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation can be extravagant. He was bred in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Fellow of <hi>Christ's</hi> Colledge, where he lived in great Esteem and Reputation for his eminent Learning and Vertues; he was one of the first that overcame the prejudices of the Education of the late unhappy Times, in that Vniversity, and was very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental to enlarge others. He had too great a Soul for the trifles of that Age, and saw ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the nakedness of Phrases and Phancyes; He out-grew the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Orthodoxy of those days, and addicted himself to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Learning and Theology, in which he even then became a great Master.</p>
                  <p>After the return of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:34594:7"/>
the excellent Bishop <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> foreseeing the vacancy in the Deanery of <hi>Connor,</hi> sent to <hi>Cambridge</hi> for some Learned and Ingenious Man, who might be fit for that Dignity: The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made to Dr. <hi>Rust,</hi> which corresponding with the great Inclination he had to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with that incomparable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: He gladly accepted of it, and hastn'd into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he landed at <hi>Dublin</hi> about <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust 1661.</hi> He was received with much Respect and Kindness by that great and good Bishop, who knew how to value such Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; and preferr'd to the Deanery as soon as it was void, which was shortly after. He continued in that Preferment during the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Life, always dearly lov'd,
<pb facs="tcp:34594:8"/>
and even admir'd by him.</p>
                  <p>At his Death (that sad stroke to all the Lovers of Religion and Learning) he was chosen for the last solemn Office to his deceased Father and Friend; and he preach't such a Funeral Sermon as became that extraordinary Person and himself. It hath been since published, and I suppose you may have seen it, upon the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Death of Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> which hapned <hi>August 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1677.</hi> The Bishopricks were divided: Dr. <hi>Boyle</hi> Dean of <hi>Cork,</hi> was nominated Bishop of <hi>Downe</hi> and <hi>Connor;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Rust</hi> Dean of <hi>Connor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dromore;</hi> he lived in the Deanery about six years, in the Bishoprick but three; for in <hi>December 1670</hi> he dyed of a Fever (in the
<pb facs="tcp:34594:8"/>
prime of his years) to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable grief of all that knew his Worth, and especially of such of them as had been blest by his Friendship, and most sweet and indearing Conversation: He was buried in the Quire of his own Cathedral Church of <hi>Dromore,</hi> in a Vault made for his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> whose sacred Dust is deposited also there: and what Dormitory hath two such Tenants?</p>
                  <p>This is the best account I can give you of the Work and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: and by it you may perceive his Memory deserves to live, and this Product of him: but there is so much reverence due to the <hi>Manes</hi> of so venerable a Person, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be hastily published under his honour'd name: I know,
<pb facs="tcp:34594:9"/>
had he designed this Exercitation for the Publick, he would have made it much more compleat and exact than we now have it: But as it is, the Discourse is weighty, and substantial, and may be of great use. As it goes about now in written Copiesit is, (I perceive) exceedingly depraved, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being still worse abused; the Publication would preserve it from further corruptions. However I dare not advise any thing in it, but this, that you take the judgment of that Reverend Doctor you mention (the deceased Authors Friend and mine,) and act according as he shall direct. I am,</p>

                  <head>A DISCOURSE OF TRUTH.</head>
                  <p>TRUTH is of aequivocal sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be defined before it be distinguish't. It is two fold; Truth in <hi>things,</hi> which you may call Truth in the Object: and Truth in the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> which is Truth in the Subject. By the first I mean nothing else but that Things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily are what they are: By the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond that there are mutual respects and relations of Things one unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

Now that Things are what they are, and that there are mutual Respects and Relations Eternal, and Immutable, and in order of Nature antecedent to any Understanding either created or uncreated, is a thing very plain and evident; for it's clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the <hi>Meridian</hi> Light, that such Propositions as these, <hi>Homo est animal rationale, Triangulum est quod habet tres angulos,</hi> are not arbitrarious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancies upon the Will, Decree, or Understanding of God, but are Necessary and Eternal Truths; and wherein 'tis as impossible to divide the Subject, and what is spoken of it, as it is for a thing not to be what it is, which is no less than a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and as indispensible are the mutual respects and relations of things both in Speculatives and Morals.</p>
                  <p>For can it be imagin'd that every. Argument can be made a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Medium</hi> to prove every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that Any thing may be a suitable means to Any end? that any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34594:10"/>
object may be conformable to any Faculty? Can Omnipotence it self make these Propositions that twice two are four, or that Parallels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intersect, clear and convincing Arguments to prove these grand Truths, <hi>That Christ came into the World to dye for Sinners, and is now exalted as a Prince and a Saviour at the Right Hand of God?</hi> Is it possible that there should be such a kind of <hi>Geometry,</hi> wherein any problems should be demonstrated by any Principles; <hi>quidlibet ex quodlibet;</hi> as that a <hi>Quadrangle</hi> is that which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of four right Lines: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the three Angles of a Triangle are equal to two right ones?</p>
                  <p>Can the infinite Wisdom it self make the damning of all the Innocent &amp; the unspotted Angels in Heaven a proportionate means to declare and manifest the unmeasureableness of his Grace and Love, and goodness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them? Can Lying, Swearing, Envy, Malice, nay hatred of God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34594:11"/>
and goodness it self, be made the most acceptable Service of God, and the readiest way to a mans Happiness? And yet all these must be true, and infinitely more such contradictions than we can possibly imagine, if the mutual respects and relations of things be not Eternal and Indispenfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: which that they are, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove; and in order to it</p>
                  <p>First, we must premise that Divine <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> cannot be the Fountain of the Truth of things; nor the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the references of one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For it is against the Nature of all Understanding, to <hi>make</hi> its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; it is the nature of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>ut moveatur, illuminetur, forme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> &amp;c. Of its Object, <hi>ut moveat, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminet, formet: Intellectus in actu primo</hi> hath its self unto its object, as the Eye unto the Sun; it is irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, inlightned and actuated by it: And <hi>Intellectus in actu secundo,</hi> hath its self unto its objects, as the Image to that it represents; and the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34594:11"/>
of Understanding consists in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actuated by, and in an adaequate Conformity to its object, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of all Idea's, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Representations of things. The Sum is this, No Idea's or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations are the things they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present; all Understanding is such; therefore no Understanding doth <hi>make</hi> the Natures, Respects and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of its Objects.</p>
                  <p>It remains then, that absolute, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarious and independent <hi>Will</hi> must be the Fountain of all Truth; and must determine the References and Dependencies of things: which asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would in the <hi>First</hi> place destroy the Nature of God, and rob him of all his Attributes. For then it's impossible that there should be such a thing as Divine <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> which is nothing else but an apprehension of common notions, and the natures and mutual respects and relations of things. For if the Nature of God be such, that his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34594:12"/>
arbitrarious imagination that such and such things have such and such natures and Dependencies, doth make those things to have those Natures or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies, he may as easily Unima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Imagination; and then they that before had a mutual Harmony, Sympathy and Agreement with one another, shall now stand at as great a distance and opposition. And thus the Divine Understanding will be a mere Protaean <hi>Chymaera,</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Conflux of intellectual Atomes: Contradictions are true, if God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands them so, and then the foundation of all Knowledge is taken away, and God may as truly be said to know nothing as every thing; nay, any Angel or Man may as truly be said to know all things, as God himself; for then every thing will be alike certain, and every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension equally conformable to Truth. These are infallible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and a thousand more as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd as these, if contradictory Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34594:12"/>
may be both true: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be so or no, it's a meer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Dependance upon the Arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleasure of God, if there be not a necessary immutability and eternal opposition betwixt the being and the not being of the same thing, at the same time and in the same respect. Likewise all those Truths we call <hi>Common Notions,</hi> (the Systeme and Comprehensions of which, is the very Essence of Divine Wisdom; as the conclusions issuing from them, not by any operose deduction, but a clear intuitive light, are the very Nature of Divine Knowledge, if we distinguish those two Attributes in God) I say, all these propositions of immediate and indemonstrable Truth, if these be only so, because so understood by God, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by God because he pleased so to have them, and not because there is an indispensible relation of Harmony and Proportion betwixt the Terms themselves; then it is a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34594:13"/>
thing meerly casual, and at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God to change his former apprehensions, and Idea's of those Truths, &amp; to make their contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as Evident, Radical and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental as themselves but even now were; and so Divine Wisdom and Knowledge will be a various, fickle and mutable thing, a meer tumult &amp; confusion: all these consequences infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly flow from this certain Principle, that upon a changeable and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cause, Effects must needs have a changeable and uncertain Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. And there is nothing ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable in it self more changeable and uncertain than <hi>Will</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the dictates of Reason and Understanding.</p>
                  <p>If any deny these Consequences and Deductions, because they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that God is mutable and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; I answer, by bringing this as another absurdity, that if there be no indispensable and eternal respects of things, it will rob God of his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34594:13"/>
Immutability, and unchangeableness: for if there be no necessary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt <hi>Vnchangeableness</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> what should hinder, but that if God please to <hi>think it so,</hi> it will be his perfection to be change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and if <hi>Will,</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> be the only principle of his Actions, it is infallibly his Perfection to be so. For 'tis the perfection of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to act according to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of its Nature, and it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an arbitrarious Principle to act or not, to do or undo upon no account but its own will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; to be determined, and tied up, either by it self, or from abroad, is violent and contranatural.</p>
                  <p>And therefore from this Principle, that absolute and soveraign Will is the Spring and Fountain of all Gods Actions, It was rightly inferr'd by a late <hi>Pamphliteer,</hi> that God will one day damn all Mankind, Good and Bad, Believers and Unbelievers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his Promises, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34594:14"/>
or Engagements to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; because this damning all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in despight of his Faithfulness, Justice, Mercy and Goodness will be the greatest advancement of his <hi>Soveraignty, Will</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> imaginable. His words are, <hi>God hath stored up Destruction both for the Perfect and the Wicked, and this does wonderfully set forth his Soveraignty; his exercising whereof is so perfect, that when he hath tied himself up fast as may be, by never so many promises, yet it should still have its scope, and be able to do what it will, when it will, as it will:</hi> here you have this principle improved to the height. And however you may look upon this Author as some new Light, or <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of the times, yet I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you in some pieces by him set forth, he is very sober and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, to deny the mutual respects and <hi>rationes rerum</hi> to be immutable and indispensible,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34594:14"/>
will spoil God of that <hi>universal recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> which is the greatest Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Nature: for then Justice, Faithfulness, Mercy, Godness &amp;c. will be but contingent and arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Issues of the Divine Will. This is a clear and undeniable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for if you say these be indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible perfections in God, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if <hi>Justice</hi> be so, then there is an eternal relation of Right and Equity betwixt every Being and the giving of it, that which is its propriety; if <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> then there is an indispensible agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a promise, and the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it; if <hi>Mercy,</hi> then there is an immutable and unalterable suitableness and harmony between an indigent Creature, and pity and commiseration; if <hi>Goodness,</hi> then there is an everlasting Proportion and Symmetry between fulness and its overflowing and dispreading of it self, which is the thing denyed: for to say they are indispensibly so, because God understands them so,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34594:15"/>
seems to me extream incogitancy; for that is against the nature of all understanding, which is but the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea and Representation of things, and is then a true and perfect Image, when it is exactly conformed to its object: and therefore, if things have not mutual respects and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations eternal and indispensible, then all those perfections do solely and purely depend upon absolute and independent Will, as <hi>Will;</hi> And consequently, it was and is indifferent in it self that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to these, as, <hi>Injustice, Vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Cruelty, Malice, Hatred, Spite, Revenge, Fury;</hi> and whatever goes to the constitution of Hell it self should have been made the top and highest perfections of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which is such Blasphemy as cannot well be named without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and trembling, for instead of being a God, such a nature as this is, joyned with omnipotency would be a worse Devil than any is in Hell. And yet this is a necessary
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34594:15"/>
and infallible consequence from the denial of these mutual respects and relations of things unto one another, to be eternal and unchangeable. And as by the denial of these, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is wholly destroyed, so in the second place, the <hi>mind of Man</hi> would have no certainty of Knowledge, or assurance of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. He can never come to Know there is a God, and consequently not the Will and Mind of God, which if there be no intrinsecal and indispensible respects and relations of things, must be the ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Knowledge: for what means or arguments should we use to find out, or prove a Divine Nature? It were folly and madness to sit down and consider the admirable contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and artifice of this great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Universe; how that all natural things seem to act for some end, though themselves take no Cognizance of it: How the Sun by its motion and situation, or (which is all one) by being a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34594:16"/>
of the Earths Motion, provides Light and Heat, and Life for this inferiour World, how living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bring forth a most apt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure and structure of parts and members, and with that a being endued with admirable Faculties, and yet themselves have no insight into, nor consultation about this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Workmanship; how they are furnished with Powers and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations for the preservation of this Body when it is once brought into the World; how without praevious deliberation they naturally take in that Food which without their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or animadversion is concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Ventricle, turned into Chyle, that Chyle into Blood, that Blood diffused through the Veins and Arteries, and therewith the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Members nourished, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes of strength repaired; I say, the gathering from all these (which one would think were a very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Consequence) that there is a wise Principle which directs all these Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34594:16"/>
unknown to you, in their several motions, to their several ends, (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the dependance and relations of things to be contingent and arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) were a piece of folly and incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy; for how can the Order of those things speak a wise and understanding Being, which have no relation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto one another, but their whole agreement, suitableness and proportion is a meer casual Issue of absolute and independent Will? If any thing may be the cause of any effect, and a proportionate mean to any end, who can infer infinite Wisdom from the dependence of things and their relations unto one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? for we are to know that there is a God, and the Will of that God before we can know the mutual Harmony, or Disproportion of things; and yet, if we do not know these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal respects that things have among themselves, it is impossible we should ever come to the knowledge of a God: for these are the only arguments that any Logick in the World can make
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34594:17"/>
use of to prove any conclusion: But suppose we should come to know that there is a God, which, as I have demonstrated, denying the necessary and immutable truth of common Notions, and the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible and eternal relations of things is altogether impossible. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let it be supposed; yet how shall we know that these common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and principles of natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, which are the foundation of all Discourse and Argumentation, are certain and infallible Truths; and that our <hi>Senses,</hi> (which with these former Principles, we suppose this Divine Nature to have given us to converse with this outward world) were not on purpose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon us, to befool, delude and cheat us; if we be not first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of the <hi>Veracity</hi> of God? and how can we be assured of that, if we know not that Veracity is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and how shall we know it is so, unless there be an intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal relation betwixt Veracity and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34594:17"/>
perfection? for if it be an arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous respect depending upon the Will of God, there is no way possible left whereby we should come to know that it is in God at all; And therefore we have fully as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe that all our common Notions and Principles of natural instinct, whereupon we ground all our reasonings and discourse, are meer Chymera's to delude and abuse our faculties; and all those Idea's Phantasms and Apprehensions of our external senses, we imagine are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned in us by the presence of outward objects, are meer Spect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums and Gulleries, wherewith poor mortals are befooled and cheated; as that they are given us by the first Goodness &amp; Truth to lead us into the Knowledge of himself and Nature.</p>
                  <p>This is a clear and evident conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and cannot be denyed by any that doth not complain of darkness in the brightest and most Meridian Light. And here you have the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations laid of the highest Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34594:18"/>
for who can say he knows any thing, when he hath no bassion which he can raise any true conclusions?</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the noble faculties of man, his Mind and Understanding, will be to no end and purpose, but for a Rack and Torture; for what greater unhappiness or torment can there be imagined, than to have Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, whose Accomplishment and Perfection consists in a due confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation unto their objects, and yet to have no objects unto which they may be conformed; To have a Soul unmeasurably breathing after the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of Truth and Goodness, and after a search and enquiry after one and the other, and to find at last they are but aiery empty and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Notions, depending upon the arbitratious determinations of bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and independent Will; which determinations she sees it beyond her reach ever to come to any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of?</p>
                  <p>Here you have likewise the true Foundations of that we call <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:34594:18"/>
for if there be no distinction 'twixt Truth and Falshood, Good and Evil, in the nature of the things themselves, and we never can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured what is the mind and pleasure of the supream and absolute Will (because Veracity is not intrinsecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> a Perfection, but only an Arbitrarious, if <hi>any</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in the Deity) then it infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follows, that it is all one what I do, or how I live; and I have as much reason to believe that I am as pleasing unto God, when I give up my self unto all Filthiness, Uncleanness and Sin; when I swell with Pride, Envy, Hatred and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice &amp;c. as when I endeavour with all my Might and Strength to purge and purifie my Soul from all pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defilement both of Flesh and Spirit; and when I pursue the mortification of all my carnal Lusts and Inclinations: And I have fully as much ground and assurance, that the one is the ready Way to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:34594:19"/>
And this is another branch of this <hi>second</hi> Absurdity, from the deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the intrinsecal and eternal respects and relations of things, that a man would not have any assurance of future Happiness; for though it be true indeed, or at least we fancy to our selves that God hath sent <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> into the world, &amp; by him hath made very large and ample promises, that whosoever believes in him and conforms his life unto his Precepts, shall be made heir of the same Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance and Glory which Christ is now possessed of and invested with in the Kingdom of his Father, yet what ground have we to believe that God does not intend onely to play with and abuse our Faculties, and in conclusion to damn all those that believe and live as is above expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and to take <hi>them only</hi> into the Injoyments of Heaven and Happiness, who have been the great Opposers of the Truth, and Gospel, and Life and Nature of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the world: for if there be no eternal and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34594:19"/>
indispensible Relation of Things, then there's no intrinsecal Evil in Deceiving and Falsifying, in the damning the Good, or saving obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and contumacious Sinners (whilst such) notwithstanding any promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or threatnings to the contrary: and if the things be in themselves indifferent, it is an unadvised Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to pronounce determinately on either side. Yea further, suppose we should be assured that God is <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi> and that the Scripture doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what is his Mind and Pleasure, yet if there be not an intrinsecal op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position betwixt the Being and not being of a thing at the same time, and in the same respect; then God can make a thing that hath been <hi>done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;</hi> and that whatever hath been done or spoken either by himself, or Christ, or his Prophets, or Apostles, should never be done, or spoken by him on them; though He hath come into the world; yet that He should not be come; though he hath made these promises, yet that they should not be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34594:20"/>
made; though God hath given us Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that are capable of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himself, yet that he should not have given them us; and yet we should have no Being, nor think a thought while we fancy and speak of all these contradictions; In fine, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible we should know any thing, if the opposition of contradictory terms depend upon the arbitrarious resolves of any Being whatsoever. If any should affirm, that the terms of Common Notions have an eternal and indispensible relation unto one another, and deny it of other truths, he exceedingly betrayes his folly and incogitancy; for these common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and principles are foundations, and radical truths upon which are built all the deductions of reason and Discourse, and with which, so far as they have any truth in them, they are inseparably united. All these conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are plain and undeniable, and therefore I shall travel no further in the confirmation of them.</p>
                  <p>Against this Discourse will be <hi>object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:34594:20"/>
that it destroys God's <hi>Independency</hi> and <hi>Self-sufficiency;</hi> for if there be truth antecedently to the Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; the Divine Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be a meer passive principle, acted and inlightned by something without it self, as the Eyes, by the Sun, and lesser objects, which the Sun ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiates: And if there be mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities, and dependencies of things in a moral sense, and so, that such and such means have a natural, and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal tendency, or repugnance to such and such ends, then will God be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in his actions from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without himself, which is to take away his independency, and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency. The pardoning of Sin to repenting Sinners seems to be a thing very suitable to infinite Goodness and Mercy, if there be any suitableness, or agreement in things antecedently to Gods Will; therefore in this case will God be moved from abroad and as it were Determined to an act of Grace. This will also undermine and shake many principles and opinions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34594:21"/>
which are look'd upon as Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and necessary to be believed: It will unlink and break that chain and method of Gods Decrees, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed amongst us. God's great plot, and design from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as it is usually held forth, was to advance his Mercy and Justice in the Salvation of some, and Damnation of others; We shall only speak of that part of Gods design, the advancement of his Justice in the Damnation of the greatest part of mankind, as being most pertinent for the improving of the strength of the objection against our former Discourse: That I may do this, He decrees to create man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created, decrees that man should sin, and because, as some say, man is a meer passive principle, not able, no not in the presence of objects, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce himself into action, Or because in the moment of his creation, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he was impowered with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency to stand or fall; Therefore, lest there should be a frustration of God's great design; he decrees in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34594:21"/>
next place, infallibly to determine the Will of man unto Sin, that having sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he might accomplish his Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and what he had first, &amp; from all eternity in his intentions, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Justice. Now if there be such an intrinsecal relation of things, as our former Discourse pretends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, this design of God will be wholly frustrated. For it may seem clear to every mans understanding that it is not for the Honour and Advancement of Justice to determine the will of man to sin, and then to punish him for that Sin unto which he was so determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; Whereas if God's Will, as such, be the only Rule &amp; principle of actions, this will be an accommodate means (if God so please to have it) unto his design. The Sum is, We have seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our former discourse to bind and tye up God, who is an absolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Being, to the petty forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Good and Evil; &amp; to fetter and imprison freedom, and liberty it self, in the fatal and immutable chains, and respects of things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:34594:22"/>
I answer. This objection concerns partly the understanding of God, and partly his Will; As for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine understanding, the Case is thus; There are certain Beings, or natures of things which are Logically possible; it implyes no contradiction that they should be, although it were supposed, there were no power that could bring them into being; which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or things, supposing they were in being, would have mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of agreement or opposition unto one another, which would be no more distinguished from the things themselves, than Relations are from that which founds them. Now the Divine Understanding is a represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or Comprehension of all those natures or beings thus <hi>logically,</hi> and in respect of God absolutely possible, and consequently it must needs be also a comprehension of all these Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, and Antipathies, either in a natural or a moral Way, which they have one unto another: for they, as I said, do necessarily, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34594:22"/>
flow from the things themselves, as relations do, <hi>posito fundamento &amp; termino.</hi> Now the Divine understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth not at all depend upon these natures, or relations though they be its objects; for the nature of an object doth not consist in being <hi>motivum facultatis,</hi> as it is usually with us, whose apprehensions are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by their presence; but its whole nature is sufficiently compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this, that it is <hi>terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum Facultatis;</hi> and this precisely doth not speak any dependency of the faculty upon it, especially in the divine understanding; where this <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective, terminative</hi> presence flows from the faecundity of the Divine nature: for the things themselves are so far from having any being antecedently to the Divine understanding; that had not it been their exemplary pattern, and <hi>Idea,</hi> they had never been created, and being created they would lye in darkness; (I speak of things that have not in them a principle of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, not conscious of their own

                  <p>To the second part of the <hi>Objection,</hi> the strength whereof is, that to tye up God in his actions to the reason of things, destroys his Liberty, Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteness, and Independency. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, it is no imperfection for God to be determined to Good; It is no bondage, slavery, or contraction, to be bound up to the eternal Laws of Right and Justice: it is the greatest impotency and weakness in the world to have a power to evil, and there is nothing so diametrically opposite to the very being and nature of God; <hi>Stat pro ratione voluntas,</hi> unless it be as a redargution and check to impudent and daring inquirers, is an account no where justifiable. The more any Being partakes of reason and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34594:24"/>
the worse is the imputation of acting arbitrariously, <hi>&amp; pro impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</hi> We can pardon it in Women and children, as those from whom we do not expect that they should act upon any higher principle, but for a man of reason and understanding, that hath the Laws of goodness and rectitude (which are as the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> that cannot be altered) engraven upon his mind, for Him to cast off these golden reins, and to set up arbitrarious Will for his Rule and Guide, is a piece of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable rashness and presumption. This is an infallible rule, that liberty in the power or principle is no where a perfection, where there is not an indifferency in the things or actions about which it is conversant: And therefore it is a piece of our weakness and imbecillity, that we have natures so indetermined to what is good. These things need no proof, indeed cannot well be proved, otherwise than they prove themselves: for they are of immediate truth, and prove
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34594:25"/>
themselves, they will, to a pure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our former Discourse doth not infer any dependency of God, upon any thing without himself; for God is not excited to his actions by any foreign, or extrinsecal motives; what He does, proceeds from the eternal immutable respects, and relations, or reasons of things, and where are these to be found, but in the Eternal and divine Wisdom; for what can infinite Wisdom be, but a steady, and immoveable comprehension of all those natures and relations: and therefore God in his actions, does not look abroad, but only consults, (if I may so speak) the <hi>Idea's</hi> of his own mind. What Creatures doe, is but the offering a particular case, for the reducement of a general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple into a particular action; or the presentment of an occasion for God to act according to the principles of his own nature; when we say that God pardoneth Sin upon repentance, God is not moved to an act of grace
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34594:25"/>
from any thing without himself; for this is a principle in the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that pardon of Sin to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sinners, is a thing very suitable to infinite goodness, and this principle is a piece of the Divine nature: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God upon a particular act of repentance puts forth a particular act of grace, It is but as it were a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular instance to the general rule, which is a portion of Divine perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when 'tis said, <hi>to him that hath shall be given, and he shall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> the meaning is, He that walks up unto that light, and improves that strength, that God hath already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto him, shall have more abundant incomes of light and strength from God: It doth not follow that God is moved from without to impart his Grace. For this is a branch of Divine Wisdom; it is agreeable to the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, to take notice of, and reward the sincere, though weak en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of his Creatures, after him; so that what is from abroad is but a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34594:26"/>
particular occasion to those divine principles to exert, and put forth themselves.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we spoken concerning the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>things.</hi> It follows that we speak</p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>power,</hi> or faculty, which we shall dispatch in a few words.</p>
                  <p>Truth in the power, or faculty is nothing else but a conformity of its conceptions or <hi>Idea</hi>'s unto the natures and relations of things, which in God we may call an actual, steady, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, eternal Omniformity, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> calls the Divine Intellect, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which you have largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by him. And this the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> truly call the intellectual world, for here are the natures of all things pure, and unmix'd, purged from all those dregs, refined from all that Dross and alloy which cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in their particular instances. All inferiour and sublunary things, not excluding man himself, have their excrescencies, and Defects, Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34594:26"/>
or privations are moulded up in their very frames and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There is somewhat extraneous heterogeneous and preternatural in all things here below, as they exist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; but in that other world, like the most purely fined gold, they shine in their native and proper glory. Here is the first goodness, the benigne Parent of the whole creation, with his numerous off-spring: the infinite throng of created Beings: Here is the fountain of eternal Love, with all its streams, and Rivulets: Here is the Sum of uncreated glory, surrounded with all his rayes, and beams: Here are the eternal, and indispensible Laws of right and Justice, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and indemonstrable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of truth, and goodness: Here are steady and immoveable rules, for all cases and actions, however circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated, from which the Will of God, though never so absolute, and independent from everlasting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, shall never depart one Tittle. Now all that truth that is in any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34594:27"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:34594:28"/>
created Being, is by participation and derivation from this first under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and fountain of intellectual light. And that truth in the power or faculty is nothing but the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of its conceptions, or <hi>Ideas</hi> with the natures and relations of things, is cleare and evident in it self, and necessarily follows from what hath been formerly proved concerning the truth of things themselves, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to any understanding, or will; for things are what they are, and cannot be otherwise without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and their mutual respects and dependencies eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, as hath been already shew'd: so that the conceptions and <hi>Ideas</hi> of these natures and their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, can be only so far true as they conform and agree with the things themselves, and the harmony which they have one to another.</p>

                  <p>My Lord,</p>
                  <p>ALthough I have not had the Happiness to see your Lordship since your very tender years, by reason of your distance in Foreign parts; yet I have heard so much of your great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in Knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:34594:30"/>
and Vertue, that I cannot slip this occasion to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate your early Fame, and the hopes, or rather Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance you give of being an extraordinary Person. For that season of Life which so many others pass away in Frolicks, and Riot, and vain Amours; In Raillery, and the wanton Essays of Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooning &amp; Versifying Wit, (which contemptible child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness the youth of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age seems to value as the highest Perfection) your Lordship wisely, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thi'y imploys in gaining
<pb facs="tcp:34594:30"/>
those real Acomplishments, which may fit you for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, in that high Station in which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath set you.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from an Ancient Stock of most Noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, and are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Son of a Lord and Lady, whose Vertues may inspire all who have the Honour and Happiness to be related to them, with the Noblest Thoughts and Endeavours; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a generous Ambition prompts your Lordship to
<pb facs="tcp:34594:31"/>
appear worthy the Glories of such Ancestors. Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the mark of the favour of Princes, and when 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with intellectual and moral Excellencies, it hath then the Signatures of God upon it, and the <hi>Personal</hi> gives Lustre to the <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Greatness. Secular Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours extort outward shews of Respect and Homage; while the unsuitable Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of such as are paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with misplaced Titles, make them Objects of the real scorn of their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Adorers; But the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb facs="tcp:34594:31"/>
of a wise and Vertuous Spirit commands inward Venerations, and hath a large Empire over the Souls of Men. Knowledge is a Beam of the Coelestial Light, and Vertue a Branch of the Divine Image; Great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies in themselves, and true Accomplishments of humane Na ure: In both your Lordship hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done your few years and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Pattern to young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, how to imploy their Youth Honourably and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commingly, to the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Quality, and

Families; and their own Happiness and Glory.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, there is a Perfection beyond these, or more properly, 'tis the height and perfection of them, and that is Religion: this makes Honourable in both Worlds; and enters those that are truly possest of it, among the Nobility of God. I doubt not but your Lordship hath taken care to season your Active and Considerate Youth with the Study and Practice of this best Accomplishment: such a Dedication of the
<pb facs="tcp:34594:32"/>
first Fruits to our Maker is most just in it self, most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Him, and will be most comfortable to the Person that makes the Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Your Lordship is by the Bounty of Providence incircled with all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Earthly Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Piety and a Religious Life will procure the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour, bless all your Injoyments in this World, and assure infinitely better in another. <hi>There</hi> dwells our Happiness, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the way to it. This is the Subject of the little

Book with which I here humbly present your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. If it may contribute any thing to your Service, in these highest Concerns, it will be a mighty Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and Satisfaction to,</p>

                  <p>THis Discourse was first printed about six years ago; since which time it had the fortune of a stoln Edition in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The ocasion of its Publication was this, I being desired to preach at a neighbour-City, recollected the last Sermon I had delivered to mine own people, and made use of that: some of the Hearers, that thought themselves fit Judges, misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended my meaning in divers things, and past Sentence upon their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes as mine: this induced me to transcribe it out of my memory; which I did while it was yet fresh in my mind, exactly as to the matter, though possibly with some small difference as to the frame of words, and with some additions at the end: The Copy was accidentally seen by a near Relation, who desired it should be publish'd, which I permitted; and do it now again at my Bookseller's Instance.</p>

                  <p>By the <hi>Gate,</hi> we may understand the entrance, and all the way of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and that is, <hi>Religion;</hi> By the <hi>straightness</hi> of it; the <hi>Difficulties</hi> we are to encounter.

So that the <hi>running Eye</hi> might <hi>see and read:</hi> And the <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the H. <hi>Jesus,</hi> like <hi>himself,</hi> came into the world with <hi>Rays</hi> about its Head.</p>
                  <p>Religion, I say, is <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> and what is not <hi>so,</hi> may concern the <hi>Theatre,</hi> or the <hi>Schools;</hi> may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mens <hi>Wits,</hi> and serve the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of <hi>Disputes;</hi> but 'tis nothing to <hi>Religion,</hi> 'tis nothing to the <hi>Interest</hi> of mens Souls.</p>
                  <p>Religion was once a <hi>Mystery,</hi> but the Mystery is <hi>revealed;</hi> And those things that we yet count <hi>Mysteries,</hi> are <hi>plainly</hi> enough discover'd as to their <hi>being such</hi> as we believe them, though we cannot understand the <hi>manner how;</hi> and 'tis no part of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> to <hi>enquire</hi> into that, but rather <hi>It</hi> injoyns us meekly to acquiesce in the plain declarations of Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>bold</hi> scrutiny into <hi>hidden things.</hi>

In short I say, the <hi>difficulties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are not in the Vnderstanding; In prompto &amp; Facili est aeternitas,</hi> said the Father; The affairs of eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on things <hi>Easy</hi> and <hi>Familiar.</hi> And I premise this to prevent dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mistakes.</p>
                  <p>But thoug Religion be so facile and plain a thing to be understood, yet the <hi>way</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> is no <hi>broad,</hi> or <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Path;</hi> The <hi>Gate is straight</hi> enough for all that; and I now come to shew what are the <hi>real difficulties</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and whence they arise.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One great Difficulty ariseth from the <hi>depravity</hi> of our <hi>Natures.</hi> The Scripture intimates, <hi>That we are conceived in sin,</hi> Psalm 55. 5. <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours from the Womb.</hi> Isaiah 48. 8. And <hi>Children of Wrath.</hi> Ephes. 2. 3. And we find by <hi>Experience</hi> that we bring <hi>vile</hi> Inclinations into the Wold with us. <hi>Some</hi> are <hi>naturally</hi> Cruel and Injurious; Proud and Imperious; Lustful and Revengful;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34594:38"/>
                     <hi>Others,</hi> Covetous and Unjust; Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moursome and Discontented; Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and False: And there is scarce an instance of <hi>habitual</hi> vice, or villany, but some or other are addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it by their <hi>partieular Make and Natures:</hi> I say, their <hi>Natures,</hi> for certainly it is not true what some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, to serve their Opinions, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to Experience; That <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not in Mens natural Propensions; but instill'd by corrupt Education, evil Customs and Examples:</hi> For we see that those whose <hi>Education</hi> hath been the <hi>same,</hi> do yet <hi>differ</hi> extreamly from each other in their <hi>inclinations;</hi> And <hi>some,</hi> whose Breeding hath been <hi>careless</hi> and <hi>loose,</hi> who have seen almost nothing else but Examples of <hi>Vice;</hi> and been instructed in <hi>little,</hi> besides the arts of <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Pleasure;</hi> I say, there are <hi>such</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these their <hi>unhappy</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, discover none of those <hi>vile</hi> Inclinations, and Propensions, that are in <hi>others,</hi> whose <hi>Education</hi> hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34594:38"/>
been very <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>advantageous.</hi> This I think is enough to shew that many of our evil habits are from <hi>Nature,</hi> and not from <hi>Custom</hi> only.</p>
                  <p>And yet I cannot say that <hi>Humane Nature</hi> is <hi>so</hi> debaucht, that <hi>every Man</hi> is inclin'd to <hi>every Evil</hi> by <hi>it:</hi> For there are <hi>those,</hi> who by their <hi>Tempers</hi> are <hi>averse</hi> to some kind of Vices, and <hi>naturally</hi> disposed to the <hi>contrary Vertues; some</hi> by their <hi>Constitutions</hi> are inclined to <hi>hate Cruelty, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, Lying, Impudence</hi> and <hi>Injustice,</hi> and are by <hi>Temper, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, Liberal, Modest, True</hi> and <hi>Just.</hi> There are <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Vices</hi> which our Natures almost <hi>universally</hi> rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaisnt, as many <hi>Bestialities,</hi> and some <hi>horrid Cruelties;</hi> and <hi>all</hi> men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Monsters</hi> in Humane form, are disposed to <hi>some</hi> Vertues, such as <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Kindness</hi> to <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Benefactors.</hi> All this P must confess and say, because <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> constrains me; and I do not know why <hi>Systematick Notions</hi> should

sway more than <hi>that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding <hi>these</hi> last concessions, 'tis evident enough that our Natures are much <hi>vitiated,</hi> and <hi>depraved;</hi> and <hi>this</hi> makes our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the way of Religion, <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</hi> For our work is, to <hi>cleanse</hi> our <hi>Natures;</hi> and to <hi>destroy</hi> those <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Inclinations;</hi> to <hi>crucifie the Old Man;</hi> Rom. 6. 6. and to <hi>purge out the old Leven;</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 7. <hi>This</hi> is <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Way</hi> of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which must needs be very <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,</hi> and <hi>uneasie.</hi> For the vices of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> are very <hi>dear,</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> to us; They are our <hi>Right Hands,</hi> and our <hi>Right Eyes,</hi> and esteemed as <hi>our Selves:</hi> So that to <hi>cut</hi> off, and <hi>pluck</hi> out <hi>these,</hi> and to bid defiance to, and wage War against our selves; to destroy the first born of our Natures, and to lop off our own Limbs; This cannot but be very <hi>Irksom</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant</hi> Imployment, and this is one chief business; and a considerable thing that makes <hi>Religion difficult.</hi>

                  <p n="4">IV. Our <hi>Work</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> is yet more <hi>difficult,</hi> upon the account of <hi>Custom,</hi> to which we are subject, and by which we are swayed much. <hi>This</hi> is vulgarly said to be <hi>another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the Apostle calls it by <hi>that</hi> name, 1 Cor. 11. 14. <hi>Doth not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self teach you, that if a Man have long Hair, it is a shame unto him?</hi> By the word <hi>Nature,</hi> the best Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters say only <hi>Custom</hi> is meant; since <hi>long Hair</hi> is not declared <hi>shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> by the Law and Light of Nature, taken in its chief and properest sense: For then it had never been permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Nazarites:</hi> But the <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry custom,</hi> in the Nations that used it not, made it seem <hi>shameful and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> There are other places in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ancient Authors, wherein <hi>Nature</hi> is put for <hi>Custom:</hi> But I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34594:42"/>
must not insist on <hi>this;</hi> the thing I am about is, that <hi>Custom</hi> is very <hi>powerful;</hi> and as it makes a kind of Nature, so, many times it <hi>masters</hi> and <hi>subdues</hi> it. Wild Creatures are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made gentle and familiar; and those that naturally are tame enough; are made to degenerate into wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by it.</p>
                  <p>And now besides the <hi>original</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravities of our Natures, we have <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted</hi> many <hi>vitious habits</hi> by <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> usages; which we were drawn into at first by pleasure and vanity in our young &amp; inconsiderate years, while we were led by the directions of sense: <hi>These,</hi> by <hi>frequent</hi> acts, grow at last into <hi>habits;</hi> which though in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they were <hi>tender</hi> as a Plant, and easie to have been crusht or blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet <hi>time</hi> and <hi>use</hi> hardens them into the firmness of an <hi>Oak,</hi> that braves the Weather, and can endure the stroak of the Ax and a strong Arm.</p>
                  <p>Now to destroy and root up these obstinate <hi>customary</hi> evils, is another

part of our Work. And Religion reacheth us to <hi>put off concerning the Old Conversation, the Old Man,</hi> Eph. 4. 22. and to receive <hi>new Impressions</hi> and <hi>Inclinations;</hi> to be <hi>renewed</hi> in the <hi>spirit of our Minds,</hi> 5. 23 and to <hi>put on the New Man,</hi> 5. 24. To make us <hi>new Hearts,</hi> Ezek. 18. 31. and to <hi>walk in newness of Life,</hi> Rom. 6. 4. <hi>This</hi> we are to do, and this we may well suppose to be <hi>hard</hi> work; the Scripture compares it to the <hi>changing</hi> the <hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> and the <hi>Spots</hi> of the <hi>Leopard,</hi> Jer. 13. 23. and elsewhere. <hi>How can they do good, that are accustomed to do evil?</hi> Jer. 13. 23. 'Tis <hi>hard,</hi> no doubt; and this is another <hi>difficulty</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. The Power that <hi>Example</hi> hath over us, makes the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Religion difficult.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Sum is, <hi>Example</hi> is very <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Vice</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in our Eyes; we are apt to be reconciled to <hi>that</hi> which <hi>every one doth,</hi> and to do like it; we love the <hi>trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Path,</hi> and care not to walk in the <hi>Way</hi> which is gone in but by a <hi>few.</hi>

                  <p>This is our <hi>Condition,</hi> and our <hi>work</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> is, to <hi>overcome</hi> the strong Biass of corrupt <hi>Example;</hi> to <hi>strive</hi> against the <hi>Stream,</hi> to learn to be <hi>good,</hi> though <hi>few</hi> are <hi>so,</hi> and not to follow <hi>a Multitude to do Evil,</hi> Exod. 23. 2. <hi>This</hi> is our <hi>Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>

and we are commanded to continue in the <hi>Calling wherein God hath set us,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 20. and are warned that we be not <hi>slothful in Business,</hi> Rom. 12. 11.

doth not put his Creatures upon <hi>fruitless</hi> Undertakings: He never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to do any thing in order to <hi>that,</hi> which is not to be <hi>attained.</hi> Therefore when he was resolved not to be intreated for that stubborn and rebellious Nation.

When one made this Profession to our Saviour, <hi>Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. Christ</hi> tells him, that he must expect from him no worldly Honours or Preferments; no Power or sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pleasure, no, not so much as the ordinary Accommodations of Life. <hi>The Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Ayre have Nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head.</hi>

Luk. 9. 5, 8. He would not have the man that likely might look for <hi>these,</hi> upon the opinion of his being the <hi>Messias,</hi> in the <hi>Jewish</hi> sense, one that should at last, whatever the meanness of his Condition was at present, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as a <hi>Mighty,</hi> and <hi>Triumphant tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Monarch;</hi> I say, our Saviour would not have the Man follow him for <hi>that,</hi> which he had not to bestow upon him.

                  <p>And <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> is the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of a <hi>Testimony; Divine Faith</hi> the belief of a <hi>Divine</hi> Testimony; and the chief things to be believed, as <hi>encouragements</hi> and <hi>means</hi> for a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the Difficulties in Religion, are <hi>these; That God is reconciled to us by his Son; That he will assist our weak endeavous by the Aids of his Spirit; That he will reward us if we strive as we ought, with immortal Happiness in a World of endless Glory.</hi>

                  <p>By our belief of God's being <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,</hi> we are secured from those <hi>fears,</hi> that might discourage our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and endeavours, upon the account of his <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Justice.</hi> By the <hi>Faith</hi> of his <hi>Assistance,</hi> all the <hi>objections</hi> against our <hi>striving,</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from the <hi>greatness</hi> of the <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> and the <hi>disproportionate smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of our <hi>Strength,</hi> are answered.

The <hi>inward</hi> love of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the <hi>outward</hi> exercises of them, and hereby the <hi>contrary</hi> evils are both <hi>pined</hi> and <hi>thrust out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus of the <hi>First</hi> thing that <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> implies; upon this must follow,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) <hi>An attempt upon evil habits,</hi> viz.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34594:52"/>
                     <hi>Those</hi> that have been super-induced on us by <hi>Carelesness</hi> and <hi>Temptation,</hi> bad <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>evil Company. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry victory is a means to another; we</hi> grow <hi>stronger,</hi> and the <hi>enemy weaker</hi> by it. To have overcome the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> acts of sin, is a <hi>beginning</hi> in our <hi>spiritual</hi> warfare; but our <hi>chief</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are the <hi>habits; these</hi> must be attempted also, but with <hi>Prudence;</hi> wild <hi>Beasts</hi> are not to be dealt with by <hi>main strength;</hi> Art and Stratagem must be used in this War; and 'tis <hi>good policy,</hi> I think here, to fight the <hi>least</hi> powerful foes <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> habits, before we fall on the <hi>inbred natural</hi> Inclinations. While our forces are weak, 'tis dangerous setting upon the strongest holds, <hi>viz.</hi> the vices of <hi>Complexion,</hi> which are woven into our <hi>very Natures.</hi> If a man apply all his <hi>force</hi> where he hath not <hi>resolution</hi> enough to go through with what he undertakes, he receives a foyl, and 'tis odds but he sits down and faints. <hi>Prudence</hi> therefore is to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34594:53"/>
be used, where we distrust our strength: Fall upon <hi>Sin,</hi> where 'tis <hi>weakest,</hi> where it hath <hi>least</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and least of <hi>Temptation;</hi> and where we have arguments from <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>worldly Interests</hi> wherewith to war against it. If we <hi>prevail,</hi> we are heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>success:</hi> Our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Resolution</hi> will grow <hi>stronger</hi> by this experience, when we have triumph't over the sins of <hi>evil Custom, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and <hi>sensual Indulgence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when that is done, we must remember that 'tis not enough that those <hi>habits</hi> are thrust out; <hi>others</hi> must be planted in their <hi>room:</hi> when the soyl is <hi>prepared,</hi> the <hi>seed</hi> must be sown, and the <hi>seeds</hi> of vertuous <hi>habits,</hi> are the <hi>actions</hi> of vertue. These I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended under the last head, and shall say more of the introducing of <hi>habits,</hi> under <hi>one</hi> that follows on purpose.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) The next advance in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, is, In the Strength of God, and in the Name of his Son, to assault the greater Devils, and to strive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34594:53"/>
to cast out them; I mean the <hi>Sins</hi> of <hi>Complexion,</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> Nature. This is a <hi>great</hi> work, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>strong Faith,</hi> and <hi>many Prayers,</hi> and <hi>much Time,</hi> and <hi>great Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>invincible Resolution:</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy <hi>these heartily;</hi> and though thou now and then mayst receive a foyl, yet give not off so, but rise again in the strength of <hi>God,</hi> implore <hi>new</hi> aid, and fortifie thy self with <hi>more</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, and <hi>deeper</hi> resolves; and <hi>then</hi> renew the <hi>Combat</hi> upon the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> of <hi>Divine Assistance,</hi> and <hi>Christ's Merits</hi> and <hi>Intercession,</hi> and the <hi>promise</hi> that sin <hi>shall not have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us,</hi> Rom. 6. 14.</p>
                  <p>Remember, that <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>great</hi> work, and the biggest <hi>difficulty;</hi> if this be not overcome, all our <hi>other labour</hi> hath been in <hi>vain,</hi> and will be <hi>lost.</hi> If this <hi>root</hi> remain, it will still bear <hi>poysonous</hi> fruit, which will be <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> for <hi>Temptation,</hi> and occasion of <hi>continual falling;</hi> and we shall be in danger of being reconciled again
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34594:54"/>
to our <hi>old</hi> sins, and to <hi>undo</hi> all; and so <hi>our latter end will be worse than our beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20. Or, at least, though we stand at a stay, and satisfie our selves with <hi>that;</hi> yet though we are <hi>contented,</hi> our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not <hi>safe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we will endeavour to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of <hi>duty,</hi> or <hi>security,</hi> we must <hi>proceed</hi> still after our <hi>lesser conquests,</hi> till the <hi>sins</hi> of <hi>Complexion</hi> are laid <hi>dead</hi> at our feet. He that is born of <hi>God,</hi> sinneth not, and he cannot sin, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. Till we come to <hi>this,</hi> we are but <hi>strugling</hi> in the <hi>Birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such a <hi>perfection</hi> as is <hi>mortifying</hi> of <hi>vitious temper,</hi> is <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>attainable,</hi> and 'tis no doubt that which <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> aims at; and though it be a <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult height,</hi> yet we must not sit down this side: At least we must be always pressing on to this Mark: if Providence <hi>cut</hi> off our days before we have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to it, we may expect acceptance of the <hi>sincerity</hi> of our endeavours, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the <hi>merits</hi> of our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34594:54"/>
Saviour: For he hath procured favour for those <hi>sincere.</hi> Believers and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureres, whose Day is done before their work is compleated; <hi>this I</hi> mean, of subduing the <hi>darling</hi> sins of their <hi>particular Natures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then if we <hi>rest,</hi> and please our selves with the <hi>little Victories</hi> and Attainments, and let these our <hi>great Enemies</hi> quietly alone, 'tis an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our <hi>endeavours</hi> are not <hi>sincere,</hi> but much short of that <hi>striving,</hi> which will procure an <hi>entrance</hi> into the <hi>straight Gate.</hi> The next thing (and 'tis the last <hi>I</hi> shall mention) which is implyed in <hi>striving,</hi> is,</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) <hi>To furnish our selves, through Divine Grace, with the Habits and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of Holiness and Vertue.</hi> For <hi>Goodness</hi> to become a kind of <hi>Nature</hi> to the Soul, is <hi>height</hi> indeed; but such a one as <hi>may</hi> be reacht: the new Nature, and new Creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. are not meer names.</p>
                  <p>We have observ'd that some men are of a <hi>Natural Generosity, Veracity</hi>

and <hi>Sweetness;</hi> and they <hi>cannot</hi> act contrary to these <hi>Native</hi> Vertues without a mighty <hi>Violence:</hi> why now should not the <hi>New Nature</hi> be as <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful</hi> as the <hi>Old?</hi> And why may not the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> working by an active Faith and Endeavour, fix <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> on the Soul, as prevalent as <hi>those?</hi> No doubt, it <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>doth,</hi> upon the Diviner Souls: For whom to do a <hi>wicked,</hi> or <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Action,</hi> 'twould be as <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>unnatural,</hi> as for the <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate</hi> temper to <hi>butcher</hi> the <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;</hi> or for him, that is <hi>naturally just,</hi> to <hi>oppress</hi> and make a <hi>prey</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless</hi> and the <hi>Widow.</hi> I say, such a <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>perfection</hi> as this, should be aim'd at, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. and we should not slacken or intermit our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours till it be attain'd.</p>
                  <p>In order to it, we are to use fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>meditation</hi> on the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> of Vertue and Religion; and <hi>earnest Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Grace</hi> of God; and <hi>diligent attendance</hi> upon the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>

                  <p>Thus <hi>I</hi> have shewn, that the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable difficulties</hi> may be <hi>overcome,</hi> and <hi>How:</hi> 'tis a <hi>plain course I</hi> have <hi>directed,</hi> that will not puzzle mens <hi>understandings</hi> with <hi>needless niceties,</hi> nor <hi>distract</hi> their <hi>memories</hi> with <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titndes.</hi> Let us walk in this way, and do it <hi>constantly,</hi> with <hi>vigour</hi> and <hi>alacrity;</hi> and there is no fear, but in the <hi>Strength of</hi> God, through the <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>mediation</hi> of his Son, we shall <hi>overcome,</hi> and at last <hi>enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I had now done with this <hi>general</hi>

Head, but that 'tis necessary to note three things more.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Those <hi>Instruments</hi> of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness which we must use in <hi>striving,</hi> viz. <hi>Faith, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>active Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, must all of them be imployed.</hi> Not any <hi>one</hi> singly, will do the great work; nor can the <hi>others,</hi> if <hi>any one</hi> be wanting. If we <hi>believe,</hi> and do not <hi>pray;</hi> or <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>do not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi> or <hi>endeavour,</hi> without <hi>those,</hi> the <hi>Difficulties</hi> will remain, and 'twill be impossible for us to <hi>enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) <hi>We must be diligent in our course:</hi> If we do not exercise <hi>Faith vigorously,</hi> and <hi>pray heartily,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour with our whole might,</hi> the means will not succeed; and 'tis as good not at all, as not to purpose. The Difficulties will not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>cold Faith,</hi> or <hi>sleepy Prayers,</hi> or <hi>remiss Endeavours:</hi> A very <hi>intense degree</hi> of these is <hi>necessary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Our striving must be constant;</hi> we must not <hi>begin,</hi> and <hi>look back,</hi> Heb. 10. 38. or <hi>run</hi> a while, and <hi>stop</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:34594:56"/>
in <hi>midd</hi> course, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. and content our selves with <hi>some</hi> attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and think we have <hi>arrived,</hi> Phil. 3. 14. If we do so, we shall find our selves dangerously mistaken. The <hi>Crown</hi> is at the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Warfare,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Prise</hi> at the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Race.</hi> If we will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, we must hold on: <hi>The life of one that strives as he ought, must be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion forwards;</hi> always <hi>procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> always <hi>growing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we <hi>strive thus,</hi> we cannot <hi>fail;</hi> if any of these <hi>qualifications</hi> be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we <hi>cannot but</hi> miscarry. And hence no doubt it is, that many that <hi>seek</hi> to <hi>enter, shall not be able,</hi> and the presumed sons of the Kingdom are shut out, Mat. 8.12. They <hi>seek,</hi> and are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry desirous to be admitted; They do <hi>some</hi> thing, and <hi>strive;</hi> but their <hi>stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> is <hi>partial,</hi> or <hi>careless,</hi> or <hi>short;</hi> by reason of which defects, they <hi>do</hi> not <hi>overcome,</hi> and <hi>shall</hi> not <hi>enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a <hi>dangerous</hi> Rock, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there are as many undone by <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>half striving,</hi> as by not <hi>stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>

And hence the <hi>Third Proposition</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that I proposed to discourse.</p>
                  <p n="3">(III.) <hi>THat there is a sort of Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that will not procure an entrance:</hi> implyed in these words, <hi>For many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a dangerous thing to be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34594:57"/>
into a <hi>false peace;</hi> and to take up with <hi>imperfect Godliness;</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> to our <hi>beloved sins,</hi> and to judge our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>safe</hi> upon <hi>insufficient grounds. This</hi> multitudes <hi>do,</hi> and 'tis the great danger of our days; Men cannot be <hi>contented</hi> without doing <hi>something</hi> in Religion; but they are <hi>contented with a little.</hi> And then they reckon themselves <hi>godly,</hi> before they are <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous;</hi> and take themselves to be <hi>Saints,</hi> upon such things as will not distinguish a <hi>good man</hi> from a <hi>bad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We seek after <hi>Marks</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> and would be glad to know, <hi>how</hi> we might try our state: The thing is of great importance; and if the <hi>Signs</hi> we judge by are either <hi>false,</hi> or <hi>imperfect,</hi> we are deceived to our undoing. Meer <hi>Speculative</hi> mistakes about Opinions, do no great hurt; but errour in the <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> is deadly. Now there are sundry things commonly taken for <hi>signs</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34594:58"/>
though they are <hi>something,</hi> yet they are not <hi>enough;</hi> They are <hi>hopeful</hi> for <hi>beginnings,</hi> but nothing worth when they are our <hi>end</hi> and <hi>rest.</hi> They are a kind of <hi>seeking</hi> aud <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect striving;</hi> but not <hi>such</hi> as <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh</hi> the <hi>difficulties</hi> of the way, or will procure us an <hi>entrance</hi> at the <hi>Gàte.</hi> Therefore to disable the <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, insufficient Marks</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> I shall discover in pursuance of the <hi>Third Proposition, How far a man may strive in the exercises of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet be found at last among those seekers that shall not be able to enter.</hi> And though I have intimated something of this in the general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet I shall now more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly shew it in the <hi>instances</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And in <hi>these</hi> I shall discover a <hi>Religion</hi> that may be called <hi>Animal,</hi> to which the <hi>natural</hi> man may attain.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>(I.)</hi> A Man may believe the Truths of the Gospel, and assent heartily to all the Articles of the Creed: <hi>and if</hi>

                     <hi>Charity,</hi> viz. <hi>Prevalent love to God and Men,</hi> it will not signifie: So that <hi>Martyrdom</hi> is no infallible <hi>mark,</hi> nor will it avail any thing, except <hi>sincere endeavour</hi> to <hi>overcome</hi> the greater <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,</hi> have gone before it.

                  <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Men may confidently rely upon Christ for Salvation, and be firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that he hath justified, and will make them happy.</hi> They may <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate</hi> him to themselves, and be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed mightily in the opinion of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>theirs.</hi> And yet notwithstanding this confidence may be in the number of those <hi>seekers</hi> that shall not <hi>enter.</hi> For Christ is the Author of <hi>Eternal life,</hi> only <hi>to those that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. and to <hi>obey</hi> him, is to <hi>strive vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously</hi> and <hi>constantly,</hi> to <hi>overcome</hi> all our <hi>sinful Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Habits.</hi> And those that <hi>trust</hi> he will save them, though they have never seriously set about <hi>this work,</hi> deceive themselves by vain presumption, and in effect
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34594:60"/>
say, that he will dissolve or dispense with his Laws in their favour. For he requires us to <hi>deny our selves,</hi> Mar. 8. 34. <hi>To mortifie the body,</hi> Rom 8. 13. <hi>To love enemies,</hi> Mat. 5. 44. <hi>To be meek,</hi> Mat. 11. 29. <hi>and patient,</hi> Jam. 5. 8. <hi>and humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. <hi>and just,</hi> Mat. 7. 12. <hi>and charitable,</hi> Heb. 13. 16. <hi>and Holy, as he that called us is holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 15.

                  <p>We <hi>may</hi> indeed be <hi>confident,</hi> and we <hi>ought,</hi> that he will <hi>save</hi> all those that <hi>so believe</hi> as to <hi>obey</hi> him; but may not trust that he will save us except we are some of those. To <hi>rely upon Christ for our Salvation, must follow our sincere and obedient striving, and not go before it.</hi> The mistake
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34594:61"/>
of this is exceeding dangerous, and I doubt hath been fatal to many. The sum is to <hi>rely on Christ,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>resolute</hi> and <hi>steady</hi> endeavour to overcome every sin and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will gain us nothing in the end but shame and dissappointment: <hi>For 'tis not every one that faith unto him, Lord, Lord, shall enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that doth the will of his Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Mat. 7.21. The foolish Virgins relyed upon him, and expected he should open to them; <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> Mat. 25. 11. but he kept them out, and would not <hi>know</hi> them, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>

                  <p>And we may learn hence, that the greatest gift of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>earnestness</hi> and <hi>frequency</hi> in it, is no good <hi>mark</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> except it be attended with <hi>sincere, constant</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:34594:62"/>
and <hi>matter</hi> readily and unexpectedly, which many times begets in the man a conceit that he is <hi>inspired,</hi> and that his <hi>Prayers</hi> are the <hi>breathings</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> or at least, that he is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily</hi> assisted by it; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief kindles his affections yet <hi>more,</hi> and he is carryed beyond himself, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the <hi>third Heavens,</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> as he fancies, and <hi>so</hi> he makes no doubt, but that he is a <hi>Saint</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> rank, and special favourite of Heaven; when all this while, he may be really a <hi>bad</hi> man full of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malice; Pride</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness; Scorn</hi> and <hi>ill Nature; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Betters,</hi> and <hi>disobedience to his Governours.</hi> And while it is <hi>so,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those <hi>glorious</hi> things, he is no further than the <hi>Pharisee.

the expressions of <hi>Grace</hi> in those that fear him.</p>
                  <p>So that a <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>lowly-minded</hi> Christian that talks of no <hi>immediate</hi> incomes, or <hi>communications;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps durst not, out of <hi>reverence,</hi> trust to his own present conceptions in a work so <hi>solemn,</hi> but useth the help of some <hi>pious form</hi> of words sutable to his <hi>defires</hi> and <hi>wants,</hi> who is duly <hi>sensible</hi> of his <hi>sins,</hi> and the necessity of <hi>overcoming</hi> them; and is <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>earnestly</hi> desirous of the Divine <hi>aids,</hi> in order to it: such a one as <hi>this</hi> Prays by the Spirit, and will be assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it; while the <hi>other</hi> doth all by <hi>meer Nature</hi> and <hi>Imitation,</hi> and shall not have those <hi>spiritual</hi> aids which he never <hi>heartily desires</hi> nor <hi>intends</hi> to <hi>use.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, I think, I may <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>safely</hi> say: But for the Controversie between <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Conceived Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> which of them is <hi>absolutely best,</hi> I determine nothing of it here. And indeed I suppose that in their own
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34594:63"/>
nature, they are alike indifferent, and are more or less accepted, as they partake more or less of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> viz. of <hi>Faith, Humility</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire</hi> of the good things we pray for; and a man may <hi>have these</hi> that prays by a <hi>Form;</hi> and he may <hi>want</hi> them that takes the <hi>other</hi> way, and thinks himself in a dispensation much above it. So that my business is not to set up one of these ways of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion against the other, but to shew, that the <hi>heights</hi> and vehemencies of many <hi>warm</hi> people in their <hi>unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated</hi> Prayers, have nothing in them <hi>supernatural</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, of themselves, they are no <hi>marks</hi> of <hi>Godliness:</hi> which I hope no one thinks I speak to discredit those <hi>pious</hi> ardours that are felt by <hi>really devout</hi> Souls, when a <hi>vigorous</hi> sense of God, and Divine things, doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven sometimes transport them: Far be it from me to design any thing so <hi>impious;</hi> my aim is only to note, that there are <hi>complexional heats</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34594:64"/>
many times by <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>self-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,</hi> that look like <hi>these,</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who really have little of God in them; and we should take care that we are not deceived by them. <hi>Thus far</hi> also those may go that <hi>shall not enter.</hi> I add,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>(III.)</hi> A man may endeavour some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and strive in some degree, and yet his work may miscarry, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with it.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) There is no doubt, but that an evil man may be <hi>convinced</hi> of his <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>vileness,</hi> and that even to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi> and <hi>torment.</hi> The <hi>Gentiles</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>which have not the Law, shew the works of the Law written in their Hearts, their thoughts in the mean time accusing, or excusing one another.</hi> Conscience of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten stings and disquiets the vilest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and sometimes extorts from them <hi>lamentable confessions</hi> of their sins, and <hi>earnest declamations</hi> against them. They may <hi>weep bitterly</hi> at their remembrance, and be under
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34594:64"/>
great heaviness and dejection upon their occasion. They may <hi>speak vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently</hi> against sin themselves, and love to have others to handle it severely. All this bad men may do upon the score of <hi>natural fear,</hi> and <hi>self love,</hi> and the <hi>apprehension</hi> of a <hi>fature judgment.</hi> And now such <hi>convictions</hi> will <hi>naturally</hi> beget some <hi>endeavours:</hi> A <hi>convinced understanding</hi> will have some influence upon the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affections.</hi> The <hi>mind</hi> in the <hi>unregenerate,</hi> may lust a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Flesh,</hi> as <hi>that</hi> doth against <hi>it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that (2.) such a meer <hi>animal man</hi> may <hi>promise,</hi> and <hi>purpose,</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> in some pretty considerable measure; but then, he goes not on with <hi>full</hi> Resolution, but <hi>wavers</hi> and <hi>stops,</hi> and <hi>turns about</hi> again; and lets the <hi>law</hi> of the <hi>members,</hi> that of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>sin,</hi> to prevail over him. His <hi>endeavour</hi> is <hi>remiss,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>ineffectual;</hi> it makes no <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,</hi> and will not <hi>signifie.</hi> He <hi>sins on,</hi> though with <hi>some regret;</hi> and his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34594:65"/>
very unwillingness to sin, while he commits it, is so far from <hi>lessening,</hi> that it <hi>aggravates</hi> his <hi>fault:</hi> It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that he sins against <hi>conscience</hi> and <hi>conviction;</hi> and that <hi>sin</hi> is strong and reigns.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. makes such a description seemingly of <hi>himself,</hi> as one might think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him under this state; he saith vers. 8. <hi>That sin wrought in him all manner of concupiscence:</hi> vers. 9. <hi>That sin revived, and he died:</hi> vers. 14. <hi>That he was carnal;</hi> and again; <hi>sold under sin,</hi> vers. 20. <hi>That sin dwelt in him, and wrought that which he would not:</hi> vers. 23. <hi>That the Law of his Members led him into captivity to the law of Sin:</hi> and vers. 25. <hi>That he obeyed the law of sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this be <hi>so,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man,</hi> was in <hi>this</hi> state, it will follow, that <hi>seeking</hi> and <hi>feeble endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> that overcometh no difficulty, may yet <hi>procure</hi> an <hi>entrance,</hi> and he that is come hitherto, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:34594:65"/>
is <hi>safe</hi> enough though he do not conquer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This objection</hi> presseth not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>this head,</hi> but against my whole Discourse, and the Text it self. Therefore to answer it, I say, That the St. <hi>Paul</hi> here is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of <hi>himself;</hi> He describes the <hi>state of</hi> a convinced, but <hi>unregenerate man,</hi> though he speaks in the first person; a <hi>Figure</hi> that was ordinary with <hi>this</hi> Apostle, and <hi>frequent</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in common speech: Thus we say, <hi>I am thus,</hi> and <hi>thus,</hi> and did <hi>so,</hi> and <hi>so,</hi> when we are describing a state, or actions in which perhaps we, in person, are not concerned.</p>
                  <p>In this sense the best Expositors understand these expressions, and those excellent Divines of our own, Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and others have noted to us, That this <hi>description</hi> is directly contrary to all the <hi>Characters</hi> of a <hi>regenerate man,</hi> given elsewhere by <hi>this,</hi> and the other Apostles. As he is said to be <hi>dead to</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:34594:66"/>
sin, <hi>Rom. 6. 11.</hi> Free from sin, <hi>and the</hi> servant of Righteousness, <hi>Rom. 6. 18. That</hi> he walks not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit, <hi>Rom. 8. 1.</hi> That the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, hath made him free from the Law of sin and death, <hi>Rom. 8. 2.</hi> That he overcometh the world, <hi>Joh. 5. 4.</hi> He sinneth not, <hi>1 Joh. 3. 6.</hi> He hath cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the flesh with its affections and lusts, <hi>Gal. 5. 24. Which</hi> Characters <hi>of a</hi> truly regenerate <hi>person, if they be compared with those above-cited out of</hi> Rom. <hi>7. it will appear, that they are as contrary, as 'tis possible to speak, and by this, 'tis evident that they describe the</hi> two contrary states.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For can the</hi> regenerate <hi>be</hi> full <hi>of all</hi> manner <hi>of</hi> concupiscence, <hi>and at the same time be</hi> crucified to the Flesh, <hi>and its</hi> affections <hi>and</hi> lusts? one in <hi>whom</hi> sin revives while he dies; <hi>and yet one that is</hi> dead to sin? carnal, <hi>and yet</hi> not walking after the flesh, but after the Spirit? sold under sin, <hi>and</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:34594:66"/>
yet <hi>free from sin? Having sin dwelling in him; and a captive to sin; and obeying the Law of sin;</hi> and yet <hi>free from the law of sin and death?</hi> how can these things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist? To tell us, <hi>'Tis so,</hi> and <hi>'tis not so,</hi> and to twist such <hi>contradictions</hi> into <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Paradoxes,</hi> are pretty things to please <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi> but <hi>wise men</hi> care not for <hi>riddles</hi> that are not sense. For my part I think it clear, that the Apostle in that mistaken Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, relates the <hi>feeble, impotent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of <hi>one</hi> that was <hi>convinced</hi> and <hi>strove a little,</hi> but not to <hi>purpose.</hi> And if we find our selves comprised under that <hi>description,</hi> though we may be never so sensible of the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of a <hi>sinful course,</hi> and may <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> some small matter, but without <hi>success,</hi> we are yet under, <hi>that evil,</hi> and <hi>obnoxious</hi> to <hi>that danger:</hi> For he that <hi>strives</hi> in <hi>earnest, conquers at last,</hi> and <hi>advanceth still,</hi> though all the <hi>work</hi> be not <hi>done at once.</hi> So that if we <hi>endeavour</hi> and <hi>gain</hi> nothing, our endeavour is <hi>peccant,</hi> and wants <hi>Faith</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:34594:67"/>
or <hi>Prayer</hi> for <hi>Divine aids,</hi> or <hi>constancy,</hi> or <hi>vigour;</hi> and so, <hi>Though we may seek, we shall not be able to enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (3) an <hi>imperfect Striver</hi> may <hi>overcome</hi> sin in <hi>some</hi> Instances, and yet in <hi>that</hi> do no great matter neither, if he <hi>lies down,</hi> and goes no <hi>further:</hi> There are <hi>some</hi> sins we outgrow by <hi>age,</hi> or are indisposed to them by <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily infirmity,</hi> or diverted by <hi>occasions,</hi> and it may be by other sins; and <hi>some</hi> are contrary to <hi>worldly Interests,</hi> to our <hi>credit,</hi> or <hi>health,</hi> or <hi>profit;</hi> and when we have in any great degree been hurt by <hi>them</hi> in <hi>these,</hi> we fall out with <hi>those</hi> sins, and <hi>cease</hi> from them, and so by <hi>resolution</hi> and <hi>disuse,</hi> we master them at last fully: which, if we went on, and attempted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the rest, were something: But when we stop short in these <hi>petty</hi> victories, our <hi>general state</hi> is not <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> He that conquers <hi>some</hi> evil appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, is yet a slave to <hi>others;</hi> and though he hath <hi>prevailed</hi> over <hi>some difficulties,</hi> yet the <hi>main ones</hi> are yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>

sometimes it proceeds from an itch after <hi>novelty</hi> and <hi>notions,</hi> or an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be <hi>famed</hi> for <hi>Godliness;</hi> or the <hi>importunity</hi> of natural <hi>conscience,</hi> that will not be satisfied except we <hi>do something;</hi> or a desire to get mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>feed</hi> our <hi>opinions,</hi> or to furnish us with <hi>pious</hi> discourse? I say, <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> ariseth very often from some of these; and when it doth <hi>so,</hi> we gain but <hi>little by it:</hi> yea, we are dangerously tempted to take this for an <hi>infallible token</hi> of our <hi>Saintship,</hi> and so to content our selves with this <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Ear,</hi> and to disturb every body with the abundance of our <hi>disputes</hi> and <hi>talk,</hi> while we neglect our own <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and let our <hi>unmortified affections</hi> and <hi>inclinations</hi> rest in quiet, under the shadow of these <hi>specious</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>

the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>sinners,</hi> which he may frequently speak of with much <hi>earnestness</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> and have that <hi>dear name</hi> always at his tongues end to <hi>begin</hi> and <hi>close</hi> all his sayings; and to <hi>fill</hi> up the <hi>void</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when he wants what to say next; and yet <hi>this</hi> may be a <hi>bad</hi> man, who never felt those Divine things he talks of; and never <hi>loved Christ</hi> heartily as he ought.</p>
                  <p>'Twas observed before, that there are some who have a sort of <hi>Devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in their particular <hi>Complexion;</hi> and if such are <hi>talkative</hi> (as many times they are) they will easily run into <hi>such</hi> discourses, as <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> with their <hi>temper,</hi> and take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them for <hi>that</hi> reason; As also for <hi>this,</hi> because they are apt to gain us reverence, and the good opinion of those with whom we converse. And such as are by nature disposed for this faculty, may easily get it by <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and remembrance of the <hi>devout forms</hi> they hear and read: so that

there may be nothing <hi>Divine</hi> in <hi>all this;</hi> nothing but what may consist with <hi>unmortified</hi> lusts and affections: And though such talk earnestly of the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and express a mighty love to his <hi>name,</hi> yet this may be without any real conformity unto him in his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi> The Jews spoke much of <hi>Moses,</hi> in him they <hi>believed,</hi> and in him they <hi>trusted,</hi> John 5. 45.

in <hi>Three,</hi> the lik may be said of the rest. And to this, I add,</p>
                  <p n="4">(IV.) That they may not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise themselves in the <hi>outward</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of duty, but <hi>may arrive to some things that are accounted greater heights, and are really more spiritual, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</hi> To instance.</p>
                  <p n="1">(I.) They may have <hi>some love</hi> to <hi>God, Goodness,</hi> and <hi>good Men.</hi> The Soul naturally loves <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi> and all mankind apprehend <hi>God,</hi> to be of all <hi>Beings,</hi> the most <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>perfect;</hi> and therefore must needs have an <hi>intellectual love</hi> for him: The reason that <hi>that love</hi> takes no hold of the <hi>passions</hi> in <hi>wicked</hi> men, is, partly because they are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> from the thoughts of Him, by the <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>Sense;</hi> but chiefly, because they consider him as their <hi>enemy,</hi> and therefore can have no <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> in him, who they think hath nothing but thoughts of <hi>enmity,</hi> and displeasure against them. But if once they come to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34594:72"/>
(as many times, by such false marks, as I have recited, they <hi>are</hi>) that God is their <hi>Father,</hi> and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>Friend;</hi> that <hi>they</hi> are his <hi>chosen,</hi> and his <hi>darlings,</hi> whom he loved from <hi>Eternity,</hi> and to whom he hath given his <hi>Son</hi> and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and will give <hi>Himself,</hi> in a way of the fullest enjoyment; Then the <hi>Love</hi> that before was only an <hi>esteem</hi> in the <hi>understanding,</hi> doth <hi>kindle</hi> in the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> by the help of the conceit of <hi>Gods loving them so dearly,</hi> and the <hi>passion</hi> thus heated, runs out, even into <hi>seraphick,</hi> and <hi>rapturous Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> while yet all <hi>this,</hi> is but <hi>meer animal love,</hi> excited chiefly, by the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>our selves,</hi> not of the <hi>Divine Perfections.</hi> And it commonly goes no further, then to <hi>earnest</hi> expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of extraordinary love to God in our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Discourses,</hi> while it appears not in any <hi>singular obedience</hi> to his <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal love</hi> to mankind: which are the ways whereby the true <hi>Divine Love</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:34594:73"/>
is exprest: for, <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5. 3. And as to the <hi>other, thus, If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us,</hi> 1 John 4. 12. And on the contrary, <hi>If a man say I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar,</hi> John 4. 20. <hi>Charity</hi> then and <hi>universal obedience</hi> are the <hi>true</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and expressions of our love to God; and <hi>these</hi> suppose a <hi>victory</hi> over corrupt <hi>inclinations</hi> and <hi>self-will.</hi> But the other love which ariseth from the conceit of our <hi>special dearness</hi> to God upon <hi>insufficient</hi> grounds; <hi>that</hi> goes no further then to some <hi>suavities,</hi> and <hi>pleasant fancies</hi> within our selves; and some <hi>passionate</hi> complements of the <hi>Image</hi> we have set up in our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. <hi>This</hi> Love will consist with <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of all that are not like our selves; yea, and it will produce it: those poysonous fruits, and <hi>vile</hi> affections may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and cherish'd under it. So
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34594:73"/>
that there may be <hi>some love to God</hi> in <hi>evil</hi> men: But while self-love is the <hi>only motive,</hi> and the more <hi>prevalent</hi> passion, it signifieth nothing to their advantage.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>imperfect striver</hi> may have some <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> so he <hi>may</hi> to <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>vertue:</hi> every man loves these in <hi>Idea.</hi> The vilest sinner takes part in his <hi>affections</hi> with the <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>religious,</hi> when he seeth them descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in <hi>History</hi> or <hi>Romance;</hi> and hath a detestation for <hi>those,</hi> who are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter'd as <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>immoral. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> is a great <hi>Beauty,</hi> and the mind is taken with it, while 'tis consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at a distance; and our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>interests,</hi> and sensual <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are not concern'd. 'Tis <hi>these</hi> that recommend <hi>sin</hi> to our <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>choice,</hi> while the <hi>mind</hi> ftands on the side of vertue: with <hi>that we serve the Law of God,</hi> but with the <hi>flesh the Law of Sin,</hi> Rom 7. 25.

                     <hi>mental</hi> and <hi>intellectual</hi> love to <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> That is, they <hi>approve,</hi> and <hi>like</hi> it in their <hi>minds,</hi> and would <hi>practise</hi> it also, were it not for the <hi>prevalent</hi> biass of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>sense.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence it will follow likewise, That the <hi>same</hi> may <hi>approve</hi> and <hi>res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect good men;</hi> They may reverence and love them for their <hi>Charity, Humility, Justice</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> though themselves are persons of the <hi>contrary Character;</hi> yea, they may have a great and ardent affection for those that are eminently <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>devout,</hi> though they are very <hi>irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> themselves. The <hi>conscience</hi> of <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> and of the <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> may produce this in the meer <hi>natural</hi> man, who is under the <hi>dominion</hi> of <hi>vile inclinations</hi> and <hi>affections;</hi> and therefore, neither is <hi>this</hi> a good <hi>mark of godliness.</hi> Our <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God &amp; goodness</hi> will not stead us, except it be <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi> And as the <hi>love</hi> described, may be <hi>natural,</hi> and a <hi>meer animal</hi> man may arrive unto it: So,</p>

                  <p>For this we may observe, That those whose <hi>complexion</hi> inclines them to <hi>devotion,</hi> are commonly much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of <hi>melancholy;</hi> and they that are <hi>so,</hi> are mostly very <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in their tempers; fometimes <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi> to <hi>excess;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> plung'd as deep into the other extream of <hi>sadness</hi> and <hi>dejection:</hi> one while the <hi>sweet humours</hi> enliven the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and present it with all

things that are <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>agreeable;</hi> And <hi>then,</hi> the black blood succeeds, which begets clouds and darkness, and fills the fancy with things <hi>fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>uncomfortable:</hi> And there are very few but feel such varieties, in a degree, in themselves. Now while the <hi>sweet Blood</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi> prevail, the person whose complexion inclines him to Religion, and who hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the degrees newly discours'd of (though a meer <hi>natural</hi> man) is full of inward <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>'Tis <hi>true</hi> indeed, and I am far

from denying it, that holy men feel those <hi>joys</hi> and <hi>communications</hi> of the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> which are <hi>no fancies;</hi> and the Scripture calls them <hi>great peace,</hi> Psal. 119. 165. and <hi>joy in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. and the <hi>peace of God that passeth all understanding,</hi> Phil. 4. 7.

                  <p>THus I have shewn how far the <hi>meer animal Religion</hi> may go, in <hi>imperfect striving:</hi> And now. I must expect to hear,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) That this is very <hi>severe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable</hi> Doctrine; and if one that shall eventually be <hi>shut out,</hi> may do <hi>all this,</hi> what shall become of the <hi>generality</hi> of <hi>Religious</hi> men that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do <hi>so mtch?</hi> And if <hi>all this</hi> be <hi>short,</hi> what will be available? who then shall be saved?</p>
                  <p>To which I <hi>Answer,</hi> That we are not to make the <hi>measures</hi> of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> our selves; but to take <hi>those</hi> that Christ Jesus hath <hi>made</hi> for us: And he hath told us, That <hi>except our Righteousness exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, we shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. 20. Now the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> did things in the way of <hi>Religion,</hi> that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34594:78"/>
that were equal to all the particulars: I have mentioned; yea they went beyond many of our <hi>glorious</hi> Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, who yet think themselves in an <hi>high form</hi> of <hi>Godliness.</hi> They <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> their Religion <hi>firmly,</hi> and <hi>Prayed frequently</hi> and <hi>fervently,</hi> and <hi>Fasted severely;</hi> They were <hi>exact,</hi> and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>strict</hi> in the <hi>observation</hi> of their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and hated <hi>scandalous</hi> and <hi>gross</hi> sins; and were very <hi>punctual</hi> in all the duties of <hi>outward Worship;</hi> and in many things <hi>supererrogated</hi> and went beyond what was <hi>commanded:</hi> Such <hi>zealous people</hi> were <hi>They;</hi> and They <hi>separated</hi> from the <hi>conversations</hi> and <hi>customs</hi> of <hi>other Jews,</hi> upon the account of their supposed <hi>greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> and <hi>Purity. These</hi> were <hi>heights</hi> to which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> arrived; and a good Christian must <hi>exceed</hi> all <hi>this:</hi> And he that lives in a <hi>sober course</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue;</hi> of <hi>self Government,</hi> and humble <hi>submission</hi> to God; of <hi>obedience</hi> to his <hi>Superiours,</hi> and <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to his <hi>Neighbours:</hi> He doth <hi>really</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:34594:78"/>
                     <hi>exceed</hi> it, and shall <hi>enter,</hi> when the other shall be <hi>shut out.</hi> So that, when our Saviour saith, that the <hi>Pharisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick</hi> Righteousness must be <hi>exceeded,</hi> the meaning is not, That a greater <hi>degree</hi> of every thing the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did, is <hi>necessary;</hi> but we must do <hi>that</hi> which in the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> of it is <hi>better,</hi> and more acceptable to God, <hi>viz.</hi> That whereas they placed their Religion in <hi>strict Fastings,</hi> an nice observations of <hi>Festivals;</hi> in <hi>lowd</hi> and <hi>earnest Prayers,</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> to get <hi>Proselytes;</hi> we should place <hi>ours,</hi> in <hi>sincere subjections</hi> of our <hi>wills</hi> to the <hi>will</hi> of God; in <hi>imitation</hi> of the life of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> of his Laws; in <hi>amending</hi> the faults of our natures and lives: in <hi>subduing</hi> our <hi>Passions,</hi> and casting out the <hi>habits</hi> of <hi>evil: These</hi> are much beyond the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Phanatick Pharisee;</hi> not in <hi>shew</hi> and <hi>pomp;</hi> but in <hi>real</hi> worth, and <hi>divine esteem.</hi> So that, upon the whole, we have no reason to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, because They that do <hi>so</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:34594:79"/>
                     <hi>much</hi> are <hi>cast out;</hi> since, though we find not those <hi>heats,</hi> and <hi>specious</hi> things in our selves which we observe in <hi>them,</hi> yet if we are more <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>modest,</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi> and <hi>charitable,</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> our case is <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and we have the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> when theirs is but the <hi>Form;</hi> And <hi>we,</hi> whom They accounted <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> shall <hi>enter;</hi> while <hi>they,</hi> the presumed <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,</hi> shall be <hi>shut out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (2.) I expect it should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain objected against this severity of Discourse, That our Saviour saith, Mat. 11. 20. <hi>That his yoke is easie, and his burden is light:</hi> which place seems to cross all that hath been said about the Difficulties of Religion. And 'tis true it hath such an <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> but 'tis <hi>no more;</hi> For the words look as <hi>cross</hi> to the <hi>expressions</hi> of the same Divine Author; concerning the <hi>straightness</hi> of the <hi>Gate,</hi> and <hi>narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>Way,</hi> as to any thing I have delivered from those <hi>infallible</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:34594:79"/>
                     <hi>sayings.</hi> Therefore to remove the <hi>sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> of <hi>contrariety,</hi> which the <hi>object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Text</hi> seems to have to those <hi>others,</hi> and to my Discourse, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
                  <p>That when our Saviour saith, that his <hi>yoke</hi> is <hi>easie,</hi> the word we read is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which signifieth <hi>very good, excellent, gracious;</hi> and the meaning I suppose is, That his Precepts had a <hi>native beauty</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> in them; That they are <hi>congruous</hi> and <hi>sutable</hi> to our reasonable Natures, and <hi>apt</hi> instruments to make us <hi>happy;</hi> In which sense, <hi>this</hi> expression hath no <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy</hi> to the <hi>Text,</hi> or to any thing I have said. And whereas 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, [<hi>My Burden is light</hi>] I think by this, we are to understand, That his <hi>Commands</hi> are not of that <hi>burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> nature, that the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Laws were: Those were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cumbersome, and had nothing in their nature to make them <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>agreeable;</hi> whereas his Religion had no <hi>expensive, troublesome</hi> Rites ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34594:80"/>
to it; nor did it require a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but our observation of those <hi>Laws</hi> which eternal <hi>Reason</hi> obligeth us to, and which of our selves we should choose to live under, were we freed from the <hi>intanglements</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>interests</hi> of <hi>Flesh.</hi> So that neither doth this <hi>Objection</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any thing against the scope of my Discourse.</p>
                  <p>AND now I descend to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi> of what I have said; and the things I have to add will be comprehended under these two Generals (1.) <hi>Inferences,</hi> and (2.) plain <hi>Advice</hi> in order to practise. I begin with the <hi>Inferences</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries</hi> that arise from the whole Discourse. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) We may collect, <hi>What is the state of Nature;</hi> and <hi>What the state of Grace.</hi> We have seen that 'tis the <hi>great</hi> business of <hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>overcome evil Inclinations,</hi> and the prevailing <hi>influence</hi> of <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>passion,</hi> and <hi>evil</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:34594:80"/>
                     <hi>customs</hi> and <hi>example</hi> and worldly <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi> And therefore the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> consists in the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency</hi> of <hi>These. This</hi> is that the Scripture calls the <hi>Old man,</hi> Eph. 4.22. The <hi>Image of the earthy,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>Flesh,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. <hi>Death,</hi> Rom. 7.24. <hi>Darkness,</hi> Joh. 3. 19. <hi>and old leven,</hi> 1 Cor 5. 7. On the contrary, <hi>The state of Grace</hi> is a state of <hi>sincere striving</hi> against them; which if it keeps on, ends in <hi>Victory.</hi> And this is call'd <hi>Conversion,</hi> Acts 3. 19. and <hi>Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> while 'tis in its first motions; And the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20. The <hi>Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 16. <hi>Light,</hi> Ephes. 5. 8. and <hi>Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. when 'tis arriv'd to more <hi>compleatness</hi> and <hi>perfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For our fuller understanding this, we may consider, That Grace is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (1.) for <hi>Divine favour;</hi> (2.) for <hi>Christian Vertue.</hi> As it signifies <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour,</hi> so it is used,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) For those <hi>helps</hi> and <hi>aids</hi> God
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34594:81"/>
affords us, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> Joh. 1. 17. and the <hi>influences</hi> of <hi>his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 9. In this sense we are deliver'd from the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Baptism, viz.</hi> We are intituled to <hi>divine helps,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi> for we are born in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>importence,</hi> and <hi>weakness,</hi> and <hi>destitution</hi> of <hi>spiritual assistances;</hi> This is the <hi>world</hi> of <hi>meer nature;</hi> But then in <hi>Baptism,</hi> we are brought into the <hi>world</hi> of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> that is, are put under its <hi>influences,</hi> and are assured of its <hi>aids,</hi> and so are <hi>morally born again;</hi> Not that this <hi>Regeneration</hi> alone will <hi>save</hi> us, without our endeavours; it imports only an <hi>external relation,</hi> and right to <hi>priviledges,</hi> and by <hi>these</hi> we may be powerfully <hi>assisted</hi> in our <hi>striving,</hi> if we use them.</p>
                  <p>But then (2.) <hi>Grace,</hi> as it signifies <hi>divine favour,</hi> implies his <hi>special</hi> love and kindness, such as he vouchsases to holy and vertuous men; so that we may observe that there may be a <hi>distinction</hi> between a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:34594:81"/>
and a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>salvation.</hi> A state of <hi>Grace,</hi> in the former sense, is a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition assisted</hi> by the <hi>influences</hi> of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> and all <hi>baptized</hi> persons are in <hi>that.</hi> But if they <hi>use</hi> not those <hi>helps,</hi> they are not in Gods <hi>special</hi> favour; and so not in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> But when those <hi>assistances</hi> are duly imployed, and join'd with our <hi>sincere endeavour,</hi> then the person so using them, is in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> also; and in God's special love and favour. Thus of the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> sense, as taken for <hi>divine favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The word is also used for <hi>Christian Vertue,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. and <hi>Vertue</hi> is call'd <hi>Grace,</hi> because 'tis wrought in us by the <hi>assistance</hi> of Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which are <hi>divine</hi> favours; and to be in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> in <hi>this</hi> sense, is to be a <hi>virtuous</hi> man, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth <hi>divine</hi> aids, and intitles to <hi>divine love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things I have taken an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34594:82"/>
thus briefly to state; because there is oft-times much confusion in mens discourses about <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> from which much trouble and many controversies have arisen. And by what I have said also in these brief hints, the doctrine of our Church in the office of <hi>Baptism,</hi> may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood clearly, and will appear to be very <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the <hi>petty</hi> exceptions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Dissenters.</p>
                  <p n="2">(II.) I may infer, <hi>That the great Design of Religion and the Gospel is to perfect humane nature.</hi> The <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of our <hi>natures,</hi> consists, in the <hi>subjection</hi> and <hi>subordination</hi> of the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> to the <hi>Mind,</hi> as it is enlightned, and directed by the <hi>divine Laws,</hi> and those of <hi>Reason.</hi> This is the state of <hi>integrity,</hi> in which we were <hi>first</hi> made; and we lost it by the rebellion of our <hi>senses</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour powers, which have usurpt the <hi>government</hi> of us ever since. Here
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34594:82"/>
is the <hi>imperfection,</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> of our <hi>natures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Religion designs to <hi>remove</hi> and <hi>cure these;</hi> and to restore us to our first, and happy state. Its business is not to reform our looks, and our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; or to model our actions, and gestures into a devout appearance; not only to restrain the practice of open prophaness and villany; nor to comfort us with the assurance of Gods loving us we know not why: But to <hi>cure</hi> our <hi>ill natures,</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> our <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions,</hi> to <hi>moderate</hi> our <hi>desires,</hi> to throw out <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> and all <hi>uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> surmisals, with the other <hi>spiritual</hi> sorts of wickedness; and thereby to make us <hi>like</hi> unto God, in whom there is no shadow of <hi>sin,</hi> or <hi>imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> and so to render us fit objects of his <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that whatever doth not tend to the making us, some way or other <hi>really better: better</hi> in our <hi>selves,</hi> and better in all <hi>Relations,</hi> as <hi>fathers,</hi> and children, and <hi>husbands</hi> and <hi>wives,</hi> and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34594:83"/>
                     <hi>subjects,</hi> and <hi>governours,</hi> and <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> and <hi>friends,</hi> is not Religion; It may be a <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> but 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> And where we see not <hi>this effect</hi> of Religion, let the professor of it be never so <hi>high</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> in his profession, we may yet conclude that either his <hi>Religion</hi> is not <hi>good,</hi> or that he only <hi>pretends,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> hath it not.</p>
                  <p>This I take to be a consideration of great moment and great certainty, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christian Religion aims at the <hi>bettering</hi> and <hi>perfecting</hi> of our natures. For the things it commands relate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>worship</hi> or <hi>virtue.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of <hi>external</hi> worship are <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>praise;</hi> both which are high acts of <hi>gratitude</hi> and <hi>justice,</hi> and they fit us for divine blessings, and keep us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>sense</hi> of God, and prepare us for <hi>union</hi> with him, which is the <hi>highest perfection</hi> of which the creature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. Thus the <hi>outward</hi> acts of <hi>worship</hi> tend to our happiness; and the <hi>inward</hi> do infinitely the <hi>same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:34594:83"/>
These are, <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Fear. Faith</hi> in God supports and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves us in all afflictions, and distresses. The <hi>love</hi> of him is a pleasure and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to us in all losses and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, since he is an object most fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and satisfying; and <hi>one</hi> that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lost, except we wilfully thrust him from us. <hi>Fear</hi> of God hath no <hi>torment;</hi> 'Tis no <hi>slavish</hi> dread of his <hi>greatness</hi> and Power; but a <hi>reverence</hi> of his <hi>perfections,</hi> and a <hi>lothness</hi> to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him; and this <hi>disposeth</hi> us also for the <hi>communications</hi> of his grace, and love, <hi>Ps.</hi> 85.9. And this it doth by <hi>congruity,</hi> and its <hi>own nature;</hi> which is to be said likewise of the others. So that they would make those <hi>happy</hi> that practise them, whether they had been positively enjoyn'd, or not; And though no <hi>express</hi> rewards had been annext unto them.</p>
                  <p>There are other two acts of worship which Christianity requires, which are <hi>instituted</hi> and <hi>positive,</hi> &amp; respect Christ our Lord; They are, the <hi>Sacraments;</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:34594:84"/>
                     <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> both which are <hi>holy Rites</hi> of high significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and <hi>seals</hi> of an excellent <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> between God and us, assuring us of pardon of sins, and all divine <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi> upon the conditions of our <hi>Faith.</hi> and <hi>repentance;</hi> and more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliging us to holy <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>dependence;</hi> The only <hi>way</hi> in which we can be happy. Whence we see briefly, that all the parts of <hi>worship</hi> which Christianity binds upon us, tend to our <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>Felicity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And all the <hi>vertues</hi> that it commands do the same; both those that respect us in a personal capacity, and those others that relate to us as <hi>members</hi> of <hi>Societies.</hi> Thus <hi>humility,</hi> recommended Mat. 5. 3. <hi>Meekness</hi> blest, ver. 5. purity, ver 8. are vertues that accomplish our <hi>particular</hi> persons, and make us <hi>happy</hi> in our selves. For of <hi>Pride cometh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teution,</hi> Prov. 13. 10. And a great part of our troubles arise from stomach and self-will; which humility cures. <hi>Meekness</hi> also takes away the occasion
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34594:84"/>
of the numerous mischiefs we run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to through the <hi>rage</hi> and disorder of our passions; and 'tis in it selfe a <hi>great beauty</hi> and ornament, since it ariseth from the <hi>due order,</hi> and <hi>goverment</hi> of our <hi>faculties. Purity</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends <hi>temperance</hi> of all sorts, frees us from the tormenting <hi>importunity</hi> of those desires that drag us out of our selves, and expose us to sin, and folly, and temptation, and make us exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miserable; besides which it is a perfection that renders us <hi>like</hi> unto God, and the blest <hi>Spirits</hi> of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rank. And Christian vertues do not only accomplish, and make us happy in our <hi>particular</hi> persons, but they do the same in our <hi>publique</hi> capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the more <hi>publick</hi> capacity also; They dispose us to a <hi>quiet</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our <hi>governours</hi> without <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,</hi> and complaining; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the publique <hi>peace</hi> is secured; and all good things else in <hi>that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there are <hi>other vertues</hi> that Christianity enjoyns, which have a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34594:85"/>
more direct tendency to the happiness of others, as <hi>Justice,</hi> Mat 7. 12. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. <hi>Loyalty.</hi> Rom. 13. and <hi>all</hi> other <hi>publique</hi> vertues may, I think, be comprehended under <hi>these.</hi> Where there is no <hi>Justice,</hi> every man preys upon another, and no mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is safe, Where <hi>Charity</hi> is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Jealousies, hatreds, envying, back-bitings, and cruelties abound, which render the world deplorably unhappy. Where there is not <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>conscionable submission</hi> to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, the <hi>publick</hi> is upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of commotion, involv'd in infinite miseries, and disasters. So that all the <hi>precepts</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> are in their own nature <hi>proper instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to make <hi>us happy;</hi> and they had been <hi>methods</hi> of <hi>Felicity</hi> to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by all reasonable creatures, though they had never been required by so great, and so sacred an Authority.</p>
                  <p>These things I have said, because I could not choose but take this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to recommend the <hi>excellency,</hi> and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34594:85"/>
                     <hi>reasonableness</hi> of our Religion; And I have done it but only in brief hints, because it ariseth but upon a <hi>Corollary</hi> from my main subject, and from <hi>this</hi> I infer further.</p>
                  <p n="3">(III.) <hi>That Christanity is the height, and perfection of morality.</hi> They both tend to the real bettering, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of humane nature: But the <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>measures</hi> of <hi>moral Philosophy</hi> were weak and imperfect till <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> came; <hi>He confirmed</hi> and <hi>enforced</hi> all those <hi>precepts</hi> of vertue, that were written upon our hearts; and <hi>cleared</hi> them from many <hi>corruptions</hi> that were grown upon them, through ignorance and vice, the <hi>glosses</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>false</hi> conceits of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and he inforced them anew by his <hi>Authority</hi> and the knowledge he gave of <hi>divine aids,</hi> and greater <hi>rewards,</hi> and <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> than were understood before; yea he <hi>enlarged</hi> them in some instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; such as, <hi>loving enemies</hi> and <hi>forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuries.</hi> Thus <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> taught
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34594:86"/>
morality, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>way of living like men;</hi> And the 5. Chapture of <hi>Mathew</hi> is an excellent <hi>Lecture</hi> of <hi>this</hi> kind.</p>
                  <p>So that to disparage <hi>morality,</hi> is to <hi>disgrace Christianity</hi> it self; and to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie <hi>one</hi> of the ends of Christs coming into the world. For all <hi>Religion</hi> and all <hi>duties</hi> respect either <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> or <hi>our selves;</hi> &amp; the duties that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to these <hi>two last,</hi> are acknowledg'd <hi>moral vertues.</hi> The Apostle St. <hi>James</hi> counted <hi>these Moralities</hi> of <hi>visiting</hi> the <hi>Widow</hi> and <hi>Fatherless,</hi> to be the <hi>pure Religion</hi> and undefiled. Jam. 1. 17. And the prophet <hi>Micah</hi> intimates, that those <hi>moral</hi> vertues of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> were some of the main things that God required of us <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. Our Saviour saith that the whole <hi>Law</hi> is summ'd up in <hi>these</hi> two, to <hi>love</hi> God with <hi>all</hi> our souls, and our <hi>neighbour</hi> as our <hi>selves,</hi> Math. 22. 13 which <hi>latter</hi> contains the duties of <hi>morality.</hi> And that which the <hi>grace</hi> of God in the Gospel <hi>teacheth,</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul</hi> is, to <hi>live soberly, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:34594:86"/>
                     <hi>and godly in this present world,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, There is no <hi>godliness</hi> without <hi>morality.</hi> All the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> reckon'd up <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. are <hi>moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi> And when we are commanded to <hi>grow in grace,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet,</hi> 3. 18. <hi>vertue</hi> is partly understood. For one branch of what is call'd <hi>Grace</hi> in us, is <hi>moral</hi> vertue, produced by <hi>divine</hi> aids, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> principles, and incouragements; though 'tis true, the word is extended to those duties that relate immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God also.</p>
                  <p>By which we see how <hi>ignorantly,</hi> and <hi>dangerously</hi> those people talk, that disparage <hi>morality</hi> as a dull, lame thing of no account, or reckoning. Upon this the <hi>Religion</hi> of the second Table is by too many neglected; and the whole <hi>mystery</hi> of the <hi>new Godliness</hi> is lay'd in <hi>frequent hearing,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>seraphick talk, luscious phancies, new lights, incomes, manifestations, seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in-dwellings,</hi> and such like. Thus <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> and all kinds of <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism</hi> have made their way by the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34594:87"/>
disparagement of <hi>morality,</hi> and men have learnt to believe themselves the <hi>chosen, pretious</hi> people, while their <hi>hearts</hi> have been full of <hi>malice,</hi> and <hi>bitterness,</hi> and their hands of <hi>violence,</hi> while they <hi>despised dominions,</hi> and <hi>spake evil of dignities, rebel'd</hi> against the <hi>Government,</hi> destroyed <hi>publique</hi> peace, and endeavoured to bring <hi>all</hi> into <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery</hi> and <hi>confusions.</hi> 'Tis this diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal project of dividing <hi>morality</hi> from <hi>Religion</hi> that hath given rise and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to all <hi>these villanies.</hi> And while the Practisers of such things have assumed the name of the <hi>only Godly, Godlyness</hi> it self hath been brought into <hi>disgrace</hi> by them; and <hi>Atheism</hi> incouraged to shew it self, in open <hi>defiance</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> Yea, through the <hi>indiscretions,</hi> and inconsiderateness of <hi>some preachers,</hi> the <hi>phantastry,</hi> and vain babble of <hi>others,</hi> and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>disposition</hi> of the people to <hi>admire</hi> what makes a great <hi>shew,</hi> and pretends to more than ordinary <hi>spirituality;</hi> things are, in many places, come to

that pass, that those who teach <hi>Christian vertue</hi> &amp; Religion, in <hi>plainness</hi> and <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> without sensless <hi>phrases,</hi> and fanyastick <hi>affectations,</hi> shall be reckon'd for <hi>dry moralists,</hi> and such as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand nothing of the <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Godliness.</hi> Yea, those people have been so long used to <hi>gibberish</hi> and <hi>canting,</hi> that they cannot understand <hi>plain sense;</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> is become such a stranger to their <hi>ears,</hi> that when they hear: it spoken of in a pulpit they count the <hi>preacher</hi> a broacher of <hi>new divinity;</hi> and one that would teach the <hi>way to heaven</hi> by <hi>Philosophy:</hi> And he escapes well, if they do not say, That he is an <hi>Atheist;</hi> or that he would reconcile us to <hi>Gentilism,</hi> and <hi>Heathen Worship.</hi> The danger and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of which <hi>ignorant</hi> humour, the <hi>contempt</hi> of <hi>morality,</hi> is apparent in the whole scope of my Discourse, and therefore I add no more concerning it here; but proceed to another Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is.</p>

(IV.) <hi>That Grace and the new nature, make their way by degrees on the Soul;</hi> for the <hi>difficulties</hi> will not be <hi>removed</hi> nor the corrupt <hi>nature</hi> fubdued all at once. <hi>Habits</hi> that grow by <hi>repeated</hi> acts, time, and continuance, will not be <hi>expelled</hi> in a <hi>moment.</hi> No man can become greatly <hi>evil or good,</hi> on a <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

                  </p>
                  <p>There are some <hi>seeds</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> that God hath sown in our natures; <hi>these</hi> are excited by the Divine Grace and Spirit to <hi>convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which proceed to <hi>purposes; these</hi> to <hi>resolutions,</hi> and thence we pass to <hi>abstinence</hi> from all <hi>gross sins,</hi> and the

                     <hi>performance</hi> of <hi>outward Duties;</hi> and so at last by degrces, to <hi>vigorous attempts,</hi> for the <hi>destruction</hi> of <hi>evil habits</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</hi> When <hi>Grace</hi> is arrived to <hi>this</hi> eminent growth, 'tis very visible, as the Plant is when 'tis above the ground.

                  <p>So that to catechize men about the <hi>punctual time,</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi> of their <hi>Conversion,</hi> is an <hi>idle</hi> device, and a great temptation to <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>lying.</hi> Who can tell the exact moment when the <hi>night ends,</hi> and the dawn enters? 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage</hi> from <hi>the excesses</hi> of Wickedness, which begins in some extraordinary horrors and convictions, is sometimes very notable; but 'tis not so in <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>most.</hi> The time of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was eminent, but that change was from <hi>great contrarieties</hi> and <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,</hi> and therefore 'tis not to be drawn into instance.

cannot see the <hi>Grass</hi> just putting out of the earth; or actually growing; but yet we find that it doth both.

                  <p n="5">(V.) <hi>We see that there is an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, as well as a Divine Religion:</hi> A Religion that is but the effect and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification</hi> of <hi>complexion, natural fear</hi> and <hi>self-love.</hi> How far <hi>these</hi> will go, we have seen, and how short it will prove in the end.

                  <p n="7">(VII.) It may be collected from our Discourse, <hi>Wherein</hi> the <hi>Power of Godliness</hi> consists, viz. <hi>In a progress to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection, and an intire victory over all the evils of our Natures.</hi> The <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Godliness</hi> are not only in the <hi>ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal actions of <hi>feigned</hi> Piety; But all the <hi>fine</hi> things of the <hi>Animal</hi> Religion are of <hi>this kind;</hi> and they are the <hi>worst</hi> sort: By the <hi>grosser Forms</hi> men hardly deceive <hi>others;</hi> by <hi>these</hi> they effectually <hi>gull themselves.</hi> So that many that vehemently <hi>oppose Forms,</hi> are the greatest <hi>Formalists. Forms</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:34594:93"/>
of Worship may well agree with the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godliness;</hi> whenas <hi>zeal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Forms,</hi> may be a <hi>Form</hi> it self; whatever makes <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and doth not make us <hi>better,</hi> that's a <hi>Form,</hi> at least to <hi>us.</hi> There are <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Forms,</hi> as well as those of the other sort, and <hi>these</hi> are most <hi>deadly. Poyson</hi> is worst in <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> He that speaks his Prayers <hi>ex tempore</hi> with <hi>vehemence</hi> and <hi>lowdness,</hi> if he strive not against his <hi>ill nature</hi> and <hi>self-will,</hi> is as much a <hi>Formalist,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> that tells his <hi>Prayers</hi> by his <hi>Beads,</hi> and understands not one word he saith. And those that run away from <hi>Forms</hi> in <hi>Churches,</hi> meet more dangerous <hi>ones</hi> in <hi>Barns</hi> and <hi>private corners. Orthodox Opinions, devout Phrases, set Looks, melting Tones, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Sighs,</hi> and <hi>vehement Raptures,</hi> are often meer <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> that proceed from the <hi>Animal</hi> Religion, which it self is a <hi>Form</hi> likewise. O that the observers of so many <hi>motes</hi> in their Brethrens <hi>eyes,</hi> would learn
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34594:94"/>
to throw out the <hi>Beames</hi> of their own!</p>
                  <p>The Form of Godliness that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it self to be <hi>no more,</hi> is not so <hi>hurtful:</hi> But the <hi>Formes,</hi> that call themselves the <hi>Power,</hi> are <hi>deadly.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Formality</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists</hi> that keeps on the <hi>Separation: They</hi> contend for <hi>phancies</hi> and <hi>arbitrary</hi> trifles; <hi>We</hi> for <hi>order</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> The people are abused by <hi>names,</hi> and being frighted by the <hi>shadows</hi> of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi> and <hi>Formality,</hi> they run into the worst <hi>Formality,</hi> and silliest <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> in the World. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven consists not in meats and drinks,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. neither in <hi>Circumcision,</hi> nor <hi>Vncircumcision,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 19. not in <hi>zeal for</hi> little things, nor in <hi>zeal against</hi> them; both the one and the other are equally <hi>formal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>power</hi> of Religion lies in <hi>using</hi> Divine <hi>aids heartily</hi> and <hi>constantly,</hi> in order to the overcoming the <hi>Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of our <hi>way.</hi> This <hi>Godliness</hi> is not exercised so much in <hi>reforming</hi>

                     <hi>others,</hi> as <hi>our selves:</hi> The chief design is to govern <hi>within,</hi> and not to make Laws for the <hi>World without us,</hi> This is that <hi>Wisdom</hi> that is from <hi>above,</hi> which is <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>peaceable.</hi> Jam. 3. 17. It makes no <hi>noise</hi> and bluster abroad, but quietly minds its own business at home.</p>
                  <p>So that certainly the <hi>best</hi> men have not always had the greatest <hi>fame</hi> for <hi>Godliness;</hi> as the <hi>wisest</hi> have very seldom been the most <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> They are the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Religion</hi> that make the <hi>biggest fhew.</hi> The voice of true Religion is <hi>heard in quiet,</hi> it sounds not in the corners of the street.

the <hi>way</hi> is <hi>streight,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>certain;</hi> or if it were otherwise, who would not venture his pains upon the <hi>possibility</hi> of such an <hi>issue?

                  <p>Let us then arise in the strength of <hi>Faith,</hi> and in the encouragement of <hi>those aids,</hi> and attempt with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage upon the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of our way.

                  <p>All <hi>Creatures</hi> are <hi>diligent</hi> in serving the Designs of Providence; the <hi>Heavens</hi> are in restless <hi>motion,</hi> and the <hi>Clouds</hi> are still carrying about their <hi>fruitful Waters;</hi> the <hi>sluggish Earth</hi> it self is always putting forth in variety of <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>Grass,</hi> and <hi>Flowers;</hi> the <hi>Rivers</hi> run towards the Sea, the <hi>Brooks</hi> move towards <hi>them,</hi> and the <hi>Sea</hi> within it self.

                  <p>The Sum is, <hi>All things</hi> are inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly <hi>moving towards an End;</hi> and Happiness is <hi>ours,</hi> which therefore should ingage our most careful Thoughts, and most active Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</p>

assure us that we shall neither fail of the <hi>things</hi> we <hi>seek,</hi> nor of the <hi>pleasure</hi> that we <hi>expect</hi> from them. And why then do we <hi>lazily</hi> sit down, and with the Sluggard say, <hi>There is a Lion in the way,</hi> while we despise greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, when vain things are to be sought? The Merchant doth not give off, because there are Storms, and the numerous Dangers of the Deep to be met with in his way to the <hi>Indies;</hi> nor the Souldier lay by his Arms, because of the hazards and toils of War. And do we act <hi>courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> for <hi>petty purchases;</hi> and faint and despond when we are to <hi>strive</hi> for <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Glories?</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed our own <hi>natural</hi> strength is <hi>small,</hi> in proportion to the <hi>Difficulties</hi> we are to encounter; but the <hi>Grace of God is sufficient for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. and we may do all things through Christ that strengthens us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13.

                  <p>For this we may be sure of, that <hi>God will never be wanting to us,</hi> if we are not <hi>so</hi> unto our <hi>selves,</hi> So that the case as to our <hi>natural inability,</hi> and the <hi>assistance</hi> of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> seems to be thus.

and <hi>Affections,</hi> our own <hi>unaided</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are too <hi>little</hi> for that <hi>great</hi> force: but the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is with us, It breaths upon us, and is ready to assist, if we are <hi>so</hi> to use it, and by the superaddition and ingagement of those blessed Aids, there is no evil in our natures but may be overcome.

and <hi>delightsome.</hi> Those very <hi>toils</hi> will be <hi>grateful;</hi> there is scarce any great <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>pleasure,</hi> but where there is some <hi>Difficulty</hi> and <hi>Pain.</hi> Even our <hi>Work</hi> it self will be <hi>Wages.</hi> And 'tis not only the <hi>End</hi> of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is <hi>pleasantness,</hi> but the <hi>very way,</hi> Prov. 3. 17. So that though we are call'd upon to <hi>strive,</hi> and to <hi>run,</hi> and to <hi>fight,</hi> (which words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Labour) yet we are not required to Quit our <hi>pleasures,</hi> but to <hi>change</hi> the <hi>objects</hi> of them; to leave the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi> of <hi>Swine</hi> for <hi>those</hi> of <hi>Angels; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual</hi> for <hi>spiritual</hi> Satisfactions.</p>
                  <p>Thus all things encourage, and invite us to <hi>strive;</hi> God calls upon us, and our own <hi>Interests</hi> call; <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> came to ingage us to this Work, and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> waits to assist it. If notwithstanding all this, we <hi>sit still,</hi> our Negligence will be <hi>inexcusable</hi> and <hi>fatal:</hi> or if we <hi>arise</hi> and go a <hi>little</hi> forward, and then lay us down to take our <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>rest,</hi> our state (in the judgment

of one that knew) will be worse, more <hi>desperate,</hi> and <hi>excuseless,</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 21.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Conclude</hi> all then, in the words of the Blessed <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my beloved Brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your Labour is not in vain in the Lord:</hi> To him be Glory and Honour henceforth, and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
