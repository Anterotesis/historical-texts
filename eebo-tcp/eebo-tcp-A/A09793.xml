            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To my verie good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Master Luke Clapham con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of minde in this life, and continuance of ioy in the life to come.</head>
            <p>SIR, after I had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall Treatise, (which was my chiefe woorke these long Winter nightes:) I purposed to send the written copy vnto you, not minding then to publish it. Howbeit being since perswaded that it might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to others (considering the necessitie of the argument) I haue now made that common to al which
<pb facs="tcp:19836:4"/>
at the first was intended onely to you, wherein whatsoeuer my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, I can hardlie excuse my selfe of rashnes in publishing it to the view and censure of the learned, &amp; skilfull in the French tongue (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of my selfe haue but a tast) who will easilie perceiue my wants, &amp; errors in the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet seeing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes that endeuor supplieth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of sufficiencie, and a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning counteruaileth a bad perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: J haue at all aduentures (as you see) stripped this morall treatise out of a rich French attire into a poore English weed, (I would be loth that some French man should take it as an iniurie) thrusting it out to
<pb facs="tcp:19836:4"/>
the eie of the world vnder your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, being the first fruites of my labour in this kind, not doubting of your fauourable acceptance thereof, as proceeding from him, that in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and dutie is most bownd vnto you, and to whom he oweth himselfe and all that hee hath.</p>
            <p>If the paines I haue taken herein may either please or profit the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I shall bee glad: if both, I require no more. Jf neither, yet for the first time, <hi>Sit voluisse satis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus in my hartie praiers I commend you with my good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, whom J beseech to send yee manie happie yeares to your ioy

               <hi>A Philosophicall treatise,</hi> concerning the quietnes of the minde.</head>
            <p>Plutarch to Paccius health, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Receaued your letter verie lately, wherin you desire mee to write some thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you cocerning the quietnes of the mind, and with all, touching certaine places of <hi>Platoes Timaeus,</hi> which seeme needfull of a most diligent expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. It chaunced at the same time, that <hi>Eros</hi> our familiar friend had occasion to saile with speede towards Rome, about certaine letters which hee had receiued of the most vertuous gentleman <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> who therein was verie earnest to haue him depart forth with, and to come vnto him. So wanting sufficient time to
<pb facs="tcp:19836:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
emploie in the matter, which you desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and vnwilling, that he departing from mee, should come vnto you with emptie handes: I haue drawne togither summarily out of notes, and remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (which I had long since collected for mine owne priuate vse) certaine senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces touching the tranquillitie of the mind, perswading my self that you haue not required this discourse, to the ende that you might take pleasure in reading a treatise well and eloquentlie written, but onely to serue you at need, knowing verie well, that to get the fauour of great men, and to be reported a good speaker, and as eloquent a pleader of causes in the Pallace, as anie one in Rome: you do not for al this, as <hi>Merops</hi> the Tragedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who wearieth &amp; consumeth himselfe with vainglorie to please the humour of the popular sort (which therfore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily account you happie:) but I doubt not that you keepe wel in memoric the speach which you haue oft times heard me vse, that neither a noblemans shoe healeth the gout in the foot, nor a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:19836:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ring, the crampe in the finger, nor a Diadem, the paine in the head. For how serueth store of wealth, great honors, or credit in Court, to free the minde from trouble, and to make a mans life peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if (<hi>That</hi>) be not within, which can <note place="margin">Reason.</note> vse it vertuouslie, and if it be not alwaies accompanied with contentment, which neuer wisheth that it hath not. And what other thing is <hi>That,</hi> but onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, accustomed &amp; exercised in bridling straightwaies the vnreasonable part of the minde, which easily, and oft times passeth hir bowndes, so that it cannot wander abroad at hir owne pleasure, nor be carried about after hir own appetites. Wherefore as <hi>Xenophon</hi> doth warne men to be mindfull of the gods, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them, especiallie when they are in prosperitie, to the ende, that in time of necessitie they may be more assured to reclaime them, as hauing bin long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fauourable and frendlie vnto them: So ought wise, and discreete men to make prouision of reasons, which may serue to defend them against passions, so
<pb facs="tcp:19836:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that hauing them prepared before hand, they may be more auaileable, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> need requireth. For euen as dogges which are fierce by nature do grin and barke at euerie straunge noise they heare, and are not appeased, but with the sownd of that voice which is familiar vnto them, and with which they are acquainted: So is it not an easie matter, to bring back to reason, the wilde wandering passions of the minde, vnlesse we haue a fit, and familiar bridle at hand, that may checke them, as soone as they begin to stirre.</p>
            <p>As for them, which say, that if wee would liue quietlie, we should not deale with manie matters either priuate, or publick: First I say that they would sel vs this tranquillitie too deerlie, which will <note place="margin">Idlenes.</note> haue vs buy it with the price of idlenes, which is as much, as if they should warne euery man, as being sicke, euen as <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctra</hi> doth her brother <hi>Orestes.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>Continue quiet, wretched in thy bed.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>But this were an ill medicine for the bodie, which to case the paine thereof must take away the feeling: neither is
<pb facs="tcp:19836:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he a better Phisition for the minde, who to take all disquiet from it, would make it idle, effeminate, forgetfull of all dutie towards friends, kindred and countrey.</p>
            <p>Wee see then it is vntrue that their mindes are setled, and quiet, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedle not with manie matters. For if it were so, then must we say, that women liue more contented, and lesse troubled than men, considering that for the most part they stirre not out of the house. But verie true it is, as the Poet <hi>Hesiodus</hi> saith.</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>The percing winde, that from the North doth passe.</l>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>But greefes, cares, vexations, and discontentments, be it through iealousy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superstition, ambition, or proceeding from vaine opinions, and conceites, that <note place="margin">3 especiall causes of womens discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</note> are almost innumerable, do easilie rush euen into Ladies closets, and bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And <hi>Laertes,</hi> which liued solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie in the countrie for the space of twentie yeares.</p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:19836:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  <l>Alone with one olde woman that hee had.</l>
                  <l>To dresse his meat he liu'd pensiue &amp; sad.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Albeit he separated himselfe far from his countrie, from his house, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet he alwaies carried griefe, and sadnes in his hart, which are euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with idle discontentment, and pensiue silence.</p>
            <p>Moreouer there are some which say, that not to bee emploied in affaires is oft times cause of displeasure, and the disquiet of a mans minde, As appeareth by the discontented Greeke, whom <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> describeth.</p>

And in so dooing men shall not finde so much difficultie herein, as they weene.

            <p>Not knowing how much this practise auaileth to the quiet, and contentment of the minde, whereby we may bee able with open eies firmlie to looke against Fortune, making our conceits and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, not idle, or effeminat in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as being nourished onely by a shadow, vnder such kinde of hope, as yeeldeth, &amp; bendeth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed downe by their contraries, &amp; neuer standing stiffe or vnflexible against anie one of them. But we may also obiect &amp; say against <hi>Menander,</hi> It is true, that no man liuing can say. This shall neuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to me. And yet I may saie; As long as I liue I will neuer do this, I will neuer
<pb facs="tcp:19836:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tell vntruth, I will neuer deceaue, I will neuer falsifie my faith, I will neuer sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise anie man. For this being in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is no small meane, but a great helpe to the quietnes of the minde. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise the remorse of conscience (<hi>I know that I haue committed such a heinous</hi>

               <hi>offence</hi>) doth leaue repentance in the soule, which grateth, tormenteth, and bloodieth it selfe, euen as a wound in the flesh. For reason taking away, and wiping out all other greefes, sorrowes, and anguishes doth engender this repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which with shame nippeth and byteth, and with horror afflicteth and punisheth it selfe continuallie. Euen as they who being sicke of an ague do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shake for cold or burne with heate, are more greeued and tormented, then they which endure the same passions by outward causes of winters cold, or Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers heat: so casuall and accidentall mishaps make our griefs more easie, and tolerable, as proceeding from external causes, and from without vs. But when one saith, <hi>None other is to bee blamed for</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19836:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>this, my selfe alone am the cause hereof.</hi> This is a custome, and kinde of sorrow, &amp; lamentation comming from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the hart, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we know our selues guiltie of some publicke crime, wherby the griefe is so much the greater, in that it is conioined with shame, and infamy. And therefore there is neither house nor landes, nor great store of gold &amp; siluer, nor honor and noblenes of blood, nor greatnes of office, and estate, nor the grace and vehemencie of speach, which doth so much lighten, and so sweetlie becalme the life of man, as an vndefiled <note place="margin">A pure minde maketh a sweete conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life.</note> conscience, to haue the mind pure, neat, and cleane of all lewd deedes, motions, and deuises, and our names which are the spring from whence al vertuous, and commendable actions do follow, to bee honest, and impolluted, not troubled, or infected with any vice. This is it, which giueth a cheerefull force, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, as it were diuinely inspired with a greatnes and constancie of courage, and with a more ioyfull and assured remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, then the hope which <hi>Pindarus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19836:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
describethto be the nurse of old age. For euen as the bottels wherein there hath beene frankencense put (as saith <hi>Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>) albeit they be empty yet keepe the sweete sauour therof long after, so good and vertuous actions proceeding from the minde of a wise man, doe alwaies leaue behinde a pleasing and fresh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance wherby his ioy and delight being watered doth florish and encrease, and himselfe contemneth those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone and diffame this life, as if it were a hell or place of torments and of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall aboade, where wretched and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable soules are to be chained and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. And herein I cannot but greatlie commend the saying of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who vpon a time seeing a certaine stranger in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> that decked and trimmed himselfe against a feast day, what? (saith he) doth not an honest man thinke, that al daies are feast-daies for him? yea sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and a great and solemne feast, if he be wise.</p>
            <p>For this world is a most sacred, and <note place="margin">What the world is.</note> religious temple, whereinto Man is
<pb facs="tcp:19836:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brought at his birth to beholde therein the portratures, &amp; images, not wrought and carued with mens hands, but those formes, and figures, which the <hi>Diuine mouer</hi> hath made sensible to represent vnto vs the formes intelligible, (as <hi>Plato</hi> faith) hauing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the principal impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions of life, and motie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (that is is saie.) the Sun, the Moone, the Starres, the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning streames, casting sweet freshe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the bodie of the earth, which continually like a kind mother, yeeldeth and prouideth nourishment for liuing creatures, and plantes. So wee ought to esteeme this life as a profession, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce into a most perfect and vnited religion. And therefore it were conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that it should bee replenished with great tranquitlity and neuer ending ioy not as the common sort doe at this day, in solemnising the feast of <hi>Saturne, Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> or <hi>Minerna</hi> to delight, and sporte themselues with laughter bought with monie, which they giue to dauncers, counterfeites, and stage plaiers, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to laugh. And now at these

giue our selues any rest, comfort, or time of breathing, but (that which is worse) wee are vnwilling to receaue the good counsell, and aduise of our freendes, and kindred, that warne, and exhort vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, which if we would with patience heare, and in practise followe, we might behaue our selues blamelesse for the time present, with ioy, and pleasure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the time passed, and boldly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distrust in cheereful and liuely hope attend the time to come.</p>
