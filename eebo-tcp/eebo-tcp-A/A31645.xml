            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing my ſelf converted, I thought it was my duty to ſtrengthen my Brethren, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I have had a moſt ſtrong impulſion of the Spirit, to come and publickly declare amongſt you, what the Lord hath done for my ſoul, and this not once, but many times; But being doubtfull whether it were a Meſſage from the Lord, or the meere ſtrength of Naturall affection to my Neighbours of the Place of my Birth, my Education and Aboad: and having alwayes had a very reverend reſpect of Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> from my Infancy; I contended with that Motion, till at laſt it broke out into Letters, to deſire his Reſolution, <hi>Whether the ſprinkling of Infants were of God or Man?</hi> All the Anſwers I could obtain under his hand was, that <hi>the Matter was very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of Publick Concernment, and that he deſired to adviſe about it with others.</hi> This was the 28. <hi>January</hi> 1649.</p>
            <p>Since which time. I have ſolicited him with three other Letters, Declaring that it being his conſtant Practiſe, I knew he could not be unprovided of an Anſwer; And it being held by all Divines, is one of the Diſtinguiſhing Marks of the true Church of Chriſt from the falſe; It ought not to be practiſed doubtingly. And although it were required, that every one ſhould be ready to give an account of the Hope that was in him, and that we have all a moſt ſure Word of Prophecy, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 19. Gal. 1. 16.</note> to which we do well if we take heed, without conſulting with Fleſh and Blood; yet I had given him time to conider of it, and to conſult about it, and deſir'd that he would be pleaſed to let Mr. <hi>Caſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> or the whole Synod aſſiſt him in it, to give me an Anſwer, to give me Anſwer if he pleaſed: or Publickly to diſpute it, or to let me declare what I had learnt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, and for him or them to take their Exceptions againſt any thing, which I ſhould ſpeak contrary to the true meaning of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And that, whether he reſpected me or himſelf, his people or God; I thought it his duty in ſome way, to reſolve or convince me; with ſeverall other Arguments to the like purpoſe; But after all delayes his laſt anſwer by my Son 12. <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> delivered by word of mouth (ſo far as I may credit my Sonne) was, that he would give no other Anſwer than what was given by him at the firſt.</p>
            <p>Now, Beloved friends and Neighbours, I have written you the Queſtion and his Anſwer, wherein he confeſſeth it a matter of vveight and Publick concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Wherein he implieth himſelf ignorant, in that he muſt adviſe with others; yet ſeemes unwilling to <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> to Declare amongſt you what I finde manifeſted by the Word of God. What could I have done more in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe and reſpect to him, or mine own ſoul? Wherefore I beſeech you in the Lord, conſider your Caſe. For if the Blind lead the Blind muſt not both fall into <note place="margin">Mat. 15 14.</note> the Ditch? The Lord give you Eyes to ſee?</p>
