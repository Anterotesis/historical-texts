            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It was by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Order, that the <hi>Second Book of King</hi> Edward (which had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Parliament in the fifth and sixth years of his Reign, and been repealed in the days of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>) was <hi>Review'd</hi> in the first year of Hers <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>I will not insist on this, or on the <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Bible,</hi> and sundry other Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Matters done without a Convocation in that King's Reign: My purpose not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dispute nicely about the Authority of All Things that have been done, but only to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51363:5"/>
shew, that greater Things have, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and without prejudice to the Church, been formerly done, either by <hi>private Order,</hi> or by <hi>publick Commission</hi> or <hi>Proclamation,</hi> than <hi>giving</hi> MEER ADVICE concerning such things as are fit and proper to be laid before a <hi>Convocation</hi>; which is the present Case.</p>

               <head>II. Neither is A <hi>Commission,</hi> nor THIS <hi>Commission,</hi> prejudicial to a Convocation, but useful to it.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Commission,</hi> before a Convocation meets, is not prejudicial to it: For (besides that it has been hitherto found beneficial by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) the very <hi>Nature</hi> of it shews its Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51363:5"/>That which <hi>Commissioners</hi> do, is only by way of <hi>preparation,</hi> which saveth Time and Labour, and provideth something ready for the Convocation to go upon. In all Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that which is not to be compleated without the Major part of them, is begun by a few.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that the Methods of the Two Houses of Parliament are not exactly the same with those of the Convocation, which by using its own, does not (as a late <hi>Quaerist</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">A Letter to a Friend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some <hi>Quaeries</hi> about the <hi>New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> p. 4, 5.</note> does seem to insinuate) presume to prescribe to Them. But though the Two Houses have not that Method by a <hi>Commission,</hi> yet no Member of Parliament, who, either by Himself, or by the Advice of private Friends, prepares an useful Bill, is by either of the Houses reprehended when he asks leave to bring it in.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Convocation,</hi> the first beginning of any thing that is to be done there, cannot be made by a <hi>Committee</hi> appointed by it self. For though the Members can meet by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the King's WRIT; yet, since the <hi>Act concerning the Submission of the Clergy</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>An</hi> 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Reviv'd 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> See <hi>Append.</hi> p 21.</note> 
                  <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King's</hi> WARRANT, they cannot
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51363:6"/>
legally deliberate upon any one Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Matter. It is therefore by some Spring without the Houses, by which the King moves, both with respect to the granting a WARRANT, and to the <hi>Matters</hi> which are debated upon the Authority of it.</p>
               <p>And if the King, who might have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon His own Judgment, or upon very private Advice in this Affair, is pleased to do it by so publick and solemn an Act as That is, of issuing forth an Ecclesiastical Commission, the <hi>Preparation</hi> is the more likely to be well made.</p>
               <p>And this being but <hi>Preparation,</hi> the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not prejudg'd or limited by it. It is the subsequent WARRANT that <hi>limits</hi> or <hi>enlarges</hi> their Powers, as it pleaseth a King, and not the <hi>Commission</hi> it self. The Things which by virtue of it, are prepar'd, are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals</hi> only, not <hi>Impositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as a <hi>Commission</hi> in general, is not a just Grievance to a <hi>Convocation</hi>; so neither is <hi>This present Commission</hi> to be so esteemed.</p>
               <p>Either with respect to the <hi>Power</hi> given, or to the <hi>Persons</hi> named in it.</p>

               <p>It is true, they have been publickly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in a late Paper of Quaeries<note n="a" place="margin">A Letter to a Friend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some <hi>Quaeries</hi> about the <hi>New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> p. 1, 2, p. 4.</note> as ASSU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MING <hi>men,</hi> as men who will think themselves BOUNDIN HONOUR to defend what they shall have done; as men who have <hi>Tenderness and Moderation enough to part with any thing but their Church=Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> As <hi>Men who have a Latitude to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to a Church</hi> de Facto, <hi>which has Power on its side.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are very hard words, whosoever gave them, and proceed from a Temper ASSUMING enough, to say no worse of it.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal of Spite in them, but not a grain either of Truth, Justice, or Charity. So far are they from <hi>Assuming,</hi> that I have ground to say, They have <hi>declared among themselves,</hi> That notwithstanding the offer of their present Opinions, they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

themselves, but reserve a liberty of changing their minds, if in Convocation any cogent Reasons which they had not yet thought of, were brought before them. If they were such as that Paper represents them, yet why is it a Point of <hi>Honour</hi> to defend <hi>mere Proposals?</hi> And then I would know, by what Instances it appears that they are truly such as they are there represented, MEN <note n="(b)" place="margin">Quer. p. 4.</note>

They must needs have a great defect in their Memories, who have forgotten the time when these very Men with true Christian Courage, hazarded all that was dear to them in <hi>this world,</hi> in order to the support of this Church, and the true Religion professed in it, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to read a <hi>Declaration,</hi> which was (I believe) on purpose framed for the overthrow of our <hi>Establishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the LATITUDE with which they are charg'd; they did not show it when

they were tri'd; and now (God be thank'd) they have no Temptation to it; and I fear there may be in those who are, without cause, their Enemies, a sort of NARROWNESS that is not more commendable.</p>
               <p>They have indeed this LATITUDE in them, That provided Good be done to the Church, they would rejoice in it, though even those who are their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, should happen to have the doing of it.</p>
               <p>For their NUMBER, it is again <note n="(b)" place="margin">Quaer. p. 4.</note> said falsly and absurdly, as well as spitefully, That, <hi>as it may happen, our Church may be chang'd and alter'd, and transformed by</hi> NINE <hi>men.</hi> That number of the <hi>Quorum</hi> does, by one, exceed that of the intire Body of those who by Order <hi>review'd</hi> the second Book of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Sixth</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>; for, as <hi>Cambden</hi> (where above-cited) does assure us, there were <hi>joined</hi> with Dr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> no more than <hi>seven</hi> Persons; but <hi>six,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi>

               <p>I confess there are some Great and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Men who are not named in this Commission; Neither have we such Hopes as we most earnestly wish we could have had of their appearing in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

the time of the Establishment of such a Scheme. Upon this false Ground it was that <note n="(a)" place="margin">Hist. of Ref. p. 393. L 3. An. 1559.</note>

They are not fickle, who are constant in all necessary Things, and in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials affect not Change, but do it when Piety, and Peace, and Discretion require it.</p>

               <p>It is again granted to him, that the Church at this time <hi>has powerful Enemies</hi> 
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">P. 3. Q. III.</note>. I think it seldom is without Them. But if it do's its part in showing a true Christian Temper, I doubt not but God will disappoint their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
               <p>An Attempt is to be made towards an <hi>Union amongst Protestants,</hi> and I humbly offer those Reasons to the Consideration of better Judges, which move me to believe that <hi>This is the Time</hi> for It.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Majestes</hi> have declared their desires of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:51363:15"/>The <hi>House of Lords</hi> have given us their Sense of it, in the <hi>Bill of Union.</hi> The Bill was brought down to the House of Commons, and had a Place on the Table amongst other Bills, till their Prorogation. <hi>Toleration</hi> is already grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Statute; the Nature of which requires our utmost Application in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving our own People, and the bringing in of Dissenters, for the good of both.</p>
               <p>The Eyes of the World are upon us. All the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> are in expectation of something to be done which may make for Union and Peace. Greater numbers of the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Protestant Clergy are now here, than ever were since we were a Nation. We may consult them with Ease, and not without Benefit.</p>
               <p>No Man can be wise too late: For Wisdom would not delay what is necessary or expedient to be done beyond the due Seasons of Action. After the Year Lxi, though there were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Writs</hi> issued out for the meeting of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> yet no <hi>Warrant</hi> could be procur'd for
<pb facs="tcp:51363:15"/>
the <hi>Support</hi> and <hi>Improvement</hi> of the Church, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; much Iess were we to expect it from King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those therefore, in my Opinion, do not give wholesom Advice, who say, <hi>Do nothing now,</hi> or <hi>As little as may be. Little</hi> or <hi>Much</hi> is not the Business, but as much as is fit. And if One Opportunity be neglected, it may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Powers that offer It, from vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safing Another.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter, I have a threefold Request to make.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First</hi> is to those <hi>Church-men</hi> to whom the Commissioners and Matters in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission are not fully known, and who may have conceived some Prejudice against <hi>Them,</hi> and the <hi>Work</hi> under their Hands, by means of any Letters, or Printed Pamphlets, containing uncharitable Misrepresentations, and sent about too industriously by Those who are either Enemies to <hi>Peace,</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Persons</hi> employ'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:51363:16"/>
the making of It, or have a <hi>Zeal not according to Knowledge.</hi> I heartily pray them, That, as becomes their Holy Function, they would duly consider both <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> before they censure them, and forbear, <hi>judging before the Time,</hi> lest they offend God, and lead the People into an Error, out of which it will not be easie to bring them afterwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is to the <hi>People.</hi> I earnestly beseech Them not to give too open an Ear to any such Censures of <hi>Things</hi> which they do not yet fully understand, and which, for ought they know, may prove a great Blessing to Them; nor receive ill Impressions concerning <hi>Men</hi> who, having with <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> and Firmness in both, endeavour'd to support This Church <hi>in the late Difficult Times,</hi> are not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon any Account whatsoever, to betray It in <hi>These.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Last</hi> is to the <hi>Quaerist,</hi> whether he be of the <hi>Laity</hi> or the <hi>Clergy.</hi> I entreat him to make some Christian Reflections upon his <hi>Letter,</hi> and piously to consider whether he hath not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51363:16"/>
been angry without Cause, judged rashly, done to the Commissioners what he would not have had done to himself, and endeavoured to lead others into the like Offences.</p>
