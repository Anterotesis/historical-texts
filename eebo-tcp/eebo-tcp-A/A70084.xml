            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Bodin. de Repub. l. 1. c. ult</note>Be contented to be Stiled the <hi>Two moſt Famous Vniverſities;</hi> a Title, which it is no Flattery to give you, but Injury to deny you.</p>
            <p>I have the Studies of ſome whole dayes to ſpread before you. I am not aſhamed to confeſſe ſo much, but ſhould be aſhamed to preſent your learned Conſiderations with leſſe. And will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther runne the hazard of other mens Cenſure, to have ſtudied ſo long to no purpoſe, then to
<pb facs="tcp:40297:4"/>
be guilty to my ſelfe of ſo much diſreſpect to <hi>You,</hi> as to offer to your Patronage what coſt me but ſleight ſtudying.</p>
            <p>Indeed I examined his Examinations of my Sermon with the ſame pace that I read them. But I could not confute his Errors ſo ſpeedily as I could diſcover them, nor could I ſo ſoon make them appeare to others, as they appeared to me; and the Evidencing of his Faults did coſt me ſome Paines, whereof I hope I ſhall never have juſt Cauſe to Repent.</p>
            <p>I am altogether out of hope that my Truth ſhould quickly overtake his Error, which had the Advantage of me both at the Starting and in the Speed; And yet I beleeve what I want in the ſwiftneſſe of my Feet, I ſhall have in the Firmeneſſe of my footing. And when I overtake it at laſt, as I am ſure I ſhall, ſeeing on truths will Tire (as being better at hand then at length) I am confident by Gods Aſſiſtance, it will get firme and quiet Poſſeſſion in ſpight of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It is altogether Improper for mee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare You being Two in number to the <hi>Palme Tree</hi> under which the Propheteſſe <hi>Deborah;</hi> face;
<pb facs="tcp:40297:4"/>
But the Analogie will hold well, if I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble You to the <hi>Two Olive Trees</hi> continually dropping oyle in the Preſence of God. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks Maſter <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> his Expreſſion to the <hi>Aſſembly, VNDER SVCH A SHADE AS YOVR SELVES,</hi> making <hi>thout in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> but a Shadow, (and then what is the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Shadow worth under which hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to ſit?) was but an undervaluing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive expreſſing of their worth.</p>
            <p>I honour you as You Deſerve, and Counting You a Real and Laſting Subſtance, ſo I addreſſe my Reſpects unto you:</p>
            <p>Humbly requeſting you to be pleaſed to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize and defend this my defence: the rather becauſe what doctrines therein I deliver, not long ſince I ſuckt from One of you, and in this reſpect I beleive both Breaſts give Milke alike; And therefore as your Learning is moſt Able, ſo your Goodneſſe will bee willing to Protect the ſame, not ſo much becauſe I had them from you, as becauſe you had them from the Truth.</p>
            <p>Some perchance may blame my Choice in Chooſing You for my Protection who in theſe troubleſome times are ſcarce able to defend

Wherefore fearing Partiality might blind me in mine Owne Book (knowing that <hi>Eli</hi> was not the onely Indulgent Father to his owne Off-ſpring) I imparted my Sermon to ſome whom you reſpect, and they reſpect you: Men of ſingular Learning and Piety, to Examine it. Theſe likewiſe could diſcover no dangerous Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it, except ſuch as were dangerous for a Preacher to deliver, but ſafe for People to Receive in theſe Troubleſome Times. And I am Confident that their Iudgement was ſuch, They would not be deceived with my Falſehoods: and their Honeſty ſuch, They would not deceive me by their Flattery.</p>
            <p>And now Sir (Love cannot Hate, but it may juſtly be Angry) Conſider how your accuſing of me, to maintaine dangerous Poſitions, might, as the Times ſtand, have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done me and mine, and at leaſt have intituled mee to a Priſon, now adayes the Grave of men alive. Times are not as formerly, when Schollers might ſafely Traverſe a Controverſie in diſputation.

            <p>BEing about to read Maſter <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sermon of mine, which you (to the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers credit, and Printers ſecurity) were pleaſed to approve for <hi>Orthodox and Vſefull,</hi> mine eyes in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, were entertained (I cannot ſay welcomed) with this following note,</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Advertiſement returned to the Author, by a Reverend Divine, to certifie him touching the Licenſers allowance of</hi> Maſter Fullers <hi>late Sermon of Reformation.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Sir, <hi>To ſatisfie you concerning M. Downams approbation of</hi> Maſter Fullers <hi>Sermon of Reformation, I aſſure you I heard him complaine, that he was wronged by him, in that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken exception at ſome paſſages of that Sermon,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Fuller <hi>promiſed to amend them according to his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but that he did not performe what he promiſed.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Conclude me not guilty if I were moved, but ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe if I had not beene perplext with this accuſation. Had it beene true, I want a word bad enough to expreſſe
<pb facs="tcp:40297:7"/>
the fouleneſſe of my deed. Yea iuſtly may my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be ſuſpected of falſhood, if my practiſe be convicted of diſhoneſty. We know how the Corinthians, from the ſuppoſed breach of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſolemne promiſe, were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 17. 18.</note> to infer the falſity, at leaſt the levity of his doctrine, till the Apoſtle had rectified their miſtake. This added alſo to my trouble, that I can privately enjoy my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence with more contentment to my ſelfe, then I can publikly declare it with ſafety to others. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent therefore, all that I will returne, is this.</p>
            <p>Here is an Accuſation without a witneſſe, or a witneſſe without a name, and both without truth. Would the Inke of this reverend Divine (whoſoever he was) only hold out to blot my name, and not to ſubſcribe his owne? We know what Court was complayned of, as a great grievance, becauſe Men therein might not know their Accuſers. If it cannot conſiſt with our mutuall ſafety, to have my accuſers (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> had) <hi>face to face,</hi> yet <note place="margin">Acts 25. 16.</note> it will ſtand with equity, I ſhould have them name to name: till when, I account this nameleſſe note, no better then a Libel both on you and me.</p>
            <p>God put an end unto theſe wofull times, before they put an end to us; that all outward hoſtility being laid aſide, we may have more leiſure to attend, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to follow, that inward <hi>Chriſtian Warefare,</hi> which your paines have ſo well deſcribed.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu have almoſt converted me, to be of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſome <hi>extraordinary Light</hi> is peculiarly conferred on men in this age. Seeing what coſt me many dayes to make, you in fewer houres, could make void and confute. You <hi>examined</hi> (you ſay) <hi>the ſame pace, you read,</hi> and (as is intimated) wrote as faſt, as you exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and all <hi>in one ofternoon.</hi> This if it were falſe, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you would ſay it; and if it were true, I wonder you could doe it. However I commend your policy herein: for beſides that you have given the world notice of the Pregnancie of your parts, (and it is no fault of yours, if you be rather heard then beleeved) hereby you have done me a great diſadvantage. For if I at leiſure diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome notable errors in your examinations, you have a preſent Plea, that you wrote them ſuddenly, and I ſhall only be repaired for the wrong that you have done me, with your <hi>raptim ſcripta,</hi> whereas you had done <hi>God as much Glory,</hi> the cauſe as much good, more right to your ſelfe, and credit to me, if you had tooke more time, and more truely.</p>
            <p>And now conſider, you only endeavour to confute ſome diſmembred ſentences of my Sermon, of which
<pb facs="tcp:40297:8"/>
ſome are falſely, and more of them imperfectly alleged. You know, how in a continued ſpeech, one part receives and returnes ſtrength and luſtre unto another. And how eaſie is it, to overthrow the ſtrongeſt ſentence, when it is cut off from the Aſſiſtance of the Coherence, before and after it? Alas, this diſiointing of things, undoeth kingdomes as well as ſermons, whileſt even weake mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are preſerved by their owne unity and entireneſſe. I have dealt more fairely with you, and ſet downe your whole Examinations, thereby not expecting any praiſe, but preventing juſt cenſure, if I had done otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>If you demand why my anſwer comes ſo late, ſeeing ſo long ſilence may be interpreted a conſent. Know Sir, it was the tenth of September, before either friend in love, would doe me the favour: or foe in anger, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie, to convey your booke unto me.</p>
            <p>Whether this proceeded from the intercepting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce betwixt the City and the Country, or that your Booke was loath to come out of London: as ſenſible, that the ſtrength of your poſitions, conſiſted in the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof.</p>
            <p>When I had received one of your bookes, I had not your preſent parts to anſwer it. Men muſt doe, as they may doe: I hope, though my credit may, Gods cauſe ſhall not ſuffer by my delay; ſeeing Truth doth not abate with time. Here I ſpeake not of thoſe many afflictions, that have befalne me, as not being ſo unreaſonable, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any pitty from others, in theſe dolefull dayes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in none are at leiſure to bemoane the miſery of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, whilſt the generall Calamity ingroſſeth all greife to it ſelfe; and yet, I may ſay, ſuch loſſes could not but diſturbe my ſtudies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40297:9"/>
When I had finiſhed my anſwer, I could not ſo ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily provide to have it printed. And to ſpeake plainely, I was adviſed by my beſt friends, to paſſe by your pamphlet altogether with ſilence and neglect, and apply my ſelfe onely to enlarge my Sermon, for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others.</p>
            <p>However, that you may ſee I will not decline any thing: I have anſwered every operative paſſage in your Examination.</p>
            <p>Here I might take juſt exception at the ſentence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed in the title page of your booke, 2 Tim. 3. 5. <hi>Having a forme of Godlineſſe, but denying the power thereof.</hi> Out of the whole quiver of the Bible, could you chooſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arrow to ſhoot, and make me your marke? whom if you taxe for a <hi>meere formaliſt;</hi> God grant I may make a good uſe of your bad ſuſpition of me, endeavouring to acquit my ſelfe in Heaven, whom you have accuſed on Earth: I muſt <hi>ſtand or fall to my owne Maſter,</hi> to whom I hope I ſhall <hi>ſtand,</hi> being held up by my Saviour. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, remember, we muſt all appeare before <hi>Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat,</hi> when thoſe things which <hi>have been done in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> ſhall be brought to light. Meane time goe you on, a faſt as you can in the high way to heaven; but be not too free, willfully to daſh your fellow travellers, with foule aſperſions: for if dirt may paſſe for coine, debts in this nature, may eaſily be paid you backe againe, ſo reſteth</p>

            <head>TO MY DEARE PARISH SAINT MARY SAVOY.</head>
            <p>MY deare Pariſh, for ſo I dare call you, as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that although my calamities have divorced me from your bed and board, the matrimoniall knot betwixt us is not yet reſcinded. No not although you have admitted another, (for feare I hope rather then affection) into my place. I remember how <hi>David</hi> when forced to fly from his wife, yet ſtill cals her, <hi>My wife Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall:</hi> even when at that time, ſhe was in the poſſeſſion of <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Phaltiel</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> who had rather bedded then wedded her.</p>
            <p>This Sermon I firſt made for your ſake, as providing it, not as a feaſt to entertaine ſtrangers, but a meale to feed my family. And now having againe inlarged and confirmed it, I preſent it to you, as having therein a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intereſt, being confident, that nothing but good and profitable truth is therein contain'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40297:10"/>
Some perchance will obiect, that if my Sermon were ſo true, why then did I preſently leave the pariſh when I had preached it? My anſwer is legible in the Capital letters of other miniſters miſerie, who remaine in the City. I went away, <hi>for the preſent diſtreſſe,</hi> thereby reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">1 Cor 7. 26.</note> my ſelfe to doe you longer and better ſervice? if Gods providence ſhall ever reſtore me unto you againe. And if any tax mee as <hi>Laban</hi> taxed <hi>Iacob. Wherefore didſt thou flee away ſecretly,</hi> without taking ſolemne leave? I ſay <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 27.</note> with <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Laban, becauſe I was afraid.</hi> And that plaine <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 31.</note> dealing Patriarch, who could not be accuſed for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loining a ſhooe latchet of other mens goods, confeſſeth himſelfe guilty of that lawfull felony, that hee <hi>ſtole away</hi> for his owne ſafety: ſeeing truth it ſelfe may ſometimes ſeeke corners, not as fearing her cauſe, but as ſuſpecting her judge.</p>
            <p>And now all that I have to ſay to you, is this, <hi>Take heed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 18. Acts 17. 11.</note> 
               <hi>how you heare:</hi> imitate the wiſe and noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Doctor, or doctrine bee which teacheth, or is taught unto you. <hi>Search the Scripture dayly whether theſe things be ſo.</hi> Hanſell this my counſell, on this my booke: and here beginning, hence proceed to examine all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by the ſame rule of Gods word.</p>
            <p>Only this I adde alſo, Pray daily to God, to ſend us a good and happy Peace; before we be all brought to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confuſion. You know, how I in all my Sermons unto you, by leave of my Text, would have a paſſage in the praiſe of Peace. Still I am of the ſame opinion. The lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I ſee this warre, the leſſe I like it, and the more I loath it. Not ſo much becauſe it threatens temporall ruine to our Kingdome, as becauſe it will bring a generall ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb facs="tcp:40297:10"/>
hardneſſe of hearts. And if this warre long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, we may be affected for the departure of <hi>charity,</hi> as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were at the going away of Saint <hi>Paul, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing moſt of all, that we ſhall ſee the face thereof no more.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 20. 38.</note> Strive therefore in your prayers that, that happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which our ſinnes made us unworthy to hold, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may, through Gods acceptance thereof, make us worthy to regaine.</p>

            <p>BE not affraid to peruſe my Poſitions, though they be accuſed to bee dangerous. The Saints did not feare infection from the company of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> though he was indicted to be a <hi>Peſtilent Fellow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To acquaint you with my intentions in this Book (that <note place="margin">Acts 24. 5.</note> ſo you may proportion your expectation accordingly) Herein I have to my Power vindicated the truth: conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with my conſcience, not outward ſafety; Inſomuch that I care not whom I diſpleaſed, to pleaſe <hi>the Bird in my Breaſt.</hi> Yea when the actions of other men, have by the Examiner beene laid to my charge, I have tooke the boldneſſe to leave them to their Authors to defend. For though Honeſtie commands me to pay my owne debts, yet diſcretion adviſeth me from <hi>Solomons</hi> mouth, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void <hi>Sureti-ſhip,</hi> and not to Breake my ſelfe with being bound for the Errors of others. <note place="margin">Pro. 11. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but expect to procure the Ill-will of many, becauſe I have gone in a middle and moderate way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt all extremities. I remember a ſtory too truely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to me. Once a Jayler demanded of a Priſoner, newly committed unto him: whether or no he were a Roman Catholick. No, anſwered he: what then ſaid he <hi>are you an Anabaptiſt?</hi> Neither replied the Priſoner, What, (ſaid the other) <hi>are you a Browniſt. Nor ſo</hi> ſaid the
<pb facs="tcp:40297:11"/>
man, <hi>I am a Proteſtant.</hi> Then ſaid the Jayler, get you into the dungeon: I will afford no favor to you, who ſhall get no profit by you: Had you beene of any of the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, ſome hope I had to gaine by the viſits of ſuch as are of your owne profeſſion. Iam likely to finde no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſage, in this age, who profeſſe my ſelfe to be a plaine Proteſtant, without wealt or garde, or any Addition: equally oppoſite to all <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Sectaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me mate this with another obſervation. By the Law <hi>of the twelve Tables,</hi> if a man were indebted but to one creditor, he had no Power over his body: but <note place="margin">Bodin. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. lib. 1. p 50.</note> if he owed mony to many, and was not ſolvable, all his creditors together might ſhare his body betwixt them, and by joynt conſent pluck him in peeces. Me thinks, a good Morall lurkes in this cruell Law: namely, that men who oppoſe one adverſary alone, may come off and ſhift pretty well, whilſt he who provokes many enemies, muſt expect to bee torne aſunder: and thus the poore <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi> will bee rent into as many pieces, as the <hi>Levites</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iudg. 19. 29.</note> 
               <hi>wife</hi> was.</p>
            <p>Yet I take not my ſelfe to bee of ſo deſolate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne a Religion, as to have no fellow profeſſors with me. If I thought ſo, I ſhould not only ſuſpect, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne my judgement: having ever as much loved ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſſe of heart, as I have hated ſingularity of opinion. I conceive not my ſelfe like <hi>Eliah to be left alone:</hi> having, as I am confident, in England, more then ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, <note place="margin">1 King. 19. 14.</note> juſt of the ſame Religion with me. And amongſt theſe, there is one in price and value, eminently <hi>worth tenne thouſand,</hi> even our gratious Soveraigne, whom God in ſafety and honour long preſerve amongſt us.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt waſh away an aſperſion, generally,
<pb facs="tcp:40297:12"/>
but falſely caſt on men of my profeſſion and temper: for all <hi>moderate</hi> men, are commonly condemned for <hi>Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is true, <hi>Saepelatet vitium proximitate boni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is as true, <hi>Saepelatet virtus proximitate mali.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Lukewarmneſſe hath often fared the better (the more mens ignorance) for pretending neighbourhood to moderation: ſo Moderation (the more her wrong) hath many times ſuffered for having ſome ſuppoſed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity with lukewarmneſſe. However they are at a grand diſtance, Moderation being an wholeſome Cordiall to the ſoule: whilſt lukewarmneſſe (a temper which ſeekes to reconcile hot and cold) is ſo diſtaſtefull, that <hi>health it ſelfe</hi> ſeemes ſick of it, and vomits it out. And we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <note place="margin">Rev. 3 16.</note> theſe differences betwixt them.</p>
            <p>Firſt the Lukewarme man (though it be hard to tell what he is; who knowes not what he is himſelfe) is fix't to no one opinion, and hath no certain creed to beleeve; Whereas the Moderate man, ſticks to his principles, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Truth whereſoever he findes it, in the opinions of friend, or foe; gathering an herb, though in a ditch: and throwing away a weed, though in a Garden.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Lukewarme man, is both the archer and marke himſelfe; aiming only at his owne outward ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. The Moderate man, levels at the glory of God, the quiet of the Church, the chooſing of the Truth, and contenting of his conſcience.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Lukewarme man, as hee will live in any Religion, ſo he will dye for none. The Moderate man, what he hath warily choſen, will valiantly maintaine, at leaſt wiſe intends, and deſires to defend it, to the death.
<pb facs="tcp:40297:12"/>
The <hi>Kingdome of Heaven</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ſuffereth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> And in this ſenſe, I may ſay, the moſt moderate <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 12.</note> men are the moſt violent, and will not abate an hooſe, or haires breadth, in their Opinions, whatſoever it coſt them. And time will come, when Moderate men, ſhall be honoured as <hi>Gods Doves,</hi> though now they be hooted at, as <hi>Owles in the Deſart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Letter ſwels too great, I muſt break off. Only requeſting the reader by all obligations of charity.

In like manner wee, here mentioning Diſcretion, call it <hi>Chriſtian Diſcretion,</hi> for difference thereof, that all may know, we meane not that which deſtroyes Zeale, but that which directs it; not that which quencheth Zeale, but which keepes it in the Chimney, the proper place thereof; not that which makes it leſſe lively, but what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40297:20"/>
makes it more laſting. This Diſcretion, though laſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is not leaſt needfull in the Reformers of a Church; and muſt principally appeare in two things; Firſt, the not ſparing of the Tares for the Wheats ſake. Secondly, the not ſpoyling the Wheat for the Tares ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> The not ſparing the Tares for the Wheats ſake. By  Tares we underſtand, not only things unlawfull in a Church, but things unexpedient and unprofitable, which alſo muſt be removed. The barren Fig-tree, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 17. was condemned, not for bearing deadly or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fruit, but none at all. <hi>Cut it downe, why cumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it the ground?</hi> Gods Garden ought to bee ſo well dreſſed, as to have nothing ſuperfluous, that doth harme that doth no good therein. <hi>Hee that will not worke, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall hee eate,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 3. 10. If ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are to be found in our Church, which will not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, neither needfull in themſelves, nor conducing to decency, let them no longer have countenance in the Church, nor maintenance from it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> The not ſpoyling the Wheat for the Tares ſake, and letting thoſe things alone which are well ordered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.  Yet is there a generation of Anabaptiſts, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fewer, I hope, then are reported, yet more I fear then are diſcovered; people too turbulent to obey, and too tyrannicall to command. If it ſhould come into their hands to reforme, Lord what worke would they make. Very facile, but very foule is that miſtake in the vulgar Tranſlation, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 8. Inſtead of <hi>Everrit do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, ſhee ſwept the houſe,</hi> 'Tis rendred, <hi>Evertit domum, She overturnd the houſe.</hi> Such ſweeping we muſt expect from ſuch Spirits, which under pretence to cleanſe our Church, would deſtroy it. The beſt is, they are ſo farre from <hi>ſitting at the Helme,</hi> that I hope they ſhall ever be <hi>kept under Hatches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Now as diſcretion diſcovereth it ſelfe in the matter of 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40297:20"/>
Reformation, ſo alſo it appeareth in the manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Firſt, it is to be done with all reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ancient Fathers. Theſe, though they lived neer the Fountain of Religion, yet lived in the Marches of Paganiſme; as alſo in the time wherein the <hi>Myſtery of iniquity began to work,</hi> which we hope is now ready to receive the wages. If therefore there be found in their practice any Ceremonies ſmacking of Paganiſme or Popery, and if the ſame can be juſtly chalenged to continue in our Church, I plead not for their longer life,  but for their decent buriall.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Secondly, with honourable reſervation to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our firſt Reformers. Reverend <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Learned <hi>Ridley,</hi> Down right <hi>Lattimer,</hi> Zealous <hi>Bradford,</hi> Pious <hi>Philpot,</hi> patient <hi>Hooper,</hi> men that had their failings, but worthy in their Generations; <hi>Theſe bare the heat of the day,</hi> indeed, which were burnt to aſhes; and though we may write a fairer hand then they, yet they affixed a firmer Seal, that dyed for their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Laſtly, with carefulneſſe, not to give any juſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Papiſts. Say not, we need not to feare to offend them, who would confound us. We have ſo long waited for their converſion, we have almoſt ſeene our ſubverſion. Indeed we are forbidden to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Gods <hi>little ones,</hi> but not inhibited to offend the Devils <hi>great ones.</hi> And though S. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us to <hi>give no offence to thoſe that are without,</hi> that is meant of pure Pagans; and therefore the Papiſts being neither well <hi>within</hi> nor well <hi>without,</hi> fall not under that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. For all theſe Expreſſions ſavour more of <hi>Humor</hi> then Holineſſe, of <hi>Stomack,</hi> then the Spirit. Though Papiſts forget their duty to us, let us remember our duty to them; to them, not as Papiſts, but as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, to their perſons, not erronious
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40297:21"/>
opinions, not giving them any juſt offence. But if they will be offended without cauſe, be their amends in their own hands. If <hi>Rebeckah</hi> will come to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſhe ſhall be wellcome. But in no caſe ſhall <hi>Iſaac</hi> go back to <hi>Rebeckah, Geneſis</hi> 34. 6. <hi>Beware that thou bring not my ſon thither again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> Theſe five Ingredients muſt compound effectuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers. Where any, or all of theſe are wanting, a  Reformation will either not be made, or not long kept. Witneſſe the pretended Reformation, the Papiſts ſo much bragge off, in the laſt of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by the <hi>Delegates of Cardinall Poole.</hi> Where nothing of worth was done, but many fooliſh ceremonies enforced, and the Bones of <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Phagi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> burnt. It paſſeth for the expreſſion of mad man, <hi>to beat the aire;</hi> and it is little better to beat the <hi>earth.</hi> To fight (as they did) againſt duſt and aſhes, bodies of men long before buried: except they thought by this ſimilitude of burning dead bodies, to worke in ſilly people a beliefe of Purgatory fire, tormenting ſoules deceaſed. Now when it came into queſtion whether the Ordinances and Deciſions of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers ſhould be ingroſſed in Parchment, or in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox.</hi> Acts Monum. pag. 1064</note> Doctor <hi>Swinborne,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Clare Hall</hi> gave his opinion, that paper would doe the deed well  enough, as being likely to laſt longer then thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees ſhould ſtand in force; as afterward it came to paſſe, they being all reſcinded in the next yeer, being the firſt of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> Two things more muſt here be well obſerved. Firſt,  that there is a grand difference betwixt founding of a new Church, and reforming of an old. For the former, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> outſtript all men in the World. The Papiſts bragge much of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> who is ſaid to have founded as many Monaſteries, as there be weekes in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40297:21"/>
the yeer. Surely more Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> were built from the ground by Saint <hi>Paul, who ſtrived to preach the Goſpel, not where Chriſt was named, leſt he ſhould build upon another mans foundation, Romans</hi> 15. 20. But reforming of Churches is an eaſier work, as not giving a Church the life but the luſtre; not the birth but the beauty; either repairing what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, or removing what is redundant. Thus we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſole founder of the Temple, though <hi>Ioaſh</hi> repaired it, amending the breaches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Iotham</hi> enlarged it, adding the beautifull porch thereto; and <hi>Ezechiah</hi> adorned it, covering the pillars with ſilver therein.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> However, it is worth our obſerving, that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers  are ſometimes ambitious to entitle themſelves to be founders, as being covetous of credit, and counting it more honour to make a thing, then to mend it. Thus <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> boaſted, <hi>Daniel</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the houſe of the Kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majeſty?</hi> Whereas <hi>Babylon</hi> was built by <hi>Nimrod,</hi> or (as others ſay) <hi>Semyramis,</hi> many yeers before <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> cradle was made. Yet he, no doubt, did encreaſe, ſtrengthen, and beautifie it; on which title, ſee how he engroſſeth all the glory unto himſelfe, as firſt, and ſole founder! <hi>Is not this great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon that I have built?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Let none in like manner brag, that they are now the firſt Founders of a Church in <hi>England,</hi> built long ſince  therein, time out of minde. We deny and defile ſuch Papiſts as ſay that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monke was the firſt Apoſtle of this Iſland, where the Goſpel long before had been preached, though not to the <hi>Saxons</hi> our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, yet to the <hi>Britans</hi> our Predeceſſors. Yea, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſe to ſearch who firſt brought Chriſtianity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40297:22"/>
over into <hi>Britanny,</hi> my endeavours have been ſtill at a loſſe and left at uncertainty. Perchance as God, <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> 34. 6. buried the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> That <hi>no man knoweth the place of his Sepulchre unto this day,</hi> to cut off from the Jewes all occaſion of Idolatry; So it ſeems his wiſdom hath ſuffered the names of the firſt founders of Religion <hi>Here</hi> to be covered in obſcurity, to prevent poſterity from being ſuperſtitious to their Memories. However, if juſtly we be angry with the Papiſts for making the Brittiſh Church (a tall ſtripling grown,) to weare ſwadling cloathes againe: more cauſe have we to diſtaffe the pens and preachings of ſuch who make their addreſſes unto us, as unto pure Pagans where the word is newly to be planted. A <note n="b" place="margin">In a book of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to travel.</note> Moderne Author tels us a ſtrange ſtory, how the ſervants of Duke <hi>D. Alva,</hi> ſeeking for a Hawke they  had loſt, found a new country in the Navell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> not known before, invironed with Mountaines, and peopled with naked Salvages; I ſhould wonder if ſuch a <hi>Terra incognita</hi> could be found in <hi>England;</hi> which (what betwixt the covetouſneſſe of Landlords and the carefulneſſe of Tenants) is almoſt meaſured to an Acre. But if ſuch a place were diſcovered, I muſt allow that the Preachers there were the firſt planters of the Goſpel, which in all others places of the kingdom are but the Continuers thereof. I hope Chriſt hath reaped much goodneſſe long ago, where theſe, now, new pretend to plant it. And if <hi>England</hi> hath not had a true Church hitherto, I feare it will not have a true Church hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> The ſecond thing I commend unto you is this, That a perfect Reformation of any Church in this world may  be deſired, but not hoped for. Let <hi>Zenophons Cyrus</hi> be King in <hi>Plato's</hi> Common-wealth; and Batchelors wives breed maides children in <hi>Mores Vtopia,</hi> whileſt Roſes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40297:22"/>
grow in their Gardens without prickles, as Saint <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> held they did before the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> Theſe phanſies are pleaſing and plauſible, but the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof unfeiſable; and ſo is the perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a Church in this world difficult to bee deſcribed, and impoſſible to be practiſed. For beſides that Sathan will doe his beſt, or rather his worſt to undoe it; Man in this life is not capable of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Look not to finde that in man out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, which was not found in man in Paradiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in an holy eſtate. <hi>Martin Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, he never knew good order in the Church laſt above fifteen yeares, in the purity thereof; yea, the more perfect the Reformation is, the leſſe time it is likely to laſt. Mans minde being in conſtant motion, when it cannot aſcend higher, will not ſtand ſtill, but it muſt decline. I ſpeake not this to diſ-hearten men from endeavouring a perfect Reformation, but to keep them from being diſ-heartned, when they ſee the ſame cannot be exactly obſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> And yet there are ſome now adayes that talke of a <hi>great light,</hi> manifeſted in this age more then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.  Indeed we Modernes have a mighty advantage of the Ancients, whatſoever was theirs, by Induſtry, may be ours. The Chriſtian Philoſophy of <hi>Iuſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr;</hi> the conſtant Sanctity of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> the Catholick faith of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> the Orthodox judgement of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen;</hi> the manifold Learning of <hi>Ierome;</hi> the ſolid Comments of <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> the ſubtill Controverſies of <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> the excellent Morals of <hi>Gregory;</hi> the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Devotions of <hi>Bernard:</hi> All contribute themſelves to the edification of us, who live in this later Age. But as for any tranſcendent extraordinary miraculous light, peculiarly conferred on our Times, the worſt I wiſh
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40297:23"/>
the opinion is this, that it were true. Sure I am that this light muſt not croſſe the Scripture, but cleere the Scripture. So that if it affirmeth any thing contrary to Gods written Word, or enforceth any thing (as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation) not expreſt in Gods Word; I dare boldly ſay, That ſuch a light is kindled from Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> As for the opinion of Chriſts corporall viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to come within few yeares, I will neither pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily  reject it, nor dare abſolutely receive it.

Nor dare we receive it, not being ſafe to be familiar with ſtrangers at the firſt ſight; and this Tenent is ſtrange, as ſet common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afoot with theſe few laſt yeares. I am afraid rather on the contrary of a generall defection. Seeing the word is ſo ſlighted, and the gueſts begin to play with their meat, I feare leſt God the maſter of the feaſt, will call for the <hi>Voyder:</hi> that ſo when Chriſt comes to judgement, he ſhall <hi>finde no faith on the earth.</hi> But of things to come, <hi>little and doubtfully.</hi> If this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts corporall comming very ſhortly be true, I hope if we live, we ſhall have our ſhare therein: if otherwiſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath no cauſe to complaine, if dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he commeth not into the earthly Canaan, but into the Heavenly.</p>

                  <p>A. <hi>The Policy of the Sermon.)</hi> Such carnall Policy wherein the ſubtilty of the Serpent ſtings the ſimplicity of the Dove to death, I utterly diſclaim in my Sermon. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Policy is neceſſary, as in our Practice ſo in our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, for Piety is alwayes to goe before it, but never to goe without it.</p>
                  <p>B. <hi>But it ſo moderates and modificates.)</hi> The moſt Civill Actions will turne wild, if not warily moderated. But if my Sermon clogges Reformation with falſe or needleſſe Qualifications (till the ſtrength of the matter leakes out at them) my guilt is great.

                  <p>I <hi>How imperfect a Church.)</hi> I ſaid it and I ſay it againe; it was a Truth before your Cradle was made, and will be one after your Coffin is rotten.</p>
                  <p>K <hi>That the light that the Fathers had formerly, was as full &amp; glorious.</hi> Shew me ſuch a ſillable in all the Sermon and I'le yeeld the cauſe: Not that this Poſition is falſe but becauſe I never ſaid it; except you collect it from thoſe my words

                  <p>N. <hi>For firſt, he that conceits there can be no perfection in a Church, will ſcarce labour to make that Church better.)</hi> If

the <hi>He</hi> you ſpake of be a meere carnall man, this nor any other principle (ſave Grace and Gods Spirit) can ſpurre him on to goodneſſe. But if this <hi>He</hi> be a regenerate man, this doctrine will make him tire no whit the ſooner in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Reformation. You ſay, <hi>he will ſcarce labour,</hi> whereby you confeſſe he will labour. The Gramatian ſaith, <hi>Quod fere fit, non fit, quod vix fit, fit.</hi> One <hi>ſcarce</hi> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ten thouſand <hi>almosts.</hi> Yet I perceive by the ſcant meaſure in your expreſsion, that you conceive this Doctrine of the impoſsibility of a Churches perfection on earth, to be but a backe friend to Reformation. Heare therefore what I anſwer for my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hereby you furniſh the papiſts with a Cavill, and <note place="margin">1 The Doctrine of the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibility of a Churchesper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this world, being well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, begets not lazineſſe but the more induſtry in wiſe reformer.</note> with a Colour to enforce the ſame againſt the Proteſtants. For we teach and maintaine, that the beſt workes of men are ſtained with ſome imperfections. Hence the papiſts may inferre, <hi>That he that conceits there can be no perfection in a good deed, will ſcarce labour to doe one.</hi> And thus our Doctrine ſhall be condemned for diſheartning of holineſſe. See Sir how you meet popery in your undiſcreet ſhunning of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though there can be no abſolute perfection in a Church, yet <hi>quo ad gradum,</hi> in ſome good degree it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, and all good men will endeavour it. Mariners which make forth for the Northerne Diſcoveries, goe out with this aſſurance, that it is impoſſible to come to the pole. Yet have they ſought and found out very farre, almoſt to the eightieth degree of latitude. What covetouſneſſe or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity did in them, ſure Grace is as active to doe in Gods Children who will labour <hi>to draw neere</hi> to a perfect Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, in obedience to Gods command though they know they ſhall never fully attaine unto it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Doctrine of the impoſſibility of a perfect Reformation in this world well underſtood, begets not idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but the more induſtry in mens endeavours. For thoſe that beleeve that the perfection of a Church may be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40297:27"/>
in this life, are ſubject to this miſtake (one errour is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creative of another) to thinke that ſometimes they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have attained it, and ſo ending in the midſt of their journey, may ſit downe and take up their reſt: Whereas thoſe who conceive the impoſſibility of perfection, are kept in conſtant doing, having ſtill <hi>plus ultra,</hi> with Saint <hi>Paul, forgetting thoſe things that are behind, they reach forth to thoſe things which are before, and preſſe towards the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>marke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if it be objected that the impoſſibility of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection diſcourageth men to endeavour it, ſeeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rationally deſire it, <hi>non eſt volunt as impoſſibilium,</hi> it is no levell wiſh aimed at a marke, but a Velleity ſhot at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which deſires an impoſſibility. It is anſwered, that Gods ſervants endeavouring a perfect Reformation, doe not light on a labour in vaine, that which is wanting in them being ſupplyed in Gods acceptance: If they doe their beſt, their deſire is taken for the deed: The deformities of their imperfect Reformation being pardoned by God in Chriſt, in which reſpect, <hi>their labours are not in vaine in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſeeing this point of the impoſſibility of a Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches perfection is moſt true (as hereafter we ſhall make ſo appeare) if hereupon any grow remiſſe and large in Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, it is not the fault of Gods ſtraight Doctrine, but of mens crooked practice: For if men inferre helliſh Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from heavenly promiſes, ſuch bad conſequences are not the lawfull Children of Gods Truth, but the Baſtards of mans corruption, where they are juſtly to be fathered for their maintenance. And now I ſuppoſe that your excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe your words <hi>will ſcarce labour,</hi> is abundantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                  <p>O. <hi>Nor will he care for any new light, whilſt the old is in beſt reputation with him.)</hi> This is grounded on what I never ſaid, but if by the <hi>old light</hi> be meant that which ſhined from the Ancient of dayes into the Scriptures and thence through the Fathers to us, I preferre it before any new light whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40297:27"/>
P. <hi>A good policy to ſtay the Reformation till His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties returne.)</hi> It need not have ſtayed till His Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, which might have been done before His going away; who ſo often and ſo earneſtly offered to reforme whatſoever could juſtly be convinced to be amiſſe in our Church; which proffers had they been as thankfully accepted, as they were graciouſly tendered, long ſince it had been done what we now diſpute of, though it matters not for the ſpilling of our inke, if other mens blood had beene ſpared. And I doubt not when opportunity is offered His Majeſty will make good his word, whom no Vollyes of diſcurteſies though diſcharged never ſo thicke againſt him, ſhall drive him from His Princely Promiſe, whilſt he lookes not downewards on mens behaviour to him, but upwards to his Proteſtations to God, learning from Him whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to be <hi>Unchangeable.</hi> But if (which God forefend, and yet all earthly things are caſuall) it ſhould come to paſſe, that in point of Reformation, what formerly was proffered by the Sovereigne, and refuſed by the Subject, ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be requeſted by the Subject, and denied by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne; we ſhall have leiſure enough to admire Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, bemoane our owne condition, and inſtruct our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity not to outſtand good offers, leaſt for want of ſeeing their happineſſe they feele their owne miſery. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to your mentioning of His Majeſties return; when all is done for ought I can ſee, Reformation muſt ſtay till His Majeſties returne. As for the time and manner thereof when and how it ſhall be done, God in his goodneſſe and wiſdome ſo order it, that it may be moſt for his glory, the Kings honour, the good of the Church and State. But this I ſay againe, that till this his returning, the generall enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and peaceable practiſing of any Reformation cannot be performed.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>And then there is hope it may coole in their hands.)</hi> If by their hands you meane his Majeſties (and what elſe can your words import) it is as diſloyall a ſuſpition, as his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40297:28"/>
would be an unfitting expreſſion that ſhould ſay, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation would boyle over in the hands of the Parliament. But Sir, thus farre you have excepted againſt my Sermon in generall, now you are pleaſed to confute ſome particulars thereof.</p>

For the Church being a body conſiſting of imperfect men the Members thereof, the body muſt needs be imperfect alſo.

                  <p>A. <hi>As for Innovations they have beene made by your moſt learned.)</hi> Concerning Innovations I muſt inlarge my ſelfe. <note place="margin">That the Church of England can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly be taxed with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations.</note> In mixt Actions wherein good and bad are blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we can neither chuſe nor refuſe all, but may pick out ſome, and muſt leave the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they may better be tearmed Renovations then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, as lately not new forged, but new furbiſhed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they were not ſo many as ſome complaine. The ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious old man cryes out in the Comedy, that 600. Cooks were let into his houſe, when they were but two.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40297:30"/>
Jealouſie hath her hyper boles as well as her flattery. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome of theſe Innovations may eaſier be rayled on then juſtly reproved; namely, ſuch as concerned the adorning of Churches, and the comlineſſe of mens behaviour in Gods ſervice, where outward decency (if not gariſh, coſtly above the Eſtates of the pariſh, mimicall affected or ſuperſtitious) is the Harbinger to provide the lodging for inward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For ſome bodily diſtance brings our ſouls the neerer to God, with whom ſome have ſuch clowniſh familiarity, they have the leſſe friendſhip. Fourthly, if theſe gave of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it was not for any thing in themſelves but either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they were challenged to be brought in without law. This often makes good matters to be ill reliſhed, honeſt men if wiſe withall, being loath to pay their obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it becomes legally due.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe they ſeemed new and unuſuall, and we know how in dangerous times every well-meaning ſtranger may be ſuſpected for a ſpy till he hath given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelfe. Now few daughter-Churches had ſeen ſuch Ceremonies, though ſome of their Mother-Cathedrals could well remember them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe they were multiplied without any ſet number; and thoſe Ceremonies which men ſaw were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definit, they feared would be infinit.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe they were preſſed in ſome places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moderation. And herein ſome young men (I will not ſay ran without ſending, but) ran further then they were ſent, outſtripping them who firſt taught them to goe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, becauſe they were preſſed by men, ſome of whoſe perſons were otherwiſe much diſtaſted; how juſtly? let them ſeek who are concerned.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, becauſe men complained that painfull Preaching and pious living, the life of Gods ſervice were not preſſed and practiſed with equall earneſtneſſe, as outward decency the luſtre thereof; whence their feares inferred, that the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40297:31"/>
ſhaddowes would devoure the Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas you ſay that theſe Innovations have been made by <hi>our moſt learned,</hi> herein I muſt confeſſe that the ſcales of my skill are too little in them to weigh the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of great Schollers and to conclude who have the <hi>moſt.</hi> But this I know, that alwayes a diſtinction hath been made and admitted betwixt the opinions and practiſe of the moſt eminent particular Doctors (how great ſoever in place pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or parts) and the Reſolutions and Commands of the Church in generall. In which reſpect, what hitherto you alleadge to the contrary, doth no whit diſprove my words, that ſuch Innovations are rather <hi>in the Church then of the Church,</hi> by which they were never abſolutely enjoyned nor generally received, as alwayes diſclaimed by many, and late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſeſed by moſt.</p>
                  <p>Such indeed as uſed them out of Conſcience (I ſhould have no Conſcience to think otherwiſe of ſome) are not to be blamed if they privately practiſe them ſtill, at their own petill, till their judgements are otherwiſe informed. Such as took them up for faſhion ſake, for faſhion ſake have ſince laid them downe. Such as were frighted into them deſiſt, now their feare is removed. Laſtly, thoſe who uſed them in hope of preferment, now diſuſe them in deſpaire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not to ſay ſome of them are as violent on the contrary ſide, and perchance onely wait <hi>the Word of command</hi> from the prevalent party to turne <hi>Faces about</hi> againe. In briefe, ſeeing generally theſe Ceremonies are left off, it ſeems nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manners nor Charity, alwayes to lay that in mens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, which the Voider ſome pretty while ſince hath cleane taken away.</p>
                  <p>Say not that theſe Innovations are now rather in a ſwound then dead &amp; likly to revive, when cheriſhed with the warmth of Authority, ſeeing His Majeſty hath often and fully prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that whatſoever is juſtly offenſive in them ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and pitty it is but that the reſt ſhould by the ſame lawfull power be re-enforced. But enough hereof, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40297:31"/>
more perchance then will pleaſe the Reader, though leſſe could not have ſatisfied the Writer; If I have contented any, well; If I have diſpleaſed all, I am contented.</p>
                  <p>B. <hi>Therefore goe not on to perſwade ſuch a Fundamentall Integrity and Eſſentiall purity.)</hi> Indeed the pains may well be ſpared, for all wiſe men are ſufficiently perſwaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of already. For if hereby you meane (and I would faine learne what other ſence your words are capable of) that the Cſturch of <hi>England</hi> hath not as yet been <hi>Entire</hi> in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and <hi>Pure</hi> in the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> to Salvation. We all are in a wofull Condition. Have we lived thus long in our Church, now to dye eternally therein? Seeing none can be ſaved therein if it be unſound in the Fundamentals of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; muſt the thouſand ſix hundred forty third yeer from Chriſt's birth be the firſt yeer of the nativity of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from which ſhe may date her Eſſentiall purity? Sir, I could at the ſame time chide you with anger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane you with pitty, bluſh for you with ſhame, were it not that I conceive this paſſage fell unawares from your pen, and that you intend to gather it up againe.</p>
                  <p>C. <hi>You know in what a caſe that Church was, when ſhee thought her ſelfe rich, and full and glorious.)</hi> Good Sir, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of my ſervice to ſtay you, or elſe run on till you be ſtopt by your owne wearineſſe. Our Church never brag'd thus her ſelfe, nor any other for her; whoſe faults we have already freely confeſſed, yet maintained her to be ſound in all <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and pure in all <hi>Eſſentials.</hi>

                  <p>Before I deale with the particulars of this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will enlarge (not alter) what I ſaid in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of this point, promiſing as much brevity as God ſhall enable me to temper with Clearneſſe, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Readers patience whilſt at mine owne perill I deliver my opinion.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, here we promiſe neceſſary diſtinction. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40297:36"/>
we betwixt thoſe Times, when the Church liveth under Pagan or perſecuting Princes, and when God bleſſeth her with a Chriſtian King, defender of the Faith: In the former caſe the Church may and muſt make an hard ſhift to reforme her ſelfe ſo well as ſhe can (for many things will be wanting, and more will be but meanly ſupplyed) without any relating to a ſupreame Power, whoſe leave therein will be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to deſire and impoſſible to obtaine. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they muſt provide themſelves to ſuffer, offering no violence, except it be to drowne a Tyrant in their teares, or to burne him with coales of kindneſſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on his head. In the latter caſe, when the ſupreame Power is a nurſing Father to the Church, ſuckling it, not ſucking blood from it, the Church muſt have recourſe to it before ſhee may reforme. Reforming of a Church muſt neither ſtay behind for <hi>Nero</hi> his leave, nor runne before without the conſent of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Religion it ſelfe muſt not be deckt with thoſe flowers which are violently pluck'd from the Crownes of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princes.</p>
                  <p>Come we now then to ſhew, how in a Chriſtian ſtate, all are to contribute their joynt endeavours to promote a Reformation.</p>
                  <p>In a Church, and ſuch a State I conſider three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees thereof. Firſt, meere private men without any <note place="margin">3 How far pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Miniſters and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are to concur to the advancing of a publike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> mixture of a publike Relation. Secondly, perſons pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a middle poſture with the Centurian in publike imployment over ſome, yet <hi>under Authority</hi> themſelves. Thirdly, the abſolute ſupreame Power, who depends of God alone.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, meere private men; they have nothing to doe in publike reforming but to advance it by their hearty prayers to God, and to facilitate the generall Reformation, by labouring to amend their owne and their Families lives according to the Word;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40297:36"/>
this is all God requireth of them and more I feare then moſt of them will performe.</p>
                  <p>Next, ſucceed thoſe perſons in a middle poſture, and theſe are either Miniſters or Magiſtrates. Miniſters even the meaneſt of them have thus far their part in publike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, that they are to <hi>lift</hi> up their <hi>voice like a Trumpet</hi> (though not like <hi>Sheba</hi> his Trumpet to ſound ſedition) <note place="margin">2 Sam. 20. 1.</note> both to reprove vitiouſneſſe in Manners, and to confute er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in Doctrine. And if men of power and imminent place in the Church, then as their ingagement is greater, ſo their endeavours muſt be ſtronger, to preſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a publike Reformation to ſuch whom it doth concerne.</p>
                  <p>Magiſtrates may have more to doe in publike Reforming having a calling from God, who therefore hath ſet them in a middle place betwixt Prince and people, to doe good offices under the one, over the other, betwixt both. And having a calling from the King, eſpecially if they be his Counſellours, whoſe good they are to advance by all lawfull meanes, and rather to diſpleaſe him with their ſpeech, then to diſhonour him with their ſilence; and having a calling from their Country, whoſe ſafety they muſt be tender and carefull of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, therefore they are with all induſtry (both from the Miniſters mouth and by their owne inquiry) to take true notice of ſuch defects and deformities in the Church or State as are really to be reformed. Secondly, they are with all ſincerity to repreſent the ſame to the ſupreame Power. Thirdly, with all humility to requeſt the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Enormities. Fourthly, with all gravity to improve their requeſt with arguments from Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Princes honour, the peoples profit, and the like, Laſtly, with their beſt judgement to propound and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the faireſt way whereby a Reformation may as ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as ſafely be effected. And if they meet with difficulties in the ſupreame Power delaying their requeſt, they are not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40297:37"/>
to be diſheartned, but after their fervent prayers to God, who alone hath the hearts of Kings in his hands, they are conſtantly to renue their requeſt at times more ſeaſonable, in places more proper, with expreſſions more patheticall, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their words as full of earneſtneſſe, as their deeds farre from violence.</p>
                  <p>As laſt comes the ſupreame Power, who alone is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme by its own Authority, though not by its owne advice <note place="margin">4. What parts therein are onely to be acted by the <hi>ſupreame Power.</hi>
                     </note> alone. For becauſe it is rationally to be preſumed, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have beſt skill in matters of Divinity, they are to be conſulted with; and here comes in the neceſſity and uſe of <hi>Councels, Convocations, Synods</hi> and Aſſemblyes. And becauſe there is not onely a conſtant correſpondency, but alſo an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable complication betwixt the Church &amp; State; Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are therefore to be adviſed with in a Reformation, ſo to ſettle it as may beſt comply with the Common-wealth. For God in that generall warrant, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order;</hi> puts as I may ſay the Cloath and Sheeres into the hands of the Church and Chriſtian Princes, to cut out and faſhion each particular decency and order, ſo as may ſhape and ſuit beſt with the preſent Time and Place wherein ſuch a Reformation is to be made.</p>
                  <p>Theſe parts therefore are to be acted in a Reformation by the ſupreame Power. Firſt, he is (either by his owne Motion, or at the inſtance and intreaties of others) to call and congregate ſuch Aſſemblyes. Secondly, to give them leave and liberty to conſult and debate of matters needing to be reformed. Thirdly, to accept the reſults of their conſultations, and to weigh them in the ballance of his Princely diſcretion. Fourthly, to confirme ſo much with his <hi>Royall Aſſent</hi> as his judgement ſhall reſolve to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or convenient. Laſtly, to ſtamp the Character of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon it, that Recuſants to obey it may be ſubject to civill puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>But now all the queſtion will be what is to be done if the endeavours of Subjects be finally returned with deafneſſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40297:37"/>
or deniall in the ſupreame Power. In this caſe a pulike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation neither ought nor can be performed without the conſent of the ſupreame Power: It ought not,</p>
                  <p>Firſt becauſe God will not have a Church reformed by the deforming of his Commandement. He hath ſaid <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother</hi> and requireth that all Superiours ſhould be reſpected in their places. Secondly, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rich in Preſidents for our inſtruction in all caſes of importance affords us not one ſingle example, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in people attempted publiquely to reforme, without or againſt the conſent of the ſupreame Power; and in this particular, I conceive a negative Argument followeth undeniably: wherefore ſeeing the Kings in <hi>Judah</hi> (there the ſupreame Power) were alwayes called upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, commended for doing ſo much, or condemned for doing no more; and the people neither commanded to remove, nor reproved for not removing publique I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, without the conſent of the ſupreame Power; it plainly appeareth, that a publique Reformation belongeth to the ſupreame Power, ſo that without it, it ought not to be done.</p>
                  <p>As it ought not, ſo it cannot be done without the conſent thereof; for admit that the higheſt ſubordinate Power ſhould long debate, and at laſt conclude, the moſt wholſome Rules for Reformation; yet as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, that amongſt the many good Lawes that were made one ſtill was wanting, namely, a Law to command and oblige men to the due obſerving of thoſe Lawes which were made. So when the beſt Reſolutions are determined on by any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Power, there ſtill remaines an abſolute neceſſity that the ſupreame Power ſhould bind and enforce to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving thereof.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance: Some Offenders are poſſeſſed with ſuch uncleane Spirits of prophaneneſſe, <hi>that none can bind</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 5. 3. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>them, no not with</hi> Chaines of Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures, onely outward Mulcts in purſe or perſon can hold
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40297:38"/>
and hamper them. <hi>Seythian</hi> ſlaves muſt be ordered with whips, and a preſent priſon more affrights im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent perſons, then Hel-fire to come. In the Writs <hi>De Excommunicato capiendo, &amp; de Haeretico comburendo,</hi> ſuch as flout at the <hi>Excommunicato</hi> and the <hi>Haeretico,</hi> are notwithſtanding heartily afraid of the <hi>Capiendo</hi> and the <hi>Comburendo,</hi> Wherefore in ſuch caſes the Church when it is moſt perfectly reformed is fame to crave the aid of the State by civill and ſecular penalties, to reduce ſuch as are Rebels to Church-Cenſures (ſometimes inflicting death it ſelfe on blaſphemous Heretickes) and this cannot be performed by any ſubordinate Power, in the State, but onely by the ſupreame Power. Otherwiſe, Offenders, if preſſed by any inferiour Power would have a free Appeale and no doubt find full redreſſe from the ſupreame Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without whoſe conſent ſuch penalties were impoſed on them,</p>
                  <p>Now if it be demanded, what at laſt remaines for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to doe, in caſe the ſupreame Power finally refuſeth to reforme. Thus they are to imploy themſelves. Firſt, to comfort themſelves in this, that they have uſed the meanes, though it was Gods pleaſure to with-hold the bleſſing. Secondly they are to reflect on themſelves, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to bemoane their own ſinnes which have cauſed Gods juſtice to puniſh them in this kind. If a rhumaticke head ſends downe a conſtant flux, to the corroding of the lungs, an ill affected ſtomacke firſt ſent up the vapours which cauſed this diſtillation: And pious Subjects conceive that if God ſuffer Princes to perſiſt in dangerous errours, this diſtemper of the head came originally from the ſtomack, from the ſinnes of the people, who deſerved this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thirdly, they are to reforme their ſelves and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and if the ſupreame Power be offended thereat, to prepare themſelves patiently to ſuffer, whatſoever it ſhall impoſe upon them, having the ſame cauſe though not the ſame comfort, to obey a bad Prince as a good one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:40297:38"/>
By the way, a word in commendation of paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: When men who cannot be active without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <note place="margin">5.

Firſt, Chriſt ſet the principall copie thereof, leading <hi>Captivity captive on the Croſſe,</hi> and ever ſince he hath ſanctified ſuffering with a ſecret ſoveraigne vertue even to conquer and ſubdue perſecution.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it hath beene continued from the Primitive Church by the Albigences to the moderate Proteſtants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <note place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, it is a Doctrine ſpirituall in it ſelfe. It muſt needs be good, it is ſo contrary to our bad natures and corrupt inclinations, who will affirme any thing rather then we will deny our ſelves, and our owne revengefull diſpoſitions. And ſurely the Martyrs were no leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for their willing ſubmitting to then for their conſtant enduring of their perſecutors cruelty. And it was as much (if not more) for them to conquer their owne vindicative ſpirits, as to undergoe the heavieſt tortures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is a doctrine comfortable to the Practiſers, bitter, but wholſome. Yet it is ſweetned with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſolation of a cleere conſcience, which is Food in Famine, Freedome in Fetters, Health in Sickneſſe, yea, life in death.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is glorious in the eyes of the beholders, who muſt needs like and love that Religion, whoſe profeſſors (where they cannot lawfully dearly ſell) doe frankly give their lives in the defence thereof.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is a Doctrine fortunate in ſucceſſe. By prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience, <hi>the Dove</hi> hath out-flowne <hi>the Eagle.</hi> Chriſt's Kingdome hath out-ſtreatched <hi>Caeſars</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Hereby the wiſdome of the Eaſt was ſubdued to the folly of Preaching. The Sunne of the Goſpell aroſe in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40297:39"/>
the Weſterne parts. The parched South was watered with the dew of the Word. The frozen North was thawed with the heat of Religion: But ſince the Doctrine of reſiſting the ſupreame Power came into faſhion, the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath runne up to a high top, but ſpread nothing in breadth; few Papiſts have beene reclaimed, and no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans have beene converted. Alas! that ſo good a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhould be now in ſo great diſgrace; yet will we praiſe ſuch <hi>ſuffering,</hi> though we ſuffer for praiſing it. If we cannot keepe this Doctrine alive, we will grieve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is dying; being confident, that though now it be buried in ſo deepe diſhonour, God in due time will give it a glorious reſurrection. And though I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, it is farre eaſier to praiſe <hi>paſſive Obedience</hi> then to practice it, yet to commend a vertue is one degree to the imitation of it, and to convince our judgements: Firſt, of the goodneſſe of the deede, is by Gods bleſſing one way to worke our wils to embrace it: In a word, if this Doctrine of <hi>paſſive Obedience</hi> be cryed downe, hereafter we may have many bookes of <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> but never more any <hi>bookes of Martyrs.</hi> And now theſe things premiſed, we returne to <hi>Master Saltmarſh</hi> his examination of my Sermon.</p>

But I deny a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Reformation to be extraordinary in this acception; as if it were to be ordered or managed by any other rules or preſidents, then ſuch as are ordinary and uſuall in the Bible, where many patterns of publique Reformations are preſented; in which reſpect the ordinary diſpenſation is to be reſorted to in the performance thereof. Whereas you ſay, that in publique Reformations, <hi>God giveth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary conjunctures of Times and circumſtance, and extraordinary concurrences.</hi> It is true in this ſenſe, that the great Clock-keeper of Time ſo orders the coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of all things that when his houre is come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch a Reformation ſhall be made, every officious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance will joyfully contribute his utmoſt aſſiſtance to the advancing thereof. Wherefore if men cannot make a Reformation without roving from their calling, or break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40297:40"/>
Gods Commandement (according to which it cannot be done without the conſent of the ſupreame Power.) Hereby it plainly appeares, that the hand of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence doth not as yet point at that happy minute of Reformation, there being as yet times diſtracted with jarres and disjunctures, not onely in circumſtances, but even in ſubſtantiall matters requiſite thereunto. And therefore ſeeing Gods good time may not be prevented, but muſt be expected, men are ſtill patiently to wait and pray for that <hi>conjuncture of Times</hi> and <hi>concurrency of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,</hi> whereof you ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>But whereas you ſpeake of <hi>Extraordinary Incitations</hi> (paralell to what you ſaid before, of <hi>ſpeciall excitations</hi> and <hi>christianly inſpired.)</hi> In theſe your expreſſions you open a dangerous Pit, and neither cover it againe nor <note place="margin">Exo. 21. 33. 34</note> raile it about with any cautions, ſo that Paſſengers may unawares fall into it.</p>
                  <p>For everyman who hath done an unwarrantable act, which <note place="margin">6. That no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary excitations, incitations or inſpirations are beſtowed from God on men in heſe dayes.</note> he can neither juſtifie by the law of God or man, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend preſently that he had an extraordinary Incitation for it; a fine tricke to plead Gods leave to breake his law. Nor can we diſprove the impudence of ſuch people except we may uſe ſome touch-ſtones, thereby to try their counterfeit incitations; my opinion herein ſhall be contrived into three Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, no ſuch extraordinary incitations are extant now a dayes from God, as ſtirre men up to doe any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Commandements. Indeed, ſome ſuch we meet with in the Scripture, where the Law-giver diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with his owne law, incited <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his ſon, <hi>Sampſon</hi> to kill himſelfe, and the Iſralites to rob the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians. <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 2. Judg. 16. 30. Exod. 12. 36.</note> In ſuch caſes it was no diſobedience to Gods publique command, but obedience to his private coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand; if the ſervant varied his practice according to his abſolute Maſters peculiar direction. But ſuch incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come not now a dayes but from the ſpirit of deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:40297:40"/>
Secondly, no extraordinary excitations are extant now a dayes from God, ſeizing on men (as anciently) in <hi>Enthuſiaſmes,</hi> or any ſuch raptives, as make ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on them. For theſe are within the virge of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which are now ceaſed, and our age produceth things rather monſtrous then miraculous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, extraordinary incitations are ſtill beſtowed by God in theſe dayes; namely, ſuch that he giveth to ſome of his ſervants; a more then uſuall and common proportion of his grace, whereby they are enabled for and incited to his ſervice with greater rigour and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then ordinary Chriſtians. My judgement herein ſhall not be niggardly to reſtraine Gods bountifull dealing, but I verily beleeve that he who was ſo exceedingly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall in former ages, is not ſo cloſe handed in our times, but that in this ſence he beſtoweth extraordinary motions, eſpecially on ſuch whom his Providence doth call to eminent Places, either in Church or State. But ſuch motions quicken them to <hi>runne the way of Gods Commandements,</hi> not to ſtart without or beſide it. And as hereby they are heightned to an Heroicall degree of Piety, ſo though ſometimes we may ſay of them in a Rhetoricall expreſſion, that <hi>they goe beyond themſelves,</hi> yet they never goe beyond their calling, not never goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Gods Commandements.</p>
                  <p>Now if any ſhall pretend that they have an extraordinary excitation to make a publique Reformation without the conſent of the ſupreame Power, to whom by Gods law it belongs, ſuch an excitation cannot come from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: For if the ſpirit of the Prophets be ſubject to the Prophets, much more is it ſubject to the God of the Prophets, and to the law of that God. And truly Sir, this paſſage of <hi>extraordinary incitations,</hi> as it is by you rawly laid downe and ſo left, containeth in it ſeed enough if well (or rather ill) husbanded, to ſow all the Kingdome with ſedition, eſpecially in an age wherein the Auabaptiſt in their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40297:41"/>
actions, beaten out of the field by Gods Word, doe daily flye to this their Fort of extraordinary excitations.</p>
                  <p>And you may obſerve when God gave <hi>extraordinary excitations, quo ad regulam</hi> (ſtirring up men to doe things contrary to the received rule of his Commandements) then ſuch excitations were alwayes attended with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary operations. <hi>Phinehas,</hi> who killed <hi>Cosby</hi> and <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> could ſtay the plague with his prayer; and <hi>Eliah</hi> who curſed the Captaines with their fifties, could cauſe fire to come downe on them from Heaven. It appeares this his curſe was pronounced without malice, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by a miracle. It is lawfull for ſuch to call for fire, who can make fire come at their call; and would none would kindle diſcord on Earth, till firſt they fetcht the ſparks thereof from Heaven. Neither doe we proudly tempt Gods providence, but truly trye ſuch mens pretended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary incitations, if when they wander from Gods Commandements in their Actions, and plead inſpirations, we require of them to prove the truth of ſuch inſpirations, by working a miracle.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, you being (as it ſeemes) an oppoſite to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, would make ſtrange worke, to put downe one <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> in a Dioceſſe, and ſet up many <hi>extraordinaries</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Pariſh: And for ought I know, if ſome pretend <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary excitations,</hi> publikely to reforme againſt the will of the ſupreame Power, ſuch as ſide with the <hi>ſupreame Power,</hi> may with as much probability alleadge <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary excitations</hi> to oppoſe and croſſe the others Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo betwixt them both our Church and State will be ſufficiently miſerable. And now Sir, remember what you ſaid in the laſt Paragraffe: <hi>To the law</hi> (ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>and to the Testimony;</hi> to ſuch Judges we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeale from all your <hi>ſpeciall excitations, extraordinary Incitations and christian Inſpirations.</hi>

And although this wary Prince long poiſed himſelf betwixt feare of the Emperor and love of the truth, yet he always either publikely defended <hi>Luther,</hi> or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately concealed him, till at laſt having outgrowne his fears, he fell boldly to publike reforming. As for the ſtates of <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> wherein <hi>Zuniglius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> lived, as thoſe Cities in one Relation are but members of the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian Common-wealth, ſo in another capacity they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire bodies of themſelves and in theſe ſtates the Magiſtrates did ſtamp the Character of civill authority on that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which theſe Miniſters did firſt ſet on foot by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.

Though a malefactor be condemned by the Judge to be executed, yet the Sheriffe is a murderer if he torment him to death, contrary to the ſentence of law.

                  <p>Againſt the rule of Piety: Becauſe God hath ſaid <hi>give no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any.</hi> Againſt the rule of Charity; becauſe thereby we are <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 32. 2 Cor. 63.</note> cruell to them which are our Brethren by nature, and may be by grace. Againſt the rule of Chriſtian Prudence, becauſe we cannot give any juſt offence, but alſo thereby we doe give them a juſt advantage againſt us. I beleeve Sir, were you to diſpute in an Univerſity againſt Popiſh Opponents, you would ſo warily ſtate the queſtion which you defend as that you would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly give any <hi>upper ground</hi> to your Adverſaries, more then what they could get for themſelves. Wherfore as the wreſtlers in the Olimpian games uſed to annoint themſelves with oyle, not only thereby to ſupple their joynts, but alſo to make their naked bodies the more ſlick and ſlippery, that ſo thoſe who wreſtled with them might catch no hold upon them, ſo ought we, who are like to have conſtant oppoſition with the Papiſts, to give them no more advantage then what they can earn, &amp; if we give them more, they will be more ready to jeere us for our folly, then thank us for our bounty unto them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, in this reſpect it is more dangerous to give juſt offence, and therby juſt advantage (for the one cannot be done without the other) to the Papiſts then to any meer Pagans: For Pagans being rude, dull and ignorant, though an advantage be given them, cannot in point of learning husband and improve it to the utmoſt. But the Papiſts whom we doe know and muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge cunning fencers in the School of wit and learning, are ſo well skild, as ever to keep and inforce the advantage we once beſtowed on them. And though we need never feare them and all their art, ſo long as we have God and a good cauſe on our ſide, ſo if we betray our cauſe by giving them juſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, it is juſt with God to deliver us over into their hands, to beat us with our owne weapons.</p>

And heare let the Reader be pleaſed to take notice, as much materiall to our purpoſe, that there is a grand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betwixt the Removing of things, bad in their owne nature, and betwixt the manner of removing them. If any thing be bad in it ſelfe, it may not be continued, it muſt be removed. None can diſpence with the retaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though never ſo many or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> offended thereat, let them turne their girdles, with all their knots in them behind them, whilſt wee neede not care for their cauſeleſſe anger. They who were ſo quick fighted that they could ſee an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, where it was never given them; Let them looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the ſame place, and their quick eyes will behold there, the amends which were never tendered them.</p>
                  <p>But now, as for the manner of removing of things badd in themſelves, when there is a liberty and latitude leſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us after what faſhion we will doe it, either this way or that way we muſt doe it ſo as to give none any juſt offence. For where it is at our choice and pleaſure to uſe variety of waies, our diſcretion muſt pitch on the beſt, whereby God may receive the moſt glory, the action the moſt luſter, wee our ſelves the greateſt comfort, and all others no juſt cauſe of offence. And here once againe let mee requeſt the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obſerve, that in my Sermon, I never mentioned any rendernes, to give the Papiſts offence, in removing of thinges bad in themſelves, but this caution of not giving the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts juſt offence, was inſerted in the proper place, when we came to ſhew how diſcretion is to appeare in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a reformation.</p>
                  <p>Yea the ſame thing for ſubſtance may be done and juſt offence, either may or may not be given according to the different manner of doing it. For inſtance, ſuch Pictures which are in the ſuburbs of ſuperſtition; becauſe the gate of that City is alwaies open, may without any giving of juſt offence be fairely taken away. But to ſhoot off the head of the ſtatue of Chriſt, either to ſpite the Papiſts, or ſport our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40297:49"/>
ſelves giveth juſt offence. Though the Image be nothing, yet ſuch uſage thereof is ſomething, the bullet ſhott at the picture, wounds pietie: For to do ſerious worke in a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring way, is inconſiſtent with Chriſtian gravities, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth not light of knowledge but lightneſſe, not to ſay lewdneſſe of behaviour.</p>
                  <p>Another inſtance. Suppoſe that ſome ceremonies anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for time, uſed by the fathers, (though abuſed by the Papiſts (reduced by the Proteſtants, defended by our Engliſh, not oppoſed by forraigne Devines, be practiſed in our Church. And withall ſuppoſe, that ſuch ceremonies as they are harmeleſſe ſo to be uſeleſſe, and not without the ſuſpition of danger, as the preſent times ſtand. In this caſe it will give no juſt offence to the Papiſts to take them away under the Nation, of things unneceſſary, and unſuting with our preſent condition. But to remove them as things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, Idolatrous, or ſuperſtitious, giveth juſt offence and great advantage to our Romiſh adverſaries, by the diſgrace we put on Antiquity. Beſides, hereby we betray our friends which have don good ſervice for our Religion, namely ſuch Engliſh Devines who with their penns have Learnedly and truly aſſerted the lawfulneſſe of ſuch ceremonies, and this our retreating from them and leaving them ingaged, (as <hi>Ioas</hi> ſerved <hi>Vriah</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2. Sam. 11. 35.</note> at the ſiege of <hi>Rahab</hi> treacherouſly) ſhews much baſeneſſe in us and in ſuch a caſe, the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of good men, is the diſhonoring of God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But if I ſhould in Courticie yeeld ſo much unto you (which I never will) that it were lawfull to give juſt offence to &amp; grounded dedicated Papiſts, yet know there be ſome, who in their opnions, &amp; affections, the borderers betwixt us &amp; the Papiſts, <hi>almoſt</hi> Proteſtants <hi>not far from</hi> our Religion, having one foote in it, and the other likely to follow, ſuch People when they ſee, that we take no care, and make no conſcience, to give juſt offence to the Papiſts, will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to retract their reſolutions, and call back their forward affections, ſay not that ſuch men are better loſt then found.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40297:49"/>
Is this the bowels of Chriſtian compaſſion, which ought to be in us, If we wilfully blaſt ſuch bloſſomes, we are not worthy of any ripe fruite, and it is both cruelty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſſe to caſt ſuch <hi>doe bake cakes</hi> to the Doggs, which by ſtanding a while longer in the Oven, would make good and wholſome bread. Nor herein do I write only by gueſſe, but too much by knowledge, ſuch as I can, neither well conceale nor comfortably, relate. For when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious paines of ſome reverend Devines whom I know, have brought ſome Papiſts to the doore of our Church, the juſt offence given them, by the moderne extravagances of ſome undiſcreer Proteſtants, cauſed them to fale backe againe to Popery. And now to returne to your Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All things contained therein, are eaſily to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that which we have promiſed.</p>
                  <p>B. <hi>Saint Paule was of another Spirit, who forbere not a Diſciple <note n="*" place="margin">Gall. 2. 11</note> and Apoſtle,</hi> Saint <hi>Paule</hi> perceiving a dangerous  error, in <hi>Peter,</hi> reproved him, both preſently while the wound was greene, and publiquely, that the plaiſter might be as broad as the ſore. But in thus doing he gave no juſt offence to <hi>Peter</hi> but blamed <hi>Peter</hi> for giving juſt offence to other Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>C. <hi>He goeth on and perſueth the offence till they left him)</hi> This inſtance of Chriſts his cariage herein nothing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageth you. Give me leave to repeate what I ſaid before, If things be bad in themſelves, they muſt be removed, though they give never ſo many offence, or rather though never ſo many or great men, take offence thereat, ſo alſo if a neceſſary Truth bee to be introduced, it muſt be preached and brought into the Church, though never ſo many be offended thereat. And if there be but one way, and no more allowed us, how and in what manner to do it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that one way, it muſt be don, not valluing the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any. But if verity of way be permitted unto us, God expects that we ſhould give the leaſt; and if poſſible no offence to any. Now to apply the truth which our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40297:50"/>
Saviour heare preached, and preſſed, was of abſolute and neceſſary concernment. Namely that he was the true <hi>Manna Meſsiah and broad from heaven.</hi> Such truths muſt bee preached, and if any burne with anger thereat, let not their fire be quenched, till it goe out for went of fuell. The caſe is forre otherwiſe in this Reformation, betwixt us and the Papiſts. We had all eſſentiall truths before, and if any orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, or additionall truths be now to be brought in, they muſt be ſo done as to give no juſt offence to the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>Thoſe truths, which are eſſentially, univerſally, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and at all times holy ought not to be meaſured, by the umbrage and ſcandall of the adverſaries.)</hi> If hereby you meane, that neceſſary truths muſt not bee forborne to bee preached, for feare of giving any offence, I clearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with you. Onely I ſay that all ſuch truths are in our Church already, and not now to bee newly brought in, (as you intimate) by the Reformation.</p>
                  <p>E. <hi>And yet the Apoſtle Preacheth, and layes thoſe blockes and this rock of offence in the way too.)</hi> The Apoſtle preached Chriſt, and intended him to be a <hi>rock of deſerue</hi> to all, As for thoſe who perverted him to bee a <hi>rock of offence</hi> to themſelves, this ſcandall was not juſtly given to them, but unjuſtly taken by them. If Papiſt take offence at any ſuch truth, it ſhall affect us no more then the cryes of <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets <note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 18. 29.</note> affected any of whom it is ſaid, <hi>there was none to anſwer them nor any that regarged them.</hi> But as for the manner of removing away any errors, or bringing in any Truths, we ought to bee wary and circumſpect, for our own ſakes, as well as theirs, to give them no juſt offence.</p>
                  <p>To conclude. For mine owne part Sir I pittie the Perſons of all Papiſts, &amp; heartily deſire their convertion, but hate theirs, and all other errors, <hi>with a perfect hatred.</hi> And this my enmity to all Popiſh Tenents, doth the more plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be grounded on my Judgement not on my paſſion, Becauſe I would have almen ſo cautious, as not to give them juſt advantage leaſt out actions fight for them, whilſt our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40297:50"/>
affections fight againſt them. What Frier will not laugh in his Coule at this your opinion, that it is lawfull to give Papiſts juſt offence? Well, you never ſhall have my conſent, to combate as our Churches Champion, againſt Rome for the Proteſtant cauſe, untill you have learnt more skill in fencing, and not to lye at ſo open a guard. And if you hold it lawfull to give Papiſts juſt offence, by the next returne you will hold it lawfull to give juſt offence to all, which are termed <hi>Popiſhly affected,</hi> the Gangrean of which expreſſion, is by ſome extended to taint as ſound and hearty Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as any be in England.</p>

What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had of us in Learning, and Religion, and what wee heve of them.</note> ſhew, God willing in what reſpect the Fathers, for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge excelled, and exceeded us, and in what reſpect wee modernes goe beyond them. They had a threeſold advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage above us. 1. Of ſight. 2. Of light. 3. and of a nearer object.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of a better light, Being men of eminent natural
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40297:53"/>
parts, improved with excellent learning, and to the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne fathers, the Greeke tongue, the language of the New Teaſtament was naturall, ſo that it coſteth us much paines and ſweat but to come to the place whence they ſtarted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of a brighter light. As their conſtancie in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was great, ſo no doubt the heate of their zeale was attended with a proportionable light, and heavenly illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation God doing much for them that ſuffer much for him. Eſpecially in thoſe points wherein they encountred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, they were more then men, and went beyond them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> from whom our moderne Browniſts differ no more, then the ſame man differs from himſelfe in new cloathes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of a nearer Object. They living cloſer to Chriſts times, could therefore better underſtand the <hi>ſence of the Church</hi> in the doctrine delivered to the Apoſtles. Here we muſt know that Apoſtles, and Apoſtolick men as they wrote Gods word in their Epiſtles, and Goſpels for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of all poſterity, ſo for the inſtruction of their preſent age they alſo <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. 1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>traditioned it</hi> in their Preaching by word of mouth to the people of thoſe times, not that they delivered any thing <hi>viva voce</hi> contrary or diſſertent from what they wrote, or that (as the Papiſts ſtile for their traditions) they ſupplyed and enjoyned any thing as neceſſary to ſalvation, which otherwiſe was wanting in the Scripture but the ſelfe ſame things which they wrote in the New Teſtament, they alſo delivered in their Sermons, and in their Preaching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated upon them, wherefore the prime primative age, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as I may ſay) two ſtrings to their bow, Scripture, and Preaching, muſt needes bee allowed to have had the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt apprehention of the meaning of heavenly miſteries, and as the <hi>children</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Iudg. 2. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>of Iſraell ſerved the Lord all the dayes of Iehoſſuah and all the dayes of the Elders, who outlived Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſſuah, who had ſeene all the great workes of the Lord which he did for Iſraell,</hi> in like manner wee may conclude,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40297:53"/>
that the greateſt puritie and the cleareſt light of the Church, laſted ſo long as any, within ſight, hearing, or memory of Chriſt or his Apoſtles preaching, or miracles, did ſurvive.</p>
                  <p>Now to hold the ſcales even, we in like manner have a three fold advantage over the Fathers. Firſt a degree of experimentall light more then they had or could have; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeene the whole conduct, Manuaging and Progreſſe of Religion ſince their times, whereby (with a litle helpe of hiſtory) a Devine who is under ſixtie in age, may be a bove ſixteene hundred in experience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we have the benefits of the Fathers bookes, a mightie advantage if we were as carefull to uſe it to Gods Glory, as we are ready to bragg of it for our owne credit. And here I muſt complaine of many mens lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Indeed a learned man <note n="*" place="margin">Nos nani ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſtantes ſuper humeros Gygantum. Hol. cott.</note> compareth ſuch as live in the latter times in reſpect of the Fathers to <hi>Dwarffes ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Giants Shoulders.</hi> But then if we will have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt by the fathers learning, we muſt take paines to mount to the tope of their Shoulders. But if like idle <hi>Dwarfes,</hi> we ſtill do but ſtand on the ground, our heads will not reach to their girdles, it is not enough to through the bookes of the fathers, togeather on an heape, and then making their workes our footeſtoolle to ſtand on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and Covers of them, as if it were no more, but V P and RIDE boaſting now far we behold beyond them. No, if we expect to gett advantage by their writings, we muſt open their bookes, read underſtand, compare, digeſt and meditate on them. And I am affraid many that leaſt looke into the Fathers, boaſt moſt that they looke beyond them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Wee have the advantage of a darkneſſe remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Gods goodneſſe from our eyes, which in ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did dimme the ſight of the Fathers. Namely the miſtery of Iniquity which wrought in their times, &amp; now is taken away in the Proteſtant Church. That Bramble of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40297:54"/>
(ſoone will it prick, which will be a thorne,) which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Lorded it over the <hi>Vine, Olive,</hi> and figtree, beganne very timely to play his parte, And the <hi>Man of ſin,</hi> then but an infant (and every thing is pretty when it is yonge,) was unawares dandled on the knees of many a devout Monke and rockt in the cell of many an holy hermit, who litle ſuſpected that then voluntary ſequeſtring themſelves to enjoy heavenly thoughts, would by degrees degenerate to be in after ages the cover of Pride, luſt and lazineſſe. Now ſeing this man of ſinne, is <hi>dead already</hi> in the Proteſtant Church, and hath a conſumption attended with the Heck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Fever in all other places, the taking away of Popiſh ſuperſtition may juſtly be accounted the third advantage which our age hath.</p>
                  <p>By the way we muſt take heed of a fault whereof many are guilty. For ſome are ready to challenge every thing in the practiſe of the Fathers which doth not pleaſe them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be Popiſh, and pretend they taſt ſuperſtition in whatſoever themſelves diſtaſt. O ſay they, the Fathers lived when the <hi>myſtery of iniquity did worke,</hi> and hence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that it is evidence enough without further tryall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne any cerimonies uſed by them, becauſe they were uſed by them. The way indeede to make Short Aſſiſes, but Perjur'd Iudges, whereas it is not enough to ſay, but to ſhew that they are ſuperſtitious, to anotomize, and diſſect the Popery conteined in them, demonſtrating where it croſſeth the word of God, wheras on the contrary all wiſe and charitable men ought to eſteeme the practiſes of the primitive Church not only to be innocent, but uſefull and honourable till they be legally convicted to be otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>If any object that the Fathers had another diſadvantage, that beſides the ſpreading of Popery; other Hereſies did alſo ſpring and ſprout apace in that time, to the darkening of the light of the truth, let them know that ſuch oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only gave truth the opportunity to tryumph, and the teeth of Error filled it the brighter Hereſies, <hi>In eodom ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:40297:54"/>
                     <hi>quo nat a, damnat a equos errores patrum aetas tulit, eos &amp; ſuſtulis,</hi> condemnig them in Synods and Councells, And in this point to be an equall Empire betwixt the <hi>ancients</hi> and us, we muſt conſider that we live in the <hi>Later age,</hi> and commonly bad humors which have viſited the whole body do ſettle at laſt in the leggs and loweſt parts, with us Sects and Schiſmes do alſo abound, and ſome Hereſies <hi>firſt ſet a broach</hi> in the Primitive times, now <hi>runne a Tilt</hi> with all their dredgs in out dayes.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how the Fathers were both before and behind us, for knowledge, and wee therein both above and beneath them in ſeverall reſpects. See the wiſdome and goodneſſe of God, how he hath ſweely <hi>tempered</hi> things together. So good that all have ſome, ſo wiſe that none have all. And how eaſie may this controvercy be accommodated, <hi>whether ours or the Fathers light were the greateſt,</hi> where if the difference be but cleerly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the parties are fully reconciled. And now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive having anſwered you in groſſe, I need not apply my ſelfe to any perticulers of your examination.</p>

                  <p>You hover in Generalls, and ſeeme to me deſirous that <note place="margin">9. Now new light or new eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall truths are or can be revealed in this age.</note> your Reader ſhould underſtand more then you are willing to expreſſe; my opinion breifly is this. That no new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, or new infuſed light in eſſentiall points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is beſtowed on any now-adayes, but that the ſame light hath in as plentifull a meaſure beene given to former ages, eſpecially to the age wherein the Apoſtles lived, and when <hi>the faith was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and by them ſett downe in the Scripture, and that then ſo perfectly and compleatly, that it needed not the acceſſions of any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Revelations.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe that men by ſearching the Scripture (that oyle will never leave increaſing as long as more veſſells be ſtill brought) and diligent prayer to God may and do arive daily at a clearer underſtanding of many places of Gods word which they had not before. Theſe words; <hi>Thou art Peter and on this rock will I build my Church,</hi> and that Place, <hi>this is my body,</hi> are now more truly and plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood then they were 200 yeares agoe, when the Popes <hi>ſupremacy</hi> was as falſly founded on the former as tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation was unjuſtly inferred from the latter. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe were not Revelations of new truthes, but repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ould. For the prime primative Church received and embraced the ſame, The Saints <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 14. 3.</note> in the time of Popery <hi>Sung as it were a new ſong,</hi> a Song not new but renewed, not new in it ſelfe but perchance to the hearers, and ſuch are many truthes, which are preached in our age in the Proteſtant Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40297:55"/>
They that maintaine the contrary opinion of moderne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of new eſſentiall truths doe a three fold miſchiefe therein. Firſt they lay an aſpertion of ignorance and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of knowledge on the Apoſtles themſelves, and this is no leſſe then <hi>Scandalum Magnatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly they much unſettle men in matters of Religion, and produce a conſtant inconſtancy and ſcepticall hovering in all oppinions and as the <hi>Athenians</hi> erected an Altar to the <hi>unknowne God,</hi> ſo men muſt reſerve a blancke in their ſoules therin to write truths <hi>at yet unknown,</hi> when they ſhall be revealed. Thus men will never know when their creede is ended, and will daily waver in that truth which they have in poſſeſſion, whilſt they waite for a clearer and firmer as yet in revertion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly they ſixe on the Scripture an imputation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and ſuch as talke of new revelations of truth, may well remember the paſſage in the Old Revelation. <note n="*" place="margin">Reve. 21. 18</note> 
                     <hi>If any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the plagues that are written in this booke.</hi> And it ſeemes to mee all one in effect whether men peece the Scriptures, with old Traditions, or new Revelations; and thus the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt and Anabaptiſt are agreed like men in a circle going ſo farre from each other with their faces, till their backes meete together. And I profeſſe I ſhould ſooner truſt a tradition containing in it nothing croſſe to the Scripture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to mee recommended from the primitive times, and countenanced with the practiſe of the Church in all ages, then a new upſtart Revelation. The beſt is, wee have no neede to truſt either, whilſt we have Gods word alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to relie on.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of all is this, We have now a-dayes no new truths revealed, but old ones either more fairely cleared or more firmely aſſented to, no new Starres of Revelation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in any hearts. If any ſuch doe burne and blaze there, they are but comments which will fade at laſt. In a word this age is not happie with any new truths, but guiltie of many old lyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:40297:56"/>
Yea, it rendereth it ſuſpitious, that ſome men are going about ſome what, which they cannot juſtifie by the old knowne lawes of God, becauſe they beginne to broach pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative doctrines, Introductorie of new revelations: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting (as it ſeemes) the Scripture, the old Iudge, as not for their turnes, becauſe they provide for an Appeale to an other Vmpirer; and if thoſe are juſtly accounted dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous members in the Church, who would bring in Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Ceremonies, then pretenders of new Revelations in Eſſentiall points of Doctrine are ſo much the greater offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by how much Doctrine is more neceſſary, and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall in a Church then ceremonies. But I will anſwer ſome paſſages in your Examination particularlie.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>The Goſpel doth worke and winde its beames into the world, according to the propheticall ſeaſons for Revelotions.)</hi> Diſtinguiſh we heare, betwixt matters <hi>of fact,</hi> and matters <hi>of faith.</hi> Matters of fact being foretold in the Scripture, are beſt underſtood when they are accompliſhed: In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the longer the world laſteth, the clearer men ſee &amp; the plainer they underſtand ſuch predictions.

                  </p>
                  <p>O. <hi>The Apoſtles had not all their truths and light, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at once, ſome early, ſome late, ſome not till the Holy Ghoſt was beſtowed.)</hi> All this is moſt true which you ſay, The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles at firſt were (as we may ſay) Freſhmen, newly admitted into Chriſts Company. Then they tooke their firſt degree of knowledge, when ſent forth to Preach the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. to the <hi>Iewes</hi> alone in their Maſters life time. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced in a higher knowledge after Chriſt his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And after his Aſſention, aſſended yet higher in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Illuminations: Laſtly, after the comming of the Holy Ghoſt, they proceeded Doctors in deede; I meane, they then had the completion and conſumation of all underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding neceſſary to ſalvation. Now Sir, Conſider that after this time, they wrote the New Teſtament, and therein all eſſentialls for us to know and doe for our ſoules health, ſo that we now doe deduce and derive our knowledge, not from the Apoſtles in their infancy, or minority of Judgement, but from them having attained to the Top, and Verticall point of their perfecteſt skill in heavenly miſteries.</p>
                  <p>P. <hi>And who cannot thinke wee are riſing into that age, wherein God will power his Spirit upon all fleſh, &amp;c.)</hi> What proportion doth this beare with what you ſaid not long ſince, Propheſying that our <hi>Marian Times</hi> did approach too faſt?
