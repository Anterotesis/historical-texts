            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(although the Ever-flowing

of <hi>Hungary</hi>
variously agitated
under several muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are now presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the World
in an <hi>Epitome,</hi> which
neverthelesse Comprehends most of
the Transactions in <hi>Europe,</hi> and may
intitle it self to be its Remembrancer.
This Nation some Ages before, not
seen and unheard of, did out of its Ruins
rise to a Mighty Kingdome, and as it
did so wonderfully increase, so did it
with the same Urgencies of Fate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb facs="tcp:65063:6"/>
as fast, and again recover it self;
and so by the inconstancy of its For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
either added <hi>Terrour</hi> or <hi>Hope</hi> to its
Neighbours: For while this People
struggled for Empire, intending to heap
up their Glory in the Splendor of one
Day, and would allow no futurities to
their Felicity, the Justice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
decreed them a laborious race,
wherein their speed and Strength hath
been tired; and by many uneven As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
and Descents, almost wearied out
of Breath: in which time notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(the space of Twelve hundred years
and upwards) it hath effected so many
great things both in War and Peace,
that it seemeth to have dared and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
things far beyond either its
Fortune or Ability, Commanding and
extending its Power so far over the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
Nations, that while its Actions
and story is read, both <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi>
are concerned, and are again subjected
in the review, as Tributaries to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
of this Empire.</p>
            <p>I must confesse that so many Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssitudes,
and the Grandeur of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
do much discompose the Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:65063:6"/>
but so that the shape of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
hereof will sufficiently appear, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it have not its full Proportions.</p>
            <p>We consider therefore the <hi>Hungarian</hi>
Nation according to these Intervals or
Distances, The first Age was most
fierce and Sanguinous, while they were
under the darknesse of Paganisme, which
lasted almost 600 years, during which
time they exceeded the very Beasts in
all savage and barbarous Cruelty. The
following Age under <hi>Geysa</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi>
Christian Princes, until the Reign of
<hi>Charles</hi> Son of <hi>Lewis,</hi> in which time
passed 340 years, was afflicted and sore
put to it; yet it made a shift to rear
it self &amp; raise its Glory out of the Dust.
Thence to our Times have run 330
years, in which its Glories have been
retrograde, and have verged to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
and feeble estate, save that under
K. <hi>Matthias</hi> the Kingdom mov'd its Arms
with some vigour, and seemed to be
renewed to a Fresh and active Youth
and Virility.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Matthias</hi> being taken away by
the envyous Destinies, the <hi>Hungarians</hi>
soon lost their ancient Courage and
<pb facs="tcp:65063:7"/>
Vertue, suffering the <hi>Turks</hi> to possesse
themselves of the greatest part of their
Country (which they are now like
wholly to subdue) while they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
betwixt the Interests of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
the Emperour, and <hi>Iohn Zapolyai</hi>
Vayvod of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> pretenders
to that Crown; so that <hi>Hungary</hi> is to
be sought in it self. For while the
Kingdome was insociable and coveted
by many, it became burdened with
more weight then it could bear; and that
Government which might have been
well supported and maintained by one,
being shouldred by so many, fell with
ruine to the Ground.</p>
            <p>It is now redevable to the Reader,
that I give an account of what Authors
have been consulted in the Compiling
of this Treatise; Many <hi>Hungarian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being waived because of their Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
and fondnesse of their own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Fabulous Untruths; of which
sort are <hi>Ranzanus, Ritius,</hi> and others;
but one for all is <hi>Bonfinius,</hi> who hath
loaded the Original of the <hi>Hungarians</hi>
with a multitude of Fictions. <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>zius</hi>
hath done something better; in
<pb facs="tcp:65063:7"/>
the whole six hundred Authours have
been conferred; but those to whom
Credence was due are onely these; First
<hi>Nicholas Istuamfi,</hi> a man conversant in
the story who wrote his Rationale from
the life of <hi>Matthias</hi> the first; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his propense affection to the
<hi>Caesars</hi> (for which teason he either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
Truth or conceals their Vices)
fome rare, more Ancient and modern
Writers have been contra-examined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. Next to him, <hi>Flavius As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius
Centorinus,</hi> who Composed his
History of the <hi>Dacian</hi> Wars out of the
Manuscript Commentaries of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi>
and <hi>Castaldus</hi> (his General) them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Lastly, <hi>Iohn Michael Brutus,</hi>
who wrote of this matter by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Stephen Bathori</hi> King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
together with <hi>Thuanus</hi> and some
few not so Eminent.</p>
            <p>The Reader, it is presumed, will be
hereby satisfied of the veracity and
Authority of this Discourse, whose
Subject (being so much a stranger)
needed a very ample Certificate, for
that Impostures of these distant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
are very rife and frequent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65063:8"/>
All that is to be Apologised and
Excused, is the style, which pretends
to nothing but understandible <hi>English,</hi>
shut up by such rigid clauses and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
of matter, that it could not
breath any free Language. And when
the Reader shall have perceived how
this Volume is crowded to render it a
Manual acceptable to the diversion of
curious and inquisitive men, he will
no doubt vouchsafe a Pardon to this
Endevour.</p>

lying North and North-east, by the Name of
<hi>Scythia,</hi> and under that general Appellation
the Inhabitants were notified to the world, which
now is distinguished into the different Tribes
of the present <hi>Tartarian</hi> Empire; who at
this day continue that vagrant, incursive, and
predatory disposition, that brought these neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitous
<hi>Huns</hi> in vast multitudes into fertiler
though never so distant Regions.</p>
               <p>It will be therefore requisite to give some

               <p>
                  <hi>Scythia</hi> by the Ancients was divided into the

of the <hi>Danow, Savus</hi> and <hi>Dravus,</hi>
3 great Rivers by the City of <hi>Belgrade)</hi> the
reason of which mistake was, for that they falsly
supposed <hi>Asia</hi> to be divided from <hi>Europe</hi> by
the <hi>Tanais:</hi> For from <hi>Taenarus</hi> the Extreme
promontory of <hi>Peloponesus</hi> to the Springs and

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65063:9"/>
extending to the Northern Ocean, is Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
that River arising in the Confines of
the greater <hi>Russia,</hi> and the lesser <hi>Tartary,</hi>
from a Lake called <hi>Ivanowo Iezcier,</hi> not out
of the <hi>Riphaean</hi> Mountains, as is fabled by the
Ancients; for that there are no such Hills in
nature, nor was it ever agreed among Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
where they should be sited. And it is
since manifest that from the Lake aforesaid there
is as much space of ground lying between the
Sea, as is betwixt it and <hi>Peloponensus,</hi> so that
many places are assigned to <hi>Asia</hi> in this Region,
which do truely belong to <hi>Europe.</hi> This is the
rather insisted, to rectifie the general mistake
in most of the modern Maps and descriptions
of the World.</p>
               <p>The vastnesse of the <hi>Asian Scythia</hi> is so
great,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Asian Scythia.</note> that its bounds were neither known in

Circumscribed to the East with the opposite
shore of unknown Seas; to the North with
the Frozen <hi>Scythian</hi> Sea; to the West with the
<hi>Cimmerian Bosphorus, Maeotis, Tanais,</hi> and a
Line drawn to the White Sea; to the South with
the <hi>Indies;</hi> whence it comes to passe that the
Straight of <hi>Anian</hi> is yet controverted; some
allowing no such Sea; others so narrow a one,
that the <hi>Scythians</hi> are feigned to have had their
originals from <hi>America.</hi> The uncertainty of
our knowledge of this Countrey is imputed to
this main Cause, for that none of the Mighty
of the world could ever boast of a Conquest
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65063:10"/>
thereof. We read of Expeditions made against
the <hi>Scythians,</hi> both towards the East and the
West, but no way remarquable for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> never reached <hi>Iaxarta; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

               <p>Certain it is, they were Conterminous to

Bordering Northeast upon <hi>Persia,</hi>
where they Inhabited until vanquished by their

were the <hi>Getae,</hi> whose King <hi>Dormichaetes</hi> so
despised Riches, that content with Victory, he
released <hi>Lysimachus</hi> his prisoner, which sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
is alledged to this day, as the cause of
their Servitude to other Nations. <hi>Syrmius</hi> had

King of the <hi>Triballi,</hi> who for fear of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the Great, fled into the Island <hi>Peuce,</hi>
the Fame of whom remains to this day, by that

to the <hi>Massagetes,</hi> which space of ground,

to assign the same originals to them both;
but how weakly, their migrations and invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Prince of the <hi>Getae:</hi> But <hi>Strabo</hi> makes them
thus to differ, the <hi>Getae</hi> to be those whose Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
bended towards the East and the Sea; and
the <hi>Dacians</hi> those who stretched themselves
oppositely towards <hi>Germany,</hi> and the rise of
the River <hi>Ister;</hi> although he presently adds, that
they both use the same Language.</p>
               <p>Neither doth he herein agree with himself,

the <hi>Marusius</hi> flows into the <hi>Danow.</hi> Nor are

happily by the prudence of her mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and the beloved memory of her Father,
but as soon as she entrusted the whole menage of
the State into the hands of <hi>Nicholas Gara</hi> the

by the envy and hatred against him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
in the Kingdome, the secret Design where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               <p>Some of the Grandees thereupon consulted
to call in <hi>Charles</hi> Surnamed the <hi>Little</hi> Son, or

he pretended for his rapinous seizure of the
Scepter, the Composure of those Tumults and

               <p>This caused <hi>Sigismund</hi> (whom his Father
in his Life time had sent into <hi>Hungary</hi> to be
educated and fashioned according to the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi>

tempered and dissembled their resentments)
caused himself to be Crowned at <hi>Alba Regalis;</hi>
and not long after, was so inveagled and blinded
by his Parasites (with whom he most delighted)
that he could not foresee the danger of his
unjust Usurpation. For the Generality and the
Nobles being estranged in their affections,
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Queen-mother, and the above-named
<hi>Palatine,</hi> under Colour of a private

possessing the abrupt passages and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culries

               <p>To avert this storm, <hi>Sigismund</hi> dealt with

of <hi>Hungarians, Germans,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving

of the <hi>Turk,</hi> before he grew too potent
with so many additions, which his successful Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar
had annexed to his first mean and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable

accompanied with <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Hardy,</hi> Son of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who joyntly retook in

                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> having failed of his design upon

caused by his covetousnesse.</p>
               <p>At the same time <hi>Elias</hi> (Son of <hi>Peter) Vayvod</hi>
of <hi>Moldavia</hi> by these <hi>Alps,</hi> invaded <hi>Hungary,</hi>

of the Country, was packing up a very great
spoil, when <hi>Banfius</hi> and other Noblemen sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
him, and stripped him of his booty.
But a greater danger was feared from <hi>Achomet,</hi>
who took <hi>Temeswar, Lozoncius</hi> after a forward
defence, by the discord of the <hi>Germans,</hi> being
forced to yeild it upon terms, which in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of that perfidy used towards <hi>Vlumas</hi>
were not at all regarded,<note place="margin">Their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.</note> and the Garrison put
to the Sword. Twenty several other places
were either taken or yeilded, which had been
formerly in their possession, and all the tract
of ground between <hi>Temesus</hi> and <hi>Chrysus Niger,</hi>
reduced to their obedience. <hi>Lippa</hi> also, although
<hi>Aldana</hi> the Governour had boasted of the
strength of the place, and his own resolution,
was out of fear fired by himself, for which he
had lost his head, but for the intercession of
<hi>Mary</hi> the Empresse. <hi>Dregelum</hi> was also taken,
though so nobly defended by <hi>Sondius,</hi> that they
gave his dead body most honourable Sepulchre.
Not to mention many other places, among the
rest <hi>Salgon,</hi> by a stratagem of a great Log from
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65063:85"/>
the next hill, which the Garrison were made
believe for a great Gun, so that it was with the
<hi>Turks</hi> the same thing to come and to Conquer.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>Erasmus Theuffelus</hi> and <hi>Sforza
Pallavicinus</hi> newly returned out of <hi>Italy</hi> with
10000. men,<note place="margin">Theuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus <hi>and</hi> Pallavici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</hi>
                  </note> opposed themselves to this Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
but by their hastinesse and impatience in not
staying for the Nobility at <hi>Fileek,</hi> and all the
Elements conspiring their Ruin (their Powder
and Ammunition being blown up at <hi>Palastus)</hi>
they were beaten out of their Camp, and both
Generalls taken prisoners, <hi>Theuffelus</hi> denying
himself was sowed in a sack and drowned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the <hi>Thracian Bosphorus,</hi> and <hi>Sforza</hi>
ransomed with 15000. Crowns, the other cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
being set at so cheap a rate, that a <hi>German</hi>
was sold for a Peck of Barley. <hi>Szolnock</hi> was
next attaqued by <hi>Haly</hi> and <hi>Achomet,</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
either the promises or Threats of
<hi>Laurentius Nyari</hi> delivered to them by the
faint hearted Garrison. Thence the Enemy with
a hundred and twenty five Thousand men came
before <hi>Agria,</hi>

                  </note> wherein were Governours <hi>Dobo</hi>
and <hi>Neskeyus,</hi> who had in vain implored aid and
supplies from the Emperour, assisted by some
Noblemen and 2000. Souldiers. It was a sharp
and daring Seige of both sides, the Defendants
in a bravery opening the <hi>Bolikian</hi> Gate and there
after a fierce encounter slaying 3000. <hi>Turks,</hi>
which courage of theirs so disheartned <hi>Achomet</hi>
that having lost 12000. great shot against the
Town he broke up from before it, <hi>Duke Maurice

Ferdinands</hi> General having spent a whole sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

thing of moment effected against the Enemy.
The Messengers of this successe at <hi>Agria</hi> were
richly rewarded, and <hi>Dobo</hi> made Prefect of
<hi>Transylvania, Nekessius</hi> by an untimely and
ungratefull accident was killed in a rustick Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
by an Axe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> notwithstanding more afraid of
fortune then desirous of Conquest, preferred
Peace,<note place="margin">1555.</note> to which purpose he commissioned <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
Veranczius,</hi> and <hi>Francis Zayus</hi> to the Port,
by whose means <hi>Malvezius</hi> the former Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
was set at liberty, but he survived it not
long, dying in his journey back again thither
with a new Commission. In his place <hi>Augerius
Gislenius Busbequius</hi> was substituted,<note place="margin">Count <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> his Successes.</note> but nothing
more then a truce of six months could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
The War being therefore continued,
it was the good fortune as the valour of Count
<hi>Nicholas Serinus (Zrynyi</hi> by the <hi>Hungarians)</hi>
to defeat <hi>Vlumas</hi> and <hi>Amurath</hi> of <hi>Clissa</hi> by
<hi>Toploczia,</hi> who bearing up from this discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
plundered and spoiled several Towns at
their retreat; while <hi>Hameza</hi> the Governour of
<hi>Sezeserinum</hi> by a surprize gained <hi>Filek.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Busbequius</hi> was now returned <hi>re infecta</hi> from
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> without that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would
relinquish <hi>Transylvania;</hi> and <hi>Alys a Chiaux</hi>
being sent to <hi>Bathori</hi> the <hi>Vayvod,</hi> commanded
him to expell the <hi>Germans,</hi> a new Prince of

to which demands <hi>Bathori</hi> by the connivence
of <hi>Castaldus</hi> answered by the promise of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

wresting places out of the hands of those that
had them in possession it was not in their power.
Hereupon <hi>Aly Bassa</hi> formerly Governour of

divers discourses and reflections upon him,

languishing condition of his Prince; who being
a Batchelor, and disappointed of the marriage
of <hi>Ioan</hi> Daughter of <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> added

<hi>Swarzemburg</hi> to this purpose chose out 2050

these without Drum or Trumpet passed over
the <hi>Memphon</hi> Woods in the silence of the night
being guided by <hi>Felnemeth</hi> newly discharged

the Petard was applied which shivered it in

being now renewed, <hi>Haly Bassa</hi> was slain, and
the opened-day discovered an entire Victory
to the Christians. A very great spoil was here
divided; an Hundred eighty eight Great Guns
sent to the Emperour, by whom <hi>Babacurtus</hi> the

Neverthelesse the Princes of <hi>Moldavia,</hi>

forced by a timely submission and great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents

               <p>Soon after the Bassa of <hi>Buda</hi> being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

they were compelled to forsake their Camp,

together a strong Body of <hi>Croats,</hi> and other

and a while they talk'd of nothing but Peace, but
at last they brake out into high expressions, that
they would have <hi>Serinswar</hi> demolished, Count

the Power of the <hi>Turk</hi> by way of Reparation.
None of which followed; but the <hi>Christians</hi>

               <p>While this was doing, the <hi>Turks</hi> gathered

<hi>Hungary</hi> is questionlesse a very brave Country,

so that betwixt those that dyed; a Number that

being then as far as <hi>Clausenburg,</hi> in <hi>Transyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi>

yet neither their aid nor his valor availed him
when being surrounded on all sides, and striving

hope of Succour there was none left; the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

the <hi>Turks,</hi> (as has been said already) making
use of a Treaty only for their own advantage,
put themselves into a stronger posture: In the

indignation, as well against the Valiant <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi>
(that have held them tack so long

This Deceit of a Treaty lasted till the
Year 1663. and then the Fury of these <hi>Infidels</hi>
brake out, not only upon <hi>Transylvania,</hi> and
<hi>Hungaria;</hi> but upon some of the Emperours
Hereditary Countries also.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Iuly</hi> the 17. the Grand Vizier came
in great Pomp and Magnificence to <hi>Offen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> appear with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Army in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </note> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping
himself in the <hi>Pesterfield,</hi> being four
<hi>German</hi> miles in Compass. His Army was
upward of a hundred thousand men, above one
hundred great Guns, and of Wagons, and
Beasts, a number not to be believed. His first
work was to lay two Ship-bridges over the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube;</hi>
the one near to <hi>Gran,</hi> and the other not
far from <hi>Parkham.</hi> His forces being quarter'd
about those parts in Prodigious Multitudes, it
was as yet doubtful, whether he would fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Newhausel,</hi> or <hi>Raab;</hi> having his eye indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
upon both, and lying still for a good
while without action. But the design had
shew'd it self much sooner, if a continual fall
of Rain, and the Overflow of the <hi>Danube</hi>
had not hindred him: However at length, he
passed some Thousands of his Army over the
Bridge near <hi>Parkham</hi> toward the side of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausel;</hi>
when immediately a Report was spread
by some of the Pesants that were turn'd to the
<hi>Turk,</hi> that the River had torn their Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges,
and that those 4000 <hi>Turks</hi> that had
passed over, were now Cut off from the Main
body. This Rumor it was that inveigled the
Governour of <hi>Newhausel</hi> (Count <hi>Forgatz)</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:65063:160"/>
into a Couragious but an unhappy Resolution,
which was to fall upon those 4000. <hi>Turks,</hi> upon
the supposition, that the Miscarriage of the
Bridge had cut off their Retreat. It is very
true, that he was earnestly disswaded form that
Attempt,<note place="margin">Count <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatz</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</note> and told, that the Body was greater
then he imagined, but still persisting in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to fight them, upon the 28 of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
with his <hi>Hungarians, Hussars</hi> and <hi>Heyducks,</hi>
and 11 Troups of <hi>Germans,</hi> and 500 Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
(in all 6000 strong) he marched up to
them, and finding the Enemy four times stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then he expected, became sensible of the
Abuse although alas! for the <hi>Infidels</hi> having
gotten certain Intelligence of the <hi>Christians</hi>
design, and of their coming, caused the Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
presently to be repaired, which they had
purposely disordered, and marching over with
a strong power surrounded them. The <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi>
and <hi>Hussars,</hi> that were appointed to
stand for a Reserve, seeing the Enemy come
on so strong, betook themselves to flight; but
the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Heyducks</hi> that gave the Onset
behaved themselves stoutly, and sold a dear
Victory to the <hi>Turks.</hi> At last by Multitudes
they were overcome, and those that could not
get away were miserably Cut, and Mangled.
<hi>Forgatz,</hi> and some few others escaped to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausel.</hi>
This Combat lasted about three hours,
and about 3000 of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and <hi>Heyducks</hi>
were put to the Sword.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:65063:160"/>
After this Victory, the <hi>Turks</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
encouraged, and the <hi>Christians</hi> not a little
dejected, the Enemy made ready to lay a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Siege unto <hi>Newhausel:</hi> which after many
Attempts and Approaches they Battered so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausel.</hi>

beaten to the ground, and with incredible La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and delving, raised a Mount of Earth so
high that from thence, they could command
the Town, and beat the besieged from the
Walls.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the <hi>Hungarians</hi> whispered one
another to Surrender, (out of a fear to dispute
it any longer) which moved the <hi>Garmans</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to speak of an <hi>Accord,</hi> and sent to the
<hi>Grand Vizier</hi> demanding honourable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whose Answer was, that they should set

               <p>On the 26' of <hi>September</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

as bad Brutes as the worst of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,

                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:65063:161"/>
which Towns, together with a great
number of the neighbouring Villages, they
burnt to the Ground. Their Guides and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
they had from among the Boors of the
Country, who most unnaturally and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
shewed them the wayes and passes, and
had therefore for their pains some share of the
booty.</p>
               <p>This Havock lasted in <hi>Moravia</hi> 10 dayes,
and then they pass'd over the <hi>March-stream</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Austria</hi> (at which time, the Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

At length, having laden themselves
with all manner of Booty, they return'd to the
Camp at <hi>Newhausel,</hi> where they exposed the
Men and Beasts, which they had taken up in
several places, to common-sale in the Market:
While these things were doing, the <hi>Turks</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
themselves against the Fort <hi>Serinswar,</hi> and
by way of Stratagem attempted <hi>Clausenburgh</hi>
