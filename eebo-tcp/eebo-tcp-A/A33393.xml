            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Make no queſtion, but every one of You is ſenſible of the great Burthen, the Honour You have done Me This Day, carries with it, even in the moſt Sedate Times: But when Publick Calamities ſeem to Threaten this City, and Nation, ſo much the greater ought the Care and Vigilancy of the Magiſtrate to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98277:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I wiſh I could truly ſay, There were no Occaſion for any ſuch Apprehenſions; and whatever hath been of late of that kind, were without cauſe.</p>
            <p>I have the Teſtimony of my own Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I have always had a great ſence of my Unfitneſs for ſuch a Truſt; and that my own Ambition hath not had any ſhare in the Work of this Day.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Providence of God, with your good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, hath placed me in this Station, I intend (by His Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) to undergo it chearfully; and endeavour to underſtand, and then to do my Duty, as becomes an Honeſt Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Favour, or Affection, or regard to any Private Intereſt of my Own.</p>
            <p>And I reſolve, (according to the beſt of my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with the Advice of my Worthy Brethren the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) that the Law ſhall be my Rule; the Obſervation of which, next to our Duties to God, I make no queſtion will by His good Providence, be a means to preſerve Us in our Religion, and Properties, protect Me in doing My Duty, and be grateful to You and every good Man.</p>
            <p>There is One Thing I would beg, That every one of You in your ſeveral Stations, would conſider the Duty incumbent upon himſelf, by the wholſom Laws, Cuſtoms and Uſages of this City; and anſwer to a good Mind the diſcharge of the ſame; leſt, whilſt we are under ſuch great Apprehenſions of the Loſs of our good Government and Conſtitution by the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of our Enemies, we become Inſtruments of our own Ruine, and bring that Confuſion upon our ſelves by a ſupine Neglect, which otherwiſe (I truſt) all the diligence of our Enemies will never be able to accompliſh.</p>
            <p>Let it never be ſaid of this Famous City, (the preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of all her Neighbours) as once it was of old <hi>Rome,</hi> (then the Envy of the whole World) <hi>Roma ſuis Viribus ruit; Rome</hi>'s Deſtruction was from her ſelf: but let it never be ſo ſaid of <hi>London.

Abroad; but, had She not Divided within Her Self, and fallen into <hi>Faction</hi> at Home, thoſe could not have hurt Her. We cannot be Ignorant how Buſie our Common-Adverſaries, the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and Her <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> are, in Sowing <hi>Seeds of Diſſention</hi> amongſt us, in hopes of a Plentiful Harveſt in our Deſtructions: Let us therefore, who Intend to be <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as we tender our own Preſervation, be <hi>Admoniſh'd to Unite,</hi> and <hi>Joyn Together,</hi> as becomes Men in the Same Common-Danger to do; I Mean, in Defence of <hi>His Majeſties Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Government; The True Proteſtant Religion, our Laws, our Lives, our Liberties, and Properties; and, This Great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis,</hi> Againſt all ſuch Endeavours, and Damnable Plots and Contrivances, as have been, and (I fear) ſtill are, in Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt us; And, let no diligence of the Adverſary prevail to make a Breach amongſt us; nor no Difference of <hi>Opinion,</hi> amongſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> be ſo much as Remembred, or once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in This Our Time of Extremity, When, no leſs then Utter Ruine is Threatned to the <hi>Whole Proteſtant Intereſt;</hi> and which, nothing but a <hi>Firm <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> amongſt Themſelves, and <hi>Gods Providence,</hi> can, in Human Probability, Prevent: And, if we thus <hi>Joyn our Hands,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite our Hearts</hi> in Prayer, to that God, who hath ſo Miraculouſly Preſerved, and Reſtored this CITY hitherto, notwithſtanding the many Attempts againſt it, we may reaſonably aſſure our ſelves, He will, in His Good Time, Work out a Mighty Deliverance for us;</p>
            <closer>Which God of His Mercy Grant; and, let all Good Proteſtants Say,
