            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I May ſay in <hi>Jacobs</hi> words: <hi>Why do ye look one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Behold I have heard that there is Corn in Aegypt,</hi> Gen.
42. 12. Parents as they are deeply affected with their Childrens
afflictions: ſo they are carefull to uſe what means they can for
their recovery. It is very pious and Chriſtian, <hi>for the diviſions of</hi>
Reuben <hi>there be great thoughts of heart.</hi> Indeed our eyes cannot
weep enough for the breaches among brethren: yet this is but part of
our duty. <hi>Get thee up</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Joſhua) wherefore lyeſt thou
upon thy face?</hi> Joſh. 7. 10. Not blaming him for his mourning, but
telling him there was more work to be done. There are three Reaſons
(which I ſhall name) why I have publiſhed theſe Queries. Firſt, that
they may be of ſome uſe to <hi>Paſtours</hi> and <hi>Teachers of Churches:</hi> who
are moſt concerned in ſeeking to <hi>heale</hi> the <hi>breaches</hi> among them. Now
I do not ſee away more probable for <hi>healing,</hi> than to look into the
Cauſe of their differences.</p>
            <p>As for example, when ſome Brethren are not ſatisfied about the
place of <hi>TRIERS;</hi> cannot comfortably joyn in communion with
<hi>Souldiers:</hi> Nor with ſuch as have civill Offices under the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
think it a <hi>PUBLIKC SCANDALL</hi> to Religion, that
Church-members ſhould be <hi>Jaylors</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> of the Saints; and
<pb facs="tcp:96550:3"/>
ſhew no cauſe why they perſecute them: Here it is the Miniſters duty
in a ſpeciall manner to appear, where ſuch offences are taken. And by
ſound Doctrine prove (if he can) that theſe ſcruples and queſtions do
ariſe through the ignorance, and weaknes of the Brethren, and that
they are offences taken, but not given.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Of ſome uſe to ſuch Brethren as deſire to keep themſelves
pure, and not be partakers of other mens ſins: I hope without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enlargment, thoſe who know what it is <hi>not to defile their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
God will inable them to make a fruitfull improvement of theſe
<hi>Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe I do intend to proſecute this ſubject about Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
a little further; Theſe <hi>Queries</hi> concern Churches already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted:
But I have ſomething to publiſh for their ſakes, who are not
yet in Church fellowſhip. <hi>Lift up your eyes and look on the fields;
for they are white already to Harveſt,</hi> Joh. 4. 35. Here I ſhall ſhew
(ſo far as may be hinted by Queries:) firſt, what things are neceſſary
that Saints agree upon as <hi>uniting principles:</hi> ſecondly, what things
(as differences) may be born with: thirdly, what Opinions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
are deſtructive to the peace and growth of Churches, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
ſhall be conſtituted. <hi>Becauſe of the houſe of Jehovah our God,
I will ſeek good for thee,</hi> Pſal. 122. 9.</p>
            <p>But in the queries one thing I forgot; Whereas ſome <hi>Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
a while ſince took great liberty and boldneſs to write againſt the
miſdemeanour of the late <hi>King,</hi> and in their Sermons, had often that
Text, <hi>Judg. 5. 23. Curſe ye Meroh, &amp;c.</hi> What is the reaſon that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is now laid aſide? I move this queſtion, to the end that ſuch
who are herein concerned may vindicate themſelves: For it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſaid, if that which they wrote and preacht againſt the <hi>King,</hi> had
been done ſincerely, and in the fear of God, they would now by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Writing, as earneſtly perſwade people to lcome forth <hi>to the
help of the Lord againſt the mighty,</hi> as they did then.</p>
            <p>The cloſe is thus, ſo that I may be any way uſefull for the overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Iniquity, in Church and State, and the advancement of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
in both, I have my end: With me it is a very ſmall thing to
be judged of mans judgment: my judgment is with the Lord,
and my work with my God.</p>

yea, further, it may be queried by what Goſpel promiſe ſuch a

any open perſecutors of the Lords people, <hi>Pſal. 50. 18. Obe. v. 11, 12,

and ſinfull (and yet born with by the greater number) that
they may keep themſelves pure, and not be partakers of others

Seeing the Magiſtrate is to be obeyed, becauſe <hi>he bears not the ſword

place of <hi>Tryers.</hi> (as it is commonly called) hath given offence to
many pretious Chriſtians, and occaſioned much trouble in ſome
Churches, no leſſe than diviſion; the query is, whether it be not
the Duty of ſuch TRIERS as are Church-members to prove (if
they can) what they act in that particular buſineſs to be lawfull
by the Word of God, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 32, 33. 1 Pet. 5. 2, 3. 1 Cor. 8. 12,

Churches have <hi>riſen from Souldiers and others, who have places un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

(as yet free from the occaſion of ſuch trouble) do well conſider
what they do, before they admit Souldiers and others (ſo much
excepted againſt) into Church Fellowſhip? Again, for others who
either intend to joyn to ſome Church already gathered, or to
conſtitute themſelves a Church? Whether it do not likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much concern them to avoid that thing which others have
been ſo much prejudiced by: As a wiſe man will not run his Ship

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> XVII. Whether Churches in ſuch a day as this is, ſhould
not make diligent enquiry, what it is that hinders their glory and
growth? What it is that keeps the bad in, and the good out?
whence it is that they do not experience ſo much life, ſweetneſſe,
and divine Preſence in Church Ordinances as formerly they did?
Again, would they be conſcientious, and ſincere in ſearching for
the cauſe? then, whether it would not be found: Firſt, <hi>Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
in ſome Officers, who look more after the world than after
the walking of their Flock, and ſeek to keep up ſtate and pompe
in their own Family, more than purity and holines in the houſe of
God. Secondly, <hi>Arrogancy</hi> and Pride in ſome Members who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Stateſmen,</hi> are like the <hi>Sons of Zerviah, too hard for the reſt:</hi>
For through fear ſome dare not ſpeak to them of their ſcandalous

though not their conſciences, others care not for it, as if (<hi>Caa<gap reason="illegible: blurred" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were <hi>not their brothers keeper,</hi> Thus though the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of ſome Church members be like <hi>Gehazis leproſie upon the fore

Church hath neither an ear to hear, nor an ey to ſee, <hi>Lam. 3. 40.

neglecting their Chriſtian Duty each to other, that is, not admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing

into Churches (eſpecially the deceitfull walking of ſome <hi>Church-Officers,</hi>
who were winked at, when they openly ſought by LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS
and other wayes to corrupt the Churches) hath not (by
the juſt hand of God) brought many troubles and diviſions upon
them: Again, if a Church be corrupted by ſuffering ſcandalous
perſons in it, what is the Duty of a <hi>Siſter Church</hi> knowing the
ſame to, be true? And how far, and how long may a Church
hold communion with any Church, which keeps ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

been raiſed and continued in a ſpeciall manner, by ſome <hi>Church-members;</hi>
And whether ſuch Church members have not been
