            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Inſtant, between Three and Four of the Clock in the Morning conveyed himſelf away, and having in Diſguiſe got down ſafe to <hi>Wapping</hi> thought himſelf ſafe enough, having put himſelf on Board a Collier, which he pretended was Bound fow <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> but indeed was Deſigned for <hi>Hambourough,</hi> but ſome Perſons having Notice thereof, by the means of the <hi>Mate,</hi> they went to a certain Juſtice for a Warrant to Apprehend him, but he thought fit to put them off, whereupon they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves immediately to the Lords of the <hi>Council,</hi> who granted them a Warrant, whereupon they went immediately to ſearch the Ship, but he on Tueſday Night, thought not himſelf ſafe on Board the Collier, in which he was to paſs, but lay in another Ship hard by; thoſe that came this day to ſearch for him miſs'd of him on board, but had information given them that he was hard by, at a little Pedling Ale-Houſe a taking his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well-Pot, where accordingly they found him, being the Sign of the <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow</hi> in <hi>Anchor</hi> and <hi>Hope-Alley</hi> near <hi>King Edward</hi> Stairs in <hi>Wapping,</hi> from whence they immediately hurry'd him in a Coach Guarded with ſeveral Blunderbuſſes to the <hi>Lord Mayors,</hi> where the Crowd was ſo great, and the Rabble ſo Numerous, all crying out together Vengeance, Juſtice, Juſtice; that the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> was forced to come out into his Belcony, and with his Hat in his Hand deſired the People to go away, and keep the Peace; and did promiſe them that he had already ſent to the Lords of the <hi>Council</hi> about the Matter, and that they ſhould have Juſtice done them; and that in the mean time, their Priſoner ſhould be ſafely Guarded, whereupon the People withdrew, and ſoon after my Lord under a ſtrong Guard, was ſene to the Lords of the <hi>Council.</hi>
