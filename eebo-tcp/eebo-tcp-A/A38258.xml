            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His last Parliament I called, not more by others advise, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of My affaires, then by My owne choice and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who have alwaies thought the right way of Parliaments most safe for My Crowne, and best pleasing to My People: And although I was not forgetfull of those sparks, which some mens distempers formerly studied to kindle in Parliaments, (which by forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to convene for some yeares, I hoped to have extinguished) yet resolving with My self to give all just satisfaction to modest and sober desires, and to redresse all publique grievances in Church &amp; State; I hoped by My (freedome and their moderation) to prevent all misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, and miscarriages in this: In which as I feared affaires would meet with some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and prejudice in other men, so I resolved they should find least of them in My selfe; not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58806:7"/>
doubting, but by the weight of Reason I should counterpoize the over-ballancings of any factions.</p>
               <p>I was, indeed, sorry to heare, with what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and popular heat Elections were carried in many places; yet hoping that the gravity and discretion of other Gentlemen would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and fix the Commons to a due tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (guiding some mens wel-meaning zeale by such rules of moderation as are best both to preserve and restore the health of all States and Kingdomes:) No man was better pleased with the convening of this Parliament, then My self; who knowing best the largenesse of My owne Heart toward My Peoples good and just contentment, pleased My self most in that good and firme understanding, which would hence grow between Me and My People.</p>
               <p>All Jealousies being laid aside, My owne and My Childrens Interests gave me many obligations to seek and preserve the love and welfare of my Subjects. The onely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blessing that is left to the ambition of just Monarchs, as their greatest honour and safety, next Gods protection; I cared not to lessen My selfe in some things of My wonted Prerogative; since I knew I could be no loser, if I might gaine but a recompence in My Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects affections.</p>
               <p>I intended not onely to oblige My friends,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58806:7"/>
but Mine enemies also: exceeding even the desires of those, that were factiously discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, if they did but pretend to any modest and sober sense.</p>
               <p>The <hi>odium</hi> and offences which some mens rigour or remissnesse in Church, and State, had contracted upon My Government, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have expiated by such Lawes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations for the future, as might not onely rectif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I resolved to reforme, what I should by free and full advice in Parliament be convinced to be amisse; and to grant whatever My Reason &amp; Conscience told Me, was fit to be desired; I wish I had kept My self within those bounds, and not suffered My owne Judgment to have been over-borne in some things, more by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Importunities, than their Arguments; My confidence had lesse betrayed My selfe, and My Kingdomes, to those advantages, which some men sought for, who wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but power, and occasion to do mischief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58806:8"/>But our sinnes being ripe, there was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of Gods Justice, from reaping that glory in our Calamities, which we robb'd him of in our Prosperity.</p>
               <div type="prayer">
                  <p>For thou (ô Lord) hast made us see, that Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of future Reforming doe not alwaies satisfie thy Iustice, nor prevent thy Vengeance for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miscarriages.</p>
                  <p>Our sinnes have overlaid our hopes; Thou hast taught us to depend on thy mercies to forgive, not on our purpose to amend.</p>
                  <p>When thou hast vindicated thy glory by thy Iudgments, and hast shewed us, how unsafe it is to offend thee, upon presumptions afterwards to please thee; Then I trust thy mercies will restore those blessings to us, which we have so much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as to force thee to deprive us of them.</p>
                  <p>For want of timely repentance of our sinnes, Thou givest us cause to Repent of those Remedies we too late apply.</p>
                  <p>Yet I doe not Repent of My calling this last Parliament; because, ô Lord, I did it with an upright intention, to Thy glory, and My Peoples good.</p>
                  <p>The miseries which have ensued upon Me and My Kingdomes, are the Iust effects of thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure upon us; and may be yet (through thy mercy) preparatives of us to future blessings, and better hearts to enjoy them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58806:8"/>O Lord, though thou hast deprived us of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny former comforts; yet grant Me and My people the benefit of our afflictions, and thy chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that thy rod as well as thy staffe may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us: Then shall we dare to account them the strokes not of an Enemy, but a Father: when thou givest us those humble affections, that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of patience in repentance, which becomes thy Children; I shall have no cause to repent the miseries this Parliament hath occasioned, when by them thou hast brought Me and My People, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly to repent of the sinnes we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                  <p>Thy Grace is infinitely better with our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, then our Peace could be with Our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>O thou soveraigne goodnesse and wisdome, who Over-rulest all our Counsels; over-rule also all our hearts; That the worse things we suffer by thy Iustice, the better we may be by thy Mercy.</p>
                  <p>As our sinnes have turned our Antidotes into Poyson, so let thy Grace turne our Poysons into Antidotes.</p>
                  <p>As the sins of our Peace disposed us to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Warre, so let this Warre prepare us for thy blessed Peace.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> Vpon the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> death.</head>
               <p>I Looked upon my Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as a Gentleman, whose great abilities might make a Prince rather afraid, then asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to employ him, in the greatest affaires of State.</p>
               <p>For those were prone to create in him great confidence of undertakings, and this was like enough to betray him to great errours, and many enemies: Whereof he could not but contract good store, while moving in so high a spheare, and with so vigorous a lustre, he must needs (as the Sun) raise many envious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, which condensed by a popular <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> were capable to cast a cloud upon the brightest merit, and integrity.</p>
               <p>Though I cannot in My Judgment approve all he did, driven (it may be) by the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of times, and the Temper of that People, more then led by his owne disposition to any height and rigour of actions: yet I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be convinced of any such criminousnesse in him, as willingly to expose his life to the stroke of Justice, and malice of his enemies.</p>
               <p>I never met with a more unhappy conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of affaires, then in the businesse of that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58806:9"/>
unfortunate Earle: when between My owne unsatisfiednesse in Conscience, and a necessity (as some told me) of satisfying the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of some people; I was perswaded by those, that I think wished me well, to chuse rather what was safe, then what seemed just; prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the outward peace of My Kingdoms with men, before that inward exactnesse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science before God.</p>
               <p>And indeed I am so farre from excusing or denying that complyance on My part (for plenary consent it was not) to his destruction, whom in My Judgment I thought not, by any cleare Law, guilty of death: That I never bare any touch of Conscience with greater regret: which, as a signe of My repentance, I have often with sorrow confessed both to God and men, as an act of so sinfull frailty, that it discovered more a feare of Man, than of God, whose name and place on Earth no man is worthy to beare, who will avoid inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of State, by acts of so high injustice, as no publique convenience can expiate or compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate.</p>
               <p>I see it a bad exchange to wound a mans owne Conscience, thereby to salve State sores; to calme the stormes of popular discontents, by stirring up a tempest in a mans owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
               <p>Nor hath Gods Justice failed in the event
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58806:10"/>
and sad consequences, to shew the world the fallacy of that Maxime, <hi>Better one man perish (though unjustly) then the people be displeased, or destroyed.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>In all likelyhood, I could never have suffred, with My People, greater calamities, (yet with greater comfort) had I vindicated <hi>Strafford's</hi> innocency, at least by denying to Signe that destructive BILL, according to that Justice, which My Conscience suggested to Me, then I have done since I gratified some mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull importunities with so cruell a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And I have observed, that those, who counselled Me to signe that Bill, have been so farre from receiving the rewards of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiatings with the People, that no men have been harassed and crushed more than they: He onely hath been least vexed by them, who counselled Me, not to consent against the vote of My owne Conscience; I hope God hath forgiven Me and them, the sinfull rashnesse of that businesse.</p>
               <p>To which being in My soule so fully consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, those Judgements God hath pleased to send upon Me, are so much the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as a meanes (I hope) which his mercy hath sanctified so to Me, as to make Me repent of that unju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58806:10"/>
before all enjoyments, and the peace of My Conscience before the preservation of My Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Nor hath any thing more fortified My re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions against all those violent importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which since have sought to gaine alike consent from Me, to Acts, wherein my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is unsatisfied, then the sharp touches I have had for what passed Me, in My Lord of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Businesse.</p>
               <p>Not that I resolved to have employed him in My affaires, against the advise of My Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but I would not have had any hand in his Death, of whose Guiltlesnesse I was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter assured, then any man living could be.</p>
               <p>Nor were the Crimes objected against him so cleare, as after a long and faire hearing to give convincing satisfaction to the Major part of both Houses; especially that of the Lords, of whom scarce a third part were present, when the Bill passed that House: And for the House of Commons, many Gentlemen, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed enough to diminish My Lord of <hi>Straffords</hi> greatnesse and power, yet unsatisfied of his guilt in Law, durst not Condemne him to die: who for their Integrity in their Votes, were by Posting their Names, exposed to the popular calumny, hatred, and fury; which grew then so exorbitant in their clamours <hi>for Iustice,</hi> (that is, to have both My selfe and the two
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58806:11"/>
Houses Vote, and doe as they would have us) that many ('tis thought) were rather terrified to concurre with the condemning party, then satisfied that of right they ought so to doe.</p>
               <p>And that after Act vacating the Authority of the precedent, for future imitation, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently tells the world, that some remorse tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched even his most implacable enemies, as knowing he had very hard measure, and such as they would be very loath should be repeated to themselves.</p>
               <p>This tendernesse and regret I find in my soul, for having had any hand (and that very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly God knowes) in shedding one mans bloud unjustly, (though under the colour and formalities of Justice, and pretences of avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding publick mischeifes) which may (I hope) be some evidence before God and Man, to all Posterity, that I am far from bearing justly the vast load &amp; guilt of all that bloud which hath been shed in this unhappy Warre; which some men will needs charge on <hi>Me,</hi> to ease their own soules, who am, and ever shall be, more afraid to take away any mans life unjustly, then to lose my owne.</p>
               <div type="prayer">
                  <p>But thou, O God of infinite mercies, forgive me that act of sinfull compliance, which hath greater aggravations upon Me then any man. Since I had not the least temptation of envy, or

malice against him, and by my place should, at least so farre, have been a preserver of him, as to have denied my consent to his destruction.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me.</p>
                  <p>Deliver me from bloud guiltinesse O God, thou God of my salvation, and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousnesse.</p>

                  <p>Yet cast me not away from thy presence, purge me with the blood of my Redeemer, and I shall be clean; wash me with that pretious effusion, and I shall be writer then snow.</p>

                  <p>Make me to prefer Iustice, which is thy will, before all contrary clamours, which are but the discoveries of mans injurious will.</p>

               <p>That I went attended with some Gentlemen, as it was no unwonted thing for the Majesty and safety of a King so to be attended, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in discontented times; so were my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers at that time short of my ordinary Guard, and no way proportionable to hazard a tumultuary conflict. Nor were they more scared at my comming, then I was un-assured of not having some affronts cast upon me, if I had none with me to preserve a reverence to me; For many people had (at that time) lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to think those hard thoughts, which they have since aboundantly vented against Me, both by words and deeds.</p>
               <p>The summe of that businesse was this.</p>
               <p>Those men, and their adherents were then looked upon by the affrighted vulgar, as grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter protectors of their Lawes and Liberties, then my self, and so worthier of their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

I leave them to God, and their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, who, if guilty of evill machinations; no present impunity, or popular vindications of them will be subterfuge sufficient to rescue them from those exact Tribunalls.</p>
               <p>To which, in the obstructions of Justice among men, we must religiously appeal, as being an argument to us Christians of that after un-avoidable judgement, which shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge, what among men is but corruptly decided, or not at all.</p>
               <p>I endeavoured to have prevented, if God had seen fit, those future commotions, which I fore-saw, would in all likelyhood follow some mens activity (if not restrained) and so now hath done to the undoing of many thousands; the more is the pitty.</p>
               <p>But to over-awe the freedome of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or to weaken their just Authority by any violent impressions upon them, was not at all my designe: I thought I had so much Justice and Reason on my side, as should not have needed so rough assistance; and I was resolved rather to bear the repulse with patience, then to use such hazardous extremities.</p>

               <p>As it is one of the most convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that there is a God, while his power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor doth any thing portend more Gods displeasure against a Nation, then when he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the confluence and clamours of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, to passe all boundaries of Lawes, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Authority.</p>
               <p>Which those Tumults did to so high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Insolence, that they spared not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Honour and Freedome of the two Houses, menacing, reproaching, shaking, yea, &amp; assaulting some Members of both Houses, as they fancyed, or disliked them: Nor did they forbear most rude and unseemly deportments
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58806:15"/>
both in contemptuous words and actions, to My selfe and My Court.</p>
               <p>Nor was this a short fit or two of shaking, as an ague, but a quotidian feaver, alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing to higher inflammations, impatient of any mitigation, restraint, or remission.</p>
               <p>First, they must be a guard against those feares, which some men scared themselves and others withall; when indeed nothing was more to be feared and lesse to be used by wise men, then those tumultuary confluxes of meane and rude people, who are taught first to petition, then to protect, then to dictate, at last to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and overawe the Parliament.</p>
               <p>All obstructions in Parliament (that is, all freedome of differing in Votes, and debating matters with reason and candour) must be taken away with these Tumults: By these must the Houses be purged, and all rotten Members (as they pleased to count them) cast out: By these the obstinacy of men resolved to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Consciences must be subdued, by these all factious, seditious, and schismaticall proposalls against Government Ecclesiasticall or Civil, must be backed and abetted, till they prevailed.</p>
               <p>Generally, who ever had most mind to bring forth confusion and ruine upon Church and State, used the midwifery of those Tumults: whose riot and impatience was such, that they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58806:15"/>
would not stay the ripening and season of Counsels, or fair production of Acts, in the order, gravity, and deliberatenesse befitting a Parliament; but ripped up with barbarous cruelty, and forcibly cut out abortive Votes, such as their Inviters and Incouragers most fancyed.</p>
               <p>Yea, so enormous and detestable were their outrages, that no sober man could be without an infinite shame and sorrow to see them so to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, and connived at by some, countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, incouraged, and applauded by others.</p>
               <p>What good man had not rather want any thing he most desired, for the Publique good, then obtaine it by such unlawfull and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meanes? But mens passions and Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections seldome agree; violent designes and motions must have sutable engines, such as too much attend their owne ends, seldome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine themselves to Gods meanes. Force must crowd in what Reason will not lead.</p>
               <p>Who were the chief Demagogues and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of Tumults, to send for them, to flatter and embolden them, to direct and tune their clamorous importunities, some men yet living are too conscious to pretend ignorance: God in his due time will let these see, that those were no fit meanes to be used for attaining his ends.</p>
               <p>But, as it is no strange thing for the Sea to

rage, when strong winds blow upon it; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Multitudes to become insolent, when they have Men of some reputation for parts and piety to set them on.</p>
               <p>That which made their rudenesse most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, was, that many Complaints being made, and Messages sent by My selfe and some of both Houses; yet no order for redresse could be obtained with any vigour and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, proportionable to the malignity of that now far-spread disease, and predominant mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
               <p>Such was some mens stupidity, that they feared no inconvenience; Others petulancy, that they joyed to see their betters shamefully outraged, and abused, while they knew their only security consisted in vulgar flattery: So insensible were they of Mine, or the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses common safety and Honours.</p>
               <p>Nor could ever any order be obtained, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to examine, censure, and punish the knowne Boutefeus, and impudent Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who boasted of the influence they had, and used to convoke those Tumults as their advantages served.</p>
               <p>Yea, some (who should have been wiser States-men) owned them as friends, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Courage, Zeale, &amp; Industry; which to sober men could seem no better then that of the Devil, who <hi>goes about seeking whom he may</hi> deceive, and <hi>devoure.</hi>

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58806:16"/>I confesse, when I found such a deafnesse, that no Declaration from the Bishops, who were first fouly insolenced and assaulted; nor yet from other Lords and Gentlemen of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; nor yet from My self could take place for the due repression of these Tumul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some may interpret it as an effect of Pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity for any man for popular terrours to desert his publique station. But I think it a hardinesse, beyond true valour, for a wise man to set himself against the breaking in of a Sea; which to resist, at present, threatens imminent danger; but to withdraw, gives it space to spend its fury, and gaines a fitter time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the breach.

               <p>Some suspected and affirmed that I medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated a Warre, (when I went from <hi>Whitehall</hi> onely to redeem My Person, and Conscience from violence) God knowes I did not then

think of a Warre. Nor will any prudent man conceive that I would by so many former, and some after Acts, have so much weakned My selfe, if I had purposed to engage in a Warre, which to decline by all meanes, I denyed My self in so many particulars: 'Tis evident I had then no Army to flie unto, for protection, or vindication.</p>
               <p>Who can blame Me, or any other, for a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing our selves from the daily baitings of the Tumults, not knowing whether their fury and discontent might not flie so high, as to worry and teare those in pieces, whom as yet they but played with in their pawes? God, who is My sole Judge, is My Witnesse in Heaven, that I never had any thoughts of going from My House at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> if I could have had but any reasonable faire Quarter; I was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to beare much, and did so, but I did not think My self bound to prostitute the Majesty of my Place and Person, the safety of My Wife and Children, to those, who are prone to insult most, when they have objects and opportunity most capable of their rudenesse and petulancy.</p>
               <p>But this businesse of the Tumults (whereof some have given already an account to God, others yet living know themselves desperately guilty) Time and the guilt of many hath so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to leave it, as it is; Onely I believe the just Avenger of all disorders, will in time make those men, and that City, see their sinne in the glasse of their punishment. 'Tis more then an even-lay that they may one day see themselves punished by that way they offended.</p>
               <p>Had this Parliament, as it was in its first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Constitution, sate full and free, the Members of both Houses being left to their freedome of Voting, as in all reason, honour, and Religion, they should have been; I doubt not but things would have been so carried, as would have given no lesse content to all good men, then they wished or expected.</p>
               <p>For, I was resolved to heare reason in all things, and to consent to it so farre as I could comprehend it: but as Swine are to Gardens and orderly Plantations, so are Tumults to Parliaments, and Plebeian concourses to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Councels, turning all into disorders and sordid confusions.</p>
               <p>I am prone sometimes to think, That had I called this Parliament to any other place in <hi>England</hi> (as I might opportunely enough have done) the sad consequences in all likelyhood, with Gods blessing, might have been preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

               <p>A continuall Parliament (I thought) would but keep the Common-weale in tune, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Lawes in their due execution and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, wherein My interest lies more than any

               <p>Some (as I have heard) gave it out, that I soon repented Me of that setling Act: and many would needs perswade Me, I had cause so to doe; but I could not easily nor sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspect such ingratitude in Men of Honors.

               <p>Of which, I doe not yet dispaire, but that God will still blesse Me with increase of it: when Men shall have more leisure, and lesse prejudice; that so with unpassionate represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations they may reflect upon those, (as I think) not more princely then friendly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, which I granted towards the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating of their happinesse, who are now onely miserable in this, That some mens ambition will not give them leave to enjoy what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their good.</p>

               <p>Nor if I had justly resented any indignities put upon Me, or others, was I then in any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to have taken just revenge in an Hostile and Warlike way upon those, whom I knew so well fortified in the love of the meaner sort of the people, that I could not have given My e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies greater, and more desired advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Me, then by so unprincely Inconstancy, to have assaulted them with Armes, thereby to scatter them, whom but lately I had solemnly setled by an Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>God knowes I longed for nothing more then that My self, and My Subjects might qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly enjoy the fruits of My many condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p>It had been a Course full of sinne, as well as of Hazard, and dishonour for Me to goe about the cutting up of that by the Sword, which I had so lately planted, so much (as I thought) to my Subjects content, and Mine own too, in all probability: If some men had not feared where no fear was, whose security consisted in scaring others.</p>
               <p>I thank God I know so well the sincerity and uprightnesse of My owne heart, in passing that great Bill, which exceeded the very thoughts of former times; That although I may seeme lesse a Polititian to men, yet I need

no secret distinctions or evasions before God. Nor had I any reservations in My own Soule, when I passed it; nor repentings after, till I saw that My letting some men go up to the Pinnacle of the Temple, was a temptation to them to cast Me down head-long.</p>
               <p>Concluding, that without a miracle, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy it selfe, together with Me, could not but be dashed in pieces, by such a precipitious fall as they intended. Whom God in mercy forgive, and make them see at length, That as many Kingdomes as the Devill shewed our Saviour, and the glory of them, (if they could be at once enjoyed by them) are not worth the gaining, by wayes of sinfull ingratitude and dishonour, which hazards a Soule worth more Worlds then this hath Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>But God hath hitherto preserved Me, and made Me to see, That it is no strange thing for men, left to their owne passions, either to doe much evill themselves, or abuse the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much goodnesse of others, whereof an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Surfet is the most desperate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable disease.</p>
               <p>I cannot say properly that I repent of that Act, since I have no reflexions upon it as a sin of my will, though an error of too charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a judgement: Onely I am sorry other mens eyes should be evill, because mine were good.</p>

Better for Me to die enjoying this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of My Soul, which subjects Me only to God, so farre as by Reason or Religion he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects Me, then live with the Title of a King, if it should carry such a vassalage with it, as not to suffer Me to use My Reason and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in which I declare as a King, to like or dislike.</p>

which My Reason, in Justice, Honour, and Religion bids Me deny.</p>
               <p>Yet so tender I see some men are of their being subject to Arbitrary Government, (that is, the Law of anothers will, to which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves give no consent) that they care not with how much dishonour and absurdity they make their King the onely man, that must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the will of others, without having po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer left Him, to use His own Reason, either in Person, or by any Representation.</p>
               <p>And if My dissentings at any time were (as some have suspected, and uncharitably avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of error, opinion, activenesse, weaknesse, or wilfulnesse, and what they call Obstinacy in Me (which not true Judgement of things, but some vehement prejudice or passion hath fixed on My mind;) yet can no man think it other then the Badge and Method of Slavery, by savage rudenesse, and importunate detrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of violence, to have the mist of His Errour and Passion dispelled, which is a shadow of Reason, and must serve those that are destitute of the substance. Sure that man cannot be blameable to God or Man, who seriously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to see the best reason of things, and faithfully followes what he takes for Reason: The uprightnesse of his intentions will excuse the possible failings of his understanding; If a Pilot at Sea cannot see the Pole-star, it can

be no fault in him to steere his course by such stars as do best appear to him. It argues ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those men to be conscious of their defects of Reason, and convincing Arguments, who call in the assistance of meer force to carry on the weaknesse of their Councells, and Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls. I may, in the Truth and uprightnesse of My heart, protest before God and Men; that I never wilfully opposed, or denied any thing, that was in a fair way, after full and free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates propounded to Me, by the two Houses, Further then I thought in good reason I might, and was bound to do.</p>
               <p>Nor did any thing ever please Me more, then when My Judgment so concurred with theirs, that I might with good Conscience consent to them: yea, in many things where not absolute and morall necessity of Reason, but temporary convenience on point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was to be considered. I chose rather to deny My self, then them; as preferring that which they thought necessary for My Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples good, before what I saw but convenient for My self.</p>
               <p>For I can be content to recede much from My own Interests, and Personall Rights, of which I conceive My self to be Master; but in what concernes Truth, Justice, the Rights of the Church, and My Crown, together with the generall good of My Kingdomes; (all

which I am bound to preserve as much as morally lies in Me;) here I am, and ever shall be fixt and resolute, nor shall any man gain My consent to that, wherein My Heart gives My tongue or hand the Lie; nor will I be brought to affirme that to Men, which in My Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I denied before God.

               <p>I was resolved how to beare this, and much more, with patience: But I foresaw they could hardly conteine themselves within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of this one unworthy act, who had effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery enough to commit, or countenance it. This was but the hand of that cloud, which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oone after to overspread the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and cast all into disorder and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>For tis among the wicked Maximes of bold and disloyall undertakers: That bad actions must alwayes be seconded with worse, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not be begun then not carried on, for they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58806:30"/>
think the retreat more dangerous then the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, and hate repentance more then perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in a Fault.</p>
               <p>This gave Me to see clearly through all the pious disguises, and soft palliations of some men; whose words were sometime smoother then oyle, but now I saw they would prove ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Swords.</p>
               <p>Against which I having (as yet) no defence, but that of a good Conscience, thought it My best policy (with patience) to bear what I could not remedy: And in this (I thank God) I had the better of <hi>Hotham,</hi> that no disdain, or emotion of passion transported Me, by the indignity of his carriage, to doe or say any thing, unbeseeming My self, or unsutable to that temper, which, in greatest injuries, I think, best becomes a Christian, as comming nearest to the great example of Christ.</p>
               <p>And indeed, I desire alwaies more to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I am a Christian, then a King; for what the Majesty of one might justly abhor, the Charity of the other is willing to bear; what the height of a King tempteth to revenge, the humility of a Christian teacheth to forgive. Keeping in compasse all those impotent passions, whose excesse injures a man, more then his greatest enemies can; for these give their malice a full impression on our souls, which otherwaies cannot reach very far, nor doe us much hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:58806:30"/>I cannot but observe how God not long after so pleaded, and avenged My cause, in the eye of the world, that the most wilfully blind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid the displeasure to see it, &amp; with some remorse and fear to own it as a notable stroke, and prediction of divine vengeance.</p>
               <p>For, Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> unreproached, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threatned, uncursed by any language or secret imprecation of Mine, onely blasted with the conscience of his owne wickednesse, and falling from one inconstancy to another, not long after paies his owne and his eldest Sons heads, as forfeitures of their disloyalty, to those men, from whom surely he might have expected an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reward then thus to divide their heads from their bodies, whose hearts with them were divided from their KING.</p>
               <p>Nor is it strange that they who imployed them at first in so high a service, and so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfull to them, should not find mercy enough to forgive Him, who had so much premerited of them: For, Apostacy unto Loyalty some men account the most unpardonable sinne.</p>
               <p>Nor did a solitary vengeance serve the turne, the cutting off one head in a Family is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to expiate the affront done to the head of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale. The eldest Son must be involved in the punishment, as he was infected with the sinne of the Father, against the Father of his Country: Root and branch God cuts off in one day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:58806:31"/>These observations are obvious to every fancy: God knows, I was so farre from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the <hi>Hotham's</hi> ruine, (though it were such as was able to give the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For, he was never thought to be of that superstitious sowrenesse, which some men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, in matters of Religion; which so darkens their judgment that they cannot see any thing of Sinne and Rebellion in those meanes, they use, with intents to reforme to their Models, of what they call Religion, who think all is gold of piety, which doth but gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster with a shew of Zeale and fervency.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> was (I think) a man of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temper, and so most liable to those down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right temptations of ambition, which have no cloake or cheat of Religion to impose upon themselves or others.</p>
               <p>That which makes me more pity him is, that after he began to have some inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a repentance for his sinne, and repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his duty to Me, He should be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to fall into the hands of their Justice, and not My Mercy, who could as willingly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58806:31"/>
have forgiven him, as he could have asked that favour of Me.</p>
               <p>For I think clemency a debt, which we ought to pay to those that crave it, when we have cause to believe they would not after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse it, since God himself suffer us not to pay any thing for his mercy but onely prayers and praises.</p>
               <p>Poor Gentleman, he is now become a note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able monument of unprosperous disloyalty, teaching the world by so sad and unfortunate a spectacle, that the rude carriage of a Subject towards his Soveraigne carries alwaies its own vengeance, as an unseperable shadow with it, and those oft prove the most fatall, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Executioners of it, who were the first Imployers in the service.</p>
               <p>After-times will dispute it, whether <hi>Hotham</hi> were more infamous at <hi>Hull,</hi> or at <hi>Tower-hill</hi>; though 'tis certain that no punishment so stains a mans Honour, as wilfull preparations of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy actions; which besides the conscience of the sinne, brands with most indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of infamy, the name and memory to posterity, who not engaged in the Factions of the times, have the most impartiall reflections on the actions.</p>

               <p>Whom did I by power protect against the Justice of Parliament?</p>

               <p>In this point I could not but approve their generous constancy and cautiousnesse; further then this I did never allow any mans refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse against the Priviledges and Orders of the Houses; to whom I wished nothing more, then Safety, Fulnesse, and Freedome.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, some men, and those not many, despairing in faire and Parliamentary wayes by free deliberations, and Votes to gain the concurrence of the Major part of Lords and Commons, betook themselves (by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate activity of factious Tumults) to sift and terrifie away all those Members whom they saw to be of contrary minds to their purposes.</p>
               <p>How oft was the businesse of the Bishops enjoying their Ancient places, and undoubted Priviledges in the House of Peeres, carried for them by farre the Major part of Lords. Yet after five repulses, contray to all Order and Custome, it was by tumultuary, instigations obtruded again, and by a few carried, when most of the Peeres were forced to absent them-themselves.</p>
               <p>In like manner, as the Bill against Root and Branch, brought on by tumultuary Clamours, and schismaticall Terrours, which could never passe, till both Houses were sufficiently thinned and over-awed.</p>

               <p>That I consented to the Bill of putting the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops out of the House of Peers, was done with a firm perswasion of their contentednes to suffer a present diminution in their Rights, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for My sake, and the Common-weals, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I was confident they would readily yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, rather then occasion (by the least obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on their part) any dangers to Me, or to My Kingdome.

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:58806:36"/>Afterwards indeed a great shew of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents was made; which were but consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces necessarily following upon Mine, or others withdrawing from, or defence against vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: but those could not be the first occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of raising an Army against Me. Wherein I was so far from preventing them, (as they have declared often, that they might seeme to have the advantage and Justice of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive part, and load Me with all the envy and injuries of first assaulting them) that God knows, I had not so much as any hopes of an Army in My thoughts. Had the Tumults been Honourably and Effectually repressed by exemplary Justice, and the liberty of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses so vindicated, that all Members of either House might with Honour and Freedome, becomming such a Senate, have come and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their Consciences, I had obtained all that I designed by My withdrawing, and had much more willingly, and speedily returned then I retired; this being My necessity driving, the other My choise desiring.</p>
               <p>But some men know, I was like to bring the same judgement and constancy, which I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with Me, which would never fit their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes: and so while they invited Me to come, and grievously complained of My absence, yet they could not but be pleased with it: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they had found out that plausible
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58806:37"/>
and popular pretext of raising an Army to fetch in Delinquents: when all that while they never punished the greatest and most intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Delinquencie of the Tumults, and their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citers, which drave My selfe, and so many of both Houses from their places, by most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous indignities, which yet in all Reason and Honour, they were as loath to have deserted, as those others were willing they should, that so they might have occasion to persecute them with the Injuries of an Army, for not suffering more tamely the Injuries of the Tumults.</p>
               <p>That this is the true state, and first drift and designe in raising an Army against Me, is by the sequell so evident, that all other pretences vanish. For when they declared by Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Treaties, what they would have to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease them; there was nothing of consequence offered to Me, or demanded of Me, as any originall difference in any point of Law, or order of Justice. But among other lesser In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, this chiefly was urged, The Aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Episcopall, and the Establishment of Presbyterian Government.</p>
               <p>All other things at any time propounded were either impertinent as to any ground of a War, or easily granted by Me, and onely to make up a number, or else they were meerly consequentiall, and accessary, after the War was by them unjustly began.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58806:37"/>I cannot hinder other mens thoughts, whom the noise and shew of piety, and heat for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and Religion, might easily so fill with prejudice, that all equality and clearnesse of judgement might be obstructed.

               <div type="prayer">

                  <p>O my God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soule, and have not set Thee before their eyes.</p>

                  <p>Thou, O Lord, art my witnesse how oft I have deplored, and studied to divert the necessity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wherein I cannot well be thought so prodigally thirsty of my Subjects blood, as to venture my own Life, which I have been oft compelled to doe in this unhappy Warre; and which were better spent to save then to destroy my People.</p>

                  <p>The confidence of some mens false tongues is such, that they would make me almost suspect my own innocency: Yea, I could be content (at least by my silence) to take upon me so great a guilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, If by that I might allay the malice of my Enemies, and redeeme my People from this miserable Warre; since thou O Lord knowest my Innocency in this thing.</p>

of the fruits of their violent and wicked Counsells.</p>
                  <p>Save, O Lord, thy servant, as hitherto thou hast, and in thy due time scatter the people that delight in Warre.</p>
                  <p>Arise O Lord, lift up thy self, because of the rage of mine Enemies, which encreaseth more and more. Behold them that have conceived mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, travelled with iniquity, and brought forth falshood.</p>
                  <p>Thou knowest the chief designe of this Warre is, either to destroy My Person, or force My Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to make me renege my Conscience and thy Truth.</p>
                  <p>I am driven to crosse <hi>Davids</hi> choise and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, rather to fall into the hands of men, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them, (though their mercies be cruell) then into thy hands by sinning against My Conscience, and in that against thee, who art a consuming fire; Better they destroy Me, then thou shouldst damne Me.</p>
                  <p>Be thou ever the defence of My soul, who wilt save the upright in heart.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:58806:39"/>No man can doubt but they prevented Me in their purposes, as well as their injuries, who are so much before-hand in their preparations against Me, and surprisalls of My strength. Such as are not for Them, yet dare not be for Me; so over-aw'd is their Loyalty by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers numbers and terrours. I believe My In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and unpreparednesse to assert My Rights and Honour, makes Me the more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their esteeme; who would not so easily have declared a War against Me, if I had first assaulted them.</p>
               <p>They knew My chiefest Armes left Me, were those only, which the Ancient Christians were wont to use against their Persecutors, Prayers and Teares. These may serve a good mans turne, if not to Conquer as a Souldier, yet to suffer as a Martyr.</p>
               <p>Their preventing of Me, and surprizing my Castles, Forts, Armes, and Navy, with the Militia, is so farre best for me, That it may drive me from putting any trust in the arme of flesh, and wholly to cast my self into the protection of the living God, who can save by few, or none, as well as by many.</p>
               <p>He that made the greedy Ravens to be <hi>Elias</hi> Caterers, and bring him food, may also make their surprisall of outward force and defence, an opportunity to shew me the speciall support of his power and protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58806:40"/>I thank God I reckon not now the want of the <hi>Militia</hi> so much in reference to My own protection as My Peoples.</p>
               <p>Their many and sore oppressions grieve Me, I am above My owne, what I want in the hands of Force and Power, I have in the wings of Faith and Prayer.</p>
               <p>But this is the strange method these men will needs take to resolve their riddle of Making Me a glorious King, by taking away my Kingly power: Thus I shall become a support to My Friends, and a Terrour to My Enemies by being unable to succour the one, or suppresse the other.</p>
               <p>For thus have they designed, and proposed to Me, the new modelling of Soveraignty and Kingship, as without any reality of power, or without any necessity of subjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: That the Majesty of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might hereafter, hang like <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tomb, by a magnetique Charme, between the Power and Priviledges of the two Houses, in an aiery imagination of Regality.</p>
               <p>But I believe the surfeit of too much Power, which some men have greedily seized on, and now seek wholly to devour, will ere long make the Common-wealth sick both of it and them, since they cannot well digest it; Soveraigne Power in Subjects seldome agreeing with the stomacks of fellow Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:58806:40"/>Yet I have even in this point of the constant <hi>Militia</hi> sought, by satisfying their feares, and importunities, both to secure My Friends, and overcome Mine Enemies, to gaine the peace of all, by depriving My selfe of a sole power to help, or hurt any: yeilding the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> (which is My undoubted Right no lesse than the Crowne) to be disposed of as the two Houses shall think fit, during My time.</p>
               <p>So willing am I to bury all Jealousies in them, of Me, and to live above all Jealousies of them, as to My self; I desire not to be safer than I wish them and My People; If I had the sole actuall disposing of the <hi>Militia,</hi> I could not protect My People, further than they protected Me, and themselves: so that the use of the <hi>Militia</hi> is mutuall. I would but defend My self so far, as to be able to defend My good Subjects from those mens violence and fraud, who conscious to their owne evill merits and designes, will needs perswade the world, that none but Wolves are fit to be trusted with the custody of the Shepherd and his Flock. Miserable experience hath taught My Subjects, since Power hath been wrested from Me, and imployed against Me &amp; Them! that neither can be safe if both be not in such a way as the Law hath entrusted the publique safety and welfare.</p>
               <p>Yet even this Concession of Mine as to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58806:41"/>
exercise of the <hi>Militia,</hi> so vast and large, is not satisfactory to some men; which seem to be Enemies not to Me onely, but to all Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and are resolved to transmit to posterity such Jealousies of the Crowne, as they should never permit it to enjoy its just and necessary Rights, in point of Power; to which (at last) all Law is resolved, while thereby it is best protected.</p>
               <p>But here Honour and Justice due to My Successors, forbid Me to yeild to such a totall alienation of that power from them, which ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility &amp; duty (no lesse then justice and honour) should have forbad them to have asked of Me.</p>
               <p>For, although I can be content to Eclypse My owne beames, to satisfie their feares; who think they must needs be scorched or blinded, if I should shine in the full lustre of Kingly Power, wherewith God and the Lawes have invested Me: yet I will never consent to put out the Sun of Soveraignty to all Posterity, and succeeding Kings; whose just recovery of their Rights from unjust usurpations and extortions, shall never be prejudiced or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by any Act of Mine, which indeed would not be more injurious to succeeding Kings, than to My Subjects; whom I desire to leave in a condition not wholly desperate for the future; so as by a Law to be ever sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to those many factious distractions,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58806:41"/>
which must needs follow the many-headed <hi>Hydra</hi> of Government; which as it makes a shew to the People to have more eyes to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see; so they will find it hath more mouthes too, which much be satisfied: and (at best) it hath rather a monstrosity, than any thing of perfection, beyond that of right Monarchy; where counsell may be in many as the senses, but the Supreme Power can be but in One as the Head.</p>
               <p>Happily where men have tried the horrours and malignant influence which will certainly follow My enforced darknesse and Eclypse, (occasioned by the interposition and shadow of that body, which as the Moone receiveth its chiefest light from Me) they will at length more esteeme and welcome the restored glory and blessing of the Suns light.</p>
               <p>And if at present I may seem by My rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so much from the use of My Right in the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> to come short of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that trust to which I am sworne for My Peoples protection; I conceive those men are guilty of the enforced perjury, (if so it may seeme) who compell Me to take this new and strange way of discharging My trust, by seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to desert it; of protecting My Subjects by exposing My self to danger or dishonour, for their safety and quiet.</p>
               <p>Which in the conflicts of Civill Warre and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58806:42"/>
advantages of Power cannot be effected but by some side yeilding; to which the greatest love of the publique Peace, and the firmest assurance of Gods protection (arising from a good conscience) doth more invite Me, than can be expected from other mens fears; which arising from the injustice of their actions (though never so successfull) yet dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture their Authours upon any other way of safety then that of the Sword and <hi>Militia</hi>; which yet are but weak defences against the stroaks of divine vengeance, which will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; or of mens owne Consciences, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies attend injurious perpetrations.</p>
               <p>For My self, I doe not think that I can want any thing which providentiall necessity is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to take from Me, in order to My Peoples tranquillity and Gods glory, whose protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is sufficient for me; and he is able by his being with Me, abundantly to compensate to Me, as he did to <hi>Iob,</hi> what ever honour, power, or liberty the Caldeans, the Sabeans, or the Devill himself can deprive Me of.</p>
               <p>Although they take from me all defence of Armes and <hi>Militia,</hi> all refuge by land, of Forts, and Castles, all flight by Sea in my Ships, and Navy; yea, though they study to rob me of the Hearts of my Subjects, the greatest Treasure and best ammunition of a King, yet cannot they deprive me of my own

               <p>This Honour they doe Mee, to put Mee

               <p>Some things (which they are pleased to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pround) seeme unreasonable to me, and while I have any Mastery of my Reason, how can they think I can consent to them?

               <p>Some things which a King might approve, yet in Honour and Policy are at some time to be denied, to some men, lest he should seeme not to dare to deny any thing; and give too much incouragement to unreasonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or importunities.</p>

               <p>This were as if <hi>Sampson</hi> should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, not only to binde his own hands, and cut off his haire, but to put out his own eyes, that the <hi>Philistins</hi> might with the more safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mock, and abuse him; which they chose rather to doe, then quite to destroy him, when he was become so tame an object, and fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for their sport and scorne.</p>
               <p>Certainly, to exclude all power of deniall, seemes an arrogancy, least of all becomming those who pretend to make their addresses in an humble and loyall way of petitioning; who by that sufficiently confesse their owne infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, which obligeth them to rest, if not satisfied, yet quieted with such an answer as the will and reason of their Superiour thinkes fit to give; who is acknowledged to have a freedome and power of Reason, to Consent, or Dissent, else it were very foolish and absurd to ask, what another having not liberty to deny, neither hath power to grant.</p>
               <p>But if this be My Right belonging to Me,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58806:45"/>
in Reason, as a Man, and in Honour as a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign King, (as undoubtedly it doth) how can it be other then extream injury to confine my Reason to a necessity of granting all they have a mind to ask, whose minds may be as differing from Mine both in Reason &amp; Honour, as their aims may be, and their qualities are; which last God &amp; the Laws have sufficiently distinguish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Since no man seekes to limit and confine his King, in Reason, who hath not a secret aime to share with him, or usurp upon him in Power and Dominion.</p>
               <p>But they would have me trust to their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp; abandon mine own discretion; that so I might verifie what representations some have made of me to the world, that I am fitter to be their Pupill then their Prince. Truly I am not so confident of my own sufficiency, as not willingly to admit the Counsell of others: But yet I am not so diffident of my selfe, as bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Least of all have I any ground of credulity, to induce me fully to submit to all the desires
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58806:45"/>
of those men, who will not admit or doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, and neglect to vindicate the freedome of their own and others, sitting and voting in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Besides, all men that know them, know this, how young States-men (the most part) of these propounders are; so that, till experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one seven years hath shewed me, how well they can Governe themselves, and so much power as is wrested from me, I should be very foolish indeed, and unfaithfull, in my Trust, to put the reins of both Reason and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, wholly out of my own, into their hands, whose driving is already too much like <hi>Iehues</hi>; and whose forwardnesse to ascend the throne of Supremacy pretends more of <hi>Phaeton</hi> then of <hi>Phebus</hi>; God divert the Omen if it be his will.</p>
               <p>They may remember, that at best they sit in Parliament, as my Subjects, not my Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; called to be my Counsellours, not Dictatours: Their Summons extends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend their advice, not to command my Duty.</p>
               <p>When I first heard of Propositions to be sent Me, I expected either some good Lawes, which had been antiquated by the course of time, or overlayd by the corruption of manners, had been desired to a restauration of their vigour and due execution; or some evill customes

preterlegall, and abuses personall had been to be removed: or some injuries done by My selfe, and others, to the Common-weale, were to be repaired: or some equable offertures were to be tendred to Me, wherein the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of My Crowne being considered by them, might fairly induce Me to condiscend, to what tended to My Subjects good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great diminution of My selfe, whom nature, Law, Reason, and Religion, bind Me (in the first place) to preserve: without which, 'tis impossible to preserve My People accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to My Place.</p>
               <p>Or (at least) I looked for such moderate desires of due Reformation of what was (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) amisse in Church and State, as might still preserve the foundation and essentialls of Government in both; not shake and quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow either of them, without any regard to the Lawes in force, the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but with pregnant and solid reasons both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane, which might justifie the abruptnesse and necessity of such vast altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But in all their Propositions I can observe little of these kinds, or to these ends: Nothing of any Laws dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But as to the maine matters propounded by them at any time, in which is either great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, or difficulty. I perceive that what were formerly look'd upon as Factions in the State, and Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This, as to the maine; other Proposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nor doe I so much wonder at the variety,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58806:47"/>
and horrible novelty of some Propositions, (there being nothing so monstrous, which some fancies are not prone to long for.)</p>
               <p>This casts me into, not an admiration, but an extasie, how such things should have the fortune to be propounded in the name of the two Houses of the Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> among whom, I am very confident, there was not a fourth part of the Members of either House, whose judgments free, single, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part did approve or desire such destructive changes in the Government of the Church.</p>
               <p>I am perswaded there remaines in farre the Major part of both Houses, (if free, and full) so much Learning, Reason, Religion, and just moderation, as to know how to sever between the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sure they could not all, upon so little, or no Reason (as yet produced to the contrary) so soon renounce all regard to the Laws in force, to antiquity, to the piety of their reforming Progenitors, to the prosperity of former times in this Church and State, under the present Government of the Church.</p>
               <p>Yet, by a strange fatality, these men suffer, either by their absence, or silence, or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58806:47"/>
or supine credulity (believing that all is good, which is guilded with shewes of Zeale and Reformation) their private dissenting in Judgement to be drawne into the common sewer or streame of the present vogue and humour; which hath its chief rise and abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from those popular clamours and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults: which served to give life and strength to the infinite activity of those men, who stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died with all diligence, and policy, to improve to their Innovating designes, the present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions.</p>
               <p>Such Armies of Propositions having so little, in My Judgment, of Reason, Justice, and Religion on their side, as they had Tumult and Faction for their rise, must not go alone, but ever be backt and seconded, with Armies of Soldiers: Though the second should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile against My Person, yet the first shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver overcome Me, further than I see cause; for, I look not at their number and power so much, as I weigh their Reason and Justice.</p>
               <p>Had the two Houses first sued out their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and once effectually redeemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Wardship of the Tumults, (which can be no other than the Hounds that attend the cry, and hollow of those Men, who hunt after Factious, and private Designes, to the ruine of Church and State.)</p>
               <p>Did My judgment tell Me, that the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58806:48"/>
sent to Me were the Results of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of their Votes, who exercise their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as well as they have a right to sit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: I should then suspect My own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for not speedily and fully concurring with every one of them.</p>
               <p>For, I have charity enough to think, there are wise men among them: and humility to think, that, as in some things I may want; so 'tis fit I should use their advise, which is the end for which I called them to a Parliament. But yet I cannot allow their wisdome such a compleatnesse and inerrability as to exclude My self; since none of them hath that part to Act, that Trust to discharge, nor that Estate and Honour to preserve as My selfe; without whose Reason concurrent with theirs (as the Suns influence is necessary in all natures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions) they cannot beget, or bring forth any one compleat and authoritative Act of publique wisdome, which makes the Lawes.</p>
               <p>But the nnreasonablenesse of some Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is not more evident to Me than this is, That they are not the joynt and free desires of those in their Major number, who are of right to Sit and Vote in Parliament.</p>
               <p>For, many of them savour very strong of that old leaven of Innovations, masked under the name of Reformation; (which in My two last famous Predecessours daies, heaved at,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58806:48"/>
and sometime threatned both Prince and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments:) But, I am sure was never wont so far to infect the whole masse of the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdome; however it dispersed among the Vulgar: Nor was it likely so suddenly to taynt the Major part of both Houses, as that they should unanimously desire, and affect so enormous and dangerous innovations in Church and State, contrary to their former education, practise, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Not that I am ignorant, how the choice of many Members was carried by much faction in the Countries; some thirsting after nothing more, than a passionate revenge of what ever displeasure they had conceived against me, my Court, or the Clergy.</p>
               <p>But all Reason bids me impute these sudden and vast desires of change to those few, who armed themselves with the many-headed, and many-handed Tumults.</p>
               <p>No lesse doth Reason, Honour, and Safety both of Church and State command me, to chew such morsels, before I let them downe; If the straitnesse of my Conscience will not give me leave to swallow down such Camels, as others doe of Sacriledge, and injustice both to God and man, they have no more cause to quarrell with me, than for this, that my throat is not so wide as theirs. Yet by Gods help I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58806:49"/>
am resolved, That nothing of passion, or pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishnesse, or list to contradict, or vanity to shew my negative power, shall have any byas upon my judgment, to make me gratifie my will, by denying any thing, which my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Conscience commands me not.</p>
               <p>Nor on the other side, will I consent to more than Reason, Justice, Honour, and Religion perswade me, to be for Gods glory, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches good, my Peoples welfare, and my owne peace.</p>
               <p>I will study to satisfie my Parliament, and my People; but I will never, for feare, or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, gratifie any Faction, how potent soever; for this were to nourish the disease, &amp; oppresse the body.</p>
               <p>Although many mens loyalty and prudence are terrified from giving me, that free, and faithfull counsell, which they are able and willing to impart, and I may want; yet none can hinder me from craving of the counsell of that mighty Counsellour, who can both sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest what is best, and incline my heart sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly to follow it.</p>

               <p>It fell out, as a most unhappy advantage to some mens malice against me; that when they

               <p>Some men took it very ill not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when they affirmed, that what the Irish Rebels did, was done with my privity (at least) if not by my Commission: But these knew too well, that it is no news for some of my Subjects to fight, not onely without my Commission, but against my Command, and Person too; yet all the while to pretend, they fight by my Authority, and for my Safety.</p>
               <p>I would to God the <hi>Irish</hi> had nothing to alledge for their imitation against those, whose blame must needs be the greater, by how much Protestant Principles are more against all Rebellion against Princes, then those of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.

                  </gap>ions, and jealousies here in <hi>England,</hi> made most men rather intent to their own safety, or designes they were driving, then to the relief of those, who were every day inhumanely butchered in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Whose teares and bloud might, if nothing else, have quenched, or at least for a time, repressed and smothered those sparks of Civill dissentions, and Jealousies, which in <hi>England</hi> some men most industriously scattered.</p>
               <p>I would to God no man had been lesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with <hi>Irelands</hi> sad estate then my self; I offered to goe my self in Person upon that

expedition; But some men were either afraid I should have any one Kingdome quieted; or loath they were to shoot at any mark here lesse then my self; or that any should have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my destruction but themselves. Had my many offers been accepted, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident neither the ruine had been so great, nor the calamity so long, nor the remedy so desperate.</p>
               <p>So that, next to the sin of those, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that Rebellion, theirs musts needs be: who either hindred the speedy suppressing of it by Domestick dissentions, or diverted the Aides, or exasperated the Rebells to the most desperate resolutions and actions, by threatning all extremities, not only to the known heads, and chief incendiaries, but even to the whole community of that Nation; Resolving to destroy Root and Branch, men, women and children; without any regard to those usuall pleas for mercy, which Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, not wholly barbarous, are wont to hear from their own breasts, in behalf of those, whose oppressive faces, rather then their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, engaged them; or whose imbecility for Sex and Age was such, as they could neither lift up a hand against them, nor distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their right hand and their left: Which preposterous, and (I think) un-evangelicall Zeal is too like that of the rebuked Disciples,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58806:53"/>
who would goe no lower in their revenge, then to call for fire from Heaven upon whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for the repulse or neglect of a few; or like that of <hi>Iacobs</hi> sons, which the Father both bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and cursed: chusing rather to use all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremites, which might drive men to desperate obstinacy, then to apply moderate remedies; such as might punish some with exemplary Justice, yet disarme others, with tenders of mercy upon their submission, and our protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, from the fury of those, who would soon drown them, if they refused to swim down the popular stream with them.</p>
               <p>But some kind of Zeale counts all mercifull moderation, luke-warmnesse; and had rather be cruell then counted cold, and is not seldome more greedy to kill the Bear for his skin, then for any harme he hath done. The confiscation of mens estates being more beneficiall, then the charity of saving their lives, or reforming their Errours.</p>
               <p>When all proportionable succours of the poor Protestants in <hi>Ireland</hi> (who were daily massacred, and overborne with numbers of now desperate Enemies) was diverted and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed here; I was earnestly entreated, and generally advised by the chief of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant party there, to get them some respite and breathing by a cessation, without which they saw no probability (unlesse by miracle) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58806:53"/>
the remnant that had yet escaped: God knowes with how much commiseration and solicitous caution I carried on that businesse, by persons of Honour and Integrity, that so I might neither incourage the Rebells Insolence, nor discourage the Protestants Loyalty and Patience.</p>
               <p>Yet when this was effected in the best sort, that the necessity and difficulty of affaires would then permit, I was then to suffer again in my reputation and Honour, because I suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the Rebels utterly to devour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining handfuls of the Protestants there.</p>
               <p>I thought, that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But in all the misconstructions of my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (which are prone to find more credulity in men to what is false, and evill, than love or charity to what is true and good) as I have no Judge but God above me, so I can have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to appeale to his omniscience, who doth

               </p>
               <p>I have enough to doe to look to my owne Conscience, and the faithfull discharge of my Trust as a KING; I have scarce leisure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider those swarmes of reproaches, which issue out of some mens mouthes and hearts, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily as smoke, or sparks doe out of a fornace; Much lesse to make such prolix Apologies, as might give those men satisfaction: who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to their owne depth of wickednesse, are loath to believe any man not to be as bad as themselves.</p>
               <p>'Tis Kingly to doe well, and heare ill: If I can but act the one, I shall not much regard to beare the other.</p>
               <p>I thank God I can heare with patience, as bad as my worst enemies can falsly say. And I hope I shall still doe better than they desire, or deserve I should.</p>
               <p>I believe it will at last appear, that they who first began to embroyle my other Kingdomes, are in great part guilty, if not of the first let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, yet of the not-timely stopping those horrid effusions of bloud in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>Which (whatever my Enemies please to say, or thinke) I looke upon, as that of my other Kingdomes, exhausted out of my owne veins; no man being so much weakned by it, as my

                  <hi>13.</hi> Vpon the Calling in of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and their Comming.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Scots</hi> are a Nation, upon whom I have not onely common ties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Soveraignty, and Bounty, with My Father of blessed memory; but also spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and late obligations of favours, having gratified the active Spirits among them so farre, that I seemed to many, to prefer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of that Party, before My owne interest and Honour. But, I see, Royall bounty em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens some men to aske, and act beyond all bounds of modesty and gratitude.</p>
               <p>My charity, and Act of Pacification, forbids Me to reflect on former passages; wherein I shall ever be farre from letting any mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, or inconstancy, make Me repent of what I granted them, for the publique good: I pray God it may so prove.</p>
               <p>The comming againe of that Party into <hi>England,</hi> with an Army, onely to conforme this Church to their late New modell, cannot but seeme as unreasonable, as they would have thought the same measure offered from hence to themselves.</p>
               <p>Other errand I could never understand, they had, (besides those common and vulgar
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58806:56"/>
flourishes for Religion and Liberty) save only to confirme the Presbyterian Copy they had set, by making this Church to write after them, though it were in bloudy Characters.</p>
               <p>Which designe and end, whether it will justifie the use of such violent meanes, before the divine Justice: I leave to their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to judge, who have already felt the misery of the meanes, but not reaped the benefit of the end, either in this Kingdome, or that.</p>
               <p>Such knots and crosnesse of grain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objected here, as will hardly suffer that forme which they cry up, as the only just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and setling of Government and Discipline in Churches, to go on so smoothly here, as it might doe in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and was by them imagined would have done in <hi>England,</hi> when so many of the <hi>English</hi> Clergy, through levity, or discontent, if no worse passion, suddenly quitted their former engagements to Episcopacy, and faced about to their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</p>
               <p>It cannot but seeme either passion, or some self-seeking, more then true Zeal, and pious Discretion, for any forraigne State or Church to prescribe such medicines only for others, which themselves have used, rather successefully then commendably; not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the same Physick on different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, will have different operations; That
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58806:57"/>
may kill one, which doth but cure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Nor do I know any such tough and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humours in the constitution of the <hi>English</hi> Church, which gentler applications then those of an Army, might not easily have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: Nor is it so proper to hew out religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reformations by the Sword, as to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them by faire and equall disputations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those that are most concerned in the differences, whom not force, but Reason ought to convince.</p>
               <p>But their design now, seemed rather to cut off all disputation here, then to procure a fair and equall one: For, it was concluded there, that the <hi>Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sh</hi> Clergy must conforme to the <hi>Scots</hi> patterne before ever they could be heard, what they could say for themselves, or against the others way.</p>
               <p>I could have wished fairer proceedings both for their credits, who urge things with such violence; and for other mens Consciences too, who can receive little satisfaction in these points which are maintained rather by Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers fighting in the Field, than Schollars dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting in free and learned Synods.</p>
               <p>Sure in matters of Religion those truths gain most on mens Judgements and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which are least urged with secular vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which weakens Truth with prejudices;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58806:57"/>
and is unreasonable to be used, till such meanes of rationall conviction hath been applied, as leaving no excuse for ignorance, condemnes mens obstinacy to deserved pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties.</p>
               <p>Which no charity will easily suspect of so many learned and pious Church-men in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; who being alwayes bred up, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Government of Episcopacy, cannot so soon renounce both their former opinion and practise, only because that Party of the <hi>Scots</hi> will needs, by force assist a like Party here, either to drive all Ministers, as sheep into the common fold of Presbytery, or destroy them; at least fleece them, by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them of the benefit of their Flocks. If the <hi>Scotch</hi> sole Presbytery were proved to be the only institution of Jesus Christ, for all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Government; yet I believe it would be hard to prove that Christ had given those <hi>Scots,</hi> or any other of my Subjects, Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by the Sword to set it up in any of my Kingdomes, without my Consent.</p>
               <p>What respect and obedience Christ and his Apostles pay'd to the cheif Governours of States, where they lived is very clear in the Gospell; but that he, or they ever comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to set up such a parity of Presbyters, and in such a way as those <hi>Scots</hi> endeavour; I think is not very disputable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:58806:58"/>If Presbytery in such a supremacy be an institution of Christ; sure it differs from all others; and is the first and only po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet was there never any thing upon the point, which those <hi>Scots</hi> had by Army or Commissioners to move me with, by their many Solemne obtestations, and pious threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but only this; to represent to me the wonderfull necessity of setting up their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe <hi>Presbyterian Scots</hi> are not to be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the ordinary rate of Auxiliaries; nothing will induce them to engage, till those that call them in, have pawned their Soules to them, by a Solemne League and Covenant:</p>
               <p>Where many engines of religious and faire pretensions are brought chiefly to batter, or rase Episcopacy; This they make the grand evill Spirit, which, with some other Imps pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely added, to make it more odious, and terrible to the Vulgar, must by so solemne a charm &amp; exorcism be cast out of this Church, after more than a thousand yeares possession here, from the first plantation of Christianity in this Island, and an universall prescription of time and practise in all other Churches since the Apostles times till this last Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</p>
               <p>But no Antiquity must plead for it, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, like a young Heyre, thinks the Father hath lived long enough, and impatient not to be in the Bishops Chaire &amp; Authority (though Lay-men go away with the Revenues) all art is used to sink Episcopacy, and lanch Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in <hi>England</hi>; which was lately boyed up in <hi>Scotland</hi> by the like artifice of a Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:58806:61"/>Although I am unsatisfied with many pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in that Covenant (some referring to My selfe with very dubious and dangerous limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) yet I chiefly wonder at the designe and drift touching the Discipline and Government of the Church; and such a manner of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on to new waies, by Oaths &amp; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, where it is hard for men to be engaged by no lesse, then swearing for, or against those things, which are of no cleare morall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but very disputable, and controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong learned and godly men: whereto the application of Oaths can hardly be made and enjoyned with that judgment, and certainty in ones selfe, or that charity and candour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of different opinion, as I think Religion requires, which never refuses faire and equable deliberations; yea, and dissentings too, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters onely probable.</p>
               <p>The enjoyning of Oaths upon People must needs in things doubtfull be dangerous, as in things unlawfull, damnable<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and no lesse su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, where former religious and legall Engagements, bound men sufficiently, to all necessary duties. Nor can I see how they will reconcile such an Innovating Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, with that former Protestation which was so lately taken, to maintaine the Religion established in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> since they count Discipline so great a part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:58806:62"/>But ambitious minds never think they have laid snares and ginnes enough to catch and hold the Vulgar credulity: for by such poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and seemingly pious stratagems, they think to keep the popularity fast to their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under the terrour of perjury: Whereas cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all honest and wise men ever thought themselves sufficiently bound by former ties of Religion, Allegiance, and Lawes, to God and man.</p>
               <p>Nor can such after-Contracts, devised and imposed by a few men in a declared Party, without My consent, and without any like power or president from Gods or mans laws, be ever thought by judicious men sufficient ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to absolve or slacken those morall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall bonds of duty which lie upon all My Subjects consciences both to God and Me.</p>
               <p>Yet as things now stand, good men shall least offend God or Me, by keeping their Covenant in honest and lawfull waies; since I have the charity to think, that the chief end of the Covenant in such mens intentions, was, to preserve Religion in purity, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in peace: To other then such ends and meanes they cannot think themselves enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; nor will those, that have any true touches of Conscience endeavour to carry on the best designes, (much lesse such as are, and will be daily more apparently factious and ambitious)
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58806:62"/>
by any unlawfull meanes, under that title of the Covenant: unlesse they dare preferre am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, dangerous and un-authorized novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, before their knowne and sworne duties, which are indispensable, both to God and My selfe.</p>
               <p>I am prone to believe and hope, That many who took the Covenant, are yet firme to this judgment, That such later Vowes, Oaths, or Leagues, can never blot out those former gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and characters, which by just and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Oaths were made upon their Soules.</p>
               <p>That which makes such Confederations by way of solemn Leagues &amp; Covenants more to be suspected, is, That they are the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon road, used in all factious &amp; powerfull perturbations of State or Church: When formalities of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary zeal and piety are never more stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and elaborate, then, when Politicians most agitate desperate designes against all that is setled, or sacred in Religion, and Laws, which by such s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and twists them: for every man soone growes his owne Pope, and easily absolves himselfe of those ties, which, not the commands of Gods word, or the Lawes of the Land, but onely the subtilty and terrour of a Party casts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; either superfluous and vaine, when they were sufficiently tied before; or fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and injurious, if by such after-ligaments they find the Imposers really ayming to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, or suspend their former, just, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary obligations.</p>
               <p>Indeed, such illegall waies seldome, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, intend the engaging men more to duties, but onely to Parties; therefore it is not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how they keep their Covenants in point of piety pretended, provided they adhere firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Party and Designe intended.</p>
               <p>I see the Imposers of it are content to make their Covenant like Manna (not that it came from Heaven, as this did) agreeable to every mans palate and relish, who will but swallow it: They admit any mens senses of it, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse or contrary; with any salvoes, cautions, and reservations, so as they crosse not though chiefe Designe which is laid against the Church, and Me.</p>
               <p>It is enough if they get but the reputation of a seeming encrease to their Party; So little doe men remember that God is not mocked.</p>
               <p>In such latitudes of sense, I believe many
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58806:63"/>
that love Me, and the Church well, may have taken the Covenant, who yet are not so fondly and superstitiously taken by it, as now to act clearly against both all piety and loyalty: who first yeilded to it, more to prevent that immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent violence and ruine, which hung over their heads in case they wholly refused it, than for any value of it, or devotion to it.</p>
               <p>Wherein, the latitude of some generall Clauses may (perhaps) serve somewhat to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, as of <hi>Doing and endeavouring what lawfully they may,</hi> in <hi>their Places and Callings,</hi> and <hi>according to the Word of God:</hi> for, these (indeed) carry no man beyond those bounds of good Conscience, which are certaine and fixed, either in Gods Lawes, as to the generall; or the Lawes of the State and Kingdome, as to the particular regulation and exercise of mens duties.</p>
               <p>I would to God such as glory most in the name of <hi>Covenanters,</hi> would keep themselves within those lawfull bounds, to which God hath called them: Surely it were the best way to expiate the rashnesse of taking it: which must needs then appeare, when besides the want of a full and lawfull Authority at first to enjoyne it, it shall actually be carried on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond and against those ends which were in it specified and pretended.

it within such bounds of Piety, Law, and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, as can never hurt either the Church, My self, or the Publique Peace: Against which, no mans lawfull Calling can engage him.</p>
               <p>As for that Reformation of the Church, which the Covenant pretends, I cannot think it just or comely, that by the partiall advise of a few Divines, (of so soft and servile tempers, as disposed them to so sudden acting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, contrary to their former judgments, profession, and practise) such foule scandals and suspitions should be cast upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as was never done (that I have heard) by any that deserved the name of <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> abroad, nor by any men of learning and candour at home: all whose judgments I cannot but prefer before any mens now fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiously engaged.</p>
               <p>No man can be more forward than My self to carry on all due Reformations, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture judgement, and a good Conscience, in what things I shall (after impartiall advise) be, by Gods Word, and right reason, convinced to be amisse, I have offered more than ever the fullest, freest, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the sequele of some mens actions makes it evident, that the maine Reformation inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is the abasing of Episcopacy into Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58806:64"/>
and the robbing the Church of its Lands and Revenues: For, no men have been more injuriously used, as to their legall Rights than the Bishops, and Church-men. These, as the fattest Deare, must be destroyed; the other Rascal-herd of Schismes, Heresies, &amp;c. being leane, may enjoy the benefit of a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Thus <hi>Naboth's</hi> Vineyard made him the onely Blasphemer of his City, and fit to die. Still I see, while the breath of Religion fills the Sailes, Profit is the Compasse, by which Factious men steer their course in all seditious Commotions.</p>
               <p>I thank God, as no men lay more open to the sacrilegious temptation of usurping the Churches Lands, and Revenues, (which issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly from the Crowne, are held of it, and legally can revert onely to the Crowne with My Consent) so I have alwaies had such a perfect abhorrence of it in My Soule, that I never found the least inclination to such sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Reformings: yet no man hath a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desire to have Bishops and all Church-men so reform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

might at once blow up their affections, and batter downe their loyaltie.</p>

               <p>Did I not more consider My Subjects Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, then My own Vindication; I should never have given the malice of some men that pleasure, as to see Me take notice of, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what they say, or object.</p>

               <p>Not but that I had (I thank god) many with Me, which were both Learned and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, (much above that ordinary size, and that vulgar proportion, wherein some men glory so much) who were so well satisfied in the cause of My sufferings, that they chose rather to suffer with Me, then forsake Me.</p>
               <p>Nor is it strange that so religious Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as were used against Me, should be to many well-minded men a great temptation to oppose Me; Especially, being urged by such popular Preachers, as think it no sin to lie for God, and what they please to call Gods Cause, cursing all that will not curse with them; looking so much at, and crying up the goodnesse of the end propounded, that they consider not the lawfulnesse of the means used,

               <p>The weakness of these mens judgments must be made up by their clamours and activity.</p>
               <p>It was a great part of some mens Religion to scandalize Me and Mine, they thought theirs could not be true, if they cried not downe Mine as false.</p>
               <p>I thank God, I have had more triall of his grace, as to the constancy of My Religion in the Protestant profession of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both abroad, and at home, than ever they are like to have.</p>
               <p>Nor doe I know any exception, I am so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to, in their opinion, as too great a fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in that Religion, whose judicious and solid grounds, both from Scripture, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, will not give My Conscience leave to approve or consent to those many dangerous and divided Innovations, which the bold Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of some men would needs obtrude upon Me, and My People.</p>
               <p>Contrary to those well tried foundations both of Truth, and Order, which men of far greater Learning, and clearer Zeal, have set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Confession and Constitution of this Church in <hi>England,</hi> which many former Parliaments in the most calme, and unpassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate times, have oft confirmed; In which I shall ever, by Gods help, persevere, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving

               <p>'Tis strange that so wise men, as they would be esteemed, should not conceive, That dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of perswasion in matters of Religion may easily fall out, where there is the samenesse of duty, Allegiance, and subjection.

               <p>It was, indeed, a foule and indelible shame, for such as would be counted Protestants, to enforce Me, a declared Protestant, their Lord and King, to a necessary use of Papists, or any other, who did but their duty to help Me to defend My self.</p>

               <p>IT is no news to have all Innovations ushe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in with the name of Reformations in Church and State, by those, who seeking to gaine reputation with the Vulgar for their extraordinary parts, and piety, must needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe whatever was formerly setled never so well and wisely.</p>
               <p>So hardly can the pride of those that study Novelties, allow former times any share or degree of wisdome or godlinesse.</p>
               <p>And because matter of prayer and devotion to God justly beares a great part in Religion, (being the Soules more immediate converse with the divine Majesty) nothing could be more plausible to the People than to tel them, They served God amisse in that point.</p>
               <p>Hence our publique Liturgy, or Formes of constant Prayers must be (not amended, in what upon free and publique advice might seem to sober men inconvenient for matter or manner, to which I should easily consent, but) wholly cashiered, and abolished, and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny popular contempts offered to the Booke, and those that used it according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and the Lawes in force, it must be

               <p>As for the matter contained in the Booke, sober and learned men have sufficiently vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated it against the cavils and exceptions of those, who thought it a part of piety to make what pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the manner of using Set and prescribed Formes, there is no doubt but that wholsome words being knowne and fitted to mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, are soonest received into their hearts, and aptest to excite and carry along with them judicious and fervent affections.</p>
               <p>Nor doe I see any reason why Christians should be weary of a wel-composed Liturgy (as I hold this to be) more than of all other things, wherein the Constancy abates nothing of the excellency and usefulnesse.</p>

               <p>Sure we may as wel before-hand know what we pray, as to whom we pray; and in what words, as to what sense; when we desire the same things, what hinders we may not use the same words? our appetite and disgestion too may be good when we use, as we pray for, <hi>our daily bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some men, I heare, are so impatient not to use in all their devotions their owne inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gifts, that they not onely disuse (as too many) but wholly cast away and contemn the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi>; whose great guilt is, that it is the warrant and originall patterne of all set Liturgies, in the Christian Church.</p>
               <p>I ever thought that the proud ostentation of mens abilities for invention, and the vaine affectations of variety for expressions, in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique prayer, or any sacred administrations, merits a greater brand of sin, than that which they call Coldnesse and Barrennesse: Nor are men in those novelties lesse subject to formall and superficiall tempers (as to their hearts)
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58806:76"/>
than in the use of constant Formes, where not the words, but mens hearts are too blame.</p>
               <p>I make no doubt but a man may be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall in the most extemporary variety; and very fervently devout in the most wonted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions: Nor is God more a God of varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than of constancy: Nor are constant Formes of Prayers more likely to flat, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Spirit of prayer, and devotion, than un-premeditated and confused variety to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract, and lose it.</p>
               <p>Though I am not against a grave, modest, discreet, and humble use of Ministers gifts, even in publique, the better to fit, and excite their owne, and the Peoples affections to the present occasions; yet I know no necessity why private and single abilities should quite justle ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and deprive the Church of the joynt abilities and concurrent gifts of many learned and godly men; such as the Composers of the Service-Booke were; who may in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be thought to have more of gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces enabling them to compose with serious deliberation &amp; concurrent advise, such Forms of prayers, as may best fit the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wants, informe the Hearers understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and stirre up that fiduciary and fervent application of their spirits (wherein consists the very life and soule of prayer, and that so much pretended Spirit of prayer) than any
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58806:77"/>
private man by his solitary abilities can be presumed to have; which, what they are many times (even there, where they make a great noise and shew) the affectations, emptinesse, impertinency, rudenesse, confusions, flatnesse, levity, obscurity, vain, and ridiculous repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the senslesse, and oft-times blasphemous expressions; all these burthened with a most tedious and intolerable length, do sufficiently convince all men, but those who glory in that Pharisaick way.</p>
               <p>Wherein men must be strangely impudent, &amp; flatterers of themselves, not to have an infinite shame of what they so do and say, in things of so sacred a nature, before God and the Church, after so ridiculous, and indeed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane a manner.</p>
               <p>Nor can it expected, but that in duties of frequent performance, as Sacramentall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, and the like, which are still the same; Ministers must either come to use their own Formes constantly, which are not like to be so sound, or comprehensive of the nature of the duty, as Formes of Publick composure; or else they must every time affect new expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions when the subject is the same; which can hardly be presumed in any mans greatest suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies not to want (many times) much of that compleatnesse, order, and gravity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming those duties; which by this means
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58806:77"/>
are exposed at every celebration to every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters private infirmities, indispositions, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, disorders, and defects, both for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expression.</p>
               <p>A serious sense of which inconvenience in the Church unavoidably following every mans severall manner of officiating, no doubt, first occasioned the wisdome and piety of the Ancient Churches, to remedy those mischiefs, by the use of constant Liturgies of Publick composure.</p>
               <p>The want of which I believe this Church will sufficiently feel, when the unhappy fruits of many mens un-governed ignorance, and confident defects, shall be discovered in more errours, schimes, disorders, and uncharitable distractions in Religion, which are already but too many, the more is the pity.</p>
               <p>However, if violence must needs bring in, and abett those innovations, (that men may not seeme to have nothing to do) which Law, Reason, and Religion forbids, at least to be so obtruded, as wholly to justle out the publick Liturgie.</p>
               <p>Yet nothing can excuse that most unjust and partiall severity of those men, who either lately had subscribed to, used and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Service-book; or refused to use it, cried out of the rigour of Lawes and Bishops, which suffered them not to use the liberty of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58806:78"/>
their Consciences, in not using it.</p>
               <p>That these men (I say) should so suddenly change the Lyturgie into a Directory, as if the Spirit needed help for invention, though not for expressions; or as if matter prescribed did not as much stint and obstruct the Spirit, as if it were cloathed in, and confined to, fit words: (So slight and easie is that Legerdemain which will serve to delude the vulgar.)</p>
               <p>That further, they should use such severity as not to suffer without penalty, any to use the Common-prayer-Book publickly, although their Consciences bind them to it, as a duty of Piety to God, and Obedience to the Lawes.</p>
               <p>Thus I see, no men are prone to be greater Tyrants, and more rigorous exacters upon others to conform to their illegall novelties, then such, whose pride was formerly least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed to the obedience of lawfull Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and whose licentious humours most pretended Conscientious liberties, which free<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>emporary way comes not short of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but their modesty and learning far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the most of them.</p>
               <p>But this matter is of so popular a nature, as some men knew it would not bear learned and sober debates, lest being convinced by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58806:78"/>
of Reason, as well as Lawes, they should have been driven either to sin more against their knowledge, by taking away the Liturgie; or to displease some faction of the people by continuing the use of it.</p>
               <p>Though I beleeve they have offended more considerable men, not onely for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and estates, but for their weighty and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious piety, than those are, whose weaknesse or giddinesse they sought to gratifie by taking it away.</p>
               <p>One of the greatest faults some men found with the Common-Prayer-Book, I beleeve, was this, That it taught them to pray so oft for Me; to which Petitions they had not Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie enough to say <hi>Amen,</hi> nor yet Charity enough to forbeare Reproaches, and even Cursings of Me in their owne formes, instead of praying for Me.</p>
               <p>I wish their Repentance may be their onely punishment; that seeing the mischiefs which the disuse of publique Liturgies hath already produced, they may restore that credit, use, and reverence to them, which by the ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were given to Set Formes of sound and wholsome words.</p>

               <p>The moving Bishops out of the House of Peers (of which I have elswhere given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) was sufficient to take off any suspicion, that I encline to them for any use to be made of their Votes in State affaires: Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I never thought any Bishop worthy to sit in that House, who would not Vote accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Conscience.</p>
               <p>I must now in Charity be thought desirous to preserve that Government in its right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, as a matter of Religion; wherein both My judgment is fully satisfied, that it hath of all other the fullest Scripture grounds, and also the constant practise of all Christian Churches; till of late yeares, the tumultuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of People, or the factiousnesse and pride of Presbyters, or the covetousnesse of some States and Princes, gave occasion to some mens wits to invent new models, and propose

               <p>They must give Me leave, having none of their temptations to invite Me to alter the Government of Bishops, (that I may have a title to their Estates) not to believe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended grounds to any new waies: contrary to the full, and constant testimony of all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, sufficiently convincing unbiased men; that as the Primitive Churches were undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly governed by the Apostles and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Successours the first and best Bishops; so it cannot in reason or charity be supposed, that all Churches in the world should either be ignorant of the rule by them prescribed, or so soon deviate from their divine and holy pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne: That since the first Age, for 1500 years not one Example can be produced of any set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Church, wherein were many Ministers and Congregations, which had not some Bishop above them, under whose jurisdiction and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they were.</p>
               <p>Whose constant and universall practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with so large, and evident Scripture-directions, and examples, are set down in the Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for the setling of that Government, not in the persons onely of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> but in the succession;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58806:81"/>
(the want of Government being that, which the Church can no more dispense with, in point of wel-being, than the want of the word and Sacraments, in point of being.)</p>
               <p>I wonder how men came to looke with so envious an eye upon Bishops power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as to oversee both the Ecclesiasticall use of them, and Apostolicall constitution: which to Me seems no lesse evidently set forth as to the maine scope and designe of those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, for the setling of a peculiar Office, Power, and Authority in them as President-Bishops above others, in point of Ordination, Censures, and other acts of Ecclesiasticall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; then those shorter characters of the qualities and duties of Presbyter-Bishops, and Deacons, are described in some parts of the same Epistles; who in the latitude and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the name were then, and may now not improperly be call'd <hi>Bishops</hi>; as to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight and care of single Congregations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them by the Apostles, or those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Bishops, who (as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) succeeded them in that ordinary power, there assigned over larger divisions, in which were many Presbyters.</p>
               <p>The humility of those first Bishops avoiding the eminent title of Apostles, as a name in the Churches stile appropriated from its common notion <hi>(of a Messenger, or one sent)</hi> to that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58806:81"/>
speciall dignity which had extraordinary call, mission, gifts, and power immediately from Christ: they contented themselves with the ordinary titles of Bishops and Presbyters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till use, (the great arbitrator of words, and master of language) finding reason to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish by a peculiar name those persons, whose power and office were indeed distinct from, and above all other in the Church, as succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Apostles in the ordinary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant power of governing the Churches, the honour of (whose name they moderately, yet commendably declined) all Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (submitting to that speciall authority) appropriated also the name of <hi>Bishop,</hi> without any suspicion or reproach of arrogancy, to those, who were by Apostolicall propagation rightly descended &amp; invested into that highest and largest power of governing even the most pure and Primitive Churches: which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt had many such holy Bishops, after the pattern of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>; whose speciall power is not more clearly set down in those Epistles (the chief grounds and limits of all Episcopall claime, as from divine right) then are the characters of these perilous times, and those men that make them such; who not enduring sound doctrine, and cleare testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of all Churches practise, are most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Disputers, and proud Usurpers, against
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58806:82"/>
true Episcopacy: who, if they be not Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and Boasters, yet they seem to be very covetous, heady, high-minded; inordinate and fierce, lovers of themselves, having much of the forme, little of the power of godlinesse.</p>
               <p>Who, by popular heaps of weak, light, and unlearned Teachers, seek to over-lay and smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pregnancy &amp; authority of that power of Episcopall Government, which, beyond all equivocation and vulgar fallacy of names, is most convincingly set forth, both by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and all after Histories of the Church.</p>
               <p>This I write rather like a Divine, than a Prince, that Posterity may see (if ever these Papers be publique) that I had faire grounds both from Scripture-Canons, &amp; Ecclesiastical examples, whereon My judgement was stated for Episcopall Government.</p>
               <p>Nor was it any policy of State, or obstinacy of will, or partiality of affection, either to the men, or their Function which fixed Me: who cannot in point of worldly respects be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable to Me as to recompence the injuries and losses I, and My dearest relations with My Kingdomes have sustained, and hazarded, chiefly at first upon this quarrell.</p>
               <p>And not onely in Religion, of which, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the best rule, and the Churches Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall practise the best commentary, but also in right reason, and the true nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58806:82"/>
it cannot be thought that an orderly Subordination among Presbyters, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, should be any more against Christianity, then it is in all secular and civill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where parity breeds Confusion and Faction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I can no more beleeve, that such order is inconsistent with true Religion, then good fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are with beauty, or numbers with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Nor is it likely that God, who appointed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall orders, &amp; a Prelacie, in the Government of his Church, among the Jewish Priests, should abhor or forbid them among Christian Ministers; who have as much of the principles of schisme and division as other men; for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting and suppressing of which, the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall wisdome (which was divine) after that Christians were multiplied so many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and Presbyters with them, appointed this way of Government, which might best preserve order and union w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Not that I am against the managing of this

Presidency and Authority in one man, by the joynt Counsell and consent of many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: I have offered to restore that, as a fit meanes to avoid those Errours, Corruptions, and Partialities, which are incident to any one man; Also to avoid Tyranny, which becomes no Christians, least of all Church-men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ides, it will be a meanes to take away that burden, and <hi>odium</hi> of affaires, which may lie too heavy on one mans shoulders, as indeed I think it formerly did on the Bishops here.</p>
               <p>Nor can I see what can be more agreeable both to Reason and Religion, then such a frame of Government which is paternall, not Magisteriall; and wherein not only the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of avoiding Faction and Confusion, Emulations and Contempts, which are prone to arise among equals in power and function; but also the differences of some Ministers gifts, and aptitudes for Government above others, doth invite to imploy them, in reference to those Abilities, wherein they are Eminent.</p>
               <p>Nor is this judgement of Mine touching Episcopacy, any pre-occupation of opinion, which will not admit any oppositions against it: It is well known I have endeavoured to satisfie My self in what the chief Patrons for other wayes can say against this, or for theirs: And I find they have, as farre lesse of Scripture grounds, and of Reason; so for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58806:83"/>
and practice of the Church, or testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Histories, they are wholly destitute, wherein the whole stream runs so for Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, that there is not the least rivulet for any others.</p>
               <p>As for those obtruded examples of some late reformed Churches, (for many retain Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops still) whom necessity of times and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires rather excuseth, then commendeth for their inconformity to all Antiquity; I could never see any reason why Churches orderly reformed and governed by Bishops should be forced to conform to those few, rather then to the Catholick example of all Ancient Churches, which needed no Reformation: And to those Churches at this day, who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Bishops in all the Christian world, are many more then Presbyterians or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents can pretend to be; All whom the Churches in My three Kingdomes lately Governed by Bishops, would equalize (I think) if not exceed.</p>
               <p>Nor is it any point of wisdom or charity, where Christians differ, (as many do in some points) there to widen the differences, and at once to give all the Christian world (except a handfull of some Protestants) so great a scandall in point of Church-government; whom, though you may convince of their Errrours in some points of Doctrine, yet you
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58806:84"/>
shall never perswade them, that to compleat their Reformation, they must necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, and wholly cast off that Government, which they, and all before them have ever owned as Catholick, Primitive, and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall: So far, that never Schismaticks, nor Hereticks (except those Arians) have strayed from the Unity, and Conformity of the Church in that point; ever having Bishops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Besides, the late generall approbation and submission to this Government of Bishops, by the Clergy, as well as the Laity of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, is a great confirmation of My Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and their inconstancy is a great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice against their novelty; I cannot in charity so far doubt of their learning or integrity, as if they understood not what heretofore they did; or that they did conform contrary to their Consciences; So that their facility and levity is never to be excused, who, before ever the point of Church-government had any free &amp; impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall debate, contrary to their former Oathes and practice, against their obedience to the Lawes in force, and against My consent, have not only quite cryed down the Government by Bishops; but have approved and incouraged the violent and most illegall stripping all the Bishops, and many other Church-men, of all their due Authority and Revenues, even to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58806:84"/>
the selling away, and utter alienation of those Church-lands from any Ecclesiasticall uses: So great a power hath the stream of times, and the prevalency of parties over some mens judgements; of whose so sudden and so totall change, little reason can be given, besides the <hi>Scots</hi> Army comming into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the folly of these men will at last punish it self, and the Desertors of Episcopacy will appeare the greatest Enemies to, and Betrayers of their owne interest: for Presbytery is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so considerable or effectuall, as when it is joyned to, and crowned with Episcopacy. All Ministers wil find as great a difference in po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The tenuity and contempt of Clegy-men will soone let them see, what a poore carcasse they are, when parted from the influence of that Head, to whose Supremacy they have been sworne.</p>
               <p>A little moderation might have prevented great mischiefs; I am firme to Primitive E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy, not to have it extirpated, (if I can hinder it.) Discretion without passion might easily reforme, whatever the rust of times, or indulgence of Laws, or corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have brought upon it. It being a grosse
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58806:85"/>
vulgar errour to impute to, or revenge upon the Function, the faults of times, or persons; which seditious and popular principle, and practise, all wise men abhorre.</p>
               <p>For those secular additaments and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Authority, Civill Honour and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, which My Predecessours, and Christian Princes in all Countries have annexed to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Church-men; I look upon them, but as just rewards of their learning, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who are fit to be in any degree of Church-Government; also enablements to works of Charity, &amp; Hospitality, meet strengthenings of their Authority in point of respect, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance; which in peacefull times is hardly payed to any Governours by the measure of their vertues, so much, as by that of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states; Poverty and meannesse exposing them and their Authority to the contempt of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious minds, and manners, which persecuting Times much restrained.</p>
               <p>I would have such men Bishops, as are most worthy of those incouragements, and best able to use them: if at any time My judgment of men failed My good intention made My er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour veniall: And some Bishops, I am sure, I had, whose learning, gravity, and piety, no men of any worth or forehead can deny: But, of all men, I would have Church-men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Governours to be redeemed from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58806:85"/>
that vulgar neglect; which (besides an innate principle of vitious opposition, which is in all men against those that seem to reprove, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them) will necessarily follow both the Presbyterian parity, which makes all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters equall; and the Independent inferiority, which sets their Pastors below the People.</p>
               <p>This for My judgment touching Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wherein (God knows) I doe not gratifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny designe or passion with the least perverting of Truth.</p>
               <p>And now I appeale to God above, and all the Christian world, whether it be just for Subjects, or pious for Christians, by violence, and infinite indignities, with servile restraints to seek to force Me their KING and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, as some men have endeavoured to doe, against all these grounds of My Judgment, to consent to their weak and divided novelties.</p>
               <p>The greatest Pretender of them desires not more than I doe, That the Church should be governed, as Christ hath appointed, in true Reason, and in Scripture; of which, I could never see any probable shew for any other waies: who either content themselves with the examples of some Churches in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy &amp; solitude; when one Presbyter might serve one Congregation, in a City or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; or else they deny these most evident Truths, That the Apostles were Bishops over
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58806:86"/>
those Presbyters they ordained, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Churches they planted; and that, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being necessary for the Churches wel-being, when multiplied and sociated, must also necessarily descend from the Apostles to others, after the example of that power and superiority, they had above others; which could not end with their persons; since the use and ends of such Government still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
               <p>It is most sure, that the purest Primitive and best Churches flourished under Episcopacy; and may so still, if ignorance, superstition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, revenge, and other disorderly and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall passions had not so blowne up some mens minds against it, that what they want of Reasons or Primitive Patterns, they supply with violence and oppression; wherein some mens zeale for Bishops Lands, Houses, and Revenues hath set them on worke to eate up Episcopacy: which (however other men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem) to Me is no lesse sin, than Sacriledge; or a robbery of GOD (the giver of all we have) of that portion which devout mindes have thankfully given againe to him, in giving it to his Church and Prophets; through whose hands he graciously accepts even a cup of cold water, as a libation offered to himselfe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as to My particular engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above other men, by an Oath agreeable
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58806:86"/>
to My judgement, I am solemnly obliged to preserve that Government, and the Rights of the Church.</p>
               <p>Were I convinced of the unlawfullnesse of the Function, as Antichristian, (which some men boldly, but weakly calumniate) I could soone, with Judgment, break that Oath, which erroneously was taken by Me.</p>
               <p>But being daily by the best disquisition of truth, more confirmed in the Reason and Religion of that, to which I am Sworn; How can any man that wisheth not My damnation, perswade Me at once to so notorious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined sins, of Sacriledge and Perjury? besides the many personall Injustices I must doe to many worthy men, who are as legally invested in their Estates, as any, who seek to deprive them; and they have by no Law, been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of those crimes, which might forfeit their Estates and Lively-hoods.</p>
               <p>I have oft wondred how men pretending to tendernesse of Conscience, and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can at once tell Me, that My Coronation Oath binds Me to Consent to whatsoever they shall propound to Me, (which they urge with such violence) though contrary to all that Rationall and Religious freedome which every man ought to preserve; &amp; of which they seem so tender in their own Votes; yet at the same time these men will needs perswade Me,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58806:87"/>
That I must, and ought to dispence with, and roundly break that part of My Oath, which binds Me agreeable to the best light of Reason and Religion I have) to maintain the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and legall Rights of the Church. 'Tis strange My lot should be valid in that part, which both My self, and all men in their own case, esteem injurious &amp; unreasonable, as being against the very naturall and essentiall liberty of our soules; yet it should be invalid, and to be broken in another clause, wherein I think My selfe justly obliged, both to God and Man.</p>
               <p>Yet upon this Rack chiefly have I been held so long, by some mens ambitious Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and sacrilegious Cruelty; torturing (with Me) both Church and State, in Civill distentions; till I shall be forced to consent, and declare that I doe approve, what (God knowes) I utterly dislike, and in My Soul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor; as many wayes highly against Reason, Justice, and Religion: and whereto, if I should shamefully, and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58806:87"/>
against Me, as an inducement for Me, to consent to the like in My other Kingdoms, For it should be considered that Episcopacy was not so rooted and setled there, as 'tis here; nor I (in that respect) so strictly bound to continue it in that Kingdom as in this; for what I think in My judgment best, I may not think so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary for all places, &amp; at all times.</p>
               <p>If any shall impute My yeilding to them, as My failing and sin, I can easily acknowledge it; but that is no argument to do so again, or much worse; I being now more convinced in that point: nor indeed hath My yeilding to them been so happy and successefull as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Me to grant the like to others.</p>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58806:88"/>
beyond what they have done in My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes (by Gods blessing) which might make Me believe either Presbytery or Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy have a more benigne influence upon the Church and mens hearts and lives, than Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy in its right constitution.</p>
               <p>The abuses of which, deserve to be extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as much as the use retained; for I think it farre better to hold to primitive and uniforme Antiquity, than to comply with divided no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.</p>
               <p>A right Episcopacy would at once satisfie all just desires and interests of good Bishops, humble Presbyters, and sober People; so as Church affaires should be managed neither with tyrannie, parity, nor popularity; neither Bishops ejected, nor Presbyters despised, nor People oppressed.</p>

               <p>I Look upon the way of Treaties, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring from fighting like Beasts, to arguing like Men; whose strength should be more in their understandings, than in their limbs.</p>
               <p>And though I could seldome get opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to Treat, yet I never wanted either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire or disposition to it; having greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of My Reason, than My Sword: I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58806:89"/>
was so wholly resolved to yeild to the first, that I thought neither My selfe, nor others, should need to use the second, if once we rightly understood each other.</p>
               <p>Nor did I ever think it a diminution of Me, to prevent them with Expresses of My desires, and even importunities to Treat: It being an office, not onely of humanity, rather to use Reason, than Force; but also of Christianity to <hi>seek peace and ensue it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I am very unwillingly compelled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend My self with Armes, so I very willingly embraced any thing tending to Peace.</p>
               <p>The events of all Warre by the Sword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very dubious, and of a Civill Warre un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable; the end hardly recompencing, and late repairing the mischief of the means.</p>
               <p>Nor did any successe I had ever enhaunce with Me the price of Peace, as earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Me as any man; though I was like to pay dearer for it than any man: All that I sought to reserve was, Mine Honour, and My Conscience; the one I could not part with as a KING, the other as a Christian.</p>
               <p>The Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> gave the fairest hopes of an happy composure; had others applied themselves to it with the same moderation, as I did, I am confident the War had then ended.</p>

               <p>I see, Jealousies are not so easily allayed, as they are raised: Some men are more afraid to retreat from violent Engagements, than to Engage: what is wanting in equity, must be made up in pertinacy. Such as had little to enjoy in peace, or to lose in warre, studied to render the very name of <hi>Peace</hi> odious and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected.</p>
               <p>In Church affaires, where I had least liberty of prudence, having so many strict ties of Conscience upon Me; yet I was willing to condescend so farre to the setling of them, as might have given fair satisfaction to all men, whom faction, covetousnesse, or superstition had not engaged more, than any true zeale, charity, or love of Reformation.</p>
               <p>I was content to yeild to all that might seem to advance true piety; I onely sought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue what was necessary in point of Order, Maintenance, and Authority to the Churches Government; and what I am perswaded (as I have elswhere set downe My thoughts more
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58806:90"/>
fully) is most agreeable to the true Principles of all Government, raised to its full stature and perfection, as also to the primitive Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall patterne, and the practise of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church conforme thereto.</p>
               <p>From which wholly to recede, without any probable reason urged or answered, onely to satisfie some mens wills and fantasies (which yet agree not among themselves in any point, but that of extirpating Episcopacy, and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against Me) must needs argue such as soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and infirmity of mind in Me, as will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part with Gods Truth, than Mans Peace, and rather lose the Churches honour, than crosse some mens Factious humours.</p>
               <p>God knowes, and time will discover, who were most too blame for the un-succesfulnesse of that Treaty, and who must bear the guilt of after-calamities. I believe, I am very excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable both before God, and all unpassionate men, who have seriously weighed those trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, wherein I endeavoured no lesse the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of Peace to My people, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of my own Crowns to my Posterity.</p>
               <p>Some men have that height, as to interpret all faire Condescendings, as Arguments of feeblenesse, and glory most in an unflexible stifnesse, when they see others most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A grand Maxime with them was alwaies
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58806:91"/>
to aske something, which in reason and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour must be denied, that they might have some colour to refuse all that was in other things granted; setting Peace at as high a rate, as the worst effects of Warre; endeavouring first to make Me destroy My selfe by disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Concessions, that so they might have the lesse to doe.</p>
               <p>This was all which that Treaty, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produced, to let the world see, how little I would deny, or they grant, in order to the Publique peace.</p>
               <p>That it gave occasion to some mens further restivenesse, is imputable to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved tempers, not to any Concessions or Negations of Mine: I have alwaies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of what I offered, and they the regret, and blame, for what they refused.</p>
               <p>The highest tide of successe set me not above a Treaty, nor the lowest ebbe below a Fight: Though I never thought it any signe of true valour, to be prodigall of mens lives, rather then to be drawne to produce our owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or subscribe to other mens.</p>
               <p>That which made Me for the most part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage the unsuccesfulnesse of any Treaty, was, some mens unwillingnesse to Treat: which implied some things were to be gained by the Sword, whose unreasonablenesse they were loath to have fairly scanned, being more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

               <p>I pray God forgive them that were guilty of that Treaties breaking; and give them grace to make their advantages gotten by the Sword a better opportunity to use such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as was then wanting; that so though Peace were for our sins justly deferred, yet at last it may be happily obtain'd; what we could not get by our Treaties, we may gaine by our Prayers.</p>

                  <hi>19.</hi> Vpon the various events of the Warre; Victories, and Defeats.</head>
               <p>THe various Successes of this unhappy war, have at least, afforded Me variety of good Meditations: sometimes God was pleased to trie Me with Victory, by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting My Enemies, that I might know how with moderation and thanks to owne, and use his power, who is onely the true <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi>; able when he pleases to represse the confidence of those, that fought against Me, with so great advantages for power and number.</p>
               <p>From small beginnings on My part he let Me see, that I was not wholly forsaken by My peoples love, or his protection.</p>
               <p>Other times God was pleased to exercise My patience, and teach Me not to trust in the arme of Flesh, but in the living God.</p>
               <p>My sins sometimes prevailed against the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of My Cause: &amp; those that were with Me
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58806:92"/>
wanted not matter and occasion for his just chastisement both of them, and Me: Nor were My enemies lesse punished by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, which hardened them to continue that injustice by open hostility, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by most riotous and unparliamentary Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but personall and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate sins may oft-times over-balance the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Publick engagements; nor doth God account every gallant Man (in the worlds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem) a fit instrument to assert in the way of War a righteous Cause; The more men are prone to arrogate to their own skill, valour and strength, the lesse doth God ordinarily work by them for his own glory.</p>
               <p>I am sure the event or successe can never state the Justice of any Cause, nor the peace of mens Consciences, nor the eternall fate of their Soules.</p>
               <p>Those with Me had (I think) clearly and undoubtedly, for their Justification the Word of God, and the Lawes of the Land, together with their own Oathes; all requiring obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to My just Commands; but to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under Heaven without Me, or against Me, in the point of raising Armes.</p>
               <p>Those on the other side are forced to flie to the shifts of some pretended Feares, and wild fundamentals of State (as they call them)
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58806:93"/>
which actually overthrow the present fabrick, both of Church and State; being such imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Reasons for self-defence as are most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent for those men to alledge, who being My Subjects, were manifestly the first assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Me and the Lawes: first by unsuppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Tumults, after by listed Forces: The same Allegations they use, will fit any Faction that hath but power and confidence enough to second with the Sword, all their demands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the present Lawes &amp; Governours; which can never be such as some side or other will not find fault with, so as to urge what they call a Reformation of them to a Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, some parasitick Preachers have dared to call those Martyrs, who died fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against Me, the Lawes, their Oathes, and the Religion Established.</p>
               <p>But sober Christians know, That glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Title, can with Truth be applied only to those, who sincerely preferred Gods Truth, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r duty in all these particulars before their lives, and all that was dear to them in this world; who having no advantageous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes by any Innovation, were religiously sensible of those ties to God, the Church, and My self, which lay upon their Souls, both for obedience and just assistance.</p>
               <p>God could, and I doubt not but he did through his mercy, crown many of them with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58806:93"/>
eternall life, whose lives were lost in so just a Cause; The destruction of their bodies being sanctified, as a means to save their Soules.</p>
               <p>Their wounds, and temporall ruine serving as a gracious opportunity for their eternall health and happinesse; while the evident approach of death did, through Gods grace, effectually dispose their hearts to such Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Faith, and Repentance, which together with the Rectitude of their present engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would fully prepare them for a better life then that, which their enemies brutish and disloyall fiercenesse could deprive them of; or without Repentance hope to enjoy.</p>
               <p>They have often indeed, had the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst My side in the Field, but never, I believe, at the barre of Gods Tribunall, or their own Consciences; where they are more afraid to encounter those many pregnant Reasons, both from Law, Allegiance, and all true Christian grounds, which conflict <hi>with,</hi> and accuse them <hi>in</hi> their own thoughts, then they oft were in a desperate bravery to fight against those Forces, which sometimes God gave Me.</p>
               <p>Whose condition conquered, and dying, I make no question, but is infinitely more to be chosen by a sober man, (that duly values his duty, his soul, and eternity, beyond the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this present life) then the most
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58806:94"/>
triumphant glory, wherein their and Mine Enemies supervive; who can hardly avoid to be daily tormented by that horrid guilt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their suspicious, or now convicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences do pursue them, especially since they and all the world have seen, how false and un-intended those pretensions were, which they first set forth, as the only plausible (though not justifiable) grounds of raising a War, and continuing it thus long against Me, and the Lawes established; in whose safety and preservation all honest men think the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their Country doth consist.</p>
               <p>For, and with all which, it is farre more honourable and comfortable to suffer, then to prosper in their ruine and subversion.</p>
               <p>I have often prayed, that all on My side might joyn true piety with the sense of their Loyalty; and be as faithfull to God and their own soules, as they were to Me. That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the one might not blast the endeavours of the other.</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot think, that any shewes, or truth of piety on the other side were sufficient to dispence with, or expiate the defects of their Duty and Loyalty to Me, which have so pregnant convictions on mens Consciences, that even profaner men are moved by the sense of them to venture their lives for Me.</p>
               <p>I never had any victory which was without
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58806:94"/>
My sorrow, because it was on Mine owne Subjects, who, like <hi>Absolom,</hi> died many of them in their sinne: And yet I never suffered any Defeat, which made Me despaire of Gods mercy and defence.</p>
               <p>I never desired such Victories, as might serve to conquer, but onely restore the Lawes and Liberties of My people; which I saw were extreamly oppressed, together with My Rights by those men, who were impatient of any just restraint.</p>
               <p>When Providence gave Me, or denied Me Victory, My desire was neither to boast of My power, nor to charge God foolishly; who I believed at last would make all things to work together for My good.</p>
               <p>I wished no greater advantages by the War, then to bring My Enemies to moderation, and My Friends to peace.</p>
               <p>I was afraid of the temptation of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute conquest, and never prayed more for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over others, than over My self. When the first was denied, the second was granted Me, which God saw best for Me.</p>
               <p>The different events were but the methods of divine justice, by contrary winds to winow us: That, by punishing our sinnes, he might purge them from us; and by deferring peace, he might prepare us more to prize, and better to use so great a blessing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:58806:95"/>My often Messages for Peace shewed, that I delighted not in Warre: as My former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions sufficiently testified, how willingly I would have prevented it; and My totall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparednesse for it, how little I intended it.</p>
               <p>The conscience of My Innocency forbade Me to feare a Warre; but the love of My Kingdomes commanded Me (if possible) to avoid it.</p>
               <p>I am guilty in this Warre of nothing, but this, That I gave such advantages to some men, by confirming their power, which they knew not to use with that modesty, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which became their Loyalty and My confidence.</p>
               <p>Had I yeilded lesse, I had been opposed lesse; had I denied more, I had been more obeyed.</p>
               <p>'Tis now too late to review the occasions of the Warre; I wish onely a happy conclusion, of so unhappy beginnings: The unevitable fate of our sinnes was (no doubt) such, as would no longer suffer the divine justice to be quiet: we having conquered his patience, are condemned by mutuall conquerings, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy one another: for, the most prosperous successes on either side, impaire the welfare of the whole.</p>
               <p>Those Victories are still miserable, that leave our sinnes un-subdued; flushing our
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58806:95"/>
pride, and animating to continue injuries.</p>
               <p>Peace it self is not desireable, till repentance have prepared us for it.</p>
               <p>When we fight more against our selves, and lesse against God, we shall cease fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one another; I pray God these may all meet in our hearts, and so dispose us to an happy conclusion of these Civil Warres; that I may know better to obey God, and govern My People, and they may learn better to obey both God and Me.</p>
               <p>Nor doe I desire any man should be further subject to Me, then all of us may be subject to God.</p>

               <p>What Providence denies to Force, it may grant to Prudence: Necessity is now my Counsellour, and commands me to study my safety by a disguised withdrawing from my chiefest strength, and adventuring upon their Loyalty, who first began my Troubles.

               <p>WHen Providence was pleased to deprive Me of all other civill comforts and secular attendants, I thought the absence of them all might best be supplyed by the attendance of some of My Chaplaines; whom for their Function I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and for their Fidelity I have cause to love. By their learning, piety, and prayers, I hoped to be either better enabled to sustaine the want of all other enjoyments, or better fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the recovery and use of them in Gods good time: so reaping by their pious help a spirituall harvest of grace amidst the thornes, and after the plowings of temporall crosses.</p>
               <p>The truth is, I never needed or desired more the service and assistance of men judiciously pious, and soberly devout.</p>
               <p>The solitude they have confined Me unto, adds the Wildernesse to my temptations; For the company they obtrude upon Me, is more sad than any solitude can be.</p>
               <p>If I had asked My Revenues, My Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> or any one of My Kingdomes, it had been no wonder to have been denyed in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58806:109"/>
those things, where the evill policy of men forbids all just restitution, lest they should confesse an injurious usurpation: But to deny Me the Ghostly comfort of My Chaplaines seemes a greater rigour and barbarity, then is ever used by Christians to the meanest Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and greatest Malefactors; whom though the Justice of the Law deprive of worldly comforts, yet the mercy of Religion allows them the benefit of their Clergy, as not ayming at once to destroy their Bodies, and to damne their Soules.</p>

               <p>They that envy My being a King, are loath I should be a Christian; while they seek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Me of all things else, They are afraid I should save my Soul.</p>
               <p>Other sense, Charity it self can hardly pick out of those many harsh Repulses I received, as to that Request so often made for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of some of My Chaplaines.</p>
               <p>I have sometime thought the Unchristian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of those denialls might arise from a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure some men had to see me prefer my own Divines before their Ministers: whom, though I respect for that worth and piety

which may be in them; yet I cannot thinke them so proper for any present comforters or Physitians; Who have (some of them at least) had so great an influence in occasioning these calamities, and inflicting these wounds upon Me.</p>
               <p>Nor are the soberest of them so apt for that devotionall complyance, and juncture of hearts, which I desire to bear in those holy Offices, to be performed with Me, and for Me; since their judgements standing at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from me, or in jealousie of me, or in opposition against me, their Spirits cannot so harmoniously accord with mine, or mine with theirs, either in Prayer, or other holy duties, as is meet, and most comfortable; whose golden Rule, and bond of Perfection consists in that of mutuall Love and Charity.</p>

               <p>I confesse I am better pleased, as with stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and premeditated Sermons, so with such publique Formes of Prayer, as are fitted to the Churches and every Christians daily &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon necessities; because I am by them better assured, what I may joyn My heart unto, than I can be of any mans extemporary sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; which as I doe not wholly exclude from publique occasions, so I allow its just liberty and use in private and devout retirements; where neither the solemnity of the duty, nor the modest regard to others, doe require so great exactnesse as to the outward manner of performance. Though the light of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the fervency of affection, I hold the maine and most necessary requisites both in constant, and occasionall, solitary, and sociall Devotions.</p>
               <p>So that I must needs seem to all equal minds with as much Reason to prefer the service of My own Chaplains before that of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as I do the Liturgy before their Directory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:58806:111"/>In the one, I have been alwaies educated and exercised; In the other, I am not yet Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized, nor acquainted: And if I were, yet should I not by that, as by any certain rule and Canon of devotion, be able to follow or find out the indirect extravagancies of most of those men, who highly cry up that as a piece of rare composure and use; which is already as much despised and disused by many of them, as the Common-prayer sometimes was by those men; a great part of whose piety hung upon that popular pin of rayling against, and contemning the Government, and Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of this Church. But, I had rather be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the woe of <hi>Vae soli,</hi> than to that of <hi>Vae vobis Hypocritis,</hi> by seeming to pray what I doe not approve.</p>
               <p>It may be, I am esteemed by My Denyers sufficient of My selfe to discharge My duty to GOD as a Priest, though not to Men as a Prince.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I think both Offices, Regall and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotall, might well become the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; as anciently they were under one name, &amp; the united rights of primogeniture: Nor could I follow better presidents, if I were able, than those two eminent Kings, <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>; not more famous for their Scepters and Crownes, than one was for devout Psalmes and Prayers; the other for his divine Parables
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58806:112"/>
and Preaching: whence the one merited and assumed the name of a Prophet, the other of a Preacher. Titles indeed of greater honour, where rightly placed, than any of those the Roman Emperours affected from the Nations they subdued: it being infinitely more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to convert Soules to Gods Church by the Word, than to conquer men to a subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Sword.</p>
               <p>Yet since the order of Gods wisdome and providence hath, for the most part, alwaies distinguished the gifts and offices of Kings, of Priests, of Princes and Preachers; both in the Jewish and Christian Churches: I am sorry to find My selfe reduced to the necessity of being both, or enjoying neither.</p>
               <p>For such as seek to deprive Me of Kingly Power and Soveraignty; would no lesse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Me to live many Months without all Prayers, Sacraments, and Sermons, unlesse I become My owne Chaplaine.</p>
               <p>As I owe the Clergy the protection of a Christian KING, so I desire to enjoy from them the benefit of their gifts and prayers; which I look upon as more prevalent than My owne, or other mens; by how much they flow from minds more enlightned, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions lesse distracted, than those, which are encombred with secular affaires: besides, I think a greater blessing and acceptablenesse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58806:112"/>
those duties, which are rightly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as proper to, and within the limits of that calling, to which God and the Church have specially designed and consecrated some men: And however, as to that Spirituall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which the devout Soule is subject to Christ, and through his merits daily offers it self and its services to GOD, every private be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is a King and Priest, invested with the honour of a Royall Priesthood; yet as to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall order, and the outward polity of the Church, I think confusion in Religion will as certainly follow every mans turning Priest or Preacher, as it will in the State, where every one affects to rule as King.</p>
               <p>I was alwaies bred to more modest, and I think more pious Principles: the conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to My spirituall defects makes Me more prize and desire those pious assistances, which holy and good Ministers, either Bishops or Presbyters, may afford Me; especially in these extremities, to which God hath been pleased to suffer some of My Subjects to reduce Me; so as to leave them nothing more, but My life to take from Me: and to leave Me nothing to desire, which I thought might lesse provoke their jealousie and offence to deny Me, than this of having some mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To which end I made choice of men, as no

way (that I know) scandalous, so every way eminent for their learning and piety, no lesse than for their Loyalty: nor can I imagine any exceptions to be made against them, but only this, that they may seem too able and too well affected toward Me and My service.</p>
               <p>But this is not the first service (as I count it the best) in which they have forced Me to serve My self; though I must confesse I beare with more grief &amp; impatience the want of My Chaplaines, than of any other My Servants; and next (if not beyond in some things) to the being sequestred from my Wife and Children, since from these indeed more of humane and temporary affections, but from those more of heavenly and eternall improvements may be expected.</p>
               <p>My comfort is, that in the inforced (not neglected) want of ordinary meanes, God is wont to afford extraordinary supplies of his gifts and graces.</p>
               <p>If his Spirit will teach Me and help My In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in prayer, reading and meditation (as I hope he will) I shall need no other, either Oratour or Instructer.</p>

                  <p>O look on me thy Servant, in infinite mercy, whom thou didst once blesse with the joynt and sociated Devotions of others, whose fervency might inflame the coldnesse of my affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee; when we went to, or met in thy House with the voice of joy and gladnesse, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping thee in the unity of spirits, and with the bond of Peace.</p>
                  <p>O forgive the neglect, and not improving of those happy opportunities.</p>
                  <p>It is now thy pleasure that I should be as a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican in the wildernesse, as a Sparrow on the house top, and as a coale scattered from all those pious glowings, and devout reflections, which might

                  <p>Thou permittest men to deprive me of those outward means, which thou hast appointed in thy Church; but they cannot debarre me from the communion of that inward grace, which thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone breathest into humble hearts.</p>
                  <p>O make me such, and thou wilt teach me; thou wilt heare me, thou wilt help me: The broken and contrite heart I know thou wilt not despise. Thou, O Lord canst at once make me thy Temple,

thy Priest, thy Sacrifice, and thine Altar; while from an humble heart I (alone) daily offer up in holy meditations, fervent prayers, and unfeigned teares my self to thee; who preparest me for thee, dwellest in me, and acceptest of me.</p>
                  <p>Thou O Lord didst cause by secret supplies and miraculous infusions, that the handfull of meale in the vessell should not spend, nor the little oyle in the cruise fayle the Widow during the time of drought and dearth.</p>
                  <p>O look on my soul, which as a Widow, is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate &amp; forsaken: let not those saving Truths I have formerly learned now fail my memory; nor the sweet effusions of thy Spirit, which I have sometime felt, now be wanting to my heart in this famine of ordinary and wholsome food for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing of my Soule.</p>

but adde sin to sin, till the latter punish the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; such as were content to see Me and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Members of both Houses driven away by the first unsuppressed Tumults, are now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to flie to an Army, or defend themselves against them.</p>
               <p>But who can unfold the riddle of some mens justice? the Members of both Houses who at first withdrew, (as My self was forced to doe) from the rudenesse of the Tumults, were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Desertors, and outed of their Places in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Such as stayed then, and enjoyed the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Tumults, were asserted for the onely Parliament-men: now the Fliers from, and Forsakers of their Places, carry the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary power along with them; complaine highly against the Tumults, and vindicate themselves by an Army: such as remained and kept their stations, are looked upon as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors of tumultuary insolencies, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the freedome and honour of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>Thus is Power above all Rule, Order, and Law; where men look more to present Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages than their Consciences, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable rules of Justice; while they are Judges of others, they are forced to condemn themselves.</p>
               <p>Now the plea against Tumults holds good,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58806:119"/>
the Authours and Abbettors of them are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prodigious insolencies; when as before, they were counted as Friends and necessary A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I see Vengeance pursues and overtakes (as the Mice and Rats are said to have done a Bishop in <hi>Germany</hi>) them that thought to have escaped and fortified themselves most impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably against it, both by their multitude and compliance.</p>
               <p>Whom the Laws cannot, God will punish, by their owne crimes and hands.</p>
               <p>I cannot but observe this divine Justice, yet with sorrow and pity; for, I alwaies wished so well to Parliament and City, that I was sorry to see them doe, or suffer, any thing unworthy such great &amp; considerable bodies in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>I was glad to see them onely scared and humbled, not broken by that shaking: I never had so ill a thought of those Cities as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of their Loyalty to Me; which mistakes might eclipse, but I never believed malice had quite put out.</p>
               <p>I pray God the storme be yet wholly passed over them; upon whom I look, as Christ did sometime over <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as objects of my prayers and teares, with compassionate griefe, foreseeing those severer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58806:120"/>
gathered to their duty: fatall blindnesse fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attending and punishing wilfulnesse, so that men shall not be able at last to prevent their sorrows who would not timely repent of their sins; nor shall they be suffered to enjoy the comforts, who securely neglect the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels belonging to their peace. They will find that Brethren in iniquity are not farre from becomming insolent enemies, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing harder then to keep ill men long in one mind.</p>
               <p>Nor is it possible to gaine a faire period for those notions which go rather in a round and circle of fansie, than in a right line of reason tending to the Law, the onely center of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique consistency; whither I pray God at last bring all sides.</p>
               <p>Which will easily be done, when we shall fully see how much more happy we are, to be subject to the knowne Laws, than to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wils of any men, seem they never so plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible at first.</p>
               <p>Vulgar compliance with any illegall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant waies, like violent motions in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, soon grows weary of it self, and ends in a refractory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is some kind of deceiving and lessening the injury of My long restraint, when I find My leisure and solitude have produced some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of My self, and usefull to you; That neither you, nor any other, may hereafter measure My Cause by the Successe; nor My Judgment of things by My misfortunes; which I count the greater by farre, because they have so farre lighted upon you, and some others, whom I have most cause to love as well as My self; and of whose unmerited sufferings I have a greater sense then of Mine own.</p>
               <p>But this advantage of wisedome you have above most Princes; that you have begun,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58806:122"/>
and now spent some yeares of discretion, in the experience of troubles, and exercise of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wherein Piety, and all Vertues, both Morall and Politicall, are commonly better planted to a thriving (as trees set in winter) then in the warmth, and serenity of times; or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst those delights, which usually attend Princes Courts in times of peace and plenty; which are prone, either to root up all plants of true Vertue and Honour; or to be contented only with some leaves, and withering forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of them, without any reall fruits, such as tend to the Publick good; for which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should alwayes remember they are born and by providence desig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The evidence of which different education the holy Writ affords us in the contemplation of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> The one prepared, by many afflictions for a flourishing Kingdom, the other softned by the unparalel'd prosperity of <hi>Solomons</hi> Court; and so corrupted to the great diminution, both for Peace, Honour, and Kingdome, by those flatteries, which are as unseparable from prosperous Princes, as Flies are from fruit in summer; whom adversity, like cold weather, drives away.</p>
               <p>I had rather you should be <hi>Charles le Bow,</hi> then <hi>le Grand,</hi> good, then great; I hope God hath designed you to be both, having so early put you into that exercise of his Graces, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58806:123"/>
gifts bestowed upon you, which may best weed out all vicious inclinations, and dispose you to those Princely endowments, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which will most gain the love, and intend the welfare of those, over whom God shall place you.</p>
               <p>With God I would have you begin and end, who is King of Kings; the Soveraign disposer of the Kingdomes of the world, who pulleth downe one, and setteth up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The best Government, and highest Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty you can attain to is, to be subject to him, that the Scepter of his Word and Spirit may rule in your heart.</p>
               <p>The true glory of Princes consists in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Gods Glory in the maintenance of true Religion, and the Churches good; Also in the dispensation of civill Power, with Justice and Honour to the publick Peace.</p>
               <p>Piety will make you prosperous; at least it will keep you from being miserable; nor is he much a loser, that loseth all, yet saveth his owne soule at last.</p>
               <p>To which Center of true Happinesse God, I trust, hath and will graciously direct all these black lines of Affliction, which he hath been pleased to draw on me, and by which he hath (I hope) drawn me nearer to himself. You have already tasted of that cup whereof I
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58806:123"/>
have liberally drank, which I look upon as Gods Physick, having that in healthfulnesse which it wants in pleasure.</p>
               <p>Above all, I would have you, as I hope you are already; well-grounded and setled in your Religion: The best profession of which, I have ever esteemed that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in which you have been educated; yet I would have your own Judgement and Reason now seal to that sacred bond which education hath written, that it may be judiciously your own Religion, and not other mens custome or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which you professe.</p>
               <p>In this I charge you to persevere, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming nearest to Gods Word for Doctrine, and to the primitive examples for Government, with some little amendment, which I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where expressed, and often offered, though in vain. Your fixation in matters of Religion will not be not more necessary for your soules then your Kingdomes peace, when God shall bring you to them.</p>

               <p>Nothing seemed lesse considerable than the Presbyterian Faction in <hi>England,</hi> for many yeares; so compliant they were to publique order: nor indeed was their Party great either in Church, or State, as to mens judgments: But as soone as discontents drave men into Sidings (as ill humours fall to the disaffected mart, which causes inflamations) so did all, at first, who affected any novelties, adhere to that Side, as the most remarkable and specious note of difference (then) in point of Religion.</p>

                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:58806:125"/>Let nothing seem little or despicable to you in matters which concerne Religion and the Churches peace, so as to neglect a speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and effectuall suppressing Errours &amp; Schismes, which seem at first but as a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bredth, by seditious Spirits, as by strong winds are soon made to cover and darken the whole Heaven.</p>
               <p>When you have done justice to God, your owne soule and his Church, in the profession and preservation both of truth and unity in Religion: the next main hinge on which your prosperity will depend, and move, is, that of civill Justice, wherein the setled Laws of these Kingdomes, to which you are rightly Heire, are the most excellent rules you can governe by; which by an admirable temperament give very much to Subjects industry, liberty, and happinesse; and yet reserve enough to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and prerogative of any King, who ownes his People as Subjects, not as Slaves; whose subjection, as it preserves their property, peace, and safety, so it will never diminish your Rights, nor their ingenuous Liberties; which consists in the enjoyment of the fruits of their industry, and the benefit of those Lawes to which themselves have consented.</p>
               <p>Never charge your Head with such a Crowne, as shall by its heavinesse oppresse the whole body, the weaknesse of whose parts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p>Your Prerogative is best shewed, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in remitting, rather than exacting the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Lawes; there being nothing worse than legall Tyranny.</p>
               <p>In these two points, the preservation of esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Religion, and Lawes, I may (without vanity) turne the reproach of My sufferings, as to the worlds censure, into the honour of a kind of Martyrdome, as to the testimony of My owne Conscience; The Troublers of My Kingdomes having nothing else to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Me but this, That I preferre Religion, and Lawes established before those alterations they propounded.</p>
               <p>And so indeed I doe, and ever shall, till I am convinced by better Arguments, than what hitherto have been chiefly used towards Me, Tumults, Armies, and Prisons.</p>
               <p>I cannot yet learne that lesson, nor I hope ever will you, That it is safe for a King to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie any Faction with the perturbation of the Lawes, in which is wrapt up the publique In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and the good of the Community.</p>
               <p>How God will deale with Me, as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of these pressures, &amp; indignities, which his justice by the very unjust hands of some of My Subjects, hath been pleased to lay upon
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58806:126"/>
Me, I cannot tell: nor am I much solicitous what wrong I suffer from men, while I retaine in My soule, what I believe is right before God.</p>
               <p>I have offered all for Reformation and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that in Reason, Honour, and Conscience I can; reserving onely what I cannot consent unto, without an irreparable injury to My own Soule, the Church, and My People, and to You also, as the next and undoubted Heire of My Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>To which if the divine Providence, to whom no difficulties are insuperable, shall in his due time after My decease bring You, as I hope he will; My counsell and charge to You, is, That You seriously consider the former, reall, or objected miscarriages, which might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion My troubles, that You may avoid them.</p>
               <p>Never repose so much upon any mans single counsell, fidelity, and discretion, in managing affaires of the first magnitude, (that is, matters of Religion and Justice) as to create in Your selfe, or others, a diffidence of Your owne judgment, which is likely to be alwaies more constant &amp; impartiall to the interests of Your Crowne and Kingdome than any mans.</p>
               <p>Next, beware of exasperating any Factions by the crosnesse, and asperity of some mens passions, humours, or private opinions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by You, grounded onely upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58806:126"/>
in lesser matters, which are but the skirts and suburbs of Religion.</p>
               <p>Wherein a charitable connivence and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian toleration often dissipates their strength, whom rougher opposition fortifies; and puts the despised and oppressed Party, into such Combinations, as may most enable them to get a full revenge on those they count their Persecutors, who are commonly assisted by that vulgar commiseration, which attends all, that are said to suffer under the notion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Provided the differences amount not to an insolent opposition of Lawes, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Religion established, as to the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of them, such motions and minings are intolerable.</p>
               <p>Alwaies keep up solid piety, and those fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Truths (which mend both hearts and lives of men) with impartiall favour and justice.</p>
               <p>Take heed that outward circumstances and formalities of Religion devoure not all, or the best incouragements of learning, industry, and piety; but with an equall eye, and impartiall hand, distribute favours and rewards to all men, as you find them for their reall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse both in abilities and fidelity worthy and capable of them.</p>
               <p>This will be sure to gaine You the hearts of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58806:127"/>
the best, and the most too; who, though they be not good themselves, yet are glad to see the severer waies of virtue at any time sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by temporall rewards.</p>
               <p>I have, You see, conflicted with different and opposite Factions; (for so I must needs call and count all those, that act not in any confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Lawes established, in Church and State) no sooner have they by force subdued what they counted their Common Enemy, (that is, all those that adhered to the Lawes, and to Me) and are secured from that feare, but they are divided to so high a rivalry, as sets them more at defiance against each other, than against their first Antagonists.</p>
               <p>Time will dissipate all factions, when once the rough hornes of private mens covetous and ambitious designes, shall discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; which were at first wrapt up &amp; hidden under the soft and smooth pretensions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Reformation, and Liberty: As the Wolfe is not lesse cruell, so he will be more justly hated, when he shall appeare no better than a Wolfe under Sheeps cloathing.</p>
               <p>But as for the seduced Traine of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who in their simplicity follow those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises; My charge and counsell to You, is, That as You need no palliations for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, (as other men) so that you study really to exceed (in true and constant demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58806:127"/>
of goodnesse, piety, and virtue, towards the People) even all those men, that make the greatest noise and ostentations of Religion; so You shall neither feare any detection, (as they doe, who have but the face and maske of goodnesse) nor shall You frustrate the just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of Your People; who cannot in Reason promise themselves so much good from any Subjects novelties, as from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous constancy of their King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>When these mountaines of congealed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions shall by the sunshine of Gods mercy, and the splendor of Your virtues be thawed and dissipated; and the abused Vulgar shall have learned, that none are greater Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressours of their Estates, Liberties, and Consciences, than those men, that entitle themselves, The Patrones and Vindicators of them, onely to usurp power over them; Let then no passion betray You to any stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of revenge upon those, whose owne sinne and folly will sufficiently punish them in due time.</p>
               <p>But as soone as the forked arrow of factious emulations is drawn out, use all princely arts, and clemency to heale the wounds; that the smart of the cure may not equall the anguish of the hurt.</p>
               <p>I have offered Acts of Indempnity, and Oblivion; to so great a latitude, as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:58806:128"/>
all, that can but suspect themselves to be any way obnoxious to the Laws; and which might serve to exclude all future Jealousies and insecurities.</p>
               <p>I would have You alwaies propense to the same way, when ever it shall be desired and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, let it be granted, not onely as an Act of State-policy and necessity, but of Christian charity and choice.</p>
               <p>It is all I have now left Me, a power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give those, that have deprived Me of all; and I thanke God, I have a heart to doe it; and joy as much in this grace, which God hath given Me, as in all My former enjoyments; for this is a greater argument of Gods love to Me, than any prosperity can be.</p>
               <p>Be confident (as I am) that the most of all sides, who have done amisse, have done so, not out of malice, but mis-information, or mis-apprehension of things.</p>
               <p>None will be more loyall and faithfull to Me and You, than those Subjects, who sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of their Errours, and our Injuries, will feel in their owne Soules most vehement mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to repentance; and earnest desires to make some reparations for their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>As Your quality sets You beyond any Duell with any Subject; so the noblenesse of Your mind must raise You above the meditating
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58806:128"/>
any revenge, or executing Your anger upon the many.</p>
               <p>The more conscious You shall be to Your owne merits, upon Your People, the more prone You will be to expect all love and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty from them; and to inflict no punishment upon them for former miscarriages: You will have more inward complacency in pardoning one, than in punishing a thousand.</p>
               <p>This I write to you, not despairing of Gods mercy, and my Subjects affections towards You; both which, I hope You will study to deserve, yet We cannot merit of God, but by his owne mercy.</p>
               <p>If God shall see fit to restore Me, and You after Me, to those enjoyments, which the Lawes have assigned to Us; and no Subjects without an high degree of guilt and sinne can devest Us of; then may I have better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, when I shall be so happy to see You in peace, to let You more fully understand the things that belong to Gods glory, Your ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58806:129"/>
that You never suffer Your heart to receive the least check against, or disaffection from the true Religion established in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I tell You I have tried it, and after much search, and many disputes, have concluded it to be the best in the world; not onely in the Community, as Christian, but also in the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall notion, as Reformed; keeping the middle way between the pomp of superstitious Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and the meannesse of fantastique Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>

               <p>Indeed, they have left Me but little of life, and only the husk and shell (as it were) which their further malice and cruelty can take from Me; having bereaved Me of all those worldly comforts, for which life it self seems desirable to men.</p>
               <p>But, O My Soule! think not that life too long, or tedious, wherein God gives thee any opportunities, if not to doe, yet to suffer with such Christian patience and magnanimity in
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58806:133"/>
a good Cause, as are the greatest honour of our lives, and the best improvement of our deaths.</p>
               <p>I know that in point of true Christian va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, it argues pusillanimity to desire to die out of wearinesse of life; and a want of that heroick greatnesse of spirit which becomes a Christian in the patient and generous sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those afflictions, which as shadows neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily attend us, while we are in this body; and which are lessened or enlarged as the Sun of our prosperity moves higher, or lower: whose totall absence is best recompensed with the Dew of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The assaults of affliction may be terrible, like <hi>Sampson's</hi> Lyon, but they yeild much sweetnesse to those, that dare to encounter and overcome them; who know how to overlive the witherings of their Gourds without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content or peevishnesse, while they may yet converse with God.</p>
               <p>That I must die as a Man, is certain; that I may die a King, by the hands of My own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, a violent, sodain, and barbarous death; in the strength of My years; in the midst of My Kingdoms; My Friends and loving Subjects being helplesse Spectators; My Enemies inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Revilers and Triumphers over Me, living, dying, and dead, is so probable in humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that God hath taught me not to hope
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58806:134"/>
otherwise, as to mans cruelty; however, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire not of Gods infinite mercy.</p>
               <p>I know My Life is the object of the Devils &amp; wicked mens malice; but yet under Gods sole custody &amp; disposall: Whom I do not think to flatter for longer life by seeming prepared to die; but I humbly desire to depend upon him, &amp; to submit to his will both in life &amp; death, in what order soever he is pleased to lay them out to Me. I confesse it is not easie for Me to contend with those many horrours of death, wherewith God suffers Me to be tempted; which are equally horrid, either in the sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a barbarous Assasination; or in those greater formalities, whereby My Enemies (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more solemnly cruell) will, it may be, seeke to adde (as those did, who Crucified Christ) the mockery of Justice, to the cruelty of Malice: That I may be destroyed, as with greater pomp and artifice, so with lesse pity, it will be but a necessary policy to make My death appeare as an act of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ustice, done by Subjects upon their Soveraigne; who know that no Law of God or Man invests them with any power of Judicature without Me, much lesse against Me: and who, being sworn and bound by all that is sacred before God and man, to endeavour My preservation, must pretend Justice to cover their Perjury.</p>
               <p>It is, indeed, a sad fate for any man to have
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58806:134"/>
his Enemies to be Accusers, Parties, and Judges; but most desperate, when this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the insolence of Subjects against their Soveraigne; wherein those, who have had the chiefest hand, and are most guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving the publique Troubles, must by shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding My bloud seem to wash their own hands of that innocent bloud, whereof they are now most evidently guilty before God and man; and I believe in their owne consciences too, while they carried on unreasonable demands, first by Tumults, after by Armies. Nothing makes meane spirits more cowardly-cruell in managing their usurped power against their lawfull Superiours, than this, the <hi>Guilt of their unjust Usurpation</hi>; notwithstanding, those spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and popular pretensions of Justice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Delinquents, applied onely to disguise at first the monstrousnesse of their designes, who despaired, indeed, of possessing the power and profits of the Vineyard, till the Heire, whose right it is, be cast out and slaine.</p>
               <p>With them, My greatest fault must be, that I would not either destroy My selfe with the Church and State by My Word, or not suffer them to doe it unresisted by the Sword; whose covetous ambition no Concessions of Mine could ever yet, either satisfie, or abate.</p>
               <p>Nor is it likely they will ever think, that Kingdome of brambles, which some men seek
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58806:135"/>
to erect (at once, weak, sharp, and fruitlesse, either to God or man) is like to thrive till wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the Royall bloud of those, whose right the Kingdome is.</p>
               <p>Well, Gods will be done, I doubt not but My Innocency will find him both My Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour, and My Advocate, who is My onely Judge, whom I owne as King of Kings, not onely for the eminency of his power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty above them; but also for that singular care and protection, which he hath over them: who knows them to be exposed to as many dangers (being the greatest Patrones of Law, Justice, Order, and Religion on earth) as there be either Men or Devils, which love confusion.</p>
               <p>Nor will he suffer those men long to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper in their <hi>Babel,</hi> who build it with the bones and cement it with the bloud of their Kings.</p>
               <p>I am confident they will find Avengers of My death among themselves: the injuries I have sustained from them shall be first puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by them, who agreed in nothing so much as in opposing Me.</p>
               <p>Their impatience to beare the loud cry of My bloud, shall make them think no way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to expiate it, than by shedding theirs, who with them, most thirsted after Mine.</p>
               <p>The sad confusions following My destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are already presaged and confirmed to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58806:135"/>
Me by those I have lived to see since My troubles; in which, God alone (who onely could) hath many waies pleaded My cause; not suffering them to go unpunished, whose confederacy in sinne was their onely security; who have cause to feare that God will both further divide, and by mutuall vengeance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward destroy them.</p>
               <p>My greatest conquest of Death is from the power and love of Christ, who hath swallow'd up death in the victory of his Resurrection, and the glory of his Ascension.</p>
               <p>My next comfort is, that he gives Me not onely the honour to imitate his example in suffering for righteousnesse sake, (though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured by the foulest charges of Tyranny and Injustice) but also, that charity, which is the noblest revenge upon, and victory over My Destroyers: By which, I thank God, I can both forgive them, and pray for them, that God would not impute My bloud to them further then to convince them, what need they have of Christs bloud to wash their soules from the guilt of shedding Mine.</p>
               <p>At present, the will of My Enemies seems to be their onely rule, their power the measure, and their successe the Exactor, of what they please to call Justice; while they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the fancy of their owne safety by My danger, and the security of their lives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58806:136"/>
by My Death: forgetting, that as the greatest temptations to sinne are wrapped up in seeming prosperities, so the severest ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geances of God are then most accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, when men are suffered to compleat their wicked purposes.</p>
               <p>I blesse God, I pray not so much, that this bitter cup of a violent death may passe from Me, as that of his wrath may passe from all those, whose hands by deserting Me, are sprinkled, or by acting and consenting to My death are embrued with My bloud.</p>
               <p>The will of God hath confined, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Mine; I shall have the pleasure of dying, without any pleasure of desired vengeance.</p>
               <p>This I think becomes a Christian toward his Enemies, and a King toward his Subjects.</p>
               <p>They cannot deprive Me of more than I am content to lose, when God sees fit by their hands to take it from me; whose mercy I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, will more then infinitely recompence what ever by mans injustice he is pleased to deprive me of.</p>
               <p>The glory attending my death will farre surpasse all I could enjoy, or conceive in life.</p>
               <p>I shall not want the heavy and envied Crownes of this world, when my God hath mercifully crowned and consummated his graces with glory; and exchanged the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of my earthly Kingdomes among men,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58806:136"/>
for the substance of that heavenly kingdome with himself.</p>
               <p>For the censures of the world; I know the sharp and necessary tyranny of my Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will sufficiently confute the calumnies of tyranny against me; I am perswaded I am happy in the judicious love of the ablest and best of my Subjects, who doe not onely pity and pray for me, but would be content even to die with me, or for me.</p>
               <p>These know, how to excuse my failings, as a man, and yet to retaine, and pay their duty to me as their King; there being no religious ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity binding any Subjects by pretending to punish, infinitely to exceed, the faults and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of their Princes; especially there, where more then sufficient satisfaction hath been made to the publike; the enjoyment of which, private ambitions have hitherto frustrated.</p>

               <p>My chiefest comfort in death consists in my peace, which I trust, is made with God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whose exact Tribunal I shall not feare to appeare, as to the Cause so long disputed by the Sword, between me and my causlesse Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: where I doubt not, but his righteous judgment will confute their fallacy, who from worldly successe (rather like Sophisters, than sound Christians) draw those popular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions for Gods approbation of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whose wise providence (we know) oft permits many events, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> his revealed Word (the onely cleare, safe and fixed rule of good actions and good consciences) in no sort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves.</p>
               <p>I am confident the Justice of my Cause, and clearness of My Conscience before God &amp; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward my people will carry me, as much above them in Gods decision, as their successes have lifted them above me in the Vulgar opinion:

who consider not, that many times those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of men are lifted up to Heaven in the prosperity and applause of the world, whose rise is from Hell, as to the injuriousnesse and oppression of the designe. The prosperous winds which oft fill the sayles of Pirats, doth not justifie their piracy and rapine.</p>
               <p>I look upon it with infinite more content and quiet of Soule, to have been worsted in my enforced contestation for, and vindication of the Laws of the Land, the freedome and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Parliaments, the rights of my Crown, the just liberty of my Subjects, and the true Christian Religion in its Doctrine, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and due encouragements, then if I had, with the greatest advantages of successe, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne them all; as some men have now evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently done, whatever designes they at first pretended.</p>
               <p>The prayers and patience of my Friends and loving Subjects will contribute much to the sweetning of this bitter cup, which I doubt not but I shall more cheerfully take, and drink as from Gods hand (if it must be so) than they can give it to me, whose hands are unjustly and barbarously lifted up aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
