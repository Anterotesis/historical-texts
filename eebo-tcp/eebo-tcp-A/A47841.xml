            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DISCOURSE
UPON THE
FISHERY.</head>
            <p>BEing to treat of the <hi>Fishery,</hi> and more particularly of the <hi>Herring-Fishing</hi>
though I reckon upon the <hi>Cod</hi> and <hi>Ling-Fishing</hi> also in the
Gross, I have diligently perused, extracted, and digested whatever
I could meet with upon that Subject, and I finde that my Discourse
will fall under these 3. Propositions.</p>
            <p>I. That it is of Great, and Certain Advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II. That it lies fairer for the</hi> Subjects <hi>of his Majesty of</hi> Great Brittain, <hi>then for the</hi> Hollanders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III. That if it be Encouraged, and Established, it will prove the Foundation
of an ample, and lasting</hi> Revenue <hi>to the</hi> Crown, <hi>and of</hi>Wealth,<hi>and</hi>Prosperity <hi>to the</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nay, if it should turn to <hi>Loss,</hi> in stead of <hi>Profit,</hi> it wonld still abundantly
answer the</hi>Expence, <hi>in the</hi> Consequences; <hi>being an undertaking,
not only of</hi> Common Benefit,<hi>but (as the Case stands) of</hi> Absolute
Necessity,<hi>to the</hi> Safety, <hi>and</hi> well-being <hi>both of</hi> King <hi>and</hi>People;</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>§. 1. The Fishery is of Great, and Certain Advantage.</head>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Advantages</hi> of the <hi>Fishery;</hi> I presume there will be
no dispute, since it is granted on all hands, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> are beholding to it
for the <hi>Rise,</hi> and <hi>Support</hi> of their <hi>Greatness;</hi> for their <hi>Reputation abroad,</hi> and
for their <hi>Strength</hi> at <hi>Home:</hi> Insomuch that the <hi>Herring, Cod,</hi> and <hi>Ling</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in his Majesties Seas, by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>other Strangers,</hi> are valued
<hi>Communibus annis,</hi> at no lesse then <hi>Ten Millions of Pounds sterling;</hi> which
Computation has been often Published, and constantly received for current,
without contradiction.</p>

               <head>§. 2. The Fishery lies fairer for the Subjects of his Majesty of
Great Britain, then for the Hollanders.</head>
               <p>As the <hi>Fishery</hi> is very <hi>Considerable,</hi> so it lyes much fairer for Us,
then for <hi>Them,</hi> in regard that we have many advantages toward it, which the
<hi>Dutch</hi> want, and that <hi>we</hi> hardly want any thing which <hi>they</hi> have; save only
Industry, which may be easily Promoted by good Order, and Discipline.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We have the Fish upon our Coasts, (I might have said upon
our <hi>Shoars)</hi> where in case of <hi>Storm, Vnlading,</hi> taking in <hi>Provisions,</hi> or the
like; it is seldom above 4 or 5 hours work (and most commonly not so
much) to Recover a <hi>Harbour,</hi> and without any losse of time, to refitt, and
put to Sea again; whereas the <hi>Dutch</hi> have usually some 200 Leagues to
sayl before they come to their Fishing; and there they lie at the mercy of the
winds, for want of a Port to friend: and in Case of unlading, they have as
far back again; which takes up a great deal of time, hinders their business,
and endangers the loss of their Markets. It is true, that they have their <hi>Yagers</hi>
many times, to take off their Fish at Sea, and refurnish them with Cask, and
other necessaryes; but if it happens to be a Rowling sea, they must ly still,
and wait for a Calm; whereas with us that are in Harbour, the work of
unlading, Repacking, and sending our Fish away to the first Market, goes
on in all weathers. So that in respect of the <hi>nearnesse</hi> of the Fishing, we have
much the Better of them: And no lesse, in the Commodiousnesse of our <hi>Ports</hi>
and <hi>Crecks</hi> to Receive the <hi>Busses</hi> upon all Occasions.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Charge</hi> of a <hi>Fishing Vessell,</hi> with her <hi>Furniture, Tackle, Salt, Cask</hi>
and <hi>Victualls;</hi> there is hardly any thing that belongs to it, except <hi>Pitch</hi> and
<hi>Tarr,</hi> which <hi>We</hi> have not of our own Growth, whereas the <hi>Dutch</hi> have
little of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r own towards it, but <hi>Cheese</hi> and <hi>Butter,</hi> which is cheaper with
<hi>Us</hi> too then with <hi>Them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>Fishery</hi> be so <hi>Profitable,</hi> and lie so <hi>open</hi> to Us, that we may
master it with lesse <hi>Expence, Difficulty,</hi> or <hi>Hazzard</hi> then the <hi>Dutch,</hi> It is our
own fault if We do not improve it to the Greatest Temporal Blessing (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance)
that Providence ever bestowed upon any People.</p>
               <p>Some indeed will have it that <hi>We</hi> want Men; Others, that our men will never
take to it.</p>
               <p>To the First, I answer (under favour) that we have <hi>Men</hi> enough, but
they are idle, and live upon the Publick (to the shame of the Government)
without any Return of Labour and Industry for their Bread; let but these
People be set at work upon the <hi>Fishery,</hi> and We shall have hands to spare.</p>
               <p>The Second Exception is a Contemplation at large, <hi>viz. That the</hi> Genius
<hi>of this Nation will never endure the hardships of that Employment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93131:3"/>
To which I Reply, That the <hi>English</hi> do daily run greater hazards, and
suffer greater <hi>hardships</hi> in other Voyages, then they do in This; And that
they are, in very many Cases, inured to harder Labour: For certainly
the working of a <hi>Mine</hi> is incomparably beyond that of a <hi>Busse.</hi> But to
come to the very Point it self, so farre are the <hi>English</hi> from an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi>
to the <hi>Fishery,</hi> that they do <hi>apply</hi> themselves to it; as <hi>Yarmouth,</hi>
and <hi>Scarborough,</hi> and indeed the whole Coast will bear me Witness;
For so soon as ever harvest is over (where the <hi>Herring-season</hi> comes on)
the Boys, and Country Fellows presently flock to the Coast, to be hired
into the <hi>Fishing,</hi> and upon tryal, find it so much to their liking, that after
the second Voyage there is not one of Twenty of them but takes up at Sea
for good and all, without ever returning to his former Condition.</p>
               <p>To make it yet Clearer, it will not be amiss to take this Generall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to peices, and distinctly to Examine the severall difficultyes that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
under the notion of <hi>hardships.</hi> For to say that <hi>the</hi> English <hi>will never do
any thing but where they may ly warm, and dry; fill their Bellyes, and take their
Ease; and that the</hi> Hollanders <hi>will endure. Hardships better then the</hi> English,
will never Carry the Question: but I would fain know what sort of <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
it is (conducing to this affair) wherein the <hi>Dutch</hi> go beyond <hi>Us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are they <hi>Hardyer</hi> to encounter the <hi>Dangers of the Seas?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this poynt, we may appeal to every days Experience, and leave the
whole world to judge betwixt us.</p>
               <p>Is it the <hi>Hardship</hi> of Lying exposed to <hi>Cold Blasts,</hi> and <hi>Storms?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein lyes a Mistake, which I must confess has gain'd some Credit, and
it is worth the while to set it Right. Be it known then, that the <hi>Herring-sish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in his Majesties Seas, begins in <hi>June,</hi> and goes out in <hi>November:</hi> and
that for the <hi>first 4. Moneths,</hi> (which is the best time both for <hi>Profit</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Fair Weather)</hi> we never so much as look after it, but fall in upon the <hi>Winter
Fishing,</hi> from <hi>September,</hi> to the end of <hi>November,</hi> which is the most Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tuous
season of the whole year. And then in <hi>January,</hi> we fit out for
the <hi>North-Seas,</hi> and spend the remainder of the Winter in all extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of cold and hardship. This is enough to satisfie any man, that <hi>Our</hi>
skins are as good proof against winde and weather as <hi>Theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will put it yet further, by supposing that the <hi>Winter-Fishing</hi> would
be too hard for us; What excuse have we now for not making our best of
the <hi>Summer-Fishing,</hi> which is far the more gainful of the two?</p>
               <p>And truly the <hi>Hardship</hi> of <hi>Course-Feeding,</hi> does not amount to much nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though I know great stresse is layd upon it, <hi>how pittyfully</hi> their
People Fare; <hi>and that an</hi> English Body <hi>will never be able to live upon a</hi> Dutch
Diet.</p>
               <p>If so it were, that an <hi>English Diet</hi> could not be had, and that a <hi>Dutch one</hi>
would not serve the turn; it were something; but that is not Our Case; for
here, he that cannot feed upon the One, may have the Other: and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93131:4"/>
that the work will go on with <hi>Pease</hi> and <hi>Bacon,</hi> every jot as well as
with <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Cabbidge;</hi> Not but that the <hi>English</hi> can bring their stomacks
down too upon any Honourable Occasion, to the Grossest Food Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
as has been often seen among the Besieged in our late Troubles: but
they are too generous, to mortifie their <hi>Carcases,</hi> purely to save their <hi>Purses;</hi>
which in this particular, is the only ground of Exception; <hi>It will augment
the Charge</hi> that is to say, whereas a <hi>Holland-Buss,</hi> after their way of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualling,
clears about a <hi>1000l.</hi> a year, an <hi>English Buss</hi> will not clear above
<hi>990l.</hi> according to <hi>Ours:</hi> which <hi>10l.</hi> difference I do only admit for quiet
sake, and to shorten the dispute; as being the most that any man can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to; and more too, in plain terms, then the matter will bear. For the
<hi>Dutch-Victualling</hi> is the same with ours, so far as to <hi>Beer, Biscuyte, Butter</hi>
and <hi>Cheese;</hi> all which <hi>We</hi> can lay in much cheaper then <hi>They:</hi> so that 'tis
but adding the Charge of <hi>Pease</hi> and <hi>Bacon,</hi> which (to take it at the worst)
comes but to some 15 or <hi>16l.</hi> more, and then discounting for the other <hi>victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls</hi>
which it saves; for the difference of <hi>Prizes;</hi> and for the <hi>Brandy,</hi> which
their People drink more then ours, and there's the Accompt.</p>
               <p>Besides that the very supposall of passing from <hi>a good Diet</hi> to a <hi>bad,</hi> is a
great Errour, for the Countrey-men that put themselves into the Fishing,
fare Incomparably better at <hi>Sea,</hi> then ever they did at <hi>Land;</hi> for beside the
Ordinary Provision which they carry to Sea, they feed upon the Fish they
Catch; which for variety and Delicacy, (being fresh taken) is a Treat,
beyond what is to be had at any Noblemans Table ashoar: and improves
them at such a Rate, that of Pittifull weaklings at Land, they come in a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
or two to be hearty, stout, and healthfull persons.</p>
               <p>There is another Objection raysed from the strictnesse of the <hi>States Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> (where People must either <hi>work,</hi> or <hi>starve)</hi>which says, that <hi>the
hardshipps of the</hi> Fishery <hi>are so great, that if it were not barely to keep life and
soul together, no body would meddle with it, and that their</hi> Fishery <hi>is meerly
Supply'd cut of such a sort of People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Answer is, <hi>First,</hi> that the <hi>Foundation</hi> is a <hi>mistake,</hi> for it is already made
plain, that there are no such terrible <hi>hardshipps. Secondly,</hi> for Argument sake,
I will take all for Granted, as well the <hi>hardshipps</hi> themselves, as the <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi>
that make people undergo them; let it but be agreed, that by the force
of those <hi>necessities,</hi> the thing is done at last. For then, by a stronger reason
it may be done by <hi>Us,</hi> who have Ten men for their One, that have nothing
to live upon but their Labour: Persons that are ready to starve for want of
<hi>work,</hi> when the Nation is almost undone for want of <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are yet <hi>two Lions more in the way;</hi> 1st. <hi>Our Herrings are in no
esteem abroad, because we have not the right way of Curing them. 2ly, we shall
never make any thing on't, for</hi> the Dutch <hi>will under-sell us, by freighting chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
and consequently beat us ont of the Trade, for want of Vent.</hi> To which in
Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93131:4"/>
1st. There are <hi>two wayes</hi> of <hi>Cuting Herring;</hi> The <hi>One,</hi> at <hi>Sea;</hi> where
they are Gipp'd, Immediately upon the taking, and so Barrel'd up: The
<hi>Other,</hi> at <hi>Land,</hi> where they are <hi>Gipp'd,</hi> and <hi>Pack'd,</hi> some dayes after they
are Taken, <hi>These</hi> we call <hi>shore-made Herrings</hi> and we know before hand,
that one Barrell of the Other, (for Goodness) is worth a hundred of These;
and that they will never take their Pickle kindly, unless their Throtes be cutt
as soon as they are Caught. So that it is a great Errour, to take a <hi>shore-made
Herring</hi> for a tryal of our Skill of Curing. But for those we make at <hi>Sea,</hi> they
are as good, and as well esteemed abroad, as any <hi>Dutch Herrings</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
and this very year, above 200 Barrells were sold into the <hi>East-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi>
out of one small vessell of ours at near <hi>4l.</hi> a Barrell. I wish we were
not more to blame for not <hi>taking</hi> them, then for not <hi>Curing</hi> them. But
<hi>what if Really we could not Cure them? Is it Impossible to Learn?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly</hi> The other suggestion, that <hi>the</hi> Dutch <hi>will beat us out of our Trade,</hi> is
either of no force at all against the <hi>Fishery,</hi> or it is much more forcible against
the <hi>Merchant,</hi> and the <hi>Collier;</hi> for this Trade lies under our Noses, and
more in our Power then any other: And to discourage our Fishing upon this
Consideration, is all one, as to bid us <hi>quitt all Navigation whatsoever, and
leave our selves at the</hi> Hollanders <hi>Mercy;</hi> or in Effect, for <hi>a Prey to all Comers.</hi>
And then to fear the want of <hi>Vent,</hi> is to Imagine that people will leave Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for a great part of the Trading World lyes yet unserv'd: neither can
any man shew me that ever our Herring lay upon our Hands, for want of a
Market.</p>
               <p>Enough is sayd <hi>1st.</hi> to shew the <hi>Advantages</hi> of the <hi>Fishery.</hi> And <hi>2ly.</hi> that
we may easily <hi>Master</hi> it, if we please. It remains now that we take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it, and apply the Profit to our selves.</p>

               <head>§. 3. If the Fishery be Encouraged, and Established, it will prove the
Foundation of an ample, and lasting Revenue to the Crown, and
of Wealth and Prosperity to the Nation.</head>
               <head type="sub">Nay, if it should turn to Loss, instead of Profit, it would still abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
answer the Expence, in the Consequences; being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
not only of Common Benefit, but (as the Case stands)
of Absolute Necessity, to the Safety, and well-being both of
King and People;</head>
               <p>It is but reason, that <hi>Publique works</hi> should receive <hi>Publike Encouragement;</hi>
and that where both Prince and People are to partake of the Benefit; they
should likewise joyn in the furtherance of the thing. Of such a Quality is
this work. No sickly Project upon a Ramble we know not whither, to hunt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93131:5"/>
for we know not what; but a sober and simple Plot upon a <hi>Treasure</hi> that
lyes at our very Feet: a <hi>Treasure,</hi> of more Value to <hi>Us</hi> then <hi>both the Indies,</hi>
and yet we will not so much as stoop to take it up.</p>
               <p>The Encouragement here intended, is the raising of a Sum of money for a
<hi>Fond,</hi> as a necessary Preparatory toward the perfecting of the work: which
may be done either by <hi>Lone, Contribution,</hi> or <hi>Tax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hitchcock</hi> computes upon <hi>80000. l.</hi> to be furnished by <hi>40. persons out of

<hi>North-Wales</hi> for <hi>another,</hi> (which is no great matter.) And many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
there are; but this poynt may be cut short: for, upon good secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
there will be no difficulty of Procuring Mony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contribution</hi> would be an easy way; &amp; certainly do a great deal in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness;
if the People might but be secured from the fate of their <hi>Last Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
in this kinde, which never came to any thing, and <hi>there is a good part of
it remaining in the Collectors hands to this very day, unaccounted for.</hi> Many
wayes might be found out for their satisfaction, but none perhaps more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
then <hi>Depositing of the stock in the Chamber of London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Generall Tax</hi> would do the Deed at a blow; Nay a <hi>Particular Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
to Introduce it by degrees; (as in case of the <hi>Algier Duty</hi> for the <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of slaves;</hi> the <hi>Cole-Tax, for the Rebuilding</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi>) would sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answer my purpose.</p>
               <p>Monyes being <hi>raysed</hi> and <hi>deposited</hi> toward a <hi>Stock,</hi> we come now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<hi>where,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> to Employ them.</p>
               <p>The first thing to be done may be the Resolving upon so many <hi>staples;</hi> and
then to fall to work upon <hi>Creeks, Wharfs, Docks, Store-houses, Tan-houses,
Work-houses, Granaryes, Brew-houses,</hi> and other Conveniences for the service:
And at the same time, the <hi>Poor</hi> may be set to work upon <hi>Spinning,</hi> making
of <hi>Nets,</hi> and Ropes, and the Like; that the <hi>Fishing Tew,</hi> and <hi>the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,</hi>
may go on hand in hand together.</p>
               <p>By this Method, the designe may be very fairly advanced with a matter
of <hi>Forty or Fifty Thousand pounds,</hi> leaving the Charge of the <hi>Vessells</hi> to come
after, when there shall be Accommodations fit to Entertain and receive
them, The reasons of my proposing it thus by halves, are these; <hi>1st.</hi> There
is no need of buying <hi>Vessells</hi> till we know how to dispose of them, (though
an eye may be had in the <hi>Interim,</hi> to the saving, and setting apart for this
use, of such Ships as may possibly fall in by the By,) 2ly. The <hi>Expence</hi>
will be lighter, and so more easily Compassed. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> (which is the
main point of all) It will be a great Encouragement to a Further supply
toward the Charge of the <hi>Vessells themselves</hi> (which is next to be Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
when the people shall see that we are in Earnest, and half through
the work already.</p>
               <p>The Charge of a <hi>Herring-Busse,</hi> of <hi>80. Tun,</hi> new from the <hi>Stocks,</hi> and
furnished at all points for the <hi>Fishery;</hi> together with <hi>Victualls,</hi> &amp; <hi>Wages</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93131:5"/>
for <hi>one whole Year;</hi> may be rated at <hi>900l.</hi> which being divided into 2 parts.
I make accompt that the <hi>Vessell</hi> her self with her <hi>Cock-Boat, Mastes, Sayle,
Yards, Cables, Anchors,</hi> and other Trim to fit her for the Sea, will make
about one <hi>Moiety:</hi> So that 200 <hi>New Busses, rigg'd</hi> and <hi>fitted</hi> as aforesaid,
will come to about 90000l. (or at second hand perhaps, 30000l.
Cheaper;) which Expense, with ordinary successe, will be Cleared the first
year; and money toward a <hi>stock</hi> over and above. It were better if there were
more, but rather then fail, I would content my self for a Beginning, even
with a fourth part of these: But be they more, or sewer, I would have all
the Vessells advanced upon the <hi>Kings</hi> Accompt; and have the Remaining
Charge of <hi>Netts, Rope, Line, Cask, Salt, Victualls</hi> (and in short, of all <hi>Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Tew,</hi>
aud <hi>Provisions</hi>) to be born upon <hi>Adventure,</hi> according to common
Practise in those cases, for the Ease of his Majesty and the Encouragement of
the People. This will be better understood by a word or two concerning
the Methodes in the menage of the Fishery.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Profit</hi> of a <hi>Herring-Busse</hi> is divided into so many <hi>shares,</hi> whereof
there go about 2 <hi>Thirds</hi> to the <hi>Adventures,</hi> and the <hi>rest</hi> to the <hi>Vessell.</hi> The
<hi>Netts,</hi> and <hi>Fishing-Geare;</hi> the <hi>Master,</hi> and his <hi>Mate,</hi> with the <hi>Saylers,
Fishermen,</hi> and the <hi>vessell</hi> it selfe, are in upon the <hi>Adventure</hi> of <hi>No Purchase,
no Pay.</hi> The <hi>Ships Provisions</hi> of <hi>victuall, Salt</hi> and <hi>Cask,</hi> are furnished up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Adventure</hi> too, with the advantage it may be, of 12 <hi>per Cent</hi> for their
Comodities in <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>twice</hi> as much in times of <hi>war,</hi> above the price of
the <hi>Market,</hi> but with this difference, that this <hi>last adventure</hi> is to be payd
off upon the <hi>Return,</hi> before the <hi>dividend:</hi> without pretending to any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereit
in the profit of the voyage. So that his Majesty shall not need to be one
penny more out of Purse, then for the Vessell; as aforesayd: save only the
<hi>Shipps part</hi> toward the <hi>wages</hi> of 6 or 7 <hi>Land-men;</hi> which is so inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that after two Voyages, they themselves will deal no longer for <hi>wages,</hi>
but serve upon <hi>Adventure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the very Track of the Affayr, and by this method is Retrenched
almost the <hi>one half</hi> of the Present <hi>Charge</hi> of the <hi>Fishery;</hi> the work made ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
and Profitable, in common, both to King, and People.</p>
               <p>The Proportion of <hi>Saylers,</hi> and <hi>Fishers,</hi> for 200 <hi>Busses</hi> will be 1800, or
2000 <hi>men,</hi> which will be supply'd from our Coasts without any difficulty:
and these 200 <hi>Busses</hi> will train up yearly, at least 1200 <hi>Landmen</hi> for <hi>Sea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And then for <hi>Money,</hi> certainly it will never be wanting; when so small
a matter may advance so great a work.</p>
               <p>What were it for the <hi>Clergy</hi> to make his Majesty, a Present of 50. <hi>Busses
in kinde;</hi> and delivered without any further Trouble, into his own Ports?
which undoubtedly they would never stick at.</p>
               <p>A Matter of 50 or 100. <hi>of those Noble Persons, upon Whom his Majesty hath
showred down his Graces, and Bountyes;</hi> what were it for them to furnish as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93131:6"/>
many more (which in pure Honour, and Gratitude, they would never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse?</p>
               <p>The <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> would undoubtedly come in for their <hi>Quota</hi> too; not
only in <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of the <hi>Honours,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> they have received
from the <hi>Crown,</hi> but in pursuance of their <hi>wonted munificence</hi> in favour of all
<hi>Publique undertakings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there remains but 50 <hi>Busses more</hi> to be furnished from the <hi>whole
Nation beside,</hi> to make up the <hi>Number;</hi> which comes to little more, then a
<hi>Vessell</hi> a <hi>Country, one County</hi> with <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This way would carry the businesse through, and leave no Objection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
of any Possibility of <hi>ill-husbanding,</hi> or <hi>misapplying</hi> the <hi>Monyes;</hi> when,
the Respective <hi>Contributers</hi> themselves shall have the manage, and ordering
of their own <hi>Proportions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may suffice for an <hi>Encouragement</hi> to the <hi>Fishery;</hi> and there wants lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
now toward the <hi>Establishment</hi> of it, but the setling, and setting apart, by
Act of Parliament, of a certain <hi>Revenue</hi> for the <hi>Repairing</hi> of <hi>Creeks, Wharfs,
Houses,</hi> and <hi>Vessells,</hi> belonging thereunto; <hi>to be vested in the King, and his
Heirs for ever;</hi> to the ends and purposes aforesaid.</p>
               <p>In persuance of my Assertion, I am now to make good, that the <hi>Fishery</hi>
being duly <hi>Encouraged,</hi> and <hi>Established,</hi> will prove the <hi>Foundation</hi> of an
<hi>Ample,</hi> and <hi>Lasting Revenue</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and of <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> to
the <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the <hi>Kings</hi> providing <hi>Busses,</hi> and the settling of a matter of
<hi>20000l.</hi> a year for <hi>Reparations,</hi> and <hi>Supplies,</hi> in manner as is heretofore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest;
there will accrue to his <hi>Majesty</hi> a <hi>Third part</hi> of the <hi>Profits</hi> of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shery,</hi>
in the Right of the <hi>Vessells;</hi> which, upon a very Reasonable and
hopefull Improvement, will amount to <hi>a Million and a half,</hi> yearly; and
remain to the <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ample,</hi> and <hi>Lasting Revenue;</hi> and which I look upon as a <hi>Treasury,</hi> that
will much more then Answer all <hi>His Majesties Navall Expenses</hi> whatsoever.

               </p>
               <p>And I may very well reckon upon it also, as a <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Wealth,</hi> and
<hi>Prosperity</hi> to the <hi>Nation;</hi> for I cannot Cast my Eye upon any sort or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>People,</hi> that is not the better for it, and the <hi>Community</hi> most of all.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> It will ease this Kingdom at least <hi>300000l. a year,</hi> in the very Tax
to the <hi>Poor,</hi> by Employing all sorts of People, and turning the Great

it is remarkable, that</hi> 10000l. adventure in the Fishery, Employs more people,

               <p>Let it not be Imagin'd that I speak all this <hi>without book,</hi> for I have my
Calculation of the <hi>profit</hi> of it, and <hi>other advantages,</hi> from <hi>Sir Walter Rawleigh,
Sr. John Burrowes,</hi> and many other learned, and Experienced Authors, who
computed the yearly value, at above <hi>ten millions,</hi> when the <hi>Dutch</hi> had
not half the number of Busses which now they have.</p>
               <p>Bur be the profit more or lesse, rather then differ upon that point, <hi>we'l cast all
our Millions into the Sea again,</hi> and yet set up the <hi>Fishery,</hi> though we
should trade to <hi>Losse:</hi> for it seems to me, of so <hi>absolute a Necessity to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that</hi> (humanely speaking) <hi>we cannot well, or long subsist without it.</hi>

<hi>And it is well enough observed, that</hi> All Princes and States, are

As we can do nothing at <hi>Sea</hi> without the <hi>Fishery,</hi> so I am afraid we shall
make as ill shift at <hi>Land,</hi> For we have a <hi>bold Coast,</hi> and for want of people
upon it, to defend it, we ly open to a thousand Mischiefs. The <hi>Fishery</hi>
will relieve us in <hi>This</hi> too; by planting a <hi>Trade</hi> there, which will draw on
<hi>Commerce,</hi> and Consequently <hi>repeople</hi> and strengthen us. If it be asked me,
<hi>how we have done for Seamen all this while?</hi> I answer, that we have done for
<hi>Seamen,</hi> as some people do for <hi>mony;</hi> that have but a Thousand Pound in the
world, and play away five Hundred of it in a Night: we spend upon the
Main stock, and it will never hold out. It has been our <hi>Fishery</hi> (even
poor as it is) that has supported us all this while, and <hi>when That dyes,</hi> a man
may foretell without the help of an Oracle, that the Glory of <hi>England will
not long out-live it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I speak of the <hi>Fishery,</hi> I desire to be understood of the <hi>Fishery</hi> in
<hi>General,</hi> and of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Ling,</hi> as well as <hi>Herring;</hi> which is Esteemed to be
well nigh as Gainful too as the other. There is not any subject perhaps that
has been more Labour'd, and to lesse purpose then this, and the Reason pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
may be, that we have only taken a prospect of the <hi>Pecuniary advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
of it, which we may live without, and given no heed at all to that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of State,</hi> which makes it of <hi>Absolute Necessity</hi> to our <hi>Preservation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Contract all in a word; If any man shall say, that I have <hi>over-rated the
Fishery,</hi> and the Influence it would have upon the prosperity of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
let them reply upon Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> Sir <hi>John Burrowes,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persons of Note, who have study'd the poynt and made a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Value of it.</p>
               <p>Or If I have not sufficiently proved, that it lyes fayrer for <hi>Us,</hi> then for the
<hi>Dutch;</hi> or not fully answered all Materiall Objections to the Contrary, I
shall be Glad to be better Instructed.</p>
               <p>Or (the Profit apart) If we can ever be either <hi>Happy,</hi> or <hi>safe,</hi> without
<hi>Navigation:</hi> Or <hi>Maintain</hi> that <hi>Navigation</hi> without a <hi>Fishery;</hi> and <hi>manage</hi> it
without <hi>Pilots.</hi> If this may be done, I say, <hi>All's well:</hi> But if not; I may then
conclude that the <hi>Fishery is of an Absolute, and Undispensable Necessity, to the
well-being, both of King, and People.</hi>
