            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE LIFE
OF
C. JULIUS CAESAR;
with certain Hiſtoricall Obſervations upon
his Medalls.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He exceſſive Luſtre of a million of gallant atchievements
ſucceſſefully performed by <hi>Caeſar</hi> (the moſt illuſtrious
and celebrated Favourite of Fortune) hath through all
ages ſo dazzled the greateſt part of Mankind, eſpecially
thoſe, both ancient and modern, who made it their
buſineſſe to deſcribe the great tranſactions either of their
own, or former ages; that they have not onely parallell'd
him with the greateſt Heroes of the firſt ages, but have
ballanc'd him with <hi>Alexander,</hi> the moſt generous and the moſt grlorious of
all Monarchs. Nay in their account <hi>Caeſar</hi> farre outweighs him, ſince that
all that may be call'd great or illuſtrious, either as to <hi>Vertue, Valour,</hi> true
<hi>Magnanimity,</hi> or <hi>Clemency,</hi> is more conſpicuous in him then in all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Emperours, who after him ſate at the helm of that Monarchy. Thoſe
who made difficulty to aſſign him the firſt place among the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
conſidered not certainly that the deſignation of a building is the
Maſter-piece of the Architect, and that ſuperſtruction may require no emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of perfection. For having conſummated thoſe innumerable Trophees
he had erected among the <hi>Galls</hi> by thoſe about <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> he laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of that eternall fame the world hath deſervedly honoured him with
ſince: nay, to that height of adoration had he rais'd the minds of Poſterity,
that his very Succeſſours thought it their greateſt glory to wear the livery of
his Name, and after him to be called <hi>Caeſars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To offer at a perfect anatomy of this great man's actions, were to quote moſt
Authours and writers that have been, and conſequently a work of too long
a breath. It ſhall therefore ſuffice to trace him out in thoſe great deſignes
whereby he laid the foundations of the <hi>Roman</hi> greatneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing worthy, not onely notice, but admiration, is the ſtrange
judgement of <hi>Sylla</hi> of him: who reflecting on the great perfections of <hi>Caeſar</hi>
when yet a youth, and the ſtrange vivacity and conduct of his firſt actions,
<pb facs="tcp:51174:8"/>
made that inhumane propoſition that he might be killed, as he had
caus'd divers of the Kinred and party of <hi>Marius,</hi> who had married <hi>Iulia</hi>
an Aunt of <hi>Caeſar's</hi> by the mother ſide. Nor doth Envy want pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
ſince as he conjectur'd, one <hi>Caeſar</hi> contain'd many <hi>Marius's,</hi>
and ſhould, if ſuffer'd to live; prove the <hi>Viper</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
But this may be eaſily paſſed by, ſince that they are indeed the greateſt
actions that muſt expect Cenſure. But it muſt in the mean time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
a ſtrange tranſcendency of courage and confidence, to think to
conquer that people who had conquer'd the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> it muſt be the
effect of an ambition more then humane, for this is commonly fetter'd
to probabilities. The Emperour <hi>Iulian,</hi> though he hath made it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to ſatyrize againſt his predeceſſors, yet having to do with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he
by a ſtrange fiction diſcovers the greatneſſe of his deſignations. <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
ſayes he, a perſon of a gallant and gracefull preſence, being entered the
place, where <hi>Romulus</hi> was to entertain the <hi>Gods,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours at
the <hi>Saturnalian</hi> feaſts, came in with ſuch an inſolent deportment, that the
Gods were of opinion, he was not come thither unleſſe it were to manage
ſome ambitious plots againſt the Majeſty of Heaven, whereof <hi>Iupiter</hi> being
very jealous, he was thruſt by, till at laſt <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> made him place.
The ingenuity of this <hi>Satyriſt</hi> amounts onely to thus much, to paint ever
that great <hi>Vertue,</hi> that great indulgence of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of an inſatiable ambition, which had not this Cenſor been exceſſively
guilty of, might have prov'd ſomewhat.</p>
                  <p>But the endowments of <hi>Nature,</hi> the conſtant <hi>preſence</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and
the ſurprizing <hi>Glory</hi> conſequentiall to his Actions, were the Genius's that
rais'd him to ſuch high adventures, as the ſudden change of the <hi>Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi>
State of <hi>Rome</hi> into a <hi>Monarchicall,</hi> to pretend a title to the great
acqueſts of a valorous people for 700. yeares, and to aſſume to himſelf an
Empire far greater then the <hi>Aſſyrian, Perſian,</hi> or <hi>Macedonian,</hi> both in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of time greatneſſe and power. For not to deſcend to the acquiſitions
of the later Emperours, we ſhall onely take a view of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
as it ſtood, before <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſeiz'd the raines of Government. In <hi>Europe</hi> they
were Maſters of all <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gallia Ciſalphina,</hi> or <hi>Lombardy, Auſtria,</hi> and
<hi>Illiricum</hi> now call'd <hi>Slavonia,</hi> reaching as farre as <hi>Danubius;</hi> They had
reduc'd all <hi>Greece,</hi> the States of <hi>Athens, Lacedemonia, Thebes, Corinth,</hi>
and all <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> now call'd <hi>Morea; Macedon,</hi> and <hi>Epire</hi> now call'd
<hi>Albania,</hi> and <hi>Thrace.</hi> They had the Iſlands of <hi>Sicily, Sardynia, Creeta,
Candia, Cypres, Rhodes,</hi> and <hi>Negrepont,</hi> and divers others in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi>
Sea. They had taken in all <hi>Spain,</hi> and (which was <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s own
work) all <hi>France</hi> that part of <hi>Germany</hi> lying on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> call'd <hi>Gallia Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gica,</hi>
and great <hi>Britain.</hi> They were Maſters of all <hi>Africk,</hi> (the third part of
the world then) even to pull down the pride of <hi>Carthage.</hi> The beſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Aſia</hi> were Tributaries, as <hi>Syria, Phoenicia, Paleſtina, Iudaea, Phrygia,
Caria Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Bithynia. Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia</hi> were confederates. In
<hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Colchos</hi> they had forces. <hi>Albania Iberia</hi> and ſome other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
paid Contributions and did homage. In fine they were ſo great that they
<pb facs="tcp:51174:8"/>
were unconquerable unleſſe by their own ſtrength, that ſo they might have
this ſatisfaction and glory in their conqueſt, that they triumph'd over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſy to attribute to ambition and diſcord what is the deſign of Fate.
Greatneſſe muſt expect a period, and to be ſucceſſefull preſumes a happy
conjuncture of men and affaires. Some differences there were between
<hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> (the moſt eminent and the moſt powerfull in <hi>Rome)</hi>
rak'd up in the embers of the civile warre between <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi>
wherein the later being ſlain, the other made himſelf <hi>Dictator,</hi> and ſeiz'd
<hi>Rome,</hi> but quitted both before his death. <hi>Pompey</hi> had ſided with <hi>Sylla, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
with <hi>Marius,</hi> as being his Kinſman. But to aſcend a little higher in theſe
Broiles, we are to note that <hi>Sylla</hi> having diſpower'd himſelf, <hi>Pompey</hi> and
<hi>Craſſus</hi> came into repute. The later was the more recommended by his
wiſdome, eloquence, Nobility and exceſſive riches; the other had gain'd
the popular eſteem by his Victories and great actions in warre, even in
<hi>Sylla</hi>'s time. While the differences of theſe two encreas'd with their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> returns to <hi>Rome</hi> from his Praetorſhip in <hi>Spain,</hi> bringing that
reputation with him, that ſwell'd the greatneſſe and ambition of his
thoughts. He had gone through moſt charges Civile and Military; he had
been <hi>Quaeſtor, Tribune</hi> of the Souldiers, <hi>Aedile, High-prieſt</hi> and <hi>Praetor.</hi>
All which, with other accompliſhments he was furniſh'd with, which we
ſhall mention elſewhere, though they brought him into much eſteem, yet
was he not yet arriv'd to near the Authority and reputation of either <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
or <hi>Pompey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar,</hi> though he were come to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet ſtifled all thoughts of aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for a while: ſo that both <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> apply'd themſelves to
him, hoping by his acceſſion to ruine one the other. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
both, and carried himſelf with circumſpection, that he endeavour'd
to reconcile them, ſo hoping by his new trality to undermine them both,
which was, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayes, obſerv'd onely by <hi>Cato.</hi> At length he ſo
order'd things, that he made an agreement between them, and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
both; which caus'd that, retaining ſome jealouſies of each other,
they equally courted <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s friendſhip, by which means he became equall
to either: ſo that the power which before was between two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
now tripartite. Things being thus appeas'd, <hi>Caeſar</hi> demands the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip:
which obtain'd, he carried himſelf in it with that reputation, that
his Co-Conſul <hi>Bibulus</hi> left all to his managery. To maintain the authority
he had got, he himſelf took to wife <hi>Calpurnia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Lucius Piſo,</hi>
who was to ſucceed him in the Conſulate, and beſtowes his own
Daughter <hi>Iulia</hi> on <hi>Pompey;</hi> and ſo taking in <hi>Craſſus,</hi> they make a League,
and being equally ambitious conſpire to invade the Common-wealth. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
chuſes for his Province the <hi>Galls,</hi> or <hi>France; Craſſus, Aſia; Pompey,
Spain;</hi> whither they went with three puiſſant Armies, as if the world had
been to be trichotomiz'd among theſe three. What <hi>Caeſar</hi> did in his
Province, what Battels he fought, what people he ſubdued, what
<pb facs="tcp:51174:9"/>
valour, policy, ſucceſſe follow'd him every where, may be ſeen in his own
<hi>Commentaries</hi> of that war, approv'd by his very enemies as modeſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall,
and atteſted by <hi>Cicero, Plutarch, Suetonius, Appianus Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,
Lucan, Paulus Oroſius, Florus, Eutropius;</hi> too great a teſtimony againſt
one cenſorious <hi>Aſinius Pollio.</hi> By this war <hi>Caeſar</hi> got the reputation of
the greateſt Captain that ever was, ſubduing all <hi>France</hi> from the <hi>Pyrenean</hi>
hills to the <hi>Alps,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Rhene.</hi> But to forbear particular inſtances,
as that he conquer'd the <hi>Suiſſers</hi> and <hi>Tigurins</hi> (who were according to
<hi>Plutarch 300000.</hi> men, whereof 19000. were well diſciplin'd) this is moſt
worth our remark, that during theſe ſo great warres, he omitted not, both
by intelligence and preſents, to endear his friends both at <hi>Rome</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
doing many things without the Senate's leave, upon the ſcore of
the League with <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus.</hi> Nay, his courting of all ſorts of people,
both Souldier and Citizen, was none of his leaſt maſter-pieces, by which
means he had ſupplanted <hi>Pompey</hi> in matter of eſteem, before he perceiv'd
it. To this purpoſe hath <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerved, <hi>Lib. 33. cap. 3.</hi> that in the time
of his <hi>Aedility,</hi> that is to ſay his <hi>Shrievedome,</hi> he was ſo prodigall, that all
the <hi>Vtenſills</hi> and armes that he made uſe of at publick ſports and combats,
were all of ſilver, which yet afterwards were beſtow'd among the people;
and that he was the firſt that ever brought forth the beaſts in chariots and
cages of ſilver. This it was made ſome ſuſpect him guilty of rapine, and that
he plunder'd Temples and Cities <hi>ſaepius ob praedam quam ob delictum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this reputation of <hi>Caeſar</hi> begat jealouſy in <hi>Pompey,</hi> which (the tye
of their correſpondence being loos'd by the death of <hi>Iulia)</hi> was eaſily ſeen
to break forth into a flame, eſpecially now that <hi>Craſſus,</hi> the third man,
was together with divers ſtout <hi>Roman</hi> Legions buried with infamy in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia.</hi>
Thus the foundations of Friendſhip and Alliance in great ones being
once taken away, the ſuperſtructures fall down immediately. Nothing
could decide the emulation of two ſo great perſons, as <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
(the one defying ſuperiority, the other equality) but as great a war. It could
not but be univerſall, when Senate, Armies, Kingdomes, Cities, Allies,
all were ſome way or other embarqu'd in the quarrell. There was on one
ſide 11. Legions, on the other 18. The ſeat of the warre was <hi>Italy,
France, Epirus, Theſſaly, Aegypt, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africk;</hi> through all which after
it had ravag'd 5. yeares, the controverſy was decided in <hi>Spain.</hi> That Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
(the imperfection onely of the greateſt minds) might have been the
occaſion of ſo inveterate a warre, hath been the opinion of divers others,
who charge not <hi>Pompey</hi> with ſo great diſcoveries of it as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to whom
they aſſign a greater then the Empire; as if their mutuall diſtruſt and jealouſy
of one another, ſhould be able to cauſe ſo many tragedies through ſo many
Countries. Beſides <hi>Caeſar</hi> had his Enemies at <hi>Rome,</hi> and among others
<hi>Cato,</hi> who threatned to impeach him when he was once out of command.
What bandying there was againſt him, we find ſomewhat in the later end
of the eighth Commentary, to this purpoſe. <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> both
of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Faction, being Conſuls, it is mov'd in the Senate, that <hi>Caeſar</hi>
might be call'd home, and another ſent to ſupply his command of the Army
<pb facs="tcp:51174:9"/>
then in <hi>Gallia;</hi> ſince that he, having written for the Conſulſhip, ſhould
according to Law have been perſonally in <hi>Rome. Caeſar</hi> demands to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in Commiſſion and Government, and that he might demand the
Conſulſhip abſent. This <hi>Pompey</hi> oppoſes, though he himſelf as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Law, had had the Conſulſhip and other dignities before he was at
full Age.</p>
                  <p>This deny'd, <hi>Caeſar</hi> propoſes, that he would come to <hi>Rome</hi> as a private
man, and give over his command, ſo that <hi>Pompey</hi> quitted his employment in
<hi>Spain.</hi> About this the <hi>Senate</hi> was much divided. <hi>Cicero</hi> propoſes a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but <hi>Pompey's</hi> party prevailing, it was decreed that <hi>Caeſar ſhould by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
time quit his command, and ſhould not paſſe his Army over the River</hi>
Rubicon, <hi>which bounded his Province; declaring him an enemy to the</hi> Roman
<hi>State in caſe of refuſall. C. Curio</hi> and <hi>M. Antonius</hi> the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the
people, out of their affection to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> endeavouring to oppoſe this decree,
were thruſt diſgracefully out of the Senate, which occaſion'd them to repair
to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> whereby they endear'd the affections of the Souldiery to him, the
office of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> being ever held ſacred and unviolable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> underſtanding how things ſtood at <hi>Rome,</hi> marches with 5000. foot
and 300. Horſe to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> having commanded the Legions to follow.
Coming to the fatall paſſage of <hi>Rubicon,</hi> he entered into a deep delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
conſidering the importance, and miſeries that might enſue that paſſage.
At laſt in the midſt of his anxiety, he was animated to a proſecution of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
by the apparition of a man of an extraordinary ſtature and ſhape, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
near unto his army, piping upon a reed. The Souldiers went down
to the River ſide to heare him, and approach'd ſo near, that he caught one
of their trumpets, and leaping into the River, began with a mighty blaſt
to ſound, and ſo went to the bank of the other ſide. This reſolves <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
who cry'd out, Let us go whither the Gods, and the injurious dealings of our
enemies call us. With which he ſet ſpurs to his horſe, and paſt the River,
the army following. Who would be more particularly inform'd, may be
ſatisfi'd out of <hi>Appianus Alexandrinus, Suetonius, Plutarch,</hi> in the lives
of <hi>Caeſar, Cato,</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine l. 3. de c. d. Caeſar</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
Florus, Livy, Paulus Oroſius, Eutropius, Lucan, Pliny de viris il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtribus,
Valerius Maximus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Having paſs'd the River, and drawn the Army together, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> came
to him in thoſe diſhonourable garments wherein they had fled from <hi>Rome.</hi>
Whereupon he made an excellent oration to the Souldiery, opening to them
his cauſe: which was anſwer'd with generall acclamations, and promiſes of
duty and obedience to all commands.</p>
                  <p>This done he ſeizes <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and divers other Towns and Caſtles as
he paſt, till he came to <hi>Corfinium:</hi> where <hi>Domitius,</hi> who was to ſucceed
him in his command, was garriſon'd with 30. Cohorts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar's</hi> advance and intentions aſtoniſhed <hi>Rome,</hi> Senate and people; nay,
ſo ſurpriz'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> that he could not believe <hi>Caeſar</hi> would thruſt himſelf
into ſo much danger, or that his forces were ſo conſiderable. But though
<hi>Pompey</hi> was impower'd by the Senate to levy forces, recall the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
<pb facs="tcp:51174:10"/>
and provide for the defence of <hi>Italy,</hi> yet all could make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> The rumour of his advance ſpreading, <hi>Pompey</hi> and
the Senate leave <hi>Rome,</hi> and repair to <hi>Capua,</hi> from thence to <hi>Brundu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium;</hi>
from whence the Conſuls were diſpatch'd to <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> to unite
what forces they could, ſince they deſpair'd of reſiſting <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> who
hearing the Conſuls and <hi>Pompey</hi> were at <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> march'd thither,
and having inveſted the Town, <hi>Pompey</hi> in the night time embarques for
<hi>Dyrrhachium,</hi> where the Conſul expected him: ſo that <hi>Caeſar</hi> became
abſolute Maſter of <hi>Italy.</hi> Having not ſhipping to purſue him, he reſolv'd
for <hi>Spain,</hi> which held for <hi>Pompey,</hi> where his beſt Legions were, and two
Captains, <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afranius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Returning from <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> he in 60. dayes maſter'd all <hi>Italy</hi> without
any bloudſhed, and coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> the memory of the devaſtations
of <hi>Sylla's</hi> dayes frightned the people extreamly. But <hi>Caeſar's</hi> clemency,
and his attributing the cauſe of all the diſtractions to <hi>Pompey,</hi> quieted all
things. He ſo far juſtifi'd his own Cauſe, that he mov'd that Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
might be ſent to <hi>Pompey</hi> for peace, and cauſing himſelf to be choſen
Conſul, he opened the <hi>Roman</hi> Treaſury, and made a divided of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Souldiery. This done, he provides for <hi>Spain,</hi> having taken
care for the civile as well as military government. <hi>Brunduſium, Otranto,</hi>
and other maritime places he fortifies againſt <hi>Pompey's</hi> entring into <hi>Italy,</hi>
in caſe he ſhould attempt it. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> and <hi>Dolabella</hi> were to provide
ſhipping for him at <hi>Brunduſium</hi> againſt his return. <hi>Quintus Valerius</hi>
he ſends with a Legion into <hi>Sardinia</hi> againſt <hi>Marcus Cotta,</hi> who held it
for <hi>Pompey.</hi> To <hi>Sicily</hi> he ſends <hi>Curius</hi> againſt <hi>Marcus Cato:</hi> which
when he had taken in, he was to march into <hi>Africk.</hi> He leaves <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
to govern at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi> for all <hi>Italy.</hi> Thus intending to
leave <hi>Licinius Craſſus</hi> in <hi>France</hi> he with his wonted celerity went on his
journey, meeting with no reſiſtance, but at <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> which leaving
<hi>D. Brutus,</hi> and <hi>C. Trebonius</hi> with ſufficient forces to beſiege, he went
forward towards <hi>Spain,</hi> where he was expected by <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afranius:</hi>
with whom, though he met with the inconveniences of the Winter and
high Rivers, he had divers skirmiſhes; yet at length he carried his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſo, that the enemies were forc'd by hunger to a compoſition, the
Legions and Captains, ſuch as would not remaine with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> having leave
to depart whither they pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>The ſpring now coming on, (to leave nothing unſubdu'd) he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
into <hi>Baetica,</hi> now called <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> where quarter'd <hi>Marcus Varro,</hi>
with one Legion of Souldiers, as <hi>Pompey's</hi> Lieutenant; who, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
himſelf unable to make oppoſition, reſign'd both the Country
and Legion to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whereby all was quieted.</p>
                  <p>Thence he marched to <hi>Cordova,</hi> where aſſembling the eſtates of the
Provinces, he acknowledg'd their affection and devoirs, and ſo went to
<hi>Cales;</hi> where he took ſuch ſhips and Gallies as <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> had there,
with what others he could get, and embarqued. Having left <hi>Q. Caſsius</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51174:10"/>
which four Legions in that Province he marches to <hi>Narbona</hi> and ſo to
<hi>Marſeilles,</hi> which having ſuffer'd great miſeries during the ſiege, at
length, ſurrendred, yet he protected it from any violence, preferring the
conſideration of the antiquity of the place, before the affronts he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from it, and ſo having ſufficiently garriſon'd it, he marches into <hi>Italy</hi>
and ſo to <hi>Rome,</hi> all things ſucceeding Proſperouſly to him, though not
ſo to his Captains. For <hi>Antonius</hi> (who was joint Generall at ſea with <hi>Dola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella)</hi>
was over thrown and taken Priſoner by <hi>Octavius, Pompey</hi>'s Lieutenant,
in the gulfe <hi>Venice</hi> and that by a ſtrange ſtratagem. <hi>Antonius</hi> being forc'd
for want of ſhips to put his men into long boates, the <hi>Pompeians</hi> ty'd ropes
under the water, by which means one of them which carried a thouſand
<hi>Opitergins,</hi> ſtout young men, was ſurpriz'd and aſſaulted by the whole
Army, yet making reſiſtance from morning till night, they at laſt ſeeing all
their forts ineffectuall did by the inſtigation of their Commander <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teius,</hi>
kill one another. <hi>Dolabella</hi> was alſo overcome, as alſo <hi>Curius,</hi> who
was ordered to go into <hi>Africa,</hi> was overthrown by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s friend <hi>Iuba,</hi> King
of <hi>Mauritania.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While <hi>Caeſar</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> buſy in cauſing himſelf to be made <hi>Dictator,</hi>
and then putting off that Conſull, that ſo he might ſend Praetors into the
Provinces, as <hi>Marcus Lepidus</hi> into Spain, <hi>A. Albinus</hi> into <hi>Sicily, Sextus
Peduceius</hi> into <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Decius Brutus</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and taking ſuch
further order as he thought fit; <hi>Pompey</hi> was as buſy in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> raiſing
of men and mony and providing ſhips in order to his return into <hi>Italy.</hi>
What his forces might amount unto, may be judg'd from the almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
aſſiſtances came in to him from divers Kingdomes and Provinces
of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> from <hi>Syria, Pontus, Bithynia, Cilicia, Phoenicia, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,
Pamphilia, Armenia the leſſe, Aegypt, Greece, Theſſaly,
Boeotia, Achaia, Epire, Athens, Lacedaemonia,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Creta</hi> and <hi>Rhodes</hi>
and divers other places, there coming to his aſſiſtance in perſon the
Kings <hi>Deiotarus</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes.</hi> Theſe certainly, with thoſe he had
brought with him out of <hi>Italy,</hi> muſt needs make up a vaſt Army by
land, nor could the number of ſhips and Gallyes but be proportionable.
However <hi>Caeſar</hi> knowing all this, leaves <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> and ſo marches
to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> whence he was to embarque for <hi>Macedonia,</hi> out of this
conſideration, that his Victory conſiſted in expedition, though <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
in the mean time upon intelligence of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome,</hi> had
ſcattered his people into <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> conceiving the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of the winter would have deferr'd him from croſſing the Seas.
But <hi>Caeſar</hi> being come to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> (now call'd <hi>Brindez,)</hi> he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barques
ſeven Legions of his choiceſt men in the beginning of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
order to thoſe that were coming to make haſt and joine with thoſe
which remained behind, all whom he would ſpeedily ſend for.</p>
                  <p>Three dayes after he arrives upon the coaſt of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> before <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
had ſo much as heard of his embarquing, and lands in Spite of
<hi>Pompeys</hi> Captains, and preſently commands the ſhips to returne for
the remainder of his Army, which done he takes it by ſtorm
<pb facs="tcp:51174:11"/>
                     <hi>Apollonia,</hi> (now call'd <hi>Bellona)</hi> and <hi>Oricum,</hi> two Cities kept by <hi>L. Torquatus</hi>
and <hi>L. Straberius,</hi> for <hi>Pompey;</hi> who alarm'd by this, ſends for ſuch troups
as were neareſt, and marches to <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> where all his Ammunition and
Proviſion lay, to ſecure it from being ſurpriz'd by <hi>Caeſar:</hi> which indeed he
had attempted, but, by reaſon of the naturall ſtrength of the place, to no
purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pompey</hi> being come, both Armies lodg'd not many furlongs from one
another, onely they were divided by a River. Which poſt as it gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of divers skirmiſhes, ſo it begat many overtures of Peace from <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;</hi>
which <hi>Pompey,</hi> preſuming upon his ſtrength, would not hear of. This
propoſition of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, though it proceeded from his meekneſſe, which
was not the leaſt of his vertues; yet argu'd ſome conſcience of his own
weakneſſe at this time. For he was extreamly perplex'd, that the other
part of his Army was not come, in ſo much that he embarqued in a <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine</hi>
diſguized to fetch them. Having paſs'd down the River, the ſea was
ſo tempeſtuous, that the maſter of the veſſell would not adventure out: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
as it is ſaid, <hi>Caeſar</hi> diſcovered himſelf, and ſaid to him, <hi>Friend, thou
carrieſt Caeſar and his fortune.</hi> Whereat the maſter being encourag'd, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
out into the ſea, but the Tempeſt was ſo violent, that it brought <hi>Caeſar</hi>
back again. This action of his was like to have rais'd a mutiny in his Army,
as a thing which though it ſpoke courage, yet was a ſtranger to diſcretion:
which it may be is the reaſon that <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath made no mention of it in his
Commentaries.</p>
                  <p>But ſome few dayes after <hi>Antonius</hi> arrives with four Legions of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
part of the Army, and ſends back the ſhips for the reſt. Theſe
joyning with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> there paſt divers skirmiſhes and pickeerings (being ſo
nearly lodg'd) between both Armies: but that which was moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
was near the City of <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> wherein <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Troups were ſo rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that no threats or entreaties could ſtay them from running to their
Camp; which though fortifi'd, yet was abandon'd by ſome. <hi>Pompey</hi> in the
mean time, either out of fear that the ſlight might be feigned, and in order to
ſome ambuſh, or that he thought <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſufficiently conquer'd, doth not
proſecute the victory. Which weakneſſe in him <hi>Caeſar</hi> diſſembled not, when
afterwards he ſaid to his men, that <hi>that day had ended the war, if the enemy
had had a Captain that knew how to overcome.</hi> But <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as no Proſperity
diſorder'd him, ſo in Adverſity he had a courage and ſuch a confidence of
Fortune that he was nothing caſt down. He loſt in that engagement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Common-Souldiery, 400 <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, 10 Tribunes, and 32
Centurions, with as many Colours. This ſucceſſe obtained, <hi>Pompey</hi> ſends
the news of it into all parts of the world, ſo advantageouſly to himſelf, as
if <hi>Caeſar</hi> were utterly routed; who though he did not decline fighting, yet
thought it not policy to engage his men lately worſted (though indeed exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperated
with ſhame and indignation at their loſſe) with thoſe that were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
and fleſh'd with a victory. He therefore diſpoſes his maimed men
into <hi>Apollonia,</hi> and in the night takes his way towards <hi>Theſſaly:</hi> both to
hearten and refreſh his Army, as alſo to draw the enemy further from the
<pb facs="tcp:51174:11"/>
Sea-coaſt, where his main force and all his proviſions lay; or at leaſt to
meet with <hi>Scipio,</hi> who, he had intelligence, was to join with <hi>Pompey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This unexpected departure of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s brought <hi>Pompey</hi> almoſt to a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to return into <hi>Italy,</hi> to recover that, with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to meet with <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But the <hi>Roman</hi> Lords that were about him (a
ſort of proud, inſolent, indiſciplinable people, who indeed prov'd his
ruine) diſſwaded him, and cauſed him to alter his deſign: and ſo he fell upon
the hot purſuit of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who, making a ſtay in the fields of <hi>Pharſalia</hi> till
that his men had reaſſumed their courage and reſolution, was now willing
and eager to fight. But <hi>Pompey</hi> perceiving this readineſs of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to proceed
from want of Proviſion, and a fear his Army ſhould diminiſh, purpoſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
fighting, and would have prolong'd the warre, and ſo have defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his enemy without hazzarding his own Army. But the murmurings, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinyes,
and importunity of thoſe that were about him had ſuch a prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
influence over him (as <hi>Plutarch, Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth)
that they forced him contrary to his intentions and policy, to give
Battell; which was ſuch, that all the flower and force of <hi>Rome</hi> was engaged
in it. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army (according to the computation of moſt writers) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to half <hi>Pompey</hi>'s: but in compenſation, his men were more active,
and verſed in warre, and knew their advantages; whereas the other's was
a tumultuary ſort of people raked together, (beſides what <hi>Romans</hi> he had.)
The exact number of both theſe Armies is not agreed on by Authors: ſome
raiſe them to 300000. of which opinion was <hi>Florus;</hi> others bring them down
to 70000. But if we agree with <hi>Appianus,</hi> we muſt conceive, that ſo
many countries and nations having ſent in their aſſiſtances on either ſide,
there muſt needs be vaſt Armies on both ſides: and therefore thoſe who
pitched upon the leſſer number, meant onely the number of <hi>Romans,</hi> who
were the maine force and hope of both Generalls. But here we may make
a ſtrange remark upon the uncertain events of warre. We have two of the
greateſt Captains that ever were, the ſtouteſt Armies that ever met, ſuch as
experience, force, and valour was equally divided between, and, to be
ſhort, the moſt exaſperated parties that could be, and yet it proved but a very
ſhort ſight: ſo weak is the confidence and aſſurance that is onely placed in
number. We may further note the ſtrange influence of Religion upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in general, in that it enforces man in the greateſt exigencies to conſultation:
for <hi>Pompey</hi> met with divers things that might ſomewhat have informed him
of the ſucceſſe of that famous Battel; The running away of the beaſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined
for Sacrifice, the ſwarming of bees, the sky darkned, and his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
dream of being in mourning in the Theatre, ſeconded by his appearance
in the head of his main Battel the next day in a black robe, which might ſignifie
he mourned for the liberty of <hi>Rome</hi> beforehand.</p>
                  <p>Being both reſolved to give Battel, they put their Armies in ſuch order as
they thought fit, and harangued their Souldiers according to their ſeverall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
In the beginning, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s horſe, conſiſting moſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Gentry
and Nobility, prevailed over <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, and made them give ground: which he
perceiving, cauſes a Battalion, ſet apart for that purpoſe, to charge them;
<pb facs="tcp:51174:12"/>
with order to aime altogether at the face: which <hi>Pompey's</hi> horſe not able,
or not willing to endure, began to retreat, and ſo made way for the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
overthrow; by which means the foot being diſcourag'd, and ſeeing <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s
horſe falling on, the Victory was ſoon decided on <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſide, <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
flying to his camp, and leaving the field to his adverſary. Here was the
greateſt misfortune of <hi>Pompey,</hi> to out-live the Liberty of his Country (which
he pretended ſo much to fight for) and his own glory in this Battell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forc'd to a diſhonourable flight, and to deliberate whither he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
whether into <hi>Parthia, Africk,</hi> or <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> being thus Maſter of the field, and meeting with no oppoſition,
falls upon <hi>Pompey</hi>'s camp, which, without any great difficulty, he entered.
Whereupon <hi>Pompey</hi> diſguizing himſelf, takes up the firſt horſe he met, and
with four more (his own Son <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> the two <hi>Lentuli,</hi> and <hi>Favonius)</hi>
makes his eſcape, and ſtayes not till he came to <hi>Lariſſa:</hi> where meeting with
ſome of his own horſe, who were in the ſame condition of running away, he
continued his flight till he came to the ſhore of the <hi>Aegaean</hi> Sea; where meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accidentally with a certain Merchants ſhip of <hi>Rome,</hi> he embarques himſelf in
her, and ſailes to <hi>Mitylene,</hi> where his wife and family were. Having taken
them with him, and got together what men and ſhips a ſhatter'd fortune could
furniſh him with, he departed thence in very great doubt and perplexity, not
able to reſolve whither to diſpoſe of himſelf. He was advis'd by ſome to
march into <hi>Africa,</hi> and ſhelter himſelf with <hi>Iuba,</hi> whoſe friendſhip and
affection towards him he had receiv'd teſtimony of but very lately; others
were of opinion, his beſt courſe was to retire among the <hi>Parthians:</hi> but at
laſt, by his own wilfulneſſe, it was voted he ſhould go into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> which he
was the more inclin'd to, out of a conſideration of the friendſhip and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
which he had had with King <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> father to him who then
reign'd: and ſo touching at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he ſailes towards <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and arrives at
<hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was the controverſy for no leſſe then the known world decided in
one day, <hi>Caeſar</hi> being Maſter of the field and Victory. Of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſide there
were ſlain fifteen thouſand, if you will take it upon <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s credit, and of his
own not two thouſand. <hi>Caeſar</hi> having intelligence of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s flight, purſues
him without any ſtay with the ſwifteſt and lighteſt of his Army, ſo to give him
as little breath as he could afford, that he might not meet with any means or
opportunity to recover or repair himſelf. Reducing all Cities as he paſſed,
he comes to the Sea ſide, and taking up all the ſhips and gallies he could meet
with, and ſuch as <hi>Caſsius</hi> (who was receiv'd into his favour) could furniſh him
with, he embarques ſuch troups as he could, and paſſed into <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe:
where underſtanding that <hi>Pompey</hi> had been at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he eaſily preſumed that
he was gone for <hi>Aegypt.</hi> He thereupon reſolves to take the ſame courſe, and
taking with him onely two Legions of his old Souldiers, he ſafely arrives at
<hi>Alexandria:</hi> where he ſoon underſtood that <hi>Pompey</hi> was arrived, upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
(as was ſaid before) there might have remain'd ſome ſenſe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
in young <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> of the entertainment and favours he had done his
Father. But he was as much miſtaken in this, as he had been eluded by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb facs="tcp:51174:12"/>
in the warre: for he finds that the friendſhip of great men and Princes
ſeldome outlives their proſperity, and that adverſity makes them the greateſt
ſtrangers that may be. Being by this King <hi>Ptolemey</hi> invited into Protection,
and upon that confidence coming towards the ſhore in a ſmall Boat, he was,
ere he could reach the land, murdered, by the ſame Kings commandment,
by <hi>Septimius</hi> and <hi>Achillas,</hi> who thought by that means to purchaſe <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
favour. This was done by the contrivance of <hi>Photinus</hi> an Eunuch, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
both with King and Court was very great. <hi>Caeſar</hi> receives alſo news,
that <hi>Cornelia, Pompey</hi>'s wife, and his Son <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> were fled from that
port in the ſame veſſell wherein they came. Being landed and received into
the City, he was ſoon preſented with the head of the great <hi>Pompey;</hi> which out
of a conſideration of the horridneſſe of the fact, he would not by any means
ſee. His Ring alſo and his Seal, with his Coat of Armes upon it, were preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him: which cauſing him to reflect on the great ſucceſſes, adventures and
proſperities of that great and glorious man (beſides that he was to look on
him as his Son in Law) it drew teares from him, to compare them with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
end. Thus is he who had three times triumph'd, been ſo many times
Conſul, been the moſt eminent and the moſt concerned perſon that <hi>Rome</hi> had
for ſo many yeares together, one who had been acquainted with all the dignities
ſo great a Common-wealth could conferre upon a deſerving Citizen, moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely
and perfidiouſly aſſaſſinated, to the greateſt regret of him who was
look'd on as moſt deſirous of it. This in the mean time concludes that opinion
erroneous, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſo extremely over-joy'd at the newes of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
death, that he caus'd upon that very place where he had ordered his head to be
interr'd, a Temple to be built to the Goddeſſe <hi>Nemeſis;</hi> which ſome interpret a
moſt unnaturall revengefulneſſe, a horrid inſultation over a clamitous vertue,
and a prophanation of divine worſhip, to abuſe the name of a Goddeſſe for to
immortalize the memory of his vengeance, and to authorize the injuſtice of it.
But it is as eaſy to give the title of barbariſme and cruelty to magnanimity
and height of courage, as to ſay the contrary: and therefore <hi>Caeſar</hi> certainly
could not be guilty of ſo great an Hypocriſy, as to ſhed teares over his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
head, when he was inwardly ſurpriz'd with joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon his arrivall into <hi>Aegypt</hi> findes it embroil'd in civile warres,
ariſing from ſome differences between young <hi>Ptolemey</hi> and his ſiſter <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
about the diviſion and inheritance of the Kingdome, wherein <hi>Caeſar</hi> (as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
of <hi>Rome)</hi> thought ſit to be a mediator. <hi>Photinus</hi> and <hi>Achillas,</hi> the plotters
and practicers of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s death, fearing from <hi>Caeſar</hi> a reward of vengeance
proportion'd to ſo horrid a crime, and perceiving his inclination to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> take ſuch order, by their great influence over King and
Court, that they brought what Army the King had near the City, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of about 20000. able men: and this they did out of a deſign to entrap
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> and act the ſame perfidious butchery upon him, as they had done
upon <hi>Pompey.</hi> By this means there began between what forces <hi>Caeſar</hi> had
brought with him, and thoſe of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> within and about the City,
as alſo between the ſhips and gallies in harbour, the hoteſt diſputes and
ſharpeſt encounters he ever met with: which we ſhall not particularize here,
<pb facs="tcp:51174:13"/>
becauſe it is the proper work of a compleat hiſtory. One thing our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cannot balk in theſe hot and occaſionall engagements, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf
was perſonally engag'd in moſt diſputes, both within the City, and among
the ſhips, and that to the great hazzard of his perſon; as may appear by that
one adventure, when he was forc'd to leap out of the Boat wherein he was, into
the Sea, and by ſwimming to recover one of his gallies: and being in this
great extremity (if you will believe <hi>Suetonius,)</hi> he carried his <hi>Commentaries</hi> in
one hand above the water, and his robe in his teeth, that it might not fall
into the enemies hands. In theſe conflicts were there nine months ſpent: at
which time <hi>Caeſar</hi> receiving his forces out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> made an end of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
with the ſame attendance of <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Victory</hi> which had waited
on him every where elſe. Had <hi>Caeſar</hi> been acquainted with no warre but this,
he might juſtly challenge the title of the greateſt Captain in the world, ſo much
perſonall valour, wiſdome, conduct, circumſpection and policy did he expreſſe
in all paſſages thereof, though encompaſſed with all the inconveniences and
diſadvantages imaginable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aegypt</hi> being thus quieted, the murtherers of <hi>Pompey</hi> puniſh'd, and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
(by whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> had a Son call'd <hi>Caeſario)</hi> eſtabliſh'd Queen, <hi>Caeſar</hi> takes
his march towards <hi>Aſia</hi> through <hi>Syria,</hi> having receiv'd intelligence, that,
while he was engag'd in the warres of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> King <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> the Son of the
mighty <hi>Mithridates,</hi> taking his advantage of the diſſenſions among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
entertained ſome hopes of recovering what his Father had loſt; having
in order thereto overthrown <hi>Domitius,</hi> whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> had left Governour in
thoſe parts, and taken in by force the Provinces of <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi>
expelling thence <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> a friend and ſubject to <hi>Rome.</hi> The like he
intended to have done with <hi>Armenia</hi> the leſſe, which King <hi>Dejotarus</hi> had
made ſubject to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But <hi>Caeſar</hi> coming upon <hi>Pharnaces</hi> before he
expected him, they in a few dayes came to a Battell, which in a few hours was
diſpatched, to the overthrow of the King, and the infinite ſlaughter of his
people, which he himſelf eſcaped by flight. This Victory gave <hi>Caeſar</hi> more
ſatisfaction then any of his former, becauſe of the great deſire he had to return
to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, he was informed, many ſcandalls were ſpread, and inſolencies
committed by the encouragement of his abſence. He had alſo underſtood
that <hi>Pompey</hi>'s eldeſt Son had ſeiz'd a great part of <hi>Spain,</hi> and, out of thoſe that
<hi>M. Varro</hi> had left there, and ſome gleanings of his Father's troups, had gotten
together ſome conſiderable force. He alſo knew that moſt of the principall <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
who had eſcaped the Battel at <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> were gathered together in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi>
and headed by <hi>M. Cato,</hi> (ſurnamed <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ticenſis,</hi> for having kill'd himſelf
at <hi>Vtica)</hi> and <hi>Scipio Pompey</hi>'s Father-in-Law; that they had a great part of
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s navy; that with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Iuba</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> they had
ſubdu'd all that Country, and had a great Army in readineſſe againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
choſen <hi>Scipio</hi> for their General, becauſe that name had been fortunate
in <hi>Africk. Caeſar,</hi> upon intelligence of all theſe tranſactions, with his wonted
celerity and diligence recovers all that <hi>Pharnaces</hi> had uſurped, &amp; chaſing him
from <hi>Pontus</hi> regained all thoſe Countries, which he recommended to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Caelius Minucius,</hi> with two Legions; where having reconciled
<pb facs="tcp:51174:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
differences, decided all controverſies, and ſettled all things, by rewarding
and gratifying thoſe Kings and Tetrarchs who had continued firm to the
Common-wealth and intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> he made no longer aboad in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but
paſſing with all expedition into <hi>Italy,</hi> he came to <hi>Rome</hi> within a little more then
a year after he had departed thence: wherewith if we compare his great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and adventures, it would prove matter of faith and aſtoniſhment, to
conſider how ſuch vaſt Armies ſhould paſſe through ſo many countries in ſo
ſhort a time.</p>
                  <p>Some few dayes after his coming to <hi>Rome</hi> he is created the third time Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul,
and, as farre as time and the exigencies of his affairs permitted, ſtudied the
reformation of what diſorders there then were. For that his Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned
ſhould be Maſters of <hi>Africk,</hi> was a thing he could not eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.
Therefore with his ordinary expedition he marches thitherward, and
commands his forces to follow. He took ſhipping in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſo paſſed into
<hi>Africk,</hi> having no great force with him: however, ſuch was his confidence of
his Fortune, that he ſtaid not the arrivall of either his Army or navy. Being land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his ſmall forces near unto the City of <hi>Adrumetum,</hi> he marches unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
called <hi>Leptis;</hi> where he was received, and where he took occaſion by
ſome conflicts, to keep the enemy in action, ſo to divert them from augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their forces. In fine, his Legions being arrived, he very earneſtly ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the proſecution of the war: in which, though it laſted but four Months,
(from the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> to the end of <hi>Aprill)</hi> there happened many
encounters and Battels. For having diſpatched what work <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bienus</hi>
found him, he came to deal with <hi>Scipio</hi> and King <hi>Iuba,</hi> who had brought
an aſſiſtance of 8000. men, whereof one half were Cavalry, <hi>Africa</hi> at that
time being very abundant in horſe, as may appear partly in that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had, among them, raiſed in that Country, beſides eight Legions of foot,
20000. horſe. <hi>Hirtius, Plutarch, Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Florus</hi> have written at large of
this warre, and tell you that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was many times in very great danger as to
his own perſon, yet at laſt, by the aſſiſtance of his forces and the compliance of
his great Fortune, he put a period to that warre by one ſignall Battel, wherein
there being ſlain of the Enemies ſide 10000. they were utterly defeated; <hi>Caeſar</hi>
remained Maſter of the field, and ſhortly after of all the Country. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Captains of the adverſe party, though they eſcaped death at the fight, died
moſt of them miſerably and unfortunately. King <hi>Iuba</hi> himſelf being for want
of refuge brought to that deſpair, that fighting with <hi>Afranius,</hi> and killing him,
he commanded one of his own ſlaves to diſpatch himſelf. <hi>Marcus Cato,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Vtica,</hi> hearing of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s approach, though confident not onely of his
pardon, but his particular favour, yet either out of an indignation to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
by his enemy, or an extravagant zeal to Liberty, laid violent hands on
himſelf. <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote a book in commendation of <hi>Cato,</hi> to juſtify that action,
which <hi>Caeſar</hi> anſwer'd with another, which he called <hi>Anti-Cato,</hi> both which
are loſt. The Ceremony of his death was very remarkable; for upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the miſcarriage of moſt of his partners, he embraces his Son and Friends,
and bids them good night, pretending to go to bed. Reſting upon his bed, he
took into his hand <hi>Plato</hi>'s book of the immortality of the Soul: wherein ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:51174:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſatisfied himſelf, he, about the relieving of the watch, with a <hi>Roman</hi> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
drew his ſword, and ran himſelf into the Body. Being not quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd,
Phyſitians came in and apply'd ſomething to the wound, which he
ſuffer'd while they ſtaid with him, but aſſoon as they were departed, he pull'd
all off, and thruſt his dying hand into the wound. <hi>Scipio,</hi> the Generall in this
war, having eſcaped, and ſhipp'd himſelf in certain Gallies, was met by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
navy; but to avoid being taken by them, he gave himſelf ſome wounds, and leapt
over-board, and ſo was drown'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> being by this means abſolute Victor, ſpends ſome time in ordering the
Provinces of <hi>Africk:</hi> which done, and reducing <hi>Iuba</hi>'s Kingdome into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
he comes to <hi>Vtica,</hi> whence he embarqued the third of <hi>Iune</hi> for <hi>Sardinia;</hi>
where having ſtaid ſome few dayes, he arrives at <hi>Rome Iuly 25.</hi> whither as ſoon
as he was come, there were granted unto him four Triumphs. The firſt was for
his conqueſt and Victories in <hi>France,</hi> wherein were ſet forth the Rivers of <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi>
and the <hi>Rhene</hi> wrought in gold. In the ſecond, which was for <hi>Aegypt</hi>
and King <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> were repreſented the River <hi>Nile,</hi> and the <hi>Pharos</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
burning. The third was for his Victory over King <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> wherein a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
writing repreſented the celerity he uſed in the proſecution of that Victory,
which onely contain'd three words, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici; I came, I ſaw, I overcame.</hi>
The fourth was for his reduction of <hi>Africk;</hi> wherein was placed <hi>Iuba's</hi> Son
as a captive. As for the Battel againſt <hi>Pompey, Caeſar</hi> would not triumph for
it, becauſe it was againſt <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens.</p>
                  <p>Theſe triumphs ended, and great rewards ſcatter'd among the Souldiery,
who had been aſſiſtant in ſo great Tranſactions, the People being alſo enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with feaſts, ſports, and preſents, <hi>Caeſar</hi> is choſen the fourth time Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul.
But there yet remain'd ſome ſword-work to do, for <hi>Gneius Pompeius,</hi> Great
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Son, had got together moſt of the remainder of the <hi>African</hi> Army,
and was gone into <hi>Spain</hi> to joyn with his Brother <hi>Sextus,</hi> who (as was hinted
before) was there, and had poſſeſs'd himſelf of a great part of <hi>Spain,</hi> with the
Cities of <hi>Sevill</hi> and <hi>Cordova,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ready enough to come in to
their aſſiſtance. <hi>Caeſar</hi> takes with him his moſt experienc'd veterane Souldiers,
and with extraordinary ſpeed arrives in <hi>Spain</hi> within a few dayes, being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with his Nephew <hi>Octavius,</hi> who was about ſixteen years of Age.</p>
                  <p>Being come into <hi>Baetica</hi> (now <hi>Andaluzia)</hi> where the two <hi>Pompeys</hi> were
with ſuch Legions as they had got together, he ſoon began a hot and bloudy
war; whereof to be ſhort the iſſue was this. <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Gneius (Sextus</hi> being in
<hi>Cordova)</hi> near <hi>Munda,</hi> join battell, which proves the ſharpeſt and moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
that ever was. It laſted almoſt a whole day, and that with ſuch indifference
as to point of Victory, that it was adjudg'd ſometimes to one ſide ſometimes to
another. <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Eutropius</hi> tell us that <hi>Caeſar</hi> one time, upon his mens gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ground, was in ſuch a plunge, that he was almoſt reſolv'd to have kill'd
himſelf, ſo to have avoided the ſhame and diſhonour of being conquer'd; and
that in that heat of indignation and deſpair he ſnatched a Target from one of
his Souldiers, ſaying with a loud voice (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates) <hi>If you are not aſham'd,
leave me, or deliver me into the hands of theſe Boyes, for this ſhall be the laſt day of
my life, and your honour.</hi> With which words the Souldiers being animated
<pb facs="tcp:51174:14"/>
and heighten'd by his example, regain their loſt ground, turn, by degrees, the
ſcales of the Battell; and, towards the evening, the enemy fainting and flying,
become apparent Victors. The Enemy loſt in this field 30000. men: <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
beſide the common Souldiery, 1000. all perſons of quality. This did <hi>Caeſar</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the moſt glorious of all his Victories, (the commemoration of hazzards
and ſuffering being to ſome the greateſt ſatisfaction conceiveable,) for he would
often ſay afterwards, that at other times he fought for <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Victory,</hi> but
that that day he fought for his <hi>Life,</hi> which he had never fought for before.
<hi>Pompey,</hi> who had performed all that a wiſe and ſtout captain could, perſecuted
by a malicious fortune, and ſeeing there was no other remedy, eſcaped by
flight: but being hopeleſſe and refugeleſſe, he was at laſt ſurpriz'd by ſome of
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s friends, kill'd, and his head brought to him; which was alſo the fate of
<hi>Labienus. Sextus</hi> upon this quits <hi>Cordova,</hi> and ſhortly after <hi>Spain,</hi> leaving all to
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> who in a ſhort time reduc'd and ſettled the whole Country. Which done,
he returns to <hi>Rome,</hi> and triumphs for the warres of <hi>Spain;</hi> which was his fifth
and laſt triumph.</p>
                  <p>Having thus conquer'd the greateſt part of the world, and by conſequence
gain'd the reputation of the moſt famous and moſt powerfull man in it, it was
at leaſt a pardonable ambition, if he thought no title, name, or dignity too
great for him. It requires ſome faith to believe that ſuch vaſt bodies as <hi>Roman</hi>
Armies, conſiſting of many Legions, could at an ordinary rate, march
through ſo many Countries, and croſſe ſo many Seas, had they had no enemy
to engage: but to conquer them tranſcends it, and muſt be attributed to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;
for within leſſe then five yeares, through infinite conqueſts and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
he conſummated the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, making himſelf perpetuall
Dictator, Sovereign Lord or Emperour. Which later title though it had not
that height of ſignification which his Succeſſors have rais'd it to, yet was it
the greateſt attribution of honour which that, or after-Ages have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd.</p>
                  <p>But if his thoughts were ſo high, and his ambition ſo exorbitant as to deſerve
a ſevere Cenſure, certainly it may prove ſo much the more excuſeable, by how
much it was enflam'd by the generall acclamations and acknowledgments.
For both the Senate and peole of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome out of feare, ſome out of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſome out of diſſimulation, were forward enough to invent thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations
of honour and preeminence, and afterwards to elevate them to the
height of his ambitious mind. Hence was he call'd <hi>Emperour, Father, Reſtorer,</hi>
and <hi>Preſerver</hi> of his Country; hence created <hi>perpetuall Dictator,</hi> and <hi>Conſul</hi>
for ten yeares, and perpetuall <hi>Cenſor</hi> of their Cuſtomes; his Statue erected
among the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> hence he had his thrones and chaires of ſtate in the
Theatre and Temples, which, as alſo all publick places, were filled with his
pictures and images. Nay, their adoration aſcended to that point, that from
theſe humane honours they attributed to him divine; finding marble little
enough for Temples and Statues for him, (which were dedicated to him
with the ſame veneration as to their Gods) and metall little enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
his high and almoſt incredible adventures.</p>
                  <p>But all the power and command of ſo many nations as he had conquer'd,
<pb facs="tcp:51174:15"/>
was inconſiderable as to the extent of his mind: whereby we may ſee what
ſmall acquaintance there is between Ambition and Acquieſcence. It was
not ſufficient to have been perſonally engag'd in fifty ſignall Battels, and to
have lay'd with their Bellies to the Sun a million ninety and odd thouſand
men, (abating all thoſe that fell in the Civile warres) but there yet remains
ſomething to do greater then all this. The fierce <hi>Parthians</hi> break his ſleep,
they are yet unconquer'd, which once done, t'were eaſy, like lightning, to
paſſe through <hi>Hyrcania</hi> and other Countries to the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and ſo ſcoure
the Provinces of <hi>Scythia Aſiatica,</hi> and ſo paſſing over the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> to
come into <hi>Europe,</hi> and bring in <hi>Germany</hi> and the bordering Provinces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the wings of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle. In order to this expedition had he in
ſundry places raiſed 10000. horſe and 16. Legions of choice foot: but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greater power thought fit he ſhould leave ſome work for his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.</p>
                  <p>Nay ſome things he aim'd at beyond Man's attempt, correcting even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it ſelf. As that deſign of making <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> an Iſland, by cutting of
that neck of Land which is between the <hi>Aegeaan</hi> and <hi>Ionian</hi> Seas. He thought
to have altered the courſes of the Rivers <hi>Tiber</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ien,</hi> and made them
navigable for ſhips of the greateſt burthen. He had begun to levell diverſe
hills and mountains in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to dry up Lakes and Fenns. He re-edified
and re-peopled the once famous <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Corinth.</hi> Theſe and many other
things he had done without doubt, had not an unexpected and barbarous
death ſurpriz'd him in the midſt of his deſignations. Which becauſe it is
the tragicall part of this Relation, we ſhall referre to the laſt place, while in the
mean time we ſhall divert our thoughts, with a ſhort entertainment of his
perſonall excellencyes and endowments, his extraction, birth, Deification, and
names; as we have already ſatisfi'd our ſelves with the conſideration of his
Actions: and ſo paſſe to that part of our undertaking, wherein we preſume
to promiſe the curious and criticall reader no leſſe content then he hath
found in what he hath already reflected on, that is to ſay, the deſcription and
dilucidation of what MEDALLS have been ſnatch'd out of the jawes of
hungry Time, that have had any relation to the great name of CAESAR.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CAeſar</hi> was of a full &amp; handſome compoſure of body, of a graceful carriage
and deportment, of a whitiſh complexion, his eyes were ſomewhat big,
black, quick and piercing, his noſe ſtraight and large enough, but his
mouth was more then ordinary wide, his cheeks lean. In his later dayes
he became bald towards the fore-part of his head, and, through his continual
hazzards and hardſhips, much wrinkled in the forehead. Theſe laſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are eaſily diſcernable in his Medalls, as alſo in ſome graven ſtones
and Marbles: and this made him ſeem ſomewhat older then he was, his
baldneſſe, wrinkles, and wide mouth taking away much of the graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his countenance, and cauſing him to have a ruſtick Phyſiognomy.
This gave occaſion to <hi>Silenus</hi> the oldeſt among the <hi>Satyrs,</hi> very pleaſantly
(in the CAESARS of the Emperour <hi>Iulian)</hi> to boaſt that, beſides other
ſimilitudes between them, he had a head like <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi>'s. But as to the
<pb facs="tcp:51174:15"/>
baldneſſe, it is no more to be objected to him as indecent, then to diverſe
other great perſonages of Antiquity, as may be frequently ſeen in Medalls
and Marbles, <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf being one of the Tribe. They are the higheſt
and ſublimeſt things, nay the more divine, as approaching the sky, that are
freed from all ſuperfluities. The higheſt mountains are bald on their tops,
though in other parts they are perruqu'd with woods, and have fertile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> was much troubled at the loſſe of his haire, inſomuch as,
having effected his deſignes, he alwayes wore a Crown of Lawrell, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to cover the nakedneſſe, thruſting up the haire he had towards the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part of his head as much as he could, as may be remarked out of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies
in the Medalls. He had a ſtrong and vigorous body, able to endure
any thing of labour or hardſhip; an active and lively mind, capable of any
undertaking; his judgement and common ſenſe moſt exquiſite. He was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with a ſtrange fore-ſight and vigilance, a dexterity and preſence of mind
above ordinary, and an incredible reſolution and courage in all exigences
and emergencies. In the warres of <hi>Aſia,</hi> under the Praetor <hi>Marcus Termo</hi>
he obteined a Civicall Crown. He was admirable for his Eloquence and
incomparable Memory. He was well verſed in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
thereof foreknew many things. It was by that that he was jealous of
the <hi>Ides</hi> of the months, as being fatall to him. Nay, he writ books of the
motion of the ſtarres, regulated the year, and reduc'd it to the courſe of
the Sun; which ſcience he learned from the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> From his skill in
that ſcience he rais'd himſelf to attempt that great change and alteration
which he brought about, from the ſtrange prodigies which had happened
not long before, as you have them elegantly deſcribed by <hi>Petronius</hi> and
<hi>Lucan;</hi> the heavens, earth, ſea, nay the very mountaines and rivers intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that great viciſſitude.</p>
                  <p>But in the whole conſtellation of his vertues and perfections, none
ſhines brighter then his <hi>Clemency</hi> and <hi>Generoſity.</hi> His propenſity to pardon
his enemies, when conquered, whether Barbarians or Citizens, was exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary:
and it is much to be queſtioned whether his Lenity raiſed him more
friends or enemies. When he had paſſed the <hi>Rubicon,</hi> he takes the City
<hi>Corfinium,</hi> and in it <hi>Domitius,</hi> whom the Senate had deſigned to ſucceed
him in his Command in <hi>France:</hi> yet though all were at his mercy, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
<hi>Domitius,</hi> with what part of the Legions would go with him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to <hi>Pompey.</hi> Nor was his <hi>Clemency</hi> and <hi>Liberality</hi> leſſe remarkable at the
Battel of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> where he not onely pardoned his enemies, but received
ſome of the moſt inveterate into favour and familiarity, and engaged them
into the government of Provinces and Countries: not to mention the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him of <hi>Cato Vticenſis,</hi> and his ſevere puniſhing of the Murtherers of
<hi>Pompey.</hi> Much more might be ſaid of him, but ſince it is not our buſineſſe
to write any <hi>Panegyricks</hi> on him, we come to his <hi>extraction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for his extraction, we find that thoſe of the <hi>Iulian</hi> family boaſted that
they were originally deſcended from <hi>Iulus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Anchiſes</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> which was a common and yet no criminall ambition in
thoſe times. The Poets, above all other, thoſe that lived in the times of
<pb facs="tcp:51174:16"/>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſtrove who ſhould moſt celebrate this Genealogie,
and that by very remarkable caſts of their inherent flattery. To omit what
may be gathered out of <hi>Lucan, Petronius,</hi> and others, we ſhall content our
ſelves with what we have from <hi>Manilius,</hi> Aſtron. <hi>lib. 1.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>—Veneriſque ab origine proles</l>

                     </q>
But that which <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſuffers in this buſineſſe, is, that it was objected to
him as a great vanity, to derive himſelf from this Goddeſſe, as being ſo far
guilty of it, that he recommended to her the ſucceſſe and conduct of his
moſt ſignall enterpriſes, truſting her with all his good fortune. We men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not his dalliances with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> becauſe the temptation on her ſide was
more then ordinary; not onely that of her beauty, but her ſtrange proſtitution
of her ſelf, even to that point, that before ſhe had ſeen <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſhe cauſed her
ſelf to be put up into a Basket, and, as if it had been ſome preſent, to be
brought to him, fearing, if ſhe had come without this ſurpriſe, ſhe might not
have acceſſe. But if it be a vanity, 'tis eaſily diſcover'd in his Coins, being
furniſh'd with ſeverall ſhapes of this <hi>Venus Genitrix,</hi> this Goddeſſe of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſometimes ſitting on the prow of a ſhip, ſometimes ſtanding, bearing
a Victory in her right hand, to repreſent a <hi>Venus Victrix,</hi> ſuch as whereof <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permneſtra</hi>
dedicated a figure in the City of <hi>Argos,</hi> calling it <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Victory, which was the word <hi>Caeſar</hi> gave at the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was afterwards imitated by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> at the fight of <hi>Actium.</hi> The
ſame reaſon may be given for his placing a <hi>Venus Victrix</hi> upon the other ſide
of his own effigies in his Medalls, with a globe, as conceiving ſhe ought him
the conqueſt of the Univerſe. Beſides at the battel of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> he made a vow
to build her a Temple (as <hi>Appianus</hi> records <hi>l. 2.)</hi> and afterwards cauſed
his ſtatue to be plac'd next to that of this Goddeſſe of <hi>Generation.</hi> To
which Monuments ſeem to relate thoſe antique Inſcriptions which <hi>Gruterus</hi>
mentions, foraſmuch as concerns the worſhip of this <hi>Venus,</hi> obſerved by
the <hi>Romans</hi> out of their Veneration of her and the <hi>Iulian</hi> family.

But we ſhall have more to ſay of this Goddeſſe when we come to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls,</hi>
we therefore proceed to his <hi>Nativity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> was born under <hi>Sagittary,</hi> that is to ſay, upon the twelfth day of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> which denoted to him great Victories, and many famous triumphs
in his own Country, according to <hi>Manilius, lib. 4.</hi> in theſe verſes.
<q>
                        <l>Nec non <hi>arcitenens</hi> prima cum veſte reſurgit,</l>
                        <l>Pectora clara dabit bello, magniſque triumphis</l>
                        <l>Conſpicuum patrias Victorem ducet in arces;</l>
                        <l>Sed nimium indulgens rebus <hi>Fortuna</hi> ſecundis</l>
                        <l>Invidet in facie, ſaevitque aſperrima fronti, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
but the end ſhould be diſmall and unfortunate: as indeed it happen'd. But
<hi>Apollinaris Sidonius</hi> in his Panegyrick of <hi>Anthemius,</hi> verſ. 120. makes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
obſervation, wherein of all Authours he is ſingular, ſaying that <hi>Caeſar</hi>
was born at the ſame time when a crown of Lawrell was burning.
<q>
                        <hi>Julius</hi> in lucem venit dum Laurea flagrat.</q>
What preſage could ariſe hence to ſignify his innumerable Victories, we have
onely this Authour to inform us. But indeed there is one other diſcovers
this myſtery, but another way: for when they would preſage the fertility or
ſterility of the enſuing year, they were wont to caſt a crown of Lawrell into the
fire, and according to the crackling of the leaves they gave their judgement.
This is <hi>Tibullus. l. 2.</hi> Eleg. 5.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſuccenſa ſacris crepitet bene laurea flammis,</l>
                        <l>Omine quo felix &amp; ſacer annus eat.</l>
                        <l>At Laurus bona ſigna dedit, gaudete coloni,</l>
                        <l>Diſtendet ſpicis aurea plena Ceres.</l>
                     </q>
Therefore at <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s birth it may be thought ſome one out of ſuperſtition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
him of this ceremony, or it happened by chance. But in fine, thoſe
that were aſſiſtant at the birth, were by that accident raiſed to a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
that the child then born ſhould prove a moſt fortunate man, and
ſhould arrive to great fame and wealth.</p>
                  <p>As concerning his <hi>Deification,</hi> there is not much to be ſaid. In the firſt
place, we ſuppoſe it a thing not ſo miraculous, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that one who had done ſuch great and tranſcendent actions, as <hi>Caeſar</hi>
did, might be thought ſomewhat more then a man, and had in him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
divine; beſides that he was one acknowledg'd to have deſcended from
<hi>Venus Genetrix,</hi> the mother of the Univerſe. Other nations had that cuſtome
of adoring and invoking their Kings, as Gods, after their death; as the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,
Perſians,</hi> and the <hi>Moors,</hi> who in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s time put <hi>Iuba</hi> into the
number of the Gods. In the ſecond place, we meet with two cenſorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon this Deification. Firſt, how that Genius of Vertue and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
which was wont to animate the <hi>Roman</hi> people, was ſo metamorphoſed
into that of flattery and vanity, as to deify one who, by the greateſt, if not
the moſt, was look'd on as the greateſt oppreſſour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty, and
<pb facs="tcp:51174:17"/>
onely the moſt fortunate Malefactour that ever was, when they had not
vouchſafed that honour to <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> who had been the <hi>Moſes,</hi>
the Law-giver, the moſt juſt and the moſt pious among the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes.
Secondly, whether, if he had miſcarried at the battell of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> he had
not been the moſt infamous perſon among the <hi>Romans</hi> that ever was, and
more abominable then <hi>Catiline;</hi> and on the contrary, whether rocks,
mountains, ſeas, and the cabinets of conquered Kings and Citizens had
furniſhed marble, porphyry, jaſper and precious ſtones enough to erect pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
ſtatues, and Temples to celebrate the glory of the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> who
was ſo zealous for the Liberty of <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Divine Providence</hi> was pleaſed
to uſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> as an Inſtrument to change that <hi>Common-wealth</hi> into a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi>
that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world ſhould be born
under the peaceable reign of one ſole <hi>Monarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the name of <hi>Iulius;</hi> ſince, as is before noted, the <hi>Iulian Gens</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
it ſelf from <hi>Iulus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> by a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
coition with <hi>Venus,</hi> it muſt be granted <hi>Iulus</hi> was the Authour of this
Family.
<q>
                        <hi>Julius</hi> à magno deductum nomen <hi>Iulo.</hi>
                     </q>
as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſayes. This <hi>Iulius</hi> was alſo called <hi>Ilus,</hi> and more frequently <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
from a place in <hi>Phrygia</hi> called <hi>Aſcanium,</hi> or from a River named <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius.</hi>
That of <hi>Ilus</hi> was in memory of <hi>Ilus</hi> the moſt renowned King of
the <hi>Trojans,</hi> from whom <hi>Troy</hi> was called <hi>Ilium.</hi> But to be yet more critical,
the name <hi>Iulius</hi> or <hi>Iulus</hi> was given him, becauſe of his hairineſſe about the
cheeks ſooner then his age required, according to the ſame <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>At puer <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> cui nunc cognomen <hi>Iulo</hi>

                     </gap>, that is to ſay, a certain thick
and clotted hairineſſe, ſuch as women's, when they plait and twiſt their
haire about their heads; and he that either naturally or artificially had ſuch
a one, had firſt the honour of that name, which likely was ſome one of the
poſterity of <hi>Iulus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas;</hi> unleſſe we would rather truſt <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi>
who would have the firſt of this family to be ſo called, <hi>Quod cum
magnis crinibus ſit utero parentis effuſus,</hi> becauſe he was born with abundance
of haire. In fine, however it came, it was ſo venerable during the long
reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and three more of the family, that it
alone deſign'd the Emperour, and became a name of invocation upon any
accident of haſt, ſurpriſe, or admiration.</p>
                  <p>We might here bring in what <hi>Suetonius</hi> delivers in the life of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51174:17"/>
that the firſt Letter of the name <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which is C. being daſh'd out by a
thunderbolt, it was predicted that he ſhould dy within a hundred dayes, becauſe
that Letter ſtands for that number: and that after his deceaſe he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the number of the Gods, becauſe AESAR ſignified in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſcan</hi>

as a monument of that happineſſe and good fortune which this Goddeſſe had
procured him in all his enterpriſes. For it was his ambition, to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
in a right line from <hi>Anchiſes</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> by whoſe indulgence he had
conquered the Univerſe, as being his directrix in all his deſignes, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented

that he had obtained abſolute Victory over all his enemies; whereof the

them to her in acknowledgement of her favours. The Eagle pitched upon a
pillar, ſignifies, that his Victories have aſſured him the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which

and ſignifies abſolute Victory. It ſignifies alſo that the Empire ſhall be aſſur'd

ſtands for nothing elſe but the year, taking the word INDUTIA to ſignify
a Colony of <hi>Germans</hi> diſpoſed into that place by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s order. This name
indeed is not found among the Geographers, onely <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions a Town

head-ornament of the High-prieſt. Divers Antiquaries have ſo commented
upon this Medall, as to make the word <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſignifie an Elephant. But in my
opinion, this deviſe ſignifies altogether as much as if it had this inſcription
about it, IMP. CAESAR, or CAESAR DICTATOR PERP. on
one ſide, and PONTIF. MAX. on the other. For as the one ſhewes forth
the Royall quality, the other ſuppoſes the Pontificall to have been in thoſe

to <hi>Artemidorus)</hi> ſignifies a Royall, imperiall or ſupreme Power. But <hi>Achmet</hi>

make his name ſtand for an Elephant, for this word is little leſſe then <hi>African.</hi>
The ſame <hi>Artemidorus</hi> ſayes, that a Dragon ſeen in a dream ſignifies a King and

muſt erect <hi>Caeſar's</hi> ſtatue in the Capitoll, repreſenting upon the head

to Cities and Bodies corporate, to whom the Kings, and afterwards the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours

with the hands of men were not Gods. The <hi>Town-Clark,</hi> or the <hi>Church-warden</hi>

of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was then <hi>Neocore</hi> (in the Engliſh Tranſlation <hi>worſhipper)</hi> of the great
Goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> and of the Image fallen from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and that therefore there
being no contradiction in that, they ought not to do any thing raſhly. For theſe

conceived to have been Modells of that magnificent Temple, which the
<hi>Epheſians</hi> being <hi>Neocori,</hi> cauſed out of magnifice to be made of that rich Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
Had this controverſy between the Apoſtles and the Goldſmiths come to
a deciſion, they had proceeded thus; They would have had ſome to make
publick panegyricks of their Goddeſſe in the firſt place; then, if <hi>Paul</hi> and his
companions ſhould not reſt ſatisfied, this <hi>Neocorean</hi> people would have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
them according to their manner. Now that the <hi>Neocori</hi> of the Temples
were uſed to commend to all comers (eſpecially Travellers) the greatneſſe
and power of their Gods, and that the <hi>Neocori</hi> of Cities imitated them, but
did it with great Pomp, employing perſons eminent for Learning and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as Poets and Orators, for the honour of their Gods, as alſo their
Kings, Monarchs, Emperours, Founders, and that upon dayes in ſtituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
for that purpoſe, may be learn'd from <hi>Horace,</hi> who <hi>lib. 2. Ep. 1.</hi> writing to
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> call's thoſe Poets <hi>Aidituos,</hi> who ſhould immortalize the Vertue
of that Emperour, or rather thoſe who were charg'd to choſe ſuch as ſhould
do it, in theſe verſes:

This <hi>Hermathena,</hi> comprehending in it the God <hi>Terminus,</hi> with <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>

needs be ingenious, denoting that, though their employments were ſeverall,

that they jump'd into the ſame reſolution for to carry on the intereſt of

ſacrifices performed by that people, for the welfare, union and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

to thank the Gods for ſo good an adventure. There may this further

                        <pb facs="tcp:51174:23"/>
a man beyond middle-aged, with a great beard, and a ruſtick countenance,
with a long poniard before him. That which may be more particularly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
hence is, that he was more then ordinarily deſirous that the conſpiracy
ſhould proſper, though before he had been a great creature of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s (as <hi>Seneca</hi>
affirmes in his Book <hi>de Ira.)</hi> Nay, under pretence of preſenting a Petition to
him, he was ſo importunate with him, and held him in diſcourſe with ſuch
eagerneſſe till he came into the Senate, that he had not the time to read a note
which was preſented to him, wherein the whole conſpiracy was diſcovered.
This poniard therefore ſtands to ſignifie the great Zeal he had to this execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein he thought the Liberty of his Country was concerned; to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
which, as it was his ambition to appear the moſt eager and the moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
of all the gang, ſo he thought it his glory to give <hi>Caeſar</hi> the firſt wound.
Which conſideration leads us by the hand to what we had deſigned for the laſt
part of this diſcourſe, namely the tragicall Cataſtrophe of this miraculous
perſon.</p>
                     <p>For motives to the conſpiracy, we may lay down partly the irreconcileable
hatred that ſome bare, in others, the averſion they had from Tyranny, in others,
a kind of zeal to publick Liberty: the encouragements, <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s own careleſſeneſs
of himſelf, according to that <hi>Apophthegme</hi> of his, when adviſed to take a guard
about his perſon, <hi>That it was better to dy once then live in continuall fear;</hi> his not
humouring that people who, if courted with <hi>Majeſty</hi> (as they had been wont in
the time of the Commonwealth) had ſuffered any thing; his deriſory expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Commonwealth, ſaying that it was a ſhadow, and an imaginary no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>Antonius</hi> his profering him a Crown, which though (ſeeing the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the people backward) he accepted not, yet was his deſigne eaſily
diſcovered; the report that he was to be declared <hi>King,</hi> and would tranſlate the
Seat of the Empire to <hi>Troy,</hi> whence he pretended to deſcend, or to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to
ſpend his dayes with <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> the Tribunes ſhewing a certain law to a friend
of his, in writing, whereby it was lawfull to take as many wives as one would, the
better to people the Commonwealth. Theſe and ſuch like paſſages gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to Libels and placards, which were ſet up at every Corner, whereof divers
particularly addreſſed to <hi>Brutus,</hi> who by his influence over the chiefeſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
got together above 60. who under the conduct of <hi>Brutus</hi> (whoſe very
name they thought to be fatall to Tyrants) would preferre the Liberty of their
Country before Lives, Fortunes, or Relations. Some time before his death, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſignes and prodigies happened, that it was become the generall belief that
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s death was near at hand. Among other things, his ſoothſayer <hi>Spurina</hi>
bid him beware of the Ides of <hi>March.</hi> All which put together, ſomewhat ſtartled
him, inſomuch that he was once reſolved to deferre the Senate for that day, had
not <hi>Brutus</hi> adviſed him in no caſe to betray ſo much fear; whereupon he went.</p>
                     <p>Going therefore in his litter towards the Senate the fifteenth day
of <hi>March,</hi> it could not be but diverſe would be preſenting petitions,
and diſcourſing with him; but the Conſpiratours kept ſome of them ſo
cloſe to him, that he had not the leaſure to peruſe any thing he had taken,
which if he had, he had in an epiſtle given him by <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> or ſome
other, diſcovered the whole plot. Meeting by the way with <hi>Spurina,</hi> he told

him the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>March</hi> were come: to which he anſwered, 'tis true, but they
are not paſt. Being come to the Temple, where the Senate was to ſit that
day, and ſacrifice done according to the cuſtome, he took his chair in the
Senate. The firſt came up to him was one <hi>Celer,</hi> who while he was entreating
him to releaſe a Brother of his that was in captivity, the reſt came up to him:
whereat he ſuſpecting ſome violence, cryed out, what force is this? To which
the above-mentioned <hi>Atilius Cimber</hi> anſwered him with a wound in the
throat, which the reſt of the Conſpiratours ſeconded with others. But that which
amazed him above all, was to ſee <hi>Brutus</hi> among them, one whoſe authority
was great, and one whom he had obliged beyond all expreſſion of gratitude,
when a conquered enemy; upon which he could not but break forth into theſe
words, <hi>And thou, ſon</hi> Brutus, <hi>art thou one?</hi> Whereupon ſeeing there was no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of eſcaping, he remembred to keep the honour of his perſon, covering
his head with part of his robe, and with his left hand ſettling his cloaths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him; and ſo having received 23. wounds, he fell to the ground a ſacrifice
to the publick Liberty, near the baſe of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſtatue, which was noted as
a judgement of the Gods.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> having neither Son nor Daughter legitimate, at his death, had by
his will before, adopted his Nephew <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> who was afterwards cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Octavianus Auguſtus,</hi> who ſtudied in <hi>Apollonia</hi> at the time of this murther
of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and expected to go with him to the war againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> being
then about 17. yeares of age.</p>
                     <p>This death (as all extraordinary accidents) muſt needs beget tumult and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
in the City; All Offices ceaſed, the Temples, and Courts of Juſtice were
ſhut up; <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s friends were afraid of the Conſpiratours, &amp; they reciprocally of
them. This Tumult ſomewhat ſtartled the Conſpiratours, who ſeeing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
took not with the people as they expected, to ſecure themſelves, ſeized
the Capitoll, crying as they went, <hi>Liberty, Liberty, Liberty.</hi> Whereupon, <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
and <hi>Lepidus</hi> being all this while in Armes, divers treaties of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
paſſed between them, whereby it was at laſt agreed the Senate ſhould
ſit, whither <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> came, <hi>Antonius</hi>'s Sons being hoſtages for their
return. The Senate approves the fact, the people diſſemble their ſatisfaction:
for, as the Authority of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> with the name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> was very
charming on one ſide; ſo the horrour of the fact, and the love ſome bare <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
exaſperated them againſt the Murtherers. But <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> endeavouring to
trouble the waters as much as he could, among other things got <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be opened, wherein he had bequeath'd to the people of <hi>Rome</hi> certain
gardens and heritages near the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> and to every Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> a
certain ſumme of money: which being known, it re-enflamed their old
affection to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and raiſed a compaſſion and a regret for his death. The
day appointed for his funerall (the ceremony whereof was to burn his body
in the field of <hi>Mars) Antonius</hi> being to make the Oration, brought with
him the robe wherein <hi>Caeſar</hi> was aſſaſſinated, which being all bloudy he
ſhewed to the people, uſing ſome expreſſions which raiſed in them both indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation
and pity; inſomuch as before the ſolemnity of the funerall was
ended, they all departed in great fury with the brands of the ſame fire,
<pb facs="tcp:51174:24"/>
to ſet afire the houſes of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and the reſt of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours,
whom they ſought running up &amp; down the ſtreets. In which fury they
killed <hi>Aelius Cinna,</hi> miſtaking him for <hi>Cornelius Cinna,</hi> who indeed was one of
them. This Tumult forced <hi>Brutus, Caſſius,</hi> and all who conceived themſelves
guilty of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s death, to depart from <hi>Rome:</hi> whereupon <hi>Antonius</hi> took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to diſpenſe with the decree of the Senate, and aſſuming <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s power
and authority perſecuted them all he could. <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> went into
<hi>Greece,</hi> to govern thoſe Provinces which <hi>Caeſar</hi> (whom they had murthered)
had conferred on them, which were <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Syria;</hi> and in like manner
were all the reſt diſperſed, and that ſo unfortunately, that within the ſpace of
three yeares they all came to violent deaths.</p>

                     <p>Thus have we traced this tranſcendent Perſonage through all his great and

near as we can, enumerated the many battels he fought, the many victories ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the many people and provinces reduced, the many Kings and Countries
ſubdued, ſo to figure a perſon imitable in all things, that may be called great or

wherein if we have committed any offence, it hath been in ſtudying bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,

laſtly, we have accompanied him to his funerall pile, the fire whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
his murtherers and enemies, while he himſelf is carried up by the ſame

the nature of unacquainted ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
chooſing rather to hold any ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,

ſouldiers, whoſe knowledge groweth only from
experience, &amp; conſiſteth in the rules of their own
practice, are hardly perſwaded that hiſtory and
ſpeculative learning are of any uſe in perfecting
of their Art, being ſo different in nature from the
principles of their cunning, and of ſo ſmall affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with the life of action; wherein the uſe of
Armes and atchievements of war ſeem to have
their chiefeſt being. But thoſe purer ſpirits embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed

begetteth both ſimilitudes and differences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
natures, but yet joyntly concurring to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
our judgement with diſcretion, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall
wiſdome in the government of the mind:
Theſe men I ſay, mounting aloft with the wings
of contemplation, do eaſily diſcover the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of ſuch Martialiſts, as are only trained up
in the ſchool of practice, and taught their rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
under a few yeares experience, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to interpret no other authour but it ſelf, nor
can approve his maxims, but by his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and are rather moved to pity their hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
having learned only to be ignorant, then
to envy their skill in matter of war, when they
oppoſe themſelves againſt ſo manifeſt a truth as
this, that a meer practicall knowledge cannot
make a perfect ſouldier. Which propoſition that
I may the better confirme, give me leave to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
a little of the grounds of learning, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
from the habitude of Arts and ſciences;
which are then ſaid to be perfectly attained,
when their particular parts are in ſuch ſort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
that from the variety of that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duality,
the intellectuall power frameth generall
notions and maxims of rule, uniting terms of
the ſame nature in one head, and diſtinguiſhing
diverſities by differences of properties, aptly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the whole body into his greateſt and
ſmalleſt branches, and fitting each part with his
deſcriptions, duties, cautions and exceptions.
For unleſſe the underſtanding be in this ſort qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
and able by logiſticall diſcourſe, to aſcend
by way of compoſition, from ſingularity to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
conceptions, and return again the ſame
way to the loweſt order of his partitions, the
mind cannot be ſaid to have the perfection of
that Art, nor inſtructed in the true uſe of that
knowledge: but guiding her ſelf by ſome broken
precepts, feeleth more want by that ſhe hath not,
then benefit by that ſhe hath. Whereby it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that a ſcience divided into many branches,
and conſiſting in the multiplicity of divers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
being all ſo intereſſed in the Bulk, that a
maime of the ſmalleſt part cauſeth either debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or deformity in the body, cannot be ſaid to
be throughly attained, nor conceived with ſuch
a profiting apprehenſion as ſteeleth the mind
with true judgement, and maketh the ſcholar
maſter in his Art, unleſſe the nature of theſe
particularities be firſt had and obtained.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as no one ſcience or faculty
whatſoever, in multitude and plurality of parts,
may any way be comparable to the Art military,
wherein every ſmall and unreſpected circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
quite altereth the nature of the Action,
and breedeth ſuch diſparity and difference, that
the reſemblance of their equall participating
properties is blemiſhed with the diſſimilitude of
their diſagreeing parts; it cannot be denied, but
he that is acquainted with moſt of theſe particular
occurrences, and beſt knoweth the variety of
chances in the courſe of war, muſt needs be
thought a more perfect ſouldier, and deſerveth a
title of greater dignity in the profeſſion of Armes,
then ſuch as content themſelves with a few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
precepts and over-worn rules: without
which as they cannot be ſaid at all to be ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
ſo with them and no more, they no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51174:27"/>
the name of skilfull and perfect men of
war. Now whether meer experience, or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
joyned with reading and diſcourſe, do
feaſt the mind with more variety and choice of
matter, or entertain knowledge with greater
plenty of novelties, incident to expeditions and
uſe of Armes, I will uſe no other reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of this queſtion, then that which Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus
Patricius alleadgeth in his parallels,
where he handleth this Argument which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of.</p>
                  <p>He that followeth a war (ſaith he) doth ſee
either the courſe of the whole, or but a part only.
If his knowledge extend no farther then a part,
he hath learned leſſe then he that ſaw the whole:
but admit he hath ſeen and learned the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of one whole war, he hath notwithſtanding
learned leſſe then he that hath ſeen the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of two ſuch wars: and he again hath not
ſeen ſo much as another that hath ſerved in three
ſeverall wars: and ſo by degrees, a ſouldier that
hath ſerved ten yeares, muſt needes know more
then one that hath not ſerved ſo long. And to
conclude, he that hath received 22 yeares ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
(which was the juſt time of ſervice amongſt
the Romans before a ſouldier could be diſmiſt)
hath greater meanes of experience then another,
that hath not ſo long a time followed the camp,
and cannot challenge a diſcharge by order and
cuſtome. And hence it conſequently followeth,
that if in one or more or all theſe wars, there
have happened few or no actions of ſervice,
which might teach a ſouldier the practice of
Armes; that then his learning doth not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail
his labour. And if the war through the
negligence, or ignorance of the chief comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
have been ill carried, he can boaſt of no
knowledge, but that which acquainted him with
the corruptions of military diſcipline; if the
part which he followed were defeated and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown,
he knoweth by experience how to
looſe, but not how to gain. And therefore it is
not only experience and practice which maketh
a ſouldier worthy of his name, but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the manifold accidents which riſe from
the variety of humane actions; wherein reaſon
&amp; errour, like merchants in traffick, enterchange
contrary events of fortune, giving ſometime
copper for ſilver, and balme for poyſon, and
repaying again the like commodity as time and
circumſtances do anſwer their directions. And
this knowledge is onely to be learned in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters
of antiquity and in hiſtories, recording
the motions of former ages.</p>
                  <p>Caius Julius Caſar (whoſe actions are the
ſubject of theſe diſcourſes) after his famous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
in France, and that he had gotten the
provinces of Spain, broken the ſtrength of the
Roman Empire at Pharſalia, was held a ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſurmounting envy and all her exceptions;
and yet notwithſtanding all this, the battel he had
with Pharnaces king of Pontus, was like to have
buried the glory of his former conqueſts, in the
diſhonourable memory of a wilfull overthrow.
For having poſſeſt himſelf of a hill of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
he began to encamp himſelf in the top
thereof: which Pharnaces perceiving, (being
lodged likewiſe with his camp upon a mountain
confronting the Romans) imbattelled his men,
marched down from his camp into the valley,
and mounted his forces up the hill, where the
Romans were buſied about their intrenchments,
to give them battel. All which Caeſar took but
for a bravado: and meaſuring the enemy by
himſelf, could not be perſwaded that any ſuch
fool-hardineſſe could carry men headlong into
ſo dangerous an adventure, untill they were
come ſo near, that he had ſcarce any time to call
the legions from their work, and to give order
for the battel: which ſo amazed the Romans,

had greatly favoured them; Pharnaces had at
that time revenged the overthrow of Pompey and
the Senate, and reſtored the Roman Empire to
liberty. Which may learn us how neceſſary it is

ſaith of a skilfull painter, that being to

admit a reconciliation of this diſagreement, in

they will by no meanes acknowledge, that thoſe
monſtrous and inimitable examples of valour
and magnanimity (whereof antiquity is prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,

want ſuch treaſure) can any way avail the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of theſe dayes, which if they were as they
ought to be, would appear but counterfeit to the
luſtre of a golden age, nor yet comparable to
ſilver or braſſe, or the ſtrength of iron, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
no better title then earth or clay, whereof
the frame of this age conſiſteth. For what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
(ſay they) is between the cuſtoms
of our times, and the actions of thoſe antient
Heroes? They obſerved equity as well in war
as in peace; for vertue rather flouriſhed by the
naturall diſpoſition of men, then by law and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
the greateſt treaſure which they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were the deeds of armes which they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved
for their country, adorning the temples
of their gods with piety, and their private houſes
with glory, pardoning rather then perſecuting
a wrong, and taking nothing from the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
but ability of doing injury: But the
courſe of our times hath another bias, for cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
hath ſubverted both faith and equity,
and our valour affecteth nothing but ambition,
pride and cruelty tyrannize in our thoughts,
and ſubtilty teacheth us to carry rather a fair
countenance, then a good nature; our meanes
of getting are by fraud and extortion, and our
manner of ſpending is by waſt and prodigality,
not eſteeming what we have of our own, but
coveting that which is not ours; men effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and women impudent, uſing riches as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to wickedneſſe, and preventing natures
appetite with wanton luxury; ſupplanting
vertue with treachery, and uſing victory with
ſuch impiety, as though <hi>injuriam facere,</hi> were
<hi>imperio uti:</hi> and therefore the exemplary pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
of former times wherein true honour is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
may ſerve to be gazed upon, but no way
to be imitated by this age, being too ſubtile to deal
with honeſty, and wanting courage to incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
valour. I muſt needs confeſſe, that he that
compareth the hiſtory of Livie with that of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardine,
ſhall find great difference in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which they handle; for Livie triumpheth
in the conqueſts of vertue, and in every page e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
trophees unto valour, making his diſcourſe
like Cleanthes table, wherein vertue is deſcribed
in her entire majeſty; and ſo ſweetned with the
preſence and ſervice of the graces, that all they
which behold her are rapt with admiration of
her excellency, and charmed with the love of her
perfection: but Guichardine hath more then
Theſeus task to perform, being to wind through
the labyrinths of ſubtilty, and diſcover the quaint
practices of polititians, wherein publike and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
deſignes are oftentimes but ſhadows of
more ſecret projects, and theſe again ſerve as
foiles to more eminent intentions; being alſo
diſcoloured with diſſimulation, and ſo inſnared
in the ſleights of ſubtilty, that when you look for
war, you ſhall find peace; and expecting peace,
you ſhall fall into troubles, diſſentions and wars:
So crabbed and crooked is his argument in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Livies fortune, and ſuch art is required to
unfold the truth of thoſe myſteries.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwer this objection in a word, and
ſo to proceed to that which followeth; I ſay thoſe
immortall memories of vertue which former time
recordeth, are more neceſſary to be known, then
any ſtratagems of ſubtler ages: for equity and
valour being truly apprehended ſo ſeaſon the
motions of the ſoul, that albeit in ſo corrupt a
courſe, they cannot peradventure ſtir up imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet they oftentimes hinder many malicious
practices, and deviliſh deviſes, when evil is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the knowledge of good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the authority of better ages. And if
we will needs follow thoſe ſteps which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
courſe of the world hath traced, and play the
Cretian with the Cretian; this objection hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
nothing, but that hiſtory, eſpecially theſe of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51174:28"/>
later times, affordeth ſufficient inſtructions to
make a ſouldier perfect in that point.</p>
                  <p>Let not therefore any man deſpiſe the ſound
inſtructions which learning affordeth, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the helps that hiſtory doth offer to perfect
the weakneſſe of a ſhort experience, eſpecially
when no worth can countervail the weight of ſo
great a buſineſſe: for I take the office of a chief
commander, to be a ſubject capable of the
greateſt wiſdome that may be apprehended by
naturall meanes, being to manage a multitude
of diſagreeing minds, as a fit inſtrument to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
a deſigne of much conſequence and great
expectation, and to qualify both their affections
and apprehenſions according to the accidents
which riſe in the courſe of his directions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the true judgement which he ought to have
of ſuch circumſtances as are moſt important to a
fortunate end, wherein our providence cannot
have enough either from learning or experience,
to prevent diſadvantages, or to take hold of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.
Neither can it be denied, but as this
knowledge addeth perfection to our judgement,
ſo it ſerveth alſo as a ſpur to glory, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the deſire of honour in ſuch as behold the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements
of vertue, commended to a perpetuall
poſterity, having themſelves the like meanes to
conſecrate their memory to ſucceeding a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es,
wherein they may ſerve for examples of valour,
and reap the reward of true honour. Or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
if we thirſt after the knowledge of our own
fortune, and long to foreſee the end of that race
which we have taken, which is the chiefeſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of conſequence in the uſe of Arms; what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conjecture can be made, then to look into the
courſe of former times, which have proceeded
from like beginnings, and were continued with
like meanes, and therefore not unlikely to ſort
unto like ends?</p>
                  <p>And now if it be demanded whether reading or
practice have the firſt place in this Art, &amp; ſerveth
as a foundation to the reſt of the buildings; let

knowledge came by meer experience. But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his judgement was good in this point: for
ſince that all motion and action proceedeth from
the ſoul, and cannot well be produced, untill the
Idea thereof be firſt imprinted in the mind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which pattern the outward being and
ſenſible reſemblance is duely faſhioned; how is
it poſſible that any action can be well expreſſed,
when the mind is not directed by knowledge to
diſpoſe it in that ſort, as ſhall beſt agree with the
occurrents of ſuch natures, as are neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
both in the means and in the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
And therefore ſpeculative knowledge as the
Tramontane, to direct the courſe of all practice
is firſt to be reſpected.</p>
                  <p>But that I may not ſeem partiall in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,

in a word the benefit of practice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the good which cometh from experience;
that ſo nothing that hath been ſpoken may ſeem
to come from affection, or proceed from the forge
of unjuſt partiality. And firſt it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that practice giveth boldneſſe and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in action, and maketh men expert in ſuch
things as they take in hand: for no man can reſt
upon ſuch certainty, through the theorick of
knowledge, as he that hath ſeen his learning ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by practice, and acknowledged by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of aſſured proofe. Beſides, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other accomplements gotten only by practice,
which grace the preſence of knowledge, and
give credit to that which we have read: as firſt
to learn the uſe and advantage of the armes
which we bear: ſecondly, by frequent aſpect
and familiarity of dangers, and accidents of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
to learn to fear nothing but diſhonour, to
make no difference between heat and cold, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

as the infection of the aire, the cruelty and
oppreſſion of a neighbour nation, as were the
Suevians, who thought it great honour to ſuffer
no man to border upon their confines; or ſome
other univerſall, which made the place inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the people willing to undertake a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
exile. But oftentimes we read, that when
the inhabitants of a Country were ſo multiplied,
that the place was over-charged with multitudes
of off-ſpring, and like a poor father, had more
children then it was able to ſuſtaine, the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſurplus was ſent out to ſeek new fortunes in
forraine Countries, and to poſſeſſe themſelves of
a reſting ſeat; which might recompenſe the wants
of their native Country, with a plenteous revenue
of neceſſary ſupplements. And in this ſort we
read that Rome ſent out many Colonies into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
parts of her Empire. And in this manner the
antient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Galles diſourdened themſelves of their
ſuperfluity, and ſent them into Aſia. The Gothes
came from the Iſlands of the Baltick ſea, and in
Sulla his time ſwarmed over Germany: beſides
many other Nations, whoſe tranſmigrations are
particularly deſcribed by Lazius. But amongſt
all theſe, we find none that ſo forſook their

the ſame; from whence, as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
ſucceeding ages might derive the ſtream of
that over-flowing multitude, and by them take

For their manner was in all ſuch expeditions,
and ſending out of Colonies, to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into two or three parts, equall both in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
and number: for after they had parted
their common people into even companies, they
divided their Nobility with as great equality as
they could, among the former partitions: and
then caſting lots, that part which went out to
ſeek new adventures, left their lands and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the reſt that remained at home; and ſo
by induſtry they ſupplied that defect which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of time had drawn upon them. And this
was the meanes, which the firſt inhabitants of the

ſerve for a caveat, ſo to tranſport an Armie over a
water, where the enemie is within a reaſonable

bodie of the Armie, that advantage may thereby
be taken to cut them off altogether, and ſeparate
them from themſelves. The ſafeſt and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

watches, every watch containing three houres: and
theſe watches were diſtinguiſhed by ſeverall
notes and ſounds of Cornets or Trumpets; that
by the diſtinction and diverſitie thereof it might
eaſily be known what watch was founded. The
charge and office of ſounding the watches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed

                        <p>The firſt watch began alwaies at ſunne-ſetting,

houres as the night contained, being divided into

they called houres:) the ſecond watch continued
untill midnight; and then the third watch began,

to attribute it to their own worth, that they had
ſurprized at unawares a part of their Army,
when ſuch as had paſſed the river could not come

of the utter deſtruction of his Army.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Caeſar</hi> anſwered; That he made the
leſſe doubt of the ſucceſſe of theſe buſineſſes, in
that he well remembred and knew thoſe things
which the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Commiſſioners had related:

theſe injuries were ſuffered ſo long time to reſt
unrevenged, came all in the end to one paſſe. For
the immortall Gods were went ſometimes to give
happineſſe and long impunitie to men, that by the
greater alteration of things, the puniſhment
ſhould be the more grievous for their offences.
Howbeit if they would give Hostages for the
performance of thoſe things which were to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon, and ſatisfie the <hi>Heduans</hi> and <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogians,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Divico</hi> replied, that they were taught by their

them, whereof the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were witneſſes:

into <hi>Gallia</hi> his power was weakened, and
<hi>Divitiacus</hi> his brother reſtored to his ancient

the ſoveraigntie of the <hi>Romans</hi> made him not
onely deſpair of the kingdom, but alſo of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or what other thing ſoever he now injoyed.
And <hi>Caeſar</hi> had found out by inquirie, that the
beginning of the ſlight, when the Cavalrie was
routed, came from <hi>Dumnorix</hi> and his horſemen;
for he commanded thoſe troups which the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duans</hi>

the reſt of the Cavalrie took a fright.</p>

theſe ſuſpicions were ſeconded with matters of

through the confines of the <hi>Sequans,</hi> had cauſed
hoſtages to be given on either ſide, and done all
thoſe things not onely without warrant from the
State, but without acquainting them therewith,
and laſtly, in that he was accuſed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
of the <hi>Heduans,</hi> he thought it cauſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for him to puniſh him, or to command the
State to do juſtice upon him. One thing there
was which might ſeem too oppugne all this; the
ſingular affection of <hi>Divitiacus</hi> his brother to the
people of <hi>Rome;</hi> the great love he bare particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> his loyaltie, juſtice and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and therefore he feared leaſt his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might any way alienate or offend <hi>Divitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
ſincere affection. And therefore before he did
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51174:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any thing, he called <hi>Divitiacus,</hi> and putting aſide

<hi>M. Valerius Procillus,</hi> one of the principall men
of the Province of <hi>Gallia,</hi> his familiar friend, &amp;
whom he ſpecially truſted in matters of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and took notice what <hi>Dumnorix</hi> had utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his preſence, at a Councell of the <hi>Galles,</hi>
ſhewing alſo what informations he had privately
received concerning him: and therefore by way of
advice deſired, that without any offence to him,
either he himſelf might call him in queſtion, or
the State take ſome courſe in the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Divitiacus</hi> imbracing <hi>Caeſar</hi> with many tears
beſought him not to take any ſevere courſe with
his brother; he knew well that all thoſe things
were true, neither was there any man more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thereat then himſelf. For whereas he had
credit and reputation, both at home and amongſt
other States of <hi>Gallia,</hi> and his brother being of
ſmall power by reaſon of his youth, was by his aide
and aſſiſtance grown into favour and authoritie,
he uſed thoſe meanes as an advantage not onely
to weaken his authoritie, but to bring him to
ruine: And yet nevertheleſſe he found himſelf
overruled through brotherly affection, and the
opinion of the common people. And if <hi>Caeſar</hi>
ſhould take any ſtrict account of theſe offences,
there was no man but would think it was done
with his privitie, conſidering the place he held in
his favour; whereupon would conſequently follow
on his behalf, a generall alienation and diſtaſte
of all <hi>Gallia.</hi>

no further: for ſuch was the reſpect he had
unto him, that for his ſake, and at his requeſt he
forgave both the injurie done to the Commonwealth,
and the diſpleaſure which he had juſtly
conceived for the ſame. And thereupon called
<hi>Dumnorix</hi> before him, and in the preſence of his
brother ſhewed him wherein he had deſerved
much blame and reproof; told him what he had
underſtood, and what the State complained on;
adviſed him to avoid all occaſions of miſlike for
the future; that which was paſt he had forgiven
him, at <hi>Divitiacus</hi> his brothers intreaty. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he ſet eſpials upon him, to obſerve his courſes,
that he might be informed what he did, and
with whom he converſed.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day, underſtanding by the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers
that the Enemy was lodged under a Hill,
about eight miles from his Camp, he ſent ſome
to take a view of the Hill, and of the aſcent from
about the ſame. Which was found, &amp; accordingly
reported unto him to be very eaſie. In the third
watch of the night he ſent away <hi>T. Labienus</hi> the
Legat with two legions, and thoſe Guides that
knew the way; commanding him to poſſeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the top of that Hill. Himſelf, about the

before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>P. Cauſidius,</hi> that was held for a great ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
firſt in the Army of <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> and afterwards
with <hi>M. Craſſus,</hi> was ſent before with the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers.
At the breaking of the day, when <hi>Labie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
had got the top of the Hill, and himſelf was
come within a mile and a half of the <hi>Helvetian</hi>
Camp, without any notice to the Enemy either of
his or <hi>Labienus</hi> approach (as was afterwards
found by the Captives) <hi>Cauſidius</hi> came running
as faſt as his horſe could drive, and told him
that the Hill which <hi>Labienus</hi> ſhould have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
was held by the <hi>Galles;</hi> which he perceived
plainly by the Armes and Enſignes of the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetians.</hi>
Whereupon <hi>Caeſar</hi> drew his forces to the
next Hill, and imbattelled the Army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Labienus</hi> (according to the directions he had
from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not to fight, unleſſe he ſaw his forces
near the Enemies Camp that they might both at
the ſame time aſſault them from divers parts at
once) when he had took the Hill, kept his men
from battel, expecting our Army.</p>
                     <p>At length when it was farre in the day, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
underſtood by the Diſcoverers that the Hill
was poſſeſſed by his Party; as alſo that the enemy
was diſlodged, and that <hi>Cauſidius</hi> was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with fear, that he reported to have ſeen
that which he ſaw not. The ſame day he followed
the Enemy at the diſtance he had formerly uſed,
and incamped himſelf three miles from them.
The day following, foraſmuch as the Army was
to be paid in Corn within two days next after,
and that he was but eighteen miles diſtant from
<hi>Bibract,</hi> a great and opulent City of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duans,</hi>

was marvellous important to the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe

throughout this hiſtory, but in all their wars,
from the very cradle of their Empire, it cleared
their Armies from all difficulties, to what extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
ſoever they were put. The firſt reaſon may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51174:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be in regard of their Darts and Slings, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
their Piles; which being a heavy deadly

when the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>livity and downfall of a ſwelling

Neither can the ſhock at handy-blowes be
any thing ſo furious (which was a point of great

their ſtrength in franchiſing the in jury of a riſing

afforded them meanes of a ſtrong retreat, in the
higheſt part whereof they had commonly their
Camps well fenced, and fortified againſt all
chaunces. If it be demanded, whether the upper
ground be of like uſe in regard of our weapons;
I anſwer, that in a skirmiſh of ſhot I take the
advantage to ly in the lower ground rather then
on the hill; for the peeces being haſtily charged, as
commonly they are after the firſt volley, if the
bullet chance to ly looſe, when the noſe of the
peece is lower then the breech, it muſt needs flie
at randome, and be altogether uneffectuall: but
when the noſe ſhall be raiſed upward to the ſide
of a hill, the bullet being rammed in with his own
weight, ſhall fly with greater certainty and fury:
conſidering the nature of the powder to be ſuch,
that the more it is ſtopt and ſhut in, the more it
ſeeketh to enlarge his room, and breaketh forth
with greater violence and fury.</p>
                        <p>Concerning other weapons, I take the upper
ground in the ſhock and incounter to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous,
as well for the ſword as the pike, and
would deſerve as great reſpect, if the controverſy
were decided by theſe weapons, as ſeldome times

That he that will ſhape that beaſt (meaning war)

                        <p>The order of the <hi>Romans</hi> was, at the day of
meaſuring, to give corn to every particular ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
for a certain time, which was commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined
by circumſtances: and by the meaſure which
was given them they knew the day of the next
paiment; for every footman received after the rate
of a buſhell a week, which was thought ſufficient
for him and his ſervant. For if they had payed
them their whole ſtipend in money, it might have
been waſted in unneceſſarie expenſes: but by this
meanes they were ſure of proviſion for the time
determined; and the ſequell of the war was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
cared for by the Generall.</p>
                        <p>The Corn being delivered out, was husbanded,
ground with hand-milles, which they carried al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
with them, and made into haſty cakes,
dainty enough for a ſouldiers mouth, by no other
but themſelves and their ſervants. Neither could
they ſell it or exchange it for bread; for <hi>Saluſt</hi>
reckoneth this up amongſt other diſhonours of
the diſcipline corrupted, that the ſouldiers ſold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their corn which was given them by the
Treaſurer, and bought their bread by the day. And
this manner of proviſion had many ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
which are not incident to our cuſtome
of victualling: for it is impoſſible that victuallers
ſhould follow an Armie upon a ſervice in the

with ſufficient proviſion for an Armie: And
by that meanes the Generall cannot attend ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages

and the ſouldiers on the other ſide careleſſe of the

neither the publick good nor his private commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51174:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is nothing to be looked for but famine
and confuſion. Whereas the <hi>Romans,</hi> by their
manner of proviſion, impoſed the generall care of
the publick good upon the chief Commander,
whoſe dutie it was to provide ſtore of Corn for
his Armie; and the particular care upon every
private ſouldier, whom it eſpecially concerned to
ſee that the allowance which the Commonweale
had in plentifull manner given him for his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
might not be waſted through negligence
or prodigalitie: which excellent order the nature
of our victuals will no way admit. Their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and the next conſederate States furniſhed
their Armies continually with Corn; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by this place, that for proviſion of grain
he depended altogether upon the <hi>Hedui:</hi> and

uſed to this purpoſe: The <hi>Haſtati</hi> being in front,
did ever begin the battel: and if they found
themſelves too weak to repell the enemy, or were
happily forced to a retreat, they drew themſelves
through theſe allies or diſtances, which were
in the ſecond battel, between the maniples of
the <hi>Principes,</hi> into the ſpace which was between
the <hi>Principes</hi> and the <hi>Triarii;</hi> and there they
reſted themſelves, whilſt the Princepes took their
place and charged the Enemy. Or otherwiſe, if
the Commanders found it needfull, they filled up
thoſe diſtances of the <hi>Principes;</hi> and ſo united
with them into one body, they charged the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
all in groſſe; and then if they prevailed not,
they retired into the ſpaces between the <hi>Triarii,</hi>
and ſo they gave the laſt aſſault, all the three bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
being joyned into one.</p>
                        <p>Now if we examine by the current of the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

was no other thing but the diviſion of the
<hi>Haſtati, Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii,</hi> according to
the manner of the firſt inſtitution. And leaſt any
man ſhould dream of that ordinary diviſion,
which is likewiſe threefold, the two cornets and
the battel, and in that ſenſe he might ſay to have

otherwiſe he would have ſaid, <hi>ſucceſſerunt ſub

for ſo were the parts of that diviſion
termed. Again, in the retreat which the <hi>Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
made to the hill, when he ſaith that the firſt
and ſecond battel followed cloſe upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and the third oppoſed it ſelf againſt the <hi>Boii</hi>

ſo fitly be applied to this circumſtance, as that
from front to back.</p>
                        <p>But that place in the firſt of the Civill wars
taketh away all ſcruple of controverſy, where he
uſeth the very ſame terms of <hi>prima, ſecunda,</hi> and
<hi>tertia Acies:</hi> forbeing to encamp himſelf near
unto <hi>Afranius,</hi> and fearing leaſt his ſouldiers
ſhould be interrupted in their work, he cauſed
the firſt and ſecond battel to ſtand in Arms, and
keep their diſtance, to the end they might ſhroud
and cover the third battel (which was imploied
in making a ditch behind them) from the view
of the enemy; and this kind of imbattelling <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
obſerved in moſt of his fights: by which it
appeareth that he uſed the very ſame order and
diſcipline for imbattelling, as was inſtituted by
the old <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning the ancient names of <hi>Haſtati,
Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii,</hi> which <hi>Ramus</hi> in his
<hi>Militia Julii Caeſaris</hi> urgeth to be omitted
throughout the whole hiſtory, I grant they are
ſeldome uſed in theſe Commentaries in the ſenſe
of their firſt inſtitution: for the <hi>Haeſtati,</hi> when
the diſcipline was firſt erected, were the youngeſt
pooreſt of the legionary ſouldiers; and the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi>
were the luſty and able-bodied men;
and the <hi>Triarii</hi> the eldeſt and beſt experienced.
But in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Camp there was little or no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
either of valour or yeares between the
<hi>Haſtati, Principes and Triarii;</hi> which he
nameth <hi>Prima, Secunda, and Tertia Acies;</hi>
and therefore they were never termed by thoſe
names in reſpect of that difference.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding in regard of order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of diſcipline, that vertue might be rewarded
with honour, and that time might challenge the
priviledge of a more worthy place, the ſaid
diſtinctions and terms were religiouſly obſerved.
For in the battel with <hi>Petreius</hi> at <hi>Ilerda</hi> in
<hi>Spain,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de bello Civili.</note> he mentioneth the death of <hi>Q. Fulginius,

and in the overthrow at <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de bello Civili.</note> he ſaith
that the Eagle-bearer being grievouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
commended the ſafety of his Enſigne to the
horſemen, all the Centurions of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
being ſlain, <hi>praeter Principem priorem.</hi>
And for the <hi>Triarii,</hi> there is no term more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in <hi>Caeſar</hi> then <hi>Primipilus;</hi> which name,
by the rules of the ancient diſcipline, was given
to none but to the chiefeſt Centurion of the firſt
maniple of the <hi>Triarii:</hi> whereby it appeareth that
the maniples kept the ſame names in regard of a
neceſſary diſtinction, although peradventure the
<hi>Haſtati</hi> were as good ſouldiers as either the
<hi>Principes</hi> or the <hi>Triarii.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As touching the ſpaces between the maniples,
whereinto the firſt battel did retire it ſelf if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
urged them, I never found any mention
of them in <hi>Caeſar:</hi> excepting once here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
where in a skirmiſh the <hi>Britans</hi> ſo
urged the court of guard, which kept watch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent out
two other Cohorts to ſuccour them; who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
diſtance between them as they ſtood, the
court of guard retired it ſelf in ſafety through
that ſpace into the Camp. Otherwiſe we never
find that the firſt battel made any retreat into
the allies, between the maniples of the ſecond
battel; but when it failed in any part, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third went preſently to ſecond them:
as appeareth in the battel following with <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſtus,</hi>
and in divers others.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the uſe of this triple battel,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. de militia Romana.</note> what
can be ſaid more then <hi>Lipſius</hi> hath done? where
he laieth open the particular commodities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as far forth as a ſpeculative judgement can
diſcern of things ſo far remote from the uſe
of this age, which never imitateth this triple
battel but only in a march: for then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they make three companies, a Vangard, a
Battel, and a Rereward: but in imbattelling
they draw theſe three Companies all in front,
making two cornets and the battel, without any
other troups to ſecond them.</p>
                        <p>But let this ſuffice concerning <hi>Caeſar</hi> his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

in imbattelling: for they maintained pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

were able to bear any ſhock, how violent ſo

maketh 16, which is the fourth doubling from a

in regard of both the extremes. For every one of

which they were diſtinctly known. But the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
deſcription requireth a larger diſcourſe
then can be comprehended in theſe ſhort obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
He that deſireth further knowledge of
them, may read <hi>Aelianus,</hi> that lived in the time
of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour; and <hi>Arianus</hi> in his
hiſtorie of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, with <hi>Mauritius,</hi>
and <hi>Leo</hi> Imperator; where he ſhall have the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of <hi>Tetraphalangia, Diphalangia, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langia</hi>
unto a unite, with all the diſcipline of the
<hi>Grecians.</hi> The chiefeſt thing to be obſerved is, that
the <hi>Grecians</hi> having ſuch skill in imbattelling,
preferred a <hi>Phalanx</hi> before all other formes
whatſoever; either becauſe the figure in it ſelf was
very ſtrong; or otherwiſe in regard that it fitted
beſt their weapons, which were long pikes and
targets. But whether <hi>Caeſar</hi> termed the battell of
the <hi>Helvetians</hi> a <hi>Phalanx,</hi> in regard of their
thick manner of imbattelling onely, or otherwiſe
foraſmuch as beſides the form, they uſed the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
weapon of a <hi>Phalanx,</hi> which was the pike,
it remaineth doubtfull. <hi>Brancatio</hi> in his diſcourſes
upon this place, maketh it no controverſie but
that every ſouldier carried a pike and a target.
The target is particularly named in this hiſtorie:
but it cannot ſo eaſily be gathered by the ſame
that their offenſive weapons were pikes. In the
fight at the baggage it is ſaid, that many of the
legionarie ſhouldiers were wounded through the
cart-wheeles, with <hi>tragulae</hi> and <hi>materae,</hi> which are
commonly interpreted Speares and Javelins: and
I take them to be weapons longer then common
darts; but whether they were ſo long as the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſas</hi>
of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> I cannot tell. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
this is certain, that the <hi>Helvetians</hi> have
ever been reputed for the true <hi>Phalangitae,</hi> next
unto the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> and that in their thick
and cloſe imbattelling, they failed not at this time
of the form of a <hi>Phalanx:</hi> for they roofed it ſo
thick with targets, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith they were ſore
troubled, becauſe many of their targets were
faſtened and tied together with piles darted
through them. Which argueth that their <hi>Phalanx</hi>

                        <p>IN this Chapter we may further obſerve the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the <hi>Roman</hi> pile, which being a heavie
deadly weapon, could hardly be fruſtrated with
any reſiſtance, and in that reſpect was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

thick and cloſe battell, or whereſoever elſe
ſtroke was certain, or could hardly deceive
the aime of the caſter: for in ſuch encounters it ſo
galled the enemy, that they were neither able to
keep their order, nor anſwer the aſſault with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
counterbuffe. By which it appeareth that
the onely remedie againſt the Pile was to make
the ranks thin; allowing to every ſouldier a
large podiſme or place to ſtand in, that ſo the
ſtroke might of it ſelf fall without hurt, or by
fore-ſight be prevented; as it ſhall plainly appear
by the ſequele of this hiſtorie, which I will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to note, as the places ſhall offer themſelves to
the examination of this diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>But as touching the Pile,<note place="margin">The Roman Pile deſcribed.</note> which is ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the <hi>Roman</hi> hiſtorie, <hi>Polybius</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
it in this manner; A Pile, ſaith he, is a caſting
weapon, the ſtaffe whereof is almoſt three cubits
long, and it hath <hi>palmarem diametrum,</hi> a
hand-breadth in thickneſs. The ſtaves were
armed with a head of iron, equall in length to
the ſtaffe it ſelf: But in that ſort, that half the head
was faſtened up to the middle of the ſtaffe, with
plates of iron, like the head of a Halbert; and the
other half ſtuck out at the end of the ſtaffe like
a pike, containing a fingers breadth in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and ſo decreaſing leſſe and leſſe upto the
point, which was barbed. This head was ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
toward the points, that the weight of the ſtaffe
would bend it as it ſtuck, as appeareth in this
battel of the <hi>Helvetians.</hi> This weapon was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was called <hi>Pilum,</hi> as <hi>Varro</hi>

was too great a thickneſſe to be managed
by any mans hand, interpreteth it to be four
inches in circuit, if the ſtaffe were either round or
ſquare, for they had of both ſorts, and ſo he maketh
it very manageable; but nothing anſwerable to the
deſcription given by <hi>Polybius,</hi> either informe
or weight.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Patricius</hi> in his <hi>Paralleli</hi> maketh the ſtaffe to
have <hi>Palmarem diametrum</hi> in the butt end,<note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note> but
the reſt of the ſtaffe he maketh to decreaſe taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
unto the head of iron, where it hath the
thickneſſe of a mans finger; and ſo it anſwereth
both in form and weight to a Peſtell, as may be
ſeen by the figure, and I take it to be the meaning
of <hi>Polybius. Patricius</hi> in that place ſetteth down
four diſcommodities of the Pile. Firſt, a furious
and hot-ſpirited enemie will eaſily prevent the
darting of the Pile, with a nimble and ſpeedy
cloſe. And ſo we read that in the battell which
<hi>Caeſar</hi> had with <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> came
ſo violently upn them, that the ſouldiers caſt
away their piles and betook them to their ſwords.

their piles on either part. The ſecond diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
was, that the piles being ſo heavy could not
be caſt any diſtance, but were only ſerviceable
at hand. Thirdly, they could not be caſt with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
aime, or as they ſay, point-blank. And laſtly,
the ſouldiers were to take advantage of ground
backward when they threw them: which might
eaſily diſorder their troups, if they were not very
well experienced.</p>

that all their victories came by buckling at handy-blowes;
for they came alwayes ſo near before
they caſt their pile, that they left themſelves no

to reedify their Towns and Cities, that they
had before deſtroyed and forſaken. Which he did

                        <p>THe directions concerning their rendry and
return were very ſound, and of good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
For firſt, in that he commanded them to
attend his coming in the place where they were,
he took away all motions of new trouble, which
often removes might have cauſed, by the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſome accident which might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened:
aſſuring himſelf that their aboad in that
place would increaſe their miſeries, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ripen that deſire of peace which they made
ſhew of; conſidering that the <hi>Langones,</hi> in
whoſe territories they were, durſt not for fear of
<hi>Caeſars</hi> diſpleaſure furniſh them with any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
in that extremity. Touching the ſecurity
which the <hi>Romans</hi> required of the loyalty of ſuch
people as they conquered, their manner was to
take as hoſtages a ſufficient number of the men-children
of the chiefeſt men of that Nation;
whoſe lives depended upon their Parents fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ended with the firſt ſuſpicion of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
Which cuſtome, beſides the preſent good,
promiſed the like or better ſecurity to the next
age; when as thoſe children by converſation
and acquaintance ſhould be ſo affected to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that returning to their own
country, their actions might rather tend to the
advancement thereof, then any way be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
to the ſame. And leaſt the love of liberty and
freedome ſhould prevail more with them, then
that affection which Nature had injoyned them
to bear to their children; he did what he could to
take away the means and inſtruments of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
by cauſing them to deliver up ſuch Arms
and weapons as were there preſent: and ſo to
become ſutable to that petition of peace which
they had made.</p>
                        <p>The ſumme of all is this; he corrected the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency
of a furious people, and reduced them to
a feeling of their own madneſſe. He kept them
from ſacking the poſſeſſions of many thouſands
in the continent of <hi>Gallia,</hi> and ſent them back
again to continue their name and Nation in the
place where they firſt inhabited; which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                     <p>The Parliament being broken up, the ſame
Princes returned to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and deſired that they
might in ſecret treat with him of the ſafety of
themſelves, and all the reſt: which being
granted, they caſt themſelves in lamentable
manner at his feet, contending with a great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51174:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that thoſe things which they delivered
might not be revealed, as they did to have their
petition granted: foraſmuch as they ſaw that the
diſcovery of ſuch declarations as they propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
would neceſſarily pull upon them moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
afflictions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Divitiacus</hi> the <hi>Heduan,</hi> in the name of the
reſt, delivered, That <hi>Gallia</hi> was divided into
two factions: the <hi>Hedui</hi> were the head of the
one, and the <hi>Arverni</hi> of the other. Theſe two
States contending many years for the principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the <hi>Arverni</hi> with the <hi>Sequans</hi> their Clients,
hired the <hi>Germans</hi> to take their part; of whom
at firſt there paſſed over the <hi>Rhene</hi> ſome fifteen
thouſand: but afterwards, theſe barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
having taſted the plenty and civility of the
<hi>Galles,</hi> drew over many more, that now there
were no leſſe then one hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.
With theſe the <hi>Hedui</hi> and their Clients
had once or oftener fought; but the ſucceſſe
ſorted to their own calamity, and the utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of their Nobility and Senate: with which
loſſes they were ſo broken and decayed, that
whereas heretofore as well by their own credit,
as by the favour of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> they
ſtruck a great ſtroke throughout all <hi>Gallia;</hi> they
were now driven to deliver the chiefeſt of their
State as pledges to the <hi>Sequans,</hi> and to bind
themſelves by oath never to ſeek their releaſe or
freedome, nor to implore the aid of the people of
<hi>Rome,</hi> nor to ſeek means to free themſelves from
their ſoveraignty; onely himſelf of all the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duans</hi>
could not be brought to take that oath, or
to give his children as hoſtages: for which
cauſe he fled to <hi>Rome,</hi> and beſought help of
the Senate, being no way obliged to the contrary
either by oath or hoſtages.</p>
                     <p>But it ſo fell out, that the victory became more
grievous to the <hi>Sequans</hi> then to the <hi>Heduans:</hi>
for that <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> king of the <hi>Germans</hi> was
planted in their territories; and being already
poſſest of a third part of their Country, which
was the beſt part of all <hi>Gallia,</hi> did now require
the <hi>Sequans</hi> to forgo another third part, for that
a few months before there were come unto him
twenty four thouſand <hi>Harudes,</hi> to whom lands
and poſſeſſions were to be allotted. Whereby it
would come to paſſe within a few years that all
the <hi>Galles</hi> would be driven out of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and all the <hi>Germans</hi> would come over the
<hi>Rhene;</hi> for there was no compariſon between
<hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> either in richneſſe of ſoil
or faſhion of life.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi> after he had once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
the <hi>Galles</hi> in a battel near <hi>Amageto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brig,</hi>
he carried himſelf very cruelly and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
requiring the children of all the Nobility
for hoſtages, and ſhewing ſtrange examples of
torture upon them. If any thing were done not
according to his command or deſire, he would
eaſily ſhew himſelf to be a barbarous, fierce and
haſty man, whoſe tyranny they could no longer
endure: and unleſſe there were help to be found
in <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> all the <hi>Galles</hi>
muſt, as the <hi>Helvetians</hi> did, forſake their
Country, and ſeek new houſes and ſeats of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
far remote from the <hi>Germans,</hi> and try
their fortunes, whatever befell them. If theſe
things ſhould haply be diſcovered to <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi>
he would doubtleſſe take a ſevere revenge of all
the pledges in his cuſtody. <hi>Caeſar</hi> might by his
own authority, or the preſence of his Army, or
by the renown of his late victory, or by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> keep the <hi>Germans</hi>
from tranſporting any more Colonies into <hi>Gallia,</hi>
and defend it from the injuries of <hi>Arioviſtus.</hi>
This ſpeech being delivered by <hi>Divitiacus,</hi> all
that were preſent with much weeping beſought
<hi>Caeſar</hi> to give them relief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> obſerved that onely the <hi>Sequans</hi> of all
the reſt did no ſuch matter, or were ſo affected
as the others were; but with their heads hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down, looked mournfully upon the ground:
and wondering at it, asked them the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
To which they made no reply, but ſtood ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
with the ſame countenance of ſorrow. And
having oftentimes iterated his demand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
gaining any word of anſwer; <hi>Divitiacus</hi> the
<hi>Heduan</hi> replied that the ſtate of the <hi>Sequans</hi>
was herein more miſerable and grievous then the
reſt; that they of all others durſt not complain,
or implore aid, although it were in ſecret, as
having before their eyes the crueltie of <hi>Ariovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>
being abſent, no leſſe then if he were preſent.
And the rather, for that other men had ſafe
means of flying away; but the <hi>Sequans,</hi> having
received <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> into their Countrey, and
made him Master of their townes, were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to undergo all miſeries.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being known, <hi>Caeſar</hi> incouraged
the <hi>Galles</hi> with good words, and promiſed them
to have a care of that matter, as having great
hope, that by his meanes and power <hi>Arioviſtus</hi>
ſhould be forced to offer no further injuries. And
thereupon diſmiſſed the Councell.</p>

                        <p>IN this relation there are divers points worthily
recommended to the diſcretion of ſuch as are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51174:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
willing to be directed by other mens miſadven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
As firſt, into what extremities ambition
doth drive her thirſty favourites, by ſuppreſſing
the better faculties of the ſoul, and ſetting ſuch
unbridled motions on foot, as carry men head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into moſt deſperate attempts. For as it had
deſerved commendation in either faction, ſo to
have carried their emulation, that by their own
means and ſtrength applied to the rule of good
government, their authority might wholly have
ſwayed the inclination of the weaker ſtates: ſo
was it moſt odious in the <hi>Sequani</hi> to call in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
forces, to ſatiſfy the appetite of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered
humour; and in the end they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
rewarded.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it appeareth how dangerous a thing
it is to make a ſtranger a ſtickler in a quarrel
which civile diſſenſion hath broached, when the
party that called him in ſhall not be as able to
refuſe his aſſiſtance upon occaſion, as he was
willing to entertain it for advantage.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, the often diſcontents of theſe States
ſhew the force of a preſent evil, which poſſeſſeth
ſo vehemently the powers of the ſoul, that any
other calamity, either already paſt, or yet to
come, how great ſoever, ſeemeth tolerable and
eaſy, in regard of that ſmart which the preſent
grief inflicteth.</p>
                        <p>So the <hi>Sequani</hi> choſe rather to captivate their
liberty to the Barbariſme of a ſavage Nation,
then to indure the <hi>Hedui</hi> to take the hand of
them. And again, to make themſelves vaſſals to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> rather then indure the uſurping cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of the <hi>Germans.</hi> And finally (as the ſequele
of the hiſtory will diſcover) to hazard the loſſe
of life and Country, then to ſuffer the taxes and
impoſitions of the <hi>Romans.</hi> So predominant is
the preſent evil in mens affections, and ſo it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
at the ſeat of our judgement.</p>

were in the ſervitude and thraldome of the

and the <hi>Sequans:</hi> which in ſo great a
ſoveraignty of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> he took to be
very diſhonourable both to himſelf and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal.
As alſo for that he ſaw it very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
ſhould accuſtome by little and little to
ſtock in ſuch multitudes into <hi>Gallia.</hi> Neither
did he think he could moderate or reſtrain ſuch

poſſeſſed all the Continent of <hi>Gallia,</hi> they would,
as the <hi>Cimbri</hi> and <hi>Teutons</hi> had done before,
break out into the Province, and ſo into <hi>Italy:</hi>

                     <p>Theſe things he thought fit with all ſpeed to
prevent: and the rather, for that <hi>Arioviſtus</hi>
was grown to that pride and arrogancy, as was
not to be ſuffered. For which reſpect he thought
it expedient to ſend Embaſſadours unto him, to
appoint ſome indifferent place for parlee; for
that he had to treat with him concerning publick
affairs, and ſome matters that did much import
both of them.</p>

                        <p>I May here take an occaſion to ſpeak ſomewhat
concerning the authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,<note place="margin">Tthe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Roman Generals.</note>
which we ſee to be very large; conſidering
that <hi>Caeſar</hi> of himſelf, without any further leave
of the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> (for what may
be gathered by this hiſtory) did undertake a war
of that conſequence, and put in jeopardy the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
the Province, or what other intereſt the
<hi>Romans</hi> had in <hi>Gallia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherein we are to underſtand, that when the
State of <hi>Rome</hi> did allot the government of any
Province to a Proconſul, they did likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
unto him the careful managing of ſuch
accidents as might any way concern the good of
that regiment. For conſidering that ſuch cauſes
as may trouble a well-ordered government, are
as well externall and forreign, as internall and
bred within the bounds of that Empire: it had
been to ſmall purpoſe to have given him only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to maintain a courſe of wholeſome go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
at home, and no means to take away
ſuch oppoſitions which forraign accident might
ſet up againſt him. And ſo we ſee that <hi>Caeſar</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
the <hi>Helvetian</hi> war, in regard of the
ſafety of the Province: and this again with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioviſtus,</hi>
leaſt the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould ſo multiply in
<hi>Gallia,</hi> that the Province it ſelf might at length
be indangered. Neither had their Generals au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
only to undertake theſe wars; but the
abſolute diſpoſition alſo of the whole courſe
thereof, whether it were to treat, capitulate, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
or what elſe they thought convenient for
the advancement of the Commonweal, did
wholly reſt upon their direction; <hi>republica be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
geſta</hi> being the ſtile of the warrant for all their
actions.</p>
                        <p>Neither may we think that any ſubordinate

commandeth without controulment, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
according to the opportunity of time and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51174:40"/>
occaſion, further then either preſcription or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

the <hi>Roman</hi> affairs were diſtreſſed, and driven to

that whatſoever power reſted either in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls

that there might be no lett or retracting
power to weaken that courſe, which nothing but
an abſolute command could eſtabliſh for the
good of the Commonweal. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this abſolute government, they attributed
ſuch power to the courſe of humane actions, that
by the puniſhment which they inflicted upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

acknowledge that no man, how circumſpect ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

Foraſmuch as he thus requited the honour

of a Parlee concerning the common good;
let him know that theſe were the things that he

that he ſhould deliver up thoſe Hoſtages

<hi>Caeſar</hi> would aſſure him of a greatefull acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance

foraſmuch as in the Conſulſhips of <hi>M.

That he that ſhould obtain the government of the

                     <p>To theſe Mandates <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> replied: The

they to meddle with his proceedings.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Heduans</hi> having tried the fortune of

if they failed in that, the fraternity of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>

                        <p>WHerein for that we find a ſtrange alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no way anſwerable to that courage
which a late-gotten victory doth uſually breed in
noble ſpirits; it ſhall not be amiſſe a little to inſiſt
upon the quality of the accident, and to gather
ſuch brief inſtructions from their weakneſſe, as
may beſt ſerve to qualify the amazement of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and mitigate the frenſy of ſo violent a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And albeit my ignorance in the works of
Nature cannot promiſe any ſuch learning, as
may diſcover the true means and ſecret motions
whereby a fore-conceived fear doth trouble the
ſenſes, and aſtoniſh the mind; yet ſith the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
offereth it to our ſcanning, give me leave only
to note the ſtrangeneſſe of the circumſtance, and
rudely to delineate the pourtraiture of a beaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener
ſeen then well known, uſing the unwieldy
pile for my pencill, and ſuting my ſpeech to a
warlike auditory. I know not how it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
but thus it may happen, that when the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
receive intelligence of an eminent evil, which
may either diſpoſſeſs the ſoul of this earthly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or trouble the quiet wherein ſhe reſteth,
the ſpirits (as it ſeemeth) by the direction of
their ſoveraign Miſtreſſe, retire themſelves into
the inner cabinets and ſecreter pavillions of the
body, where the chiefeſt part of the ſoul is moſt
reſident: and ſo they leave the frontier quarters
of her kingdome naked and ungarriſoned, the
better to ſtrengthen that capitall City of the
heart, out of which the life cannot fly, but to the
utter ruine and deſtruction of the whole body.
For fear is not only a perturbation of the ſoul
proceeding from the opinion it hath of ſome evil
to come; but it is alſo a contraction and cloſing
up of the heart, when the bloud and the ſpirits
are recalled from the outward parts, to aſſiſt that
place which giveth life and motion to all the reſt.
In this Chaos and confuſion of humours and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
when the multiplicity of faculties (which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
require an ordinate diſtinction in their
ſervice, and by the order of nature ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
into ſeverall inſtruments, and be dilated
throughout the body) are thus blended confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
together, the conceptions of the mind, which
preſently riſe from theſe advertiſements, are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
choaked with the diſordered mixture of ſo
many ſeverall properties, and are ſtifled as it were
in the throng, before they can be tranſported to
our judgement or examined by reaſon, for want
of that ordinate uniformity of place which nature
requireth in the powers of the mind. And hence
proceedeth that amazedneſſe and aſtoniſhment,
which ſo daunteth the hearts of men, when they
are taken with this paſſion, that becauſe the ſoul
giveth no counſell, the body can afford no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but ſtandeth forzen through the extremity
of the perturbation, benummed in ſenſe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
of the ſpirits. So we read that <hi>Theophilus</hi>
the Emperour, in an overthrow which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him by the <hi>Hagarens,</hi> was ſtrucken with
ſuch an exceſſive fear, that he could not betake
himſelf to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>light <hi>(Adeo pavor etiam auxilia for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midat)</hi>
untill one of his chief Commanders ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by the ſhoulder, as though he were to
awake him out of a deep ſleep, threatned him
with preſent death, if he would not prevent the
ruine of the Empire, by uſing that means which
was only left for his ſafety.</p>
                        <p>Again, if in that turbulent conſiſtory the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
chance diſtinctly to receive any apprehenſion
proceeding from the forgeing faculty of the ſoul,
they carry it preſently to execution before it be
examined by reaſon, and follow the action with
ſuch vehemency, that they leave no place for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
advice and reknowledgement. And this is
the cauſe that oftentimes through extremity of
fear, to avoid one evil we run headlong into a
worſe, and find a greater danger in the means we
uſe to avoid a leſſe; becauſe reaſon did not firſt
try the apprehenſion, before it was delivered to
externall Agents. And ſo we find in the battel
between <hi>Germanicus</hi> and the <hi>Almans,</hi> that two
groſſe troups of ſouldiers were driven into ſuch
an extaſy of fear, that taking, contrary courſes to
avoid one &amp; the ſame danger, they either of them
fled to that place which the other had quitted: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could they be adviſed by each others flight,
that the places which they ſought after afforded
them no remedy.</p>
                        <p>And albeit reaſon be called to counſell when
a parlee is ſummoned of compoſition, yet it bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſo ſmall a ſway in the conſultation, that the
will of it ſelf concludeth to betray vertue to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and ſo to purchaſe peace with the loſſe of
the ſouls chiefeſt treaſure: which ought ever to
be eſtimated at a higher rate then any other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
which can betide the mind. For among
all the ſenſible things of this world, there is no
creature that hath ſuch a confuſed fear, or is more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51174:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
amazed therewith, then man is: neither is there
any miſery greater, or any bondage more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
ſervile or vile, then this, which maketh men
very abjects of all other creatures, to redeem the
evil which the danger threatneth: and then doth
ſhame follow after ſo baſe a part, and aggravate
the burthen of the ſin with loathſome diſgrace,
and penitent diſcontentment; adding oftentimes
Aloes to Wormwood, and making the end
grievouſer then the beginning. And thus doth
danger breed fear, and fear yieldeth to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and diſhonour bringeth ſhame, &amp; ſhame
being alwayes mingled with wrath and anger,
revengeth it ſelf upon it ſelf, and bringeth
more peril then the firſt danger could threaten.</p>
                        <p>Whereby it appeareth that as the affections of
the mind are bred one of another; ſo on the
contrary part ſome are bridled and reſtrained by
others: for as envy, hatred and anger riſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of love; ſo is joy leſſened with grief, envy
with mercy, and fear with ſhame.</p>
                        <p>But foraſmuch as all ſuch perturbations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
of ignorance and inconſiderateneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we think that the evil is greater then indeed
it is; let us conſider what diſpoſition of our
judgement beſt moderateth the violent heat of
theſe affections. And firſt, touching the paſſages
whereby the ſoul receiveth her advertiſements, as
they are of divers natures, the chiefeſt whereof
are the eye and the ear; ſo are their aviſoes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in quality, and require a ſeverall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to be rightly diſcerned. The intelligence
by the eye is more certain then that which cometh
by the way of hearing; foraſmuch as the eye is
a witneſſe it ſelf of every action whereof it taketh
notice, neither is it deceived in its proper object:
and therefore the judgement is not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to determine definitively how great or how
ſmall the danger is, when the relations carry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
that certainty. And albeit the care in like
manner be not deceived in her proper object, for
it faithfully giveth up that ſenſe which ſound hath
delivered unto it; yet foraſmuch as the fantaſy
hath greater ſcope to coin her vain conceptions,
in regard of the abſence of the action, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that the diſcourſing faculty be called for an
aſſiſtant, before the judgement can truly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:
and then it will appear that the truth doth
not alwayes anſwer the report which is made
thereof; inaſmuch as diſeaſed ſpirits will not
ſtick to dilate or qualify relations, according to
the key wherein they themſelves are tuned. And
therefore this firſt cometh to be conſidered of in
all ſuch violent commotions, by which of theſe
two ſenſes the firſt intelligence was received.
But concerning the judgement it ſelf this is moſt
certain, that the more it is infected with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the fleſh, the more violent are the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the ſoul. And again, the purer the
judgement is, and the higher it is lifted up from
earthly natures, being no further intereſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
then to hold a reſolution of well doing, the
fewer and lighter are the affections which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and moleſt it: for then it better diſcerneth
the truth and falſehood, good or evil that is in
things.</p>
                        <p>To redreſſe this inconvenience, <hi>Caeſar</hi> betook
himſelf to the fitteſt and moſt proper remedy;
which was by the authority of his ſpeech to reſtore
reaſon to her former dignity, and by diſcourſe,
which fear had interrupted in them, to put down
a uſurping paſſion, which had ſo troubled the
government of the ſoul, recalling it to the mean
of true reſolution, which was to moderate audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with warineſſe, but not to choak valour with
beaſtly cowardice: for theſe Oratory inducing
perſwaſions were not the leaſt point of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
conſidering how they framed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
habite of the mind (being the fountain and
beginning of all motion) to give life and force
to thoſe actions, which the ſeverity of outward
diſcipline commanded. For as laws and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of men inforce obedience of the body: ſo
reaſon and perſwaſions muſt win the ſouls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
according to that ſaying, <hi>Homines duci

Firſt, that any ſhould be ſo inquiſitive, as to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
to themſelves whither, &amp; upon what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they were carried. Concerning <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi>

earneſtly ſued for the friendſhip of the people of

                     <p>If any man were moved at the flight and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow

of battel, he ſuddenly ſet upon them as they
were diſperſed, and ſo overcame them, rather by
policy then by force. Which although it took
place againſt ſavage and unskilfull people, yet
was not <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> ſo ſimple as to think that he
could inſnare our Armies with the like ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
As for thoſe that fained the cauſe of their
fear to be the difficulty of proviſion of Corn,
and the dangerouſneſſe of the way, they ſeemed
very arrogant in their conceits, in preſuming to
direct their Generall, as if he had not known
what pertained to his duty. The <hi>Sequans</hi> and
<hi>Lingons</hi> had undertook that charge; beſides that
Corn was almoſt ripe every where in the fields:
and what the wayes were ſhould ſhortly be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Whereas it was given out that the ſouldiers
would not obey his Mandates, nor advance
their Standards, he little valued it; for he was
well aſſured, that if an Army refuſed to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to their Generall, it was either becauſe he
was thought to be unfortunate in his enterpriſes,
or elſe for that he was notoriouſly convicted of
Avarice: but the whole courſe of his life ſhould
witneſſe his innocency, and the overthrow of the
<hi>Helvetians</hi> his happineſſe. And therefore that
which he was minded to have put off for a longer
time, he would now put in execution out of hand:
for the night following, at the fourth watch he
would diſlodge from thence; that without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay he might underſtand, whether ſhame
and reſpect of their duty would prevail more with
them, then fear or cowardiſe. And though
he wiſt that no man elſe would follow him, yet
notwithſtanding he would go with the tenth legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alone, of whom he had no doubt or ſuſpicion,
and would take them as a guard to his perſon.</p>
                     <p>

                        <p>This queſtion was handled in the <hi>Roman</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
by <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> ſurnamed
<hi>Africanus,</hi> when they ſate in councell how to
rid their Country of that ſubtile <hi>Carthaginian,</hi>
that for ſixteen years ſpace had fretted like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
the beauty of <hi>Italy,</hi> waſted the land, and
brought it to deſolation, ſacked their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
or alienated them from their duty, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
their Armies, ſlain their Conſuls, and
threatned their imperiall City with ruine and
deſtruction. <hi>Fabius,</hi> upon the motion to make
war in <hi>Africk,</hi> thought it agreeable to nature
firſt to defend that which was their own, before
they attempted other mens poſſeſſions: when
peace was eſtabliſhed in <hi>Italy,</hi> then let war be ſet
on foot in <hi>Africk;</hi> and firſt let them be without
fear themſelves, before they went about to terrify
others: for thoſe forces afforded little hope of
victory in another kingdome, that were not able
to free their own Country from ſo dangerous an
enemy. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> overthrew the <hi>Athenian</hi>
Commonweal with the like counſell: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> let them be ſure of this, that
they ſhould find him a ſorer enemy in his own
Country then in another kingdome.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Scipio</hi> on the other ſide, carried on with the
honour of ſo glorious an enterpriſe, wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſons nor example to impugne <hi>Fabius</hi> his
authority: for he ſhewed that <hi>Agathocles</hi> the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſian</hi>
king, being a long time afflicted with the
<hi>Punick</hi> war, averted the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
by tranſporting his forces into <hi>Africk.</hi> But
how powerfull it was to take away fear by retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
danger upon the Oppreſſour, could there be
a preſenter example then <hi>Hannibal?</hi> There was
great difference in the nature of the action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſpoil and waſt of a ſtrangers Country,
and to ſee their own native Country waſted with
ſword and deſtruction: <hi>Plus animi eſt inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
periculum, quam propulſanti.</hi> For he that
invadeth anothers kingdome, eaſily diſcovereth
both the advantage which may be taken againſt
the enemy, and the ſtrength whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.
And amongſt the variable events of war,
many unexpected occaſions ariſe, which preſent
victory to him that is ready to take it; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtrange chances ſo alter the courſe of things,
that no foreſight can diſcern what may happen.</p>
                        <p>With theſe and the like remonſtrances, this
queſtion of no leſſe doubt then importance was
handled by two famous and worthy Captains,
whoſe minds (as it ſeemed) were intangled with
ſuch particular affections for the preſent, as might
rather draw them to wreſt reaſon to their own
humour, then to determine in ſincerity of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon what ſpecialities the truth was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
in the contrariety of their poſitions. But to
leave other commodities or diſadvantages which
were annexed unto either part, I will onely ſet
down ſome reaſons, to prove how valour and
courage may either grow or be abated by the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
which riſe in a war of that nature. And
firſt this cannot be denied, the teſtimony of an
infallible truth being grounded upon the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of mans nature, that as advantage bringeth
hope of victory, and hope conceiveth ſuch ſpirits
as uſually follow, when the thing which is hoped
for is effected, and thereby the courage becometh
hardy and reſolute in victory: ſo on the other
ſide, diſadvantage and danger breed fear, &amp; fear ſo
checketh valour, and controuleth the ſpirits, that
vertue and honour give place to diſtruſt, and yield
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51174:43"/>
up their intereſt to ſuch directours as can afford
nothing but diffidence and irreſolution.</p>
                        <p>Neither can to be denied but he that ſetteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an enemy in a ſtrange country, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth
ſuch attempts as might be made upon his
own territories, hath that advantage which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
life unto action, and ſteeleth his enterpriſe
with reſolution. For beſides the commodity of
leaving when he liſt, and proceeding as far forth
as he ſhall find his means able to fortunate his
attempts, he knoweth that the ſtrife and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
is not forth is native Country, which he quietly
enjoyeth, and is reſerved at all times to entertain
him, howſoever Fortune ſhall favour his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes:
but for a Strangers kingdome, which
his ambition thirſteth after, wherein, foraſmuch
as the riches and wealth of that State are laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them as the recompence of their labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the honour which is atchieved thereby, every
mans valour ſoareth at a high pitch, and their
courage is increaſed, without any trouble or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance
of the other faculties of the mind. But
when a Prince ſhall be aſſaulted in his own
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

parts, the better faculties will loſe their preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of adviſing how the enemy may be beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
when as every man ſhall apprehend the
terrour of the danger, and few or none conceive
the true means to avoid it.</p>
                        <p>And albeit the preſence of ſuch things as are
deareſt to his ſoul, as the piety and reſpect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
parents, the tender affection towards wife
and children, are ſufficient to raiſe valour to the
higheſt point of reſolution; yet the motives are
of ſuch weight, as will rather make them diſſident
of their own worth, as unſufficient to maintain
ſo great a cauſe, then hold them in that key
which true honour affecteth: foraſmuch as the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and fear of ſo great a danger will preſent a
greater meaſure of woes to their mind, then the
hope of victory can afford them joy.</p>
                        <p>Hence therefore groweth the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him that ſeeketh to maintain that eſtate
which he hath in poſſeſſion by force of Arms,
and another that ſeeketh to increaſe his means
by valour. For the former is preſented with the
danger of loſing all his eſtate; which affrighteth
and troubleth, having no other reward propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto him: and the other looketh upon the
advantage which he gaineth by overcoming,
which much increaſeth his valour, without any
loſſe or diſadvantage, if he chance to be put to the
worſt. And therefore there is alwayes great odds
between him that hath already loſt his goods,
and is by that means become deſperate, having
nothing further to loſe; and another that yet
keepeth his ſubſtance, but is in danger to loſe it:
for fear will ſo diſmay his mind, that he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſtruſt his own ability, then entertain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of valour.</p>
                        <p>To prove this, we need not ſeek other examples,
then thoſe imperiall Cities in whoſe cauſe this
controverſy was firſt moved. For when <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
was come into <hi>Italy,</hi> and had defeated <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius</hi>
the Conſul at <hi>Trebia,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> were
driven into ſuch an extaſy of terrour, that they
believed verily that the enemy was then coming
to aſſault the City; neither had they any hope
or aide in themſelves to keep or defend the ſame.
On the other ſide, <hi>Scipio</hi> was no ſooner landed
in <hi>Africk,</hi> but there was ſuch a tumult in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
as though the City had been already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
neither could the opinion of victory, which
<hi>Hannibal</hi> by a conquering Army in <hi>Italy</hi> had
confirmed for ſixteen years together, prevail in
the apprehenſion of ſo imminent a danger. And
then that which <hi>Fabius</hi> borrowed of Nature to
teach the <hi>Romans</hi> (that firſt men ought to defend
their own, before they ſeek other mens poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons)
was carefully followed by the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi>
for with all ſpeed they ſent for <hi>Hannibal</hi>
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> to be their Champion againſt young
<hi>Scipio.</hi> If therefore other things be correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(as there are many other particularities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the power and ſtrength of either Nation
to be conſidered) I take it much better for a
Prince to invade an enemy in his own country,
then to attend him at home in his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

                        <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> made little anſwer to <hi>Caeſars</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
but ſpake much of his own vertues and
valour; That he was come over the <hi>Rhene,</hi> not
out of his own deſire, but at the mediation and
intreaty of the <hi>Galles;</hi> that he had not left his
houſe and kindred but with great hope of high
rewards; the poſſeſſions he had in <hi>Gallia</hi> were
given him by themſelves; their hoſtages were
voluntarily delivered unto him; he took tribute
by the law of Arms, which was ſuch as Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
might lay upon the vanquiſhed; he made
no war upon the <hi>Galles,</hi> but the <hi>Galles</hi> made war
upon him: All the States of <hi>Gallia</hi> came to
fight againſt him, and had put themſelves into
the field, whoſe forces were in one battell all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51174:44"/>
and overthrown. If they were deſirous
to make another triall, he was ready to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them: but if they would have peace, it were
an injury to retract that tribute which of their
own accord they had paid untill that time. He
expected that the Amity of the people of <hi>Rome</hi>
ſhould be rather an honour and a ſafety, then a
loſſe unto him, and that he had ſought it to that
end: but if by their meanes the tribute due unto
him ſhould be retracted, he would as willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
their friendſhip as he had deſired it. In that
he had brought ſo many <hi>Germans</hi> into <hi>Gallia,</hi> it
was rather for his own defence, then of any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to ſubdue the Country; as might appear by
that he had not come thither but upon intreaty,
and ſet no warre on foot but for his own defence.
He was ſeated in <hi>Gallia</hi> before the <hi>Romans</hi>
came thither; neither had the people of <hi>Rome</hi>
before that time carried their Army beyond the
bounds of their Province: and therefore he
knew not what he meant to intrude himſelf into
his poſſeſſions. This was his Province of <hi>Gallia,</hi>
as that was ours: and as it was not lawfull for
him to command in our quarters, ſo it was not
fitting that they ſhould diſturb his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>In that he alleadged the <hi>Heduans</hi> were by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of Senate adopted into the amity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Rome;</hi> he was not ſo barbarous, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with the courſe of things, as to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that in the laſt warre of the <hi>Allobroges</hi>
they were aiding and aſſiſting to the <hi>Romans:</hi>
and in the quarrell the <hi>Heduans</hi> had with the
<hi>Sequans,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> were in like manner aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
unto them. Whereupon he had good occaſion
to ſuſpect that <hi>Caeſar,</hi> under pretence of league
and amity, kept his Army in <hi>Gallia</hi> for his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and deſtruction: and that if he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
and withdraw his Army out of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
he would no longer take him for a friend,
but for an enemy. And if his fortune were to
ſtay him, he ſhould perform a very acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to many noble and chief men of <hi>Rome</hi> (as he
had well underſtood by Letters and Meſſengers
he had received from them) whoſe favour and
amity he ſhould purchaſe by taking away his life.
But if he would depart, and leave him the free
poſſeſſion of <hi>Gallia,</hi> he would gratify him with
great rewards: and what war ſoever he deſired
to be undertaken, ſhould be gone through with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
without his perill or charge.</p>

                           </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Rutenes</hi> were in due courſe of
warre ſubdued by <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus:</hi> whom
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had pardoned, and not redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to a Province, or made them ſtipendiaries.
And if antiquitie were looked into, the people of
<hi>Rome</hi> had good claim to that Countrey: but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as the intention and will of the Senate
was they ſhould remain a free people, they were
ſuffered to be governed by their own lawes, and
left unto themſelves, notwithſtanding any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
conqueſt by force of Armes.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things were treated of in parlee,
it was told <hi>Caeſar</hi> that <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> horſemen did
approach nearer to the Mount, and that accoſting
our men they aſſaulted them with ſtones and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weapons: whereupon he brake off, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
himſelf to his Party, commanding them
not to caſt a weapon at the enemy. For albeit he
well perceived he might without peril of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
legion give battel to his Cavalry; yet he
thought ſit to refrain, leaſt it ſhould be ſaid he
had intrapped them with a parlee, contrary to
faith made and agreement. After it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
amongst the vulgar ſouldiers how arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
<hi>Arioviſtus</hi> had carried himſelf in the
treaty, forbidding the <hi>Romans</hi> to frequent any
part of <hi>Gallia,</hi> and that their Cavalry had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
our men, and that thereupon the parlee
brake off; the Army was poſſeſſed with a greater
alacrity and deſire to fight then before. Two
dayes after <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
ſignifying that he deſired to treat with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thoſe things which were left unperfect,
and thereupon willed him to appoint another day
of meeting; or if he liked not that, to ſend ſome
unto him with authority to conclude of ſuch
things as ſhould be found expedient. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was
unwilling to give any further meeting; and the
rather, for that the day before the <hi>Germans</hi>
could not be reſtrained from violence and force
of Armes. Neither did he think he might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expoſe the perſon of any of his followers to the
inhumanity of ſuch barbarous people; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought it fitteſt to ſend unto him <hi>M. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius
Procillus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>C. Valerius Cabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
ae vertuous young man, and well bred, whoſe

Flaccus:</hi> which he did the rather in regard of
his ſingular integrity, and his perfectneſſe in the
<hi>French</hi> tongue, which <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> through long
continuance had learned; and that the <hi>Germans</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51174:44"/>
had no cauſe of offence againſt him. And with
him he ſent <hi>M. Titius,</hi> that was familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi> with inſtruction to
hear what was ſaid, and to make report thereof
to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Whom as ſoon as <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> ſaw come
into his Camp, he cried out in the preſence of his
Army, demanding wherefore they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and whether they were not ſent as Spies.
And as they were about to make anſwer, he cut
them off and commanded them to be put in Irons.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day he removed his Camp, and
lodged himſelf under a hill, ſix miles from <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi>
The next day he brought his forces along by
<hi>Caeſars</hi> Camp, and incamped himſelf two miles
beyond him; of purpoſe to cut off all ſuch corn
and convoies as ſhould be ſent to the <hi>Romans</hi> by
the <hi>Heduans</hi> and <hi>Sequans.</hi> From that day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by the ſpace of five dayes together, <hi>Caeſar</hi>
imbattelled his men before his Camp; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that if <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> had a mind to give bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
he might do it when he would. But <hi>Ariovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>
all this while kept his Army within his
Camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and daily ſent out his horſemen to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh

                     </p>
                     <p>This was the manner of fighting which the
<hi>Germans</hi> had practiſed: there were 6000 horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and as many ſtrong and nimble footmen,
whom the horſemen had ſelected out of the whole
hoſt, every man one for his ſafeguard: theſe
they had alwayes at hand with them in battell,
and unto theſe they reſorted for ſuccour. If the
horſemen were over-charged, theſe ever ſtept in
to help them. If any one were wounded or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed,
they came about him and ſuccoured him.
If the matter required either to adventure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
or to retire ſpeedily back again, their
ſwiftneſſe was ſuch (through continuall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe)
that hanging on the horſe-mane by the
one hand, they would run as faſt as the horſes.</p>

the choiſe of theſe footmen was permitted to the
horſemen, in whoſe ſervice they were to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
that every man might take his friend, in
whom he repoſed greateſt confidence. When
they were overcharged, theſe ſtept in to help
them; if any man were wounded or unhorſed,
he had his footman ready to aſſiſt him: and
when they were to go upon any ſpeedy ſervice,
or ſuddenly to retire upon advantage, they ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves upon the mane of the horſes with
one hand, and ſo ran as faſt as the horſemen
could go. Which ſervices they could not poſſibly
have performed without confuſion and diſorder,
if the footmen had not ſeverally attended upon
them, according to the affection ſpecified in their
particular election.</p>
                        <p>The principall uſe of theſe footmen of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
conſiſted in the aid of their own horſemen
upon any neceſſity, not ſo much regarding their
ſervice upon the enemy, as the aſſiſtance of their
horſemen. But the <hi>Romans</hi> had long before pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed
the ſame Art to a more effectuall purpoſe;
namely, as a principall remedy not onely to reſiſt,
but to defeat far greater troups of horſe then the
enemy was able to oppoſe againſt them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the moſt ancient memory which hiſtory men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth,
is recorded by <hi>Livie</hi> in the ſecond <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
war, at the ſiege of <hi>Capua,</hi> under the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Quintus Fulvius</hi> the Conſul; where
it is ſaid that in all their conflicts, as the <hi>Roman</hi>
legions returned with the better, ſo their cavalry
was alwayes put to the worſt: and therefore
they invented this means, to make that good by Art
which was wanting in force.</p>
                        <p>Out of the whole army were taken the choiſeſt
young men, both for ſtrength and agility, and to
them were given little round bucklers, and ſeven
darts apiece in ſtead of their other weapons: theſe
ſouldiers practiced to ride behind the horſemen,
and ſpeedily to light from the horſes at a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word
given, and ſo to charge the Enemy on foot.
And when by exerciſe they were made ſo expert,
that the novelty of the invention no whit affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, the <hi>Roman</hi> horſemen went forth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with the enemy, every man carrying
his foot-ſouldier behind him; who at the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuddenly alighting, charged upon the enemy
with ſuch a fury, that they followed them in
ſlaughter to the gates of <hi>Capua.</hi> And hence,
ſaith <hi>Livie,</hi> grew the firſt inſtitution of the <hi>Veli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi>
which ever after that time were inrolled
with the legions. The authour of this ſtratagem is
ſaid to be one Q. <hi>Navius</hi> a Centurion, and was
honourablie rewarded by <hi>Fulvius</hi> the Conſul
for the ſame.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saluſt</hi> in the hiſtory of <hi>Jugurth</hi> ſaith, that

was uſed by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as appeareth in the third
book of the Civil war; ſaving that in ſtead of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51174:45"/>
the <hi>Velites,</hi> he mingled with his horſemen four
hundred of the luſtieſt of his legionary ſouldiers,
to reſiſt the cavalry of <hi>Pompey,</hi> while the reſt of

which <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirmeth to be a ſtrong

with a buckler, and a long ſword by their
right ſide. The uſe of their launce was moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
when they charged in troup, pouldron to
pouldron; and that manner of fight afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no means to intermingle footmen: but
when they uſed their darts, every man got what
advantage of ground he could, as our Carbines
for the moſt part do, and ſo the footmen might
have place among them: or otherwiſe for ſo good
an advantage they would eaſily make place for
the foot-men to ſerve among them. But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was, it appeareth by this circumſtance how
little the <hi>Romans</hi> feared troups of horſe, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the beſt means to defeat their horſe was
by their foot companies. But to make it more
plain, of many examples I will only alledge two;
the one out of <hi>Livie,</hi> to prove that the <hi>Roman</hi>
horſemen were not comparable for ſervice to foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:<note place="margin">Lib. 3. De bello Africano.</note>
the other out of <hi>Hirtius,</hi> to ſhew the ſame
effect againſt ſtrangers, &amp; <hi>Numidian</hi> horſemen.</p>
                        <p>In the Conſulſhips of <hi>L. Valerius</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Horatius, Valerius</hi> having fortunately o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
the <hi>Equi</hi> and the <hi>Volſci, Horatius</hi>
proceeded with as great courage in the war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Sabines;</hi> wherein it happened, that
in the day of battell the <hi>Sabines</hi> reſerved two
thouſand of their men to give a freſh aſſault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the left Cornet of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as they were
in conflict: which took ſuch effect, that the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionary
footmen of that Cornet were forced
to retreat. Which the <hi>Roman</hi> horſemen (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in number ſix hundred) perceiving,
and not being able with their horſe to make
head againſt the enemy, they preſently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
their horſes, and made haſt to make good
the place on foot; wherein they carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo valiantly, that in a moment of time they
gave the like advantage to their footmen againſt
the <hi>Sabines,</hi> and then betook themſelves again
to their horſes, to purſue the enemy in chaſe as
they fled. For the ſecond point; the <hi>Numidians,</hi>
as <hi>Caeſar</hi> witneſſeth, were the beſt horſemen that
ever he met with, and uſed the ſame Art as the
<hi>Germans</hi> did, mingling among them light-armed
footmen. And Ambuſcado of theſe <hi>Numidians</hi>
charging the legions upon a ſuddain, the hiſtory
ſaith that <hi>primo impetu legionis Equitatus &amp;
levis armatura, hoſtium nullo negotio, loco pulſa
&amp; dejecta eſt de colle.</hi> And as they ſometimes
retired, and ſometimes charged upon the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the Army, according to the manner of
the <hi>Numidian</hi> fight, the hiſtory ſaith, <hi>Caeſariani

that to free himſelf of this inconvenience, he took
his horſemen out of the rereward, and placed his
legions there, <hi>ita vim hoſtium per legionarium

marched, he cauſed three hundred ſouldiers of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

they might be ready upon all occaſions; <hi>Quos

I alledge the very words of the hiſtory, to
take away all ſuſpicion of falſifying or wreſting
any thing to an affected opinion. If any man
will look into the reaſon of this diſparity, he
ſhall find it to be chiefly the work of the <hi>Roman</hi>
pile (an unreſiſtable weapon) and the terrour
of horſemen; eſpecially when they were caſt
with the advantage of the place, and fell ſo thick
that there was no means to avoid them.</p>
                        <p>But to make it plain that any light-armed foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
could better make head againſt a troup of
horſe, then the Cavalrie of their own partie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they bear but the ſame weapons: let us
conſider how nimble and ready they were that
fought on foot, either to take an advantage, or to
ſhun and avoid any danger; caſting their darts
with far greater ſtrength and more certainty,
then the horſemen could do. For as the force of
all the engines of old time, as the <hi>Baliſtae, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultae</hi>
and <hi>Tolenones,</hi> proceeded from that ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and reſting Centre which nature affordeth
as the only ſtrength and life of the engine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo
what force ſoever a man maketh, muſt principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceed from that firmneſſe and ſtay which
Nature, by the earth, or ſome other unmoveable
reſt, giveth to the body, from whence it taketh
more or leſſe ſtrength, according to the violence
which it performeth; as he that lifteth up a weight
from the ground, by ſo much treadeth heavier up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth, by how much the thing is heavier
then his body. The footmen therefore having a
ſurer ſtay to counterpoize their forced motion
then the horſemen had, caſt their darts with
greater violence, and conſequently with more
certainty.</p>

that place wherein the <hi>Germans</hi> aboad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſix hundred paces from their Camp, he
choſe a ground meet to incamp in: and marching
thither in three battells, commanded two of
them to ſtand ready in Armes, and the third to
fortify the Camp. <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> ſent ſixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
foot and all his horſe to interrupt the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and hinder the intrenchment. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> as he had before determined,
cauſed two battells to withſtand the enemy, and
the third to go through with the work: which
being ended he left there two legions, and part of
the aſſociate forces, and led the other four legions
back again into the greater Camp.</p>
                     <p>The next day <hi>Caeſar,</hi> according to his cuſtome,
brought his whole power out of both his Camps; &amp;
marching a little from the greater Camp, he put
his men in array, and profered battell to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
but perceiving that <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> would not
ſtirre out of his trenches, about noon he conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Army into their ſeverall Camps. Then
at length <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> ſent part of his forces to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
the leſſer Camp. The incounter continued
very ſharp on both parts untill the evening;
and at ſun-ſetting, after many wounds given
and taken, <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> conveighed his Army
again into their Camp. And as <hi>Caeſar</hi> made
inquiry of the captives, what the reaſon was that
<hi>Arioviſtus</hi> refuſed battell, he found this to be the
cauſe; The <hi>Germans</hi> had a cuſtome, that the
women ſhould by caſting of Lots and Southſaying
declare whether it were for their behoof to fight
or no: and that they found by their Art the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>

                        <p>THe <hi>Romans,</hi> even from the infancy of their
ſtate, were ever zealous admirers of true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and alwayes deſired to behold with the
eye to what meaſure of vertue every man had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
that the tongue with greater fervency of
ſpirit might ſound out the celebration of <hi>Macte
virtute,</hi> which imported more honour then any
wealth that could be heaped upon them. Neither
was this the leaſt part of their wiſedome; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the moſt pretious things that are loſe
much of their worth, if they be not ſuted with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
correſpondent natures, whoſe ſympathy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
much more excellency then is diſcerned
when they appear by themſelves without ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.
For how ſmall is the beauty which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath given to the eye-pleaſing Diamond,
when it is not adorned with an artificiall form?
or what perfection can the form give, without a
foile to ſtrengthen it? or what good is in either
of them, if the light do not illuminate it? or what
avail all theſe, where there wanteth an eye to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
it, a judgement to value it, and an heart to
imbrace it? Such a union hath Nature imprinted
in the diverſitie of creatures concurring to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and eſpecially in morall actions, in whoſe
carriage there is a far greater exactneſſe of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie
required to approve them honourable,
then was requiſite to make the jewel beautifull.
And this did <hi>Caeſar</hi> in all his battels; amongſt
the reſt, that at <hi>Aleſia</hi> is particularly noted in this
manner, <hi>Quod in conſpectu imperatoris res gere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur,
neque recte aut turpiter factum celari po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat,
utroſque &amp; laudis cupiditas, &amp; timor

<hi>Livie</hi> would expreſſe how valiantly an action
was carried, he ſaith no more but <hi>in conſpectu im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoris
res gerebatur:</hi> which is as much as to
ſay, that foraſmuch as the <hi>Romans</hi> were diligent
obſervers of every mans worth, rewarding vertue
with honour, and cowardiſe with reproch, every
man bent his whole endeavour to deſerve the
good opinion of his Generall, by diſcharging
that duty which he owed to the Commonwealth
with all loyalty and faithfulneſſe of ſpirit.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Romans</hi> had four formes of the front of
their battell. The firſt was called <hi>Acies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta,</hi>
when neither the cornets nor the battell was
advanced one before another, but were all carried
in a right line, and made a ſtraight front; &amp; this
was their moſt uſuall manner of imbattelling.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond forme of the front was called <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqua,</hi>
when as one of the cornets was advanced
nearer unto the enemy then the reſt, to begin the
battell: and this was commonly as <hi>Vegetius</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the right cornet; for the right cornet of an
Army had great advantage againſt the left of the
enemies, in regard of their weapons and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But <hi>Caeſar</hi> did it in this place, becauſe he
perceived that the enemy was weakeſt in that part;
following a Maxime of great authority, That the
weakeſt part of an enemy is in the beginning to
be charged with the ſtrength of an Armie: for ſo
favourable are mens judgements to that which is
already happened, that the ſequele of every action
dependeth for the moſt part upon the beginning.
<hi>Dimidium facti qui bene coepit habet,</hi> ſaith a
Poet: and not without great reaſon, ſo forcible
continually is the beginning, and ſo connexed to
the ſequele by the nature of a precedent cauſe, that
the end muſt needs erre from the common courſe,
when it doth not participate of that quality which
was in the beginning. Neither can there be any
good end without a good beginning: for
although the beginning be oftentimes diſaſtrous
and unluckie, and the end fortunate and
happy, yet before it came to that end there
was a fortunate beginning: for the bad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
was not the beginning of a good, but
of an evil end. And therefore that his men might
foreſee a happy end in a good beginning, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
him with the beſt of his Army to aſſault the
weakeſt part of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>The third form of the front is called <hi>Sinnata,</hi>
when both the cornets are advanced forward,

and the battell ſtandeth backward off from the
enemy, after the faſhion of a half-moon. <hi>Scipio</hi>
uſed it in <hi>Spain,</hi> having obſerved ſome dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the enemy continually ſo diſpoſed of the
battell, that his beſt ſouldiers were alwaies in the
midſt; and therefore <hi>Scipio</hi> put all his old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in the cornets, and brought them out firſt
to charge upon the weakeſt part of the enemy,
that thoſe might decide the controverſie, before
the other that were in the midſt could come to
fight.</p>
                        <p>The laſt form is called <hi>Gibboſa,</hi> or <hi>gibbera A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
when the battell is advanced, and the two
cornets lag behind. This form did <hi>Hannibal</hi>
uſe in the battell of <hi>Cannae;</hi> but with this Art, that
he ſtrengthened his two cornets with the beſt of
his ſouldiers, and placed his weakeſt in the midſt,
that the <hi>Romans</hi> following the retreat of the
battell, which was eaſily repelld, might be incloſed
on each ſide with the two cornets.</p>

but he ſent <hi>tertiam Aciem,</hi> the third battell, to

by means whereof the fight was renewed, and
all the enemy was put to flight, and never looked
back untill they came to the <hi>Rhene,</hi> which was
about fifty miles from the place where they
fought. Where ſome few of them ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by ſwimming: others found ſome boats,
and ſo eſcaped. <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> lighting upon a little
Bark tied to the ſhore, recovered the other ſide,

ſent unto him by her brother into <hi>Gallia,</hi> and

ſlain, and the other taken.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Caeſar</hi> purſued the <hi>German</hi> horſemen,
it was his chance to light upon <hi>Valerius Procil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
as he was drawn up and down by his Keepers
bound in three chains: which accident was as
gratefull to him as the victory it ſelf; being ſo
fortunate to recover his familiar friend, and a
man of ſort in the Province, whom the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
enemy (contrary to the law of Nations)
had caſt into priſon. Neither would Fortune by
the loſſe of him abate any thing of ſo great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and contentment: for he reported that in
his own preſence they had three ſeverall times
caſt lots whether he ſhould be burned alive; and

ſubſtance, which was, to have <hi>primam, ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,

ſhould begin the battell, and the ſecond ſhould
come freſh and aſſiſt them: or peradventure if
the enemy were many and ſtrong, the firſt and
ſecond battell were joyned together, and ſo
charged upon the enemy with greater fury and
violence; but at all adventures the third battell
was ever in <hi>ſubſidio,</hi> as they termed it, to ſuccour
any part that ſhould be overcharged; which
was a thing of much conſequence, and of great

wiſdome. For if we either reſpect the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ſouldiers, or the caſualty of Fortune,
what could be more added to their diſcipline in
this behalf, then to have a ſecond and a third ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
to give ſtrength to the fainting weakneſſe
of their men, and to repair the diſadvantage
which any accident ſhould caſt upon them? Or
if their valour were equally ballanced, and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<hi>Sors,</hi> but muſt have been reputed in the order of
neceſſary effects, whereof diſcourſe of reaſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
a certain foregoing cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Whereby we ſee upon how weak an axletree
the greateſt motions of the goodleſſe world were
turned, having irregularity and uncertainty for
the <hi>Intelligentiae</hi> that governed their revolutions.
And herein all ſorts of men (although in divers
reſpects) reſted as well contented as if an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
had ſpoken unto them, and revealed the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of fatall deſtiny.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rome</hi> directed the main courſe of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the fortune of this mock-deſtiny. For
although their Conſuls and Tribunes were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the people, who pleaſed their own fancy
with the free choice of their Commanders, and
ſuted their obedience with a well-liking authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
yet the publick affairs which each Conſul
was ſeverally to manage, was ſhared out by lots.
For if an enemy were entered into their confines
to depopulate and waſt their territories, the lots
aſſigned this Conſul for the government of the
City, and the other to command the legions, and
to manage the war.</p>
                        <p>If forces were to be ſent into divers Provinces,
and againſt ſeverall enemies, neither the Senate
nor the people could give to either Conſul his task;
but their peculiar charges were authoriſed by lots.
If any extraordinary actions were to be done in
the Citie, as the dedication of a Temple, the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
of the Capitol after a pollution; <hi>Sors
omnia verſat,</hi> that did all in all. And yet (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the weak foundation of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
in their Theologie and deepeſt Divinity) we
may not think but theſe skilfull Architects of that
abſolute government, wherein vertue joyned with
true wiſdome to make an unexampled pattern,
we may not think, I ſay, but they foreſaw the
manifold danger, which in the courſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
actions could not other way be prevented
but by the uſe of lots. For when things are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
levelled between divers objects, and run with
indifferencie to equall ſtations, there muſt be
ſome controlling power to draw the current to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
one Coaſt, and to appropriate it unto one
channel, that the order of Nature be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed,
nor a well-eſtabliſhed government diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
So the ſtate of <hi>Rome</hi> caſting many things
with equall charge upon her two ſoveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
which could not be performed but by
one of them; what better meanes could there be
invented to intereſſe the one in that office, and to
diſcharge the other, then to appoint an Arbiter,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51174:49"/>
whoſe decree exceeded humane reaſon? Of which
it could not be ſaid why it was ſo, but that it was
ſo. For if the wiſedome of the Senate had been
called to counſell, or the voices of the people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
to determine of the matter; it might eaſily
have burſt out into civil diſcord, conſidering the
often contentions between the Senate and the
people, the factions of Clients, and the conſtant
mutability of every mans private affections ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
inclining unto one, although their worth
were equall, and by true reaſon indiſcernable;
which might have made the one proud of that
which peradventure he had not, and caſt the other
lower then would have well beſeemed his vertues:
and therefore to cut off theſe with many other
inconveniences, they invented lots, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either reaſon or will might decide ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.</p>
                        <p>By this it appeareth how little the ancient Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
reſpected the ground and reaſon of an
ordinance, ſo the commodity were great, and the
uſe important to the good of the State: for as they
ſaw the thing it ſelf to be caſuall, ſo they ſaw that
caſuall things are ſometimes more neceſſary
then demonſtrative concluſions: neither ought the
nature, and ſpeculative conſideration of Lawes
and Statutes to belong to the common people; but
the execution and obedience thereof maketh the
Commonwealth flouriſh. And thus endeth the
firſt Commentarie of <hi>Caeſar</hi> his warre in <hi>Gallia.</hi>

                        <p>THis rule of making tryall of the worth of an
enemy, hath alwayes been obſerved by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and grave commanders, as the ſureſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whereon the true judgement of the event may
be grounded. For if the doctrine of the old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
which teacheth that the word <hi>non pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabam,
I wist it not,</hi> was never heard out of a
wiſe mans mouth, hath any place in the courſe of
humane actions; it ought eſpecially to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
in managing theſe main points, whereon
the State of Kingdoms and Empires dependeth.
For, unleſſe was be perſwaded that blind Chance
directeth the courſe of this world with an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
confuſion, and that no foreſight can ſway
the ballance of our hap into either part of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould not by all
means endeavour to ground our knowledge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
true cauſes, and levell our proceedings to
that certainty which riſeth from the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
And this is the rather to be urged, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as our leaders are oftentimes deceived when
they look no further then to match an enemy
with equality of number, referring their valour
to be tried in the battell; not conſidering that the
eye of it ſelf cannot diſcern the difference between
two champions of like preſence and outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
unleſſe it ſee their ſtrength compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and weighed as it were in the ſcale of triall:
which <hi>Caeſar</hi> omitted not diligently to obſerve,
before he would adventure the hazard of battell.
For, beſides his own ſatisfaction, it gave great
encouragement to his men, when they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
able to countermatch an enemy, and
knew their task to be ſubject to their ſtrength.
Neither did he obſerve it only at this inſtant, but
throughout the whole courſe of his actions; for
we find that he never incountered any enemy, but
with ſufficient power, either in number or in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
to make head againſt them: which equality
of ſtrength being firſt laid as a ſure foundation,
he uſed his own induſtry and skill, and the
diſcipline wherein his men were trained, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to overſway his adverſarie; and ſo drew
victory maugre fortune unto himſelf, and ſeldome
failed in any of his battels.</p>

in the ſervices of this war. But that we
may the better conjecture what number of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
theſe ſix cohorts did contain, it ſeemeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
a little to diſcourſe of the companies and
regiments which the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                        <p>And firſt we are to underſtand, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and chiefeſt regiment in a <hi>Roman</hi> Armie was
termed by the name of <hi>Legio;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">A legion what it was.</note> as <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith,
<hi>quod leguntur milites in delectu;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> or as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">De vita Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli.</note> 
                           <hi>quod lecti ex omnibus eſſent militares;</hi>
ſo that it taketh the name <hi>Legio,</hi> of the <hi>choice</hi>
and <hi>ſelecting of the ſouldiers. Romulus</hi> is ſaid
to be the firſt authour and founder of theſe legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
making every legion to contain 3000 ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
but ſhortly after they were augmented, as
<hi>Feſtus</hi> recordeth, unto 4000; and afterward
again from 4000, to 4200. And that number
was the common rate of a legion untill <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
came into <hi>Italy,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Liv. lib. 22.</note> and then it was augmented
to 5000: but that proportion continued only
for that time. And again, when <hi>Scipio</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Africk,</hi> the legions were increaſed to 6200
footmen, and 300 horſe. And ſhortly after
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> warre, the legions that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in <hi>Macedonie</hi> to keep the Province from
rebellion, conſiſted of 6000 footmen and 300
horſe. Out of <hi>Caeſar</hi> it cannot be gathered that
a legion in his time did exceed the number of
5000 men, but oftentimes it was ſhort of that
number: for he himſelf ſaith that in this warre in
<hi>Gallia</hi> his ſouldiers were ſo waſted, that he had
ſcarce 7000 men in two legions. And if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
that place out of the 3. of the civile warre,
where he ſaith that in <hi>Pompey</hi> his Army were
110 cohorts, which amounted to the number of
55000 men; and it being manifeſt as well by
this number of cohorts, as by the teſtimony of
divers authours, that <hi>Pompey</hi> his Army conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
of 11 legions; if we divide 55000 into 11
parts, we ſhall find a legion to conſiſt of 5000
men. Which number or thereabout being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
known to be the uſuall rate of a legion, the
<hi>Romans</hi> alwayes expreſſed the ſtrength of their
Army by the number of legions that were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
as in this warre it is ſaid that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had eight
legions; which by this account might ariſe to
40000 men, beſides aſſociates, and ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
attended the Army. Further we are to
underſtand that every legion had his peculiar
name, by which it was known and diſtinguiſhed
from the reſt: and that it took either from their
order of muſter, or enrollement; as that legion
which was firſt enrolled, was called the firſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and that which was ſecond in the choice,
the ſecond legion, and ſo conſequently of the
reſt; and ſo we read in this hiſtory, the ſeventh,
the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, the eleventh and
twelfth legion: or otherwiſe from the place of
their warfare, and ſo we read of <hi>legiones Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicae,
Pannonica, Britannicae,</hi> and ſuch others:
and ſometime of their Generall, as <hi>Auguſta,

to conclude, from ſome accident of quality, as
<hi>Rapax, Victrix, Fulminifera,</hi> Plundring,
Victorious, Lightning, and ſuch like. And thus
much of the name and number of a legion:
which I muſt neceſſarily diſtinguiſh into divers
kinds of ſouldiers, according to the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> and the continuall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
thereof unto the decay of the Empire,
before I come to the deſcription of theſe ſmaller
parts whereof a Legion was compounded.</p>
                        <p>Firſt therefore we are to underſtand that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Conſuls had made a generall choiſe and
ſworn the ſouldiers, the Tribunes choſe out the
youngeſt and pooreſt of all the reſt, and called
them by the name of <hi>Velites.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Velites.</note> Their place in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the other ſouldiers was both baſe and
diſhonourable: not only becauſe they fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far
off, and were lightly armed; but alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they were commonly expoſed to the enemy,
as our forlorn hopes are. Having choſen out a
competent number for this kind, they proceeded
to the choice of them which they called <hi>Haſtati,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Haſtati.</note>
a degree above the <hi>Velites</hi> both in age and
wealth, &amp; termed them by the name of <hi>Haſtati,</hi>
foraſmuch as at their firſt inſtitution they fought
with a kind of Javelin, which the <hi>Romans</hi> called
<hi>Haſta:</hi> but before <hi>Polybius</hi> his time they uſed Piles;
notwithſtanding their ancient name continued
unto the later time of the Empire. The third choice
which they made, was of the ſtrongeſt &amp; luſtieſt-bodied
men, who for the prime of their age were
called <hi>Principes:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Principes.</note> the reſt that remain'd were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

ſaith that in his time the <hi>Velites, Haſtati,</hi>
and <hi>Principes</hi> did conſiſt of 1200 men apiece,
and the <hi>Triarii</hi> never exceeded the number of
600. although the generall number of a legion
were augmented:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de mil. Rom.</note> whereof <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

theſe reaſons; Firſt, becauſe theſe <hi>Triarii</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of the beſt of the ſouldiers, and ſo might
countervail a greater number in good worth and
valour. Secondly, they ſeldome came to buckle
with the enemy, but when the controverſy grew
very doubtfull. Laſtly, we may well conjecture
that the voluntaries and extraordinary followers
ranged themſelves amongſt theſe Triaries, and
ſo made the third battell equall to either of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51174:51"/>
former: but howſoever they never exceeded the
number of 600. And by this it appeareth that
in <hi>Polybius</hi> his time the common rate of a legion
was 4200.</p>
                        <p>In this diviſion of their men, conſiſted the
ground of that well-ordered diſcipline;<note place="margin">The uſe of this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> for in
that they diſtinguiſhed them according to their
yeares and ability, they reduced their whole

of theſe different parts, that in the generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of their whole body, every part might be

                           </gap>ding as his
worth was anſwerable to the ſame: and ſo they
made not only a number of groſſe, but a number
diſtinct by parts and properties; that from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
accident which met with any part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the judgement might determine how much
or how little it imported the whole body: beſides
the great uſe which they made of this diſtinction
in their degrees of honour and preferment, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of no ſmall conſequence, in the excellency of
their government.</p>
                        <p>The ſouldiers at their enrollement being

they then reduced them into ſmaller com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
to make them fitter for command and

                                 <desc>•</desc>

and <hi>Triarii,</hi> each of them into 10 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
making of thoſe three ſorts of ſouldiers
30 ſmall regiments, which they called <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Manipuli.</note>
And again, they ſubdivided every maniple
into two equal parts, and called them <hi>Ordines,</hi>
which was the leaſt company in a legion,<note place="margin">Ordines.</note> and
according to the rate ſet down by <hi>Polybius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
60 ſouldiers. In every <hi>Ordo</hi> there was
a Centurion or Captain, and a Lieutenant,
whom they named <hi>Optio</hi> or <hi>Tergiductor.</hi> The
maniples of the <hi>Triarii</hi> were much leſſer then the
maniples of either the <hi>Haſtati</hi> or the <hi>Principes;</hi>
foraſmuch as their whole band conſiſted but of
600 men. The <hi>Velites</hi> were put into no ſuch
companies, but were equally diſtributed amongſt
the other maniples; and therefore the <hi>Haſtati,
Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii</hi> were called <hi>ſubſignani
milites,</hi> to make a difference between them and
the <hi>Velites,</hi> which were not divided into bands,
and ſo conſequently had no enſigne of their
own, but were diſtributed amongſt the other
companies: ſo that every Maniple had 40 <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
attending upon it. And now I come to the
deſcription of a Cohort, which the hiſtory here
mentioneth.</p>
                        <p>The word <hi>Cohors</hi> in Latine doth ſignify that
part of ground which is commonly incloſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the gate of a houſe,<note place="margin">Cohors.</note> which from the ſame
word we call a court:<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de re <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>uſt.</note> and <hi>Varro</hi> giveth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the metaphor. As in a farm houſe, ſaith
he, many out-buildings joyned together make
one incloſure; ſo a cohort conſiſteth of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
maniples joyned together in one body. This
cohort conſiſted of three maniples; for every le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
had ten cohorts, which muſt neceſſarily
comprehend thoſe thirty maniples: but theſe
three maniples were not all of one and the ſame
kind of ſouldiers, as three maniples of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtati,</hi>
three of the <hi>Principes,</hi> and three of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii,</hi>
as <hi>Patricius</hi> in his <hi>Paralleli</hi> ſeemeth to
affirm; for ſo there would have remained an
odd maniple in every kind, that could not have
been brought into any cohort: But a cohort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a maniple of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> a maniple of the
<hi>Principes,</hi> and a maniple of the <hi>Triarii;</hi> and
ſo all the thirty maniples were included into ten
cohorts, and every cohort was as a little legion,
foraſmuch as it conſiſted of all thoſe ſorts of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that were in a legion. So that making a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to contain five thouſand men, a cohort had
five hundred; and ſo theſe ſix cohorts which he
encamped on the other ſide of the river under the
command of <hi>Titurius Sabinus,</hi> contained three
thouſand ſouldiers: but if you make a legion to
conſiſt but of four thouſand two hundred, which
was the more uſuall rate, there were two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
five hundred and twenty ſouldiers in theſe
ſix cohorts.</p>
                        <p>By this therefore it may appear that a legion
conſiſted of four ſorts of ſouldiers, which were
reduced into ten cohorts, and every cohort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
three maniples, and every maniple two
orders, and every order had his Centurion mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in the head of the troup, and every Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion
had his <hi>Optionem,</hi> or Lieutenant, that ſtood
in the tail of the troup.</p>
                        <p>When a legion ſtood ranged in battell ready
to confront the enemy,<note place="margin">A legion ranged in battell.</note> the leaſt body or ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
that it contained was a maniple; wherein
the two orders were joyned together, making
joyntly ten in front, and twelve in file: and ſo
every five files had their Centurion in front, and
Lieutenant in the rereward, to direct them in all
adventures. In the time of the Emperours, their
battalions conſiſted of a cohort, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
that number how great ſoever the Army
were.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Polybius</hi> diſtinguiſhing a maniple into two

order, which was that order which ſtood on the
right hand, known by the name of <hi>Primus ordo;</hi>
and the Centurion elected in the ſecond courſe,
commanded the left order; and in the abſence
of either of them, he that was preſent of them two
commanded the whole maniple. And ſo we find
that the Centurion of the firſt place was called

                           <note place="margin">3 De bello civili.</note> in which ſenſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> is to be

firſt, the priority between the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the ſame Maniple; for a cohort conſiſting
of three Maniples, whereof the firſt Maniple were
<hi>Triarii,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Principes,</hi> and the third <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtati,</hi>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:51174:52"/>
and every Maniple containing two orders,
and every order a Centurion, he ſaith that all

the firſt cohort: for theſe ten cohorts whereof a
Legion conſiſted, were diſtinguiſhed by degrees
of worthineſſe; and that which was held the
worthieſt in the cenſure of the Electors, took the
priority both of place and name, and was called
the firſt cohort; the next, the ſecond cohort;
and ſo conſequently unto the tenth and laſt.</p>
                        <p>Neither did the Legions want their degrees of
preeminence, both in imbattelling and in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping,
according either to the ſeniority of their
inrollment, or the favour of their Generall, or
their own vertue: And ſo we read that in theſe
wars in <hi>Gallia</hi> the tenth Legion had the firſt
place in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Army. And thus much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the diviſions and ſeverall companies of a
Legion, and the degrees of honour which they
held in the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Upon this deſcription it ſhall not be amiſſe
briefly to lay open the moſt apparent commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
depending upon this diſcipline;<note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this diſcipline.</note> the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
whereof more plainly appeareth, being
compared to that order which Nature hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the frame of her worthieſt creatures: for
it is evident that ſuch works of Nature come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to perfect excellency, whoſe materiall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is moſt particularly diſtinguiſhed into
parts, and hath every part indued with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
which beſt agreeth to his peculiar ſervice.
For being thus furniſhed with diverſity of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and theſe directed with fitting abilities,
the creature muſt needs expreſſe many admirable
effects, and diſcover the worth of an excellent
nature: whereas thoſe other bodies that are but
ſlenderly laboured, and find leſſe favour in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
forge, being as abortives, or barbarouſly
compoſed, wanting the diverſity both of parts
and faculties, are no way capable of ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
uſes, nor fit for ſuch diſtinct ſervices, as the
former that are directed with ſo many properties,
&amp; inabled with the power of ſo wel-diſtinguiſht
faculties. Which better works of Nature the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
imitated in the Architecture of their Army,
dividing it into ſuch neceſſary and ſerviceable
parts as were beſt fitting all uſes and imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
as firſt Legions, and legions into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts,
and cohorts into maniples, and maniples
into centuries or orders, and theſe into files;
wherein every man knew his place, and kept the
ſame without exchange or confuſion: and thus
the univerſall multitude was by order diſpoſed
into parts, untill it came unto a unity. For it
cannot be denied but that theſe centuries were in
themſelves ſo ſenſibly diſtinguiſhed, that every
ſouldier carried in his mind the particular Map
of his whole century: for in imbattelling, every
century was diſpoſed into five files, containing
twelve in a file; whereof the leaders were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
certain, and never changed but by death or
ſome other ſpeciall occaſion; and everie leader
knew his follower, and every ſecond knew the
third man, and ſo conſequently unto the laſt.</p>
                        <p>Upon theſe particularities it plainly appeareth
how eaſy a matter it was to reduce their troups
into any order of a march or a battell, to make
the front the ſlank, or ſlank front, when they
were broken and diſrankt to rally them into any
form, when every man knew both his own and
his fellows ſtation. If any companies were to
be imploied upon ſudden ſervice, the generall <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
of the Army being ſo deeply imprinted in the
mind of the commanders, would not ſuffer them
to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>re in taking out ſuch convenient troups, both
for number and quality, as might beſt agree with
the ſafety of the Army, or nature of the action.
At all occaſions and opportunities theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of advantage offered themſelves as ready
means to put in execution any deſign or ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
whatſoever: the project was no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
of, but every man could readily point out
the companies that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>it to execute the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And which is more important in regard
of the life and ſpirit of every ſuch part, their ſoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was ſweetned, or rather ſtrengthened with
the mutuall acquaintance and friendſhip one of
another; the captain marching alwayes in the
head of the troup, the enſign in the midſt, and
the lieutenant in the rereward, and every man
accompanied with his neighbour and his friend:
which bred a true and unfeigned courage, both
in regard of themſelves and of their followers.
Beſides theſe ſpecialities, the places of title and
dignity depending upon this order were no ſmall
means to cut off all matter of civile diſcord, and
inteſtine diſſenſion: for here every man knew
his place in the File, and every File knew his
place in the Century, and every Century in the
Maniple, and every Maniple in the Cohort, and
every Cohort in the Legion, and every Legion
in the Army; and ſo every ſouldier had his place
according to his vertue, and every place gave ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the man, according as their diſcipline
had determined thereof.</p>

as our Commanders in <hi>France</hi> have been negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
ſo I may not forget to give due commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the care which is had of this point amongſt
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> troups in the ſervice of the States in

                        <p>To conclude this point,<note place="margin">The benefit of ſmall battalions, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of great ſquadrons.</note> I will only touch in
a word the benefit which the <hi>Romans</hi> found in
their ſmall battalions, and the diſadvantage
which we have in making great ſquadrons. And
firſt it cannot be denied but that ſuch troups ſtand
beſt appointed for diſpoſition and array of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
which ſtanding ſtrong to receive a ſhock,
bring moſt men to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ight with the enemy: for the
principall things which are required in ſetting
of a battell, are ſo to order the troups, that the
depth in ſlank may ſerve conveniently to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the aſſault, taking up no more men then
may well ſerve for that purpoſe, and giving
means to the reſt to fight with the enemy: and
in theſe two points were both their defenſive and
offenſive conſiderations comprehended. But
ſmaller troups and battalions afford this conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
better then great ſquadrons, which
drown up many able men in the depth of their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lanks, and never ſuffer them to appear, but
when the breaking of the ſquadron doth preſent
them to the butchery of the enemy. The <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian
Phalanx,</hi> as I have noted in the firſt
book, never carried above ſixteen in ſlank, and
brought five hundred to fight in front. And theſe
little battalions (conſidering them as they ſtood
in battell ray) made as great a front or greater
then that of the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> keeping a depth anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the ſame; beſides the ſecond and third
battell, which alwayes were to ſuccour them,
which the <hi>Phalanx</hi> wanted: neither would their
thick and cloſe imbattelling admit any ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
behind them. Now if we compare the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and diſcommodities which by place and
accident were incident to either of theſe, we ſhall
find great odds between them. Theſe great ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
are not feaſible but in plain and open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where they may either ſtand immoveable, or
make eaſy and ſlow motions without ſhaking or
diſordering their body: but the leſſer are a ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for all places, champain or wooddy, levell
or uneven, or of what ſite or quality ſoever. And
to conclude, if two or three ranks of theſe great
battalions chance to be broken and diſordered,
the whole body is as much intereſſed in the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as the ſaid ranks are, and hath leſſe means
to rally it ſelf then any other leſſer company:
but if any violence chance to rout a Maniple, it
proceedeth no further in the Army then that part
which it taketh: Neithe can the diſranking of
any one part betray the ſafety of the Army to
diſorder and confuſion, foraſmuch as their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
ſerved to cut off ſuch inconveniences,
and yet no way hindered the generall uniting of
their ſtrength into one body. More may be ſaid
concerning this matter; but I only point at it,
and leave the due conſideration thereof to the
judgement of our Commanders, and return to
our hiſtory.</p>

eight miles from <hi>Caeſars</hi> camp, which
the <hi>Belgae</hi> thought to have ſurpriſed
as they came along to meet with <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and
ſuddenly aſſaulted it with ſuch fury, that the
townſmen could hardly hold out the firſt day.
The <hi>Celtae</hi> and <hi>Belgae</hi> uſe one and the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in aſſaulting a town: For having beſet the

they never ceaſe flinging of ſtones untill
they find the wall naked of defendants; and then
caſting themſelves into a <hi>Teſtudo,</hi> they approach
to the gate and undermine the walls. Which
thing was eaſily effected here; for ſo great was
the number of them that threw stones and darts,
that it was impoſſible for the defendants to abide
upon the walls. Aſſoone as the night had made
an end of the aſſault, <hi>Iccius</hi> of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> a man of
great birth and authority in his countrey, who at
that time was governour of the town, and had
been before with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to treat and conclude a

came not preſent ſuccour, he was not able to hold
out any longer. The ſame night about midnight

both <hi>Numidian</hi> and <hi>Cretian</hi> Archers, &amp; Sling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Iles of <hi>Baleares</hi> to relieve the town; by

made hopeleſſe of winning the town: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after a ſmall stay, having depopulated their

they marched with all their power towards

took up more ground then eight miles in breadth.</p>

the <hi>Galles</hi> knew no other means to take a

In the <hi>Amphitheatre,</hi>

ſhews, were brought in (ſaith he) ſixty luſty
young men, who after ſome motion and ſeemly
march, caſt themſelves into a ſquare troup, and
roofing their heads cloſe with their targets, the
firſt rank which made the front of the <hi>Teſtudo,</hi>
ſtood up right on their feet; the ſecond rank
bowed it ſelf ſomewhat lower; the third and
fourth ranks did more incline themſelves, and
ſo conſequently unto the laſt rank, which knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on the ground: and ſo they made a body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
halfe the ſide of an houſe, which they
called <hi>Teſtudo.</hi> Unto this ſquadron ſo ſtrongly
combined together came two ſouldiers running
ſome an hundred and fifty foot off, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
each other with their weapons, ran nimbly
up the ſide of the roof; and ſometimes making
as though they would defend it againſt an enemy
that would have entred upon it, ſometimes again
encountering each other in the midſt of it, leaped
up and down as ſteadily as if they had been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
firm ground. And which is more ſtrange, the
front of a <hi>Teſtudo</hi> being applyed to the ſide of a
wall, there aſcended many armed men upon the
ſaid <hi>Teſtudo,</hi> and fought in an equall height with
other ſouldiers that ſtood upon the ſaid wall to
defend it. The diſſimilitude in the compoſition
was this, that the ſouldiers that were in front, and
in the ſides of the ſquare, carried not their Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
over their heads as the other did, but covered
their bodies with them; and ſo no weapons ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

them to approach the wall with ſafety, and ſo ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to undermine it, or to climb up: and to that

<hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith that the ſouldiers climbed

notwithſtanding he daily made triall by light
skirmiſhes with his horſemen, what the enemy
could do, and what his own men durſt do. And
when he found that his own men were nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the <hi>Belgae,</hi> he choſe a convenient place
before his camp, and put his Army in battell:
the bank where he was encamped riſing ſomewhat
from a plain levell, was no larger then would
ſuffice the front of the battell; the two ſides
were steep, and the front roſe aſlope by little and
little, untill it came again to a plain, where the
legions were imbattelled. And leaſt the enemy
abounding in multitude, ſhould circumvent his
men and charge them in the flank as they were
fighting, (which they might eaſily do with their
number) he drew an overthwart ditch behind
his Army from one ſide of the hill to the other,
ſix hundred paces in length; the ends whereof he
fortified with bulwarks, and placed therein
ſtore of engines. And leaving in his Camp the
two legions which he had laſt enrolled in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi>
that they might be ready to be drawn
forth when there ſhould need any ſuccour, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelled
his other ſix legions in the front of the
hill, before his Camp. The <hi>Belgae</hi> alſo bringing
forth their power, confronted the <hi>Romans</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of battell. I here lay between both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
a ſmall Mariſh: over which the enemy
expected that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould have paſſed, and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
on the other ſide attended to ſee if the <hi>Belgae</hi>
would come over, that his men might have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them in that troubleſome paſſage. In the
mean time the Cavalry on both ſides incountered
between the two battells: and after long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
on either ſide, neither party adventuring
to paſſe over, <hi>Caeſar</hi> having got the better in the
skirmiſh between the horſemen, thought it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for that time, both for the encouraging of
his own men, and the conteſting of ſo great an
Army, and therefore he conveighed all his men
again into their Camp. From that place the
enemy immediately took his way to the River
<hi>Axona,</hi> which lay behind the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp:
and there finding foords, they attempted to paſſe
over part of their forces, to the end they might
either take the fortreſſe which <hi>Q. Titurius</hi> kept,
or break down the bridge, or ſpoile the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the state of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and cut off the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
from proviſion of corne. <hi>Caeſar</hi> having

over the river by the bridge all his horſemen,
and light-armed <hi>Numidians,</hi> with his Slingers
and Archers, and marched with them himſelf.
The conflict was hot in that place: the <hi>Romans</hi>
charging their enemies as they were troubled in
the water, ſlew a great number of them; the reſt
like deſperate perſons, adventuring to paſſe over
upon the dead carkaſes of their fellowes, were
beaten back by force of weapons: and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
incompaſſed ſuch as had firſt got over the
water, and ſlew every man of them.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Belgae</hi> perceived themſelves fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
of their hopes of winning <hi>Bibrax,</hi> of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the River, and of drawing the <hi>Romans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

best for the State in generall, and for every man
in particular, to break up their Camp, and to
return home unto their own houſes: and into

ſhould firſt enter, to depopulate and waſt them in

                        <p>FIrſt we may obſerve the Art which he uſed to
countervail the ſtrength of ſo great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
by chuſing out ſo convenient a place,
which was no broader in front then would ſuffice
the front of his battel: and having both the
ſides of the hill ſo ſteep, that the enemy could not
aſcend nor climb up, but to their own overthrow;
he made the back-part of the hill ſtrong by Art,
and ſo placed his ſouldiers as it were in the gate
of a fortreſſe, where they might either iſſue out or
retire at their pleaſure. Whereby it appeareth
how much he preferred ſecurity and ſafety before
the vain opinion of fool-hardy reſolution, which
ſavoureth of Barbariſme rather then of true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
for he ever thought it great gain to looſe
nothing; and the day brought alwayes good
fortune, that delivered up the Army ſafe unto the
evening; attending untill advantage had laid
ſure principles of victory: and yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> was
never thought a coward.</p>
                        <p>And now it appeareth what uſe he made by
paſſing his Army over the river, and attending
the enemy on the further ſide, rather then on the
ſide of the ſtate of <hi>Rhemes:</hi> for by that means he
brought to paſſe, that whatſoever the enemy
ſhould attempt in any part or quarter of the
land, his forces were ready to trouble their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
as it happened in their attempt of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brax:</hi>
and yet notwithſtanding he loſt not the
opportunity of making ſlaughter of them as they
paſſed over the river. For by the benefit of the
bridge which he had fortified, he tranſported
what forces he would, to make head againſt
them as they paſſed over; and ſo he took what
advantage either ſide of the river could afford
him.</p>

                        <p>ANd here the Reader may not marvell, if when
the hils are in labour, they bring forth but a
mouſe; for how ſoon is the courage of this huge
Army abated? or what did it attempt worthy
ſuch a multitude? or anſwerable to the report
which was bruted of their valour? but being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily
carried together by the violence of paſſion,
were as quickly diſperſed upon the ſight of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy:
which is no ſtrange effect of a ſudden
humour. For as in Nature all violent motions
are of ſhort continuance, and the durability or
laſting qualitie of all actions proceedeth from a
ſlow and temperate progreſſion; ſo the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the mind that are carried with an untempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
violence, and ſavour ſo much of heat and
paſſion, do vaniſh away even with the ſmoak
thereof, and bring forth nothing but leaſurable
repentance. And therefore it were no ill counſell
for men of ſuch natures, to qualify their haſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
with a miſtruſtfull lingering; that
when their judgement is well informed of the
cauſe, they may proceed to a ſpeedy execution.</p>
                        <p>But that which moſt bewrayeth their indiſcreet
intemperance in the hot purſuit of this enterpriſe
is, that before they had ſcarce ſeen the enemy, or
had opportunity to conteſt him in open field,
their victuals began to fail them: for their minds
were ſo carried away with the conceit of war,
that they had no leiſure to provide ſuch neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as are the ſtrength and ſinew of the war. It
was ſufficient for every particular man to be
known for a ſouldier in ſo honourable an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
referring other matters to the care of the
State. The States in like manner thought it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to furniſh out fourty or fifty thouſand men
apiece, to diſcharge their oath, and to ſave
their hoſtages, committing other requiſites to the
generall care of the confederacy: which being
directed by as unskilfull governours, never
looked further then the preſent multitude, which
ſeemed ſufficient to overthrow the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
And thus each man relied upon anothers
care, and ſatiſfied himſelf with the preſent garbe.
So many men of all ſorts and qualities, ſo many
helmets and plumed creſts, ſuch ſtrife and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
what ſtate ſhould ſeem in greateſt forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
were motives ſufficient to induce every
man to go, without further inquiry how they
ſhould go. And herein the care of a Generall
ought eſpecially to be ſeen, conſidering the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of particular judgements, that having the
lives of ſo many men depending altogether upon
his providence, and engaged in the defence of
their ſtate and country, he do not fail in theſe
main points of diſcipline, which are the pillars
of all warlike deſignes. To conclude this point,
let us learn by their errour ſo to carry a matter
(eſpecially of that conſequence) that we make
it not much worſe by ill handling it, then it was
before we firſt took it to our charge; as it here
happened to the <hi>Belgae.</hi> For their tumultuous

aſſurance of victory, that he made ſmall account
of that which was to follow, in regard of that
which had already happened: conſidering that
he ſhould not in all likelihood meet with the like
ſtrength again, in the continuance of that war.
And this was not only <hi>gravius bellum ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſori

unto his ſucceſſour, as it often falleth out in the

matter ſo, that they came even to the rampier of

he had diſcovered their treachery, and ſo made
fruſtrate their intent. In like manner <hi>Caeſar</hi> not
perſwaded that men ſhould be ſo heedleſſe, to

without further ſhaking or disjoyning the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
the ſides were likewiſe walled with hurdles,
the better to defend the ſouldiers that were under
it: the whole length was about ſixteen foot, and
the breadth ſeven, the upper roof was commonly
covered with green or raw hides, to keep it from
burning. Many of theſe hovels were joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in rank, when they went about to undermine
a wall: the higher end was put next unto the wall,
that all the weights which were thrown upon it
might eaſily tumble down, without any great
hurt to the engine: the four ſides and groundſils
had in every corner a wheel, and by them they
were driven to any place as occaſion ſerved. The
chiefeſt uſe of them was to cover and defend the
ſouldiers, as they undermined or overthrew a
wall. This engine was called <hi>Vinea,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth

                           <note place="margin">Agger or mount.</note> which we call a mount, is deſcribed in
divers hiſtories to be a hill or elevation made of
earth and other ſubſtance, which by little and
little was raiſed forward, untill it approached
near unto the place againſt which it was built;
that upon this mount they might erect fortreſſes
and turrets, and ſo fight with an advantage of
height. The matter of this mount was earth and
ſtones, faggots and timber. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith that
at the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> cut down
all the trees within 11 mile compaſſe, for matter
and ſtuff to make a mount. The ſides of this <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
were of Timber, to keep in the looſe matter:
the forepart which was towards the place of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
was open without any timber-work; for
on that part they ſtill raiſed it, and brought it
nearer the walls. That which was built at <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilia</hi>
was 80 foot high, and that at <hi>Avaricum</hi>
80 foot high and 30 foot broad. <hi>Joſephus</hi> and
<hi>Egeſippus</hi> write that there was a fortreſſe in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
300 cubites high: which <hi>Sulla</hi> purpoſing to
win by aſſault, raiſed a mount 200 cubites high;
and upon it he built a caſtle of ſtone 50 cubites
high, and fifty cubites broad; and upon the ſaid
caſtle he erected a turret of 60 cubites in height,
and ſo took the fortreſſe. The <hi>Romans</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
raiſed theſe mounts in the mouth of a haven,
and commonly to over-top a town, that ſo they
might fight with much advantage.</p>

leſſer ſort are deſcribed by <hi>Vitruvius</hi> to be ſixtie
cubites high, and the ſquare ſide ſeventeen
cubites; the breadth at the top was a fifth
part of the breath at the baſe, and ſo they ſtood
ſure without any danger of falling. The corner
pillars were at the baſe nine inches ſquare, and
ſix inches at the top: there were commonly 10
ſtories in theſe little turrets, and windowes in
every ſtory. The greater ſort of towers were
120 cubites high, and the ſquare ſide was 24
cubites, the breadth at the top was a fifth part of
the baſe; and in every one of theſe were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
200 ſtories. There was not one and the

loweſt commonly was 7 cubites and 12 inches
high, the higheſt ſtory 5 cubites, and the reſt 4
cubites and a third. In every one of theſe ſtories
were ſouldiers and engines, ladders and caſting
bridges, by which they got upon the wall and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the town. The forepart of theſe turrets was
covered with iron and wet coverings, to ſave
them from fire. The ſouldiers that removed the

upon them upon a ſuddain before they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened
of their carriages, and ſo to overthrow
them: which legion being cut off and their ſtuffe
taken, the rest would have ſmall courage to
stand againſt them. It much furthered this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
that foraſmuch as the <hi>Nervii</hi> were not able
to make any power of horſe, but what they did
they were wont to do with foot, that they might
the better reſiſt the cavalry of their borderers,
whenſoever they made any rode into their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
their manner was to cut young trees half
aſunder, and bowing the tops down to the ground,
plaſhed the boughes in breadth, and with thorns
and briars planted between them they made them
ſo thick, that it was impoſſible to ſee through
them, ſo hard it was to enter or paſſe through
them: ſo that when by this occaſion the paſſage
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army must needs be hindered,
the <hi>Nervii</hi> thought the foreſaid counſell not to

                     <p>The place which the <hi>Romans</hi> choſe to incamp

he then omitted convenient diſpoſition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

as the place required circumſpection; but altereth

the <hi>Romans</hi> marched in a triple battel of

they turned themſelves according to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity

orderly march, is diligently to obſerve the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

they may be placed for greateſt uſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
both in reſpect of their different and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
qualities, as alſo in regard of the place
wherein they are managed: and this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
will conſequently inferre the beſt and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt
diſpoſition of imbattelling, as the ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are capable of; which, if it may be obſerved
in a march, is no way to be altered. But if this
exactneſſe of imbattelling will not admit conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
carriage of ſuch neceſſary adjuncts as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to an Army, the inconvenience is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
with as little alteration from that rule, as
in a wary judgement ſhall be found expedient;
that albeit the form be ſomewhat changed, yet
the principles and ground, wherein their ſtrength
and ſafety conſiſteth, may ſtill be retained.</p>
                        <p>Neither can any man well deſcend to more
particular precepts in this point: he may exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the practices of many great and experienced
commanders, what ſort of weapon marched in
front, and what in the rereward, in what part of
the Army the Munition marched, and where the
reſt of the carriage was beſtowed, according as
their ſeverall judgements thought moſt expedient
in the particular nature of their occurrences. But
the iſſue of all will fall out thus; that he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
this rule before preſcribed, did ſeldome
miſcarry through an unſafe march. Let a good
Martia liſt well know their proper uſe in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of weapons in his Army, how they are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
or diſadvantageous, in this or that place,
againſt ſuch or ſuch an Enemy; and he will
ſpeedily order his battel, diſpoſe of his march, and
beſtow his carriages, as ſhall beſt fall out both
for his ſafety and conveniency.</p>

                           <hi>Caeſars</hi> cuſtome was to ſend his Cavalry and
light-armed footmen before the body of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
both to diſcover and impeach an Enemy;
for theſe troups were nimble in motion and fit
for ſuch ſervices: but if the danger were greater
in the rereward then in the front, the horſemen
marched in the tayl of the Army, and gave ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
where there was moſt cauſe of fear. But if it
happened that they were found unfit to make
good the ſervice in that place, as oftentimes it fell
out, and eſpecially in <hi>Africa</hi> againſt the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi>
he then removed them as he beſt found it
convenient, and brought his legionary ſouldiers,
which were the ſinews and ſtrength of his forces,
and marched continually in the bulk of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to make good that which his horſemen could
not perform. And thus he altered the antique
preſcription and uniformity of cuſtome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

they ſtuck up a white enſign, and from it they
meaſured every way a hundred foot, and ſo they
made a ſquare containing two hundred foot in
every ſide; the Area or content whereof was
almoſt an acre of ground: the from of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium</hi>
was round and high, being as emient

according to the place of every cohort in

of the Emperour, towards the heart of the camp;
and ſo conſequently every maniple took place in

lodging them either toward the middle or to the

confronting the head of the legion whereof he

when as they had commonly but two legions in

from any tent: whereof <hi>Polybius</hi> giveth
theſe reaſons; firſt, that the ſouldiers marching
into the camp in battell array, might there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
themſelves into maniples, centuries and
decuries, without tumult or confuſion; for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was the thing which they principally reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
as the life and ſtrength of their martiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
And again, if occaſion were offered to ſally
out upon an Enemy, they might very convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that ſpacious room put themſelves into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
and troups: and if they were aſſaulted in
the night, the darts and fire-works which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
ſhould caſt into their camp, would little
indamage them, by reaſon of the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the rampier and the tents.</p>
                        <p>Their tents were all of skins and hides, held
up with props, and faſtened with ropes: there
were eleven ſouldiers, as <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith, in every
tent,<note place="margin">Contuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</note> and that ſociety was called <hi>Contubernium,</hi>
of whom the chiefeſt was named <hi>Decanus,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put

                        </p>
                        <p>The ditch and the rampier were made by the
legions,<note place="margin">The ditch and the rampier.</note> every maniple having his part meaſured
out, and every Centurion overſeeing his Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
the approbation of the whole work belonged
to the Tribunes. Their manner of intrenching
was this: the ſouldiers being girt with their
ſwords and daggers, digged the ditch about the
camp, which was alwayes eight foot in breadth at
the leaſt, and as much in depth, caſting the earth
thereof inward; but if the enemy were not far off,
the ditch was alwayes eleven or fifteen or eighteen
foot in latitude and altitude, according to the
diſcretion of the Generall: but what ſcantling
ſoever was kept, the ditch was made <hi>directis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teribus,</hi>
that is, as broad in the bottom as at the
top. The rampier from the brim of the ditch was
three foot in height, and ſometimes four, made
after the manner of a wall, with green turfes cut
all to one meaſure, half a foot in thickneſſe, a
foot in breadth, and a foot and a halfe in length.
But if the place wherein they were incamped
would afford no ſuch turfe, they then ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the looſe earth which was caſt out of the ditch
with boughs and faggots, that it might be ſtrong
and well-faſtened. The rampier they properly
called <hi>Agger:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Agger.</note> the outſide whereof, which hung
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51174:62"/>
over the ditch, they uſed to ſtick with thick and
ſharp ſtakes, faſtened deep in the mound, that
they might be firm; and theſe for the moſt part
were forked ſtakes; which made the rampier very
ſtrong, and not to be aſſaulted but with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.
<hi>Varro</hi> ſaith that the front of the rampier
thus ſtuck with ſtakes,<note place="margin">Vallum.</note> was called <hi>vallum</hi> a <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricando,</hi>
for that no man could ſtride or get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it.</p>
                        <p>The camp had four gates: the firſt was called
<hi>praetoria Portae,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Praetoria porta.</note> which was alwayes behind the
Emperours tent; and this gate did uſually look
either toward the eaſt, or to the Enemy, or that
way that the Army was to march. The gate on
the otherſide of the camp oppoſite to this, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Portae Decumana,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Portae De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumana.</note> 
                           <hi>a decimis cohortibus;</hi> for the
tenth or laſt Cohort of every legion was lodged
to confront this gate: by this gate the ſouldiers
went out to fetch their wood, their water, and
their forrage, and this way their offendours were
carried to execution. The other two gates were
called <hi>Portae principales,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Portae principales.</note> foraſmuch as they ſtood
oppoſite to either end of that ſo much reſpected
place which they called <hi>principia,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Laeva Dextra.</note> only diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by theſe titles, <hi>laeva principalis</hi> and <hi>dextra,</hi>
the left and the right-hand principall gate. All
theſe gates were ſhut with doors, and in ſtanding
Camps fortified with Turrets, upon which were
planted Engines of defence, as <hi>Baliſtae, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulta,
Tolenones,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had their ſummer Camps, which
they termed <hi>Aeſtiva,</hi> and their winter Camps,
which they called <hi>Hiberna,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Caſtra Aeſtiva.</note> or <hi>Hibernacula.</hi>
Their ſummer camps were in like manner diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced,
according to the time which they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in them. For if they remained in a place
but a night or two, they called them <hi>Caſtra</hi> or
<hi>Manſiones;</hi> but if they continued in them any
long time, they called them <hi>Aeſtivas</hi> or <hi>Sedes:</hi> And
theſe were more abſolute, as well in regard of
their tents, as of their fortification, then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
wherein they ſtayed but one night. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which they called <hi>Hiberna</hi> had great labour
and coſt beſtowed upon them,<note place="margin">Hiberna.</note> that they might the
better defend them from the winter ſeaſon. Of
theſe we read, that the tents were either thatched
with ſtraw, or roofed with boards, and that they
had their armory, hoſpital, and other publick
houſes. Theſe camps have been the beginning of
many famous towns, eſpecially when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
long in a place, as oftentimes they did,
upon the banks of <hi>Euphrates, Danow,</hi> and the
<hi>Rhene.</hi> The order which they alwayes obſerved
in laying out their Camp was ſo uniform, and
well known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that when the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions
had limited out every part, and marked
it with different enſignes and colours, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
entred into it as into a known and familiar
City; wherein every ſociety or ſmall contubernie
knew the place of his lodging: and which is
more, every particular man could aſſign the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſtation of every company throughout the
whole Army.</p>

are here noted under theſe title; the firſt was
<hi>vexillum proponendum, quod erat inſigne cum

flag, which was the ſign for betaking themſelves
to their arms: for when the Generall had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to fight, he cauſed a skarlet coat or red
flag to be hung out upon the top of his tent, that
by it the Souldiers might be warned to prepare
themſelves for the battel; and this was the firſt
warning they had; which by a ſilent aſpect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
bloud and execution to their eyes, as the
only means to work out their own ſafety, and
purchaſe eternall honour. The ſecond was <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num

ſound of trumpet: this warning was a noiſe of
many trumpets, which they termed by the name
of <hi>claſſicuma calando,</hi> which ſignifieth calling;
for after the eye was filled with <hi>ſpecies</hi> ſutable to
the matter intended, they then haſted to poſſeſſe
the eare, and by the ſenſe of hearing to ſtir vp
warlike motions, and fill them with reſolute
thoughts, that no diffident or baſe conceits might

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51174:62"/>
for it was thought convenient to

the knowledge and experience of the

in former battels, they could as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
unto themſelves what was to be done, as
any other commander could teach them. The
other was, that notwithstanding <hi>Caeſar</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
commandment to every Legate, not to leave
the work or forſake the legions untill the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations

ſuch things as he thought neceſſary, ran

And foraſmuch as the enemy was no further off,
then a weapon might be caſt to incounter them,
he gave them the ſign of battel: and haſtening
from thence to another quarter, he found them
already cloſed and at the incounter. For the
time was ſo ſhort and the enemy ſo violent, that
they wanted leiſure to put on their head-pieces,
or to uncaſe their targets: ſo that what part they
lighted into from their work, or what enſign they
firſt met withall, there they ſtayed; least in
ſeeking out their own companies, they ſhould loſe
that time as was to be ſpent in fighting. The
Army being imbattelled rather according to
the nature of the place, the declivity of the hill,
and the brevity of time, then according to the
rules of art; as the legions incountred the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in divers places at once, the perfect view of
the battel being hindred by thoſe thick hedges
before ſpoken of, there could no ſuccours be placed
any where; neither could any man ſee what was
needfull to be done: and therefore in ſo great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of things, there happened divers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties
of fortune.</p>
                     <p>The ſouldiers of the ninth and tenth legion, as
they ſtood in the left part of the Army, caſting
their piles with the advantage of the hill, did
drive the <hi>Atrebates,</hi> breathleſſe with running and
wounded in the incounter, down into the river;
and as they paſſed over the water, ſlew many of
them with their ſwords. Neither did they ſtick
to follow after them over the river, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
into a place of diſadvantage, where the
battel being renewed again by the Enemy, they
put them to flight the ſecond time. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
two other legions, the eleventh and the eighth
having put the <hi>Veromandui</hi> from the upper
ground, fought with them upon the banks of the
river; and ſo the front and the left part of the
camp was well-near left naked. For in the right
cornet were the twelfth and ſeventh legions,
whereas all the <hi>Nervii,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duognatus,</hi>
were heaped together; and ſome of
them began to aſſault the legions on the open ſide,
and other ſome to poſſeſſe themſelves of the higheſt
part of the camp.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time the <hi>Roman</hi> horſemen, and
the light-armed footmen that were intermingled
amongſt them, and were at firſt all put to flight
by the Enemy, as they were entering into the
camp, met with their enemies in the face, and ſo
were driven to fly out another way. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the pages, and ſouldiers boyes, that from the
<hi>Decumane</hi> port and top of the hill had ſeen the
tenth legion follow their enemies in purſuit over
the river, and were gone out to gather pillage,
when they looked behind them, and ſaw the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

faſt as they could. At the ſame time roſe a great
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51174:63"/>
hubbub and outcry of thoſe that came along with
the carriages, who being extremely troubled and
diſmayed at the buſineſſe, ran ſome one way
and ſome another. Which accident ſo terrified
the horſemen of the <hi>Treviri</hi> (who for their prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe
were reputed ſingular amongſt the <hi>Galles,</hi>
and were ſent thither by their State to aid the
<hi>Romans)</hi> firſt when they perceived the <hi>Roman</hi>

Enemy, the legions to be overcharged and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
incloſed about, the horſemen, ſlingers, and
<hi>Numidians</hi> to be diſperſed and fled, that without
any further expectation they took their way

thick thronged on a heap, that they hindred one
another; all the Centurions of the fourth cohort

thereupon was called <hi>Scutum imbricatum.</hi> The
matter whereof a target was made was a double
board, one faſtened upon another with lint and
Buls glew, and covered with an Oxe hide, or ſome
other ſtiffe leather; the upper and lower part
of the target were bound about with a plate of
iron, to keep it from cleaving; and in the midſt
there was a boſſe of iron or braſſe, which
they called <hi>Umbo. Romulus</hi> brought them in
firſt among the <hi>Romans,</hi> taking the uſe of them
from the <hi>Sabines.</hi> The wood whereof they were

                        <p>
                           <pb n="59" facs="tcp:51174:63"/>
Of the difference of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Weapons.</p>
                        <p>I Promiſed in my ſixth book that I would make a
compariſon between the weapons of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
and <hi>Macedonians:</hi> and that I would
likewiſe write of the diſpoſition of either of their
Armies, how they do differ one from another;
and in what regard the one or the other were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inferiour or ſuperiour: which promiſe I will
now with diligence endeavour to perform. And
foraſmuch as the Armies of the <hi>Macedonians</hi>
have given ſo good teſtimonies of themſelves by
their actions, by overcoming the Armies as well
of <hi>Aſia</hi> as of <hi>Greece,</hi> and that the battels of the
<hi>Romans</hi> have conquered as well thoſe of <hi>Africa,</hi>
as all the Eaſtern countries of <hi>Europe;</hi> it ſhall not
be amiſſe, but very profitable, to ſearch out the
difference of either; eſpecially ſeeing that theſe
our times have not once, but many times ſeen
triall both of their battels and forces: that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reaſon why the <hi>Romans</hi> do overcome, and
in their battel carry away the better, we do not
as vain men were wont to do, attribute the ſame
to fortune, and eſteem them without reaſon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
victours; but rather looking into the true
cauſes, we give them their due praiſes, according
to the direction of reaſon and ſound judgement.
Concerning the battels between <hi>Hannibal</hi> and
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and concerning the <hi>Romans</hi>
loſſes, there is no need that I ſpeak much. For
their loſſes are neither to be imputed to the defect
of their Armes, or diſpoſition of their Armies;
but to the dexterity and induſtry of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
But we have intreated thereof when we made
mention of the battels themſelves; and the end it
ſelf of that warre doth eſpecially confirm this
our opinion: for when they had gotten a Captain
equall with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> even conſequently he
with all his victories vaniſhed. And he had no
ſooner overcome the <hi>Romans,</hi> but by and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
his own weapons, he trayned his Army
to their weapons: and ſo taking them up in the
beginning, he continued them on unto the end.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in his war againſt the <hi>Romans</hi>
did uſe both their weapons and order, &amp; made as
it were a medly both of the cohort and phalanx:
but notwithſtanding it ſerved him not to get the
victory, but alwayes the event by ſome means or
other made the ſame doubtful: concerning whom
it were not unfit that I ſhould ſay ſomething, leaſt
in being altogether ſilent, it might ſeem to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
this mine opinion. But notwithſtanding I
will haſten to my purpoſed compariſon.</p>
                        <p>Now touching the phalanx, if it have the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
and forces proper to it, nothing is able to
oppoſe it ſelf againſt it, or to ſuſtain the violence
thereof; as may eaſily by many documents be
approved. For when an armed man doth ſtand
firm in the ſpace of three foot in ſo thick an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raie
of battel, and the length of their pikes being
according to the firſt baſis or ſcantling ſixteen
foot, but according to the true and right conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of them fourteen cubites, out of which
are taken four allowed for the ſpace between the
left hand, which ſupporteth the ſame, and the butt
end thereof, whiles he ſtands in a readineſſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the encounter; being thus ordered, I ſay,
it is manifeſt that the length of ten cubites doth
extend it ſelf before the body of every armed man,
where with both his hands he doth advance it
ready to charge the Enemy. By which meanes it
followeth that ſome of the pikes do not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
themſelves before the ſecond, third, and
fourth rank, but ſome before the foremoſt, if the
phalanx have his proper and due thickneſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his naturall diſpoſition, both on the
ſides and behind: as <hi>Homer</hi> maketh mention
when he ſaith, that one target doth encloſe and
fortify another; one head-piece is joyned to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they may ſtand united &amp; cloſe together.</p>
                        <p>Theſe circumſtances being rightly and truly
ſet down, it muſt follow that the pikes of every
former rank in the phalanx do extend themſelves
two cubites before each other, which proportion
of difference they have between themſelves: by
which may evidently be ſeen the aſſault and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the whole phalanx, what it is, and
what force it hath, conſiſting of ſixteen ranks in
depth or thickneſſe. The exceſſe of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ranks above five, forasmuch as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
commodiouſly couch their pikes without the
diſturbance of the former, the points of them not
being long enough to enlarge themſelves beyond
the foremoſt ranks, they grow utterly unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and cannot man by man make any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or aſſault: but ſerve only by laying their
pikes upon the ſhoulders of thoſe which ſtand
before them, to ſuſtain and hold up the ſwayes
and giving back of the former ranks which ſtand
before them, to this end, that the front may ſtand
firm and ſure; and with the thickneſſe of their
pikes they do repell all thoſe darts, which paſſing
over the heads of thoſe that ſtand before, would
annoy thoſe ranks which are more backward.</p>
                        <p>And farther, by moving forward with the
force of their bodies, they do ſo preſſe upon the
former, that they do make a moſt violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
For it is impoſſible that the foremoſt
ranks ſhould give back.</p>
                        <p>This therefore being the generall and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
diſpoſition of the phalanx, we muſt now
ſpeak on the contrary part touching the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and differences, as well of the Armes, as of
the whole diſpoſition of the <hi>Roman</hi> battel. For
every <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldier for himſelf and his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
is allowed three foot to ſtand in, and in the
incounter are moved man by man, every one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
himſelf with his target, and mutually mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
whenſoever there is occaſion offered. But
thoſe which uſe their ſwords, do fight in a more
thin and diſtinct order; ſo that it is manifeſt
that they have three foot more allowed them to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51174:64"/>
ſtand in both from ſhoulder to ſhoulder, and
from back to belly, that they may uſe their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
with the better commodity. And hence it
cometh to paſſe that one <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldier taketh
up as much ground, as two of thoſe which are to
encounter him of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalanx: ſo
that one <hi>Roman</hi> is as it were to oppoſe himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ten pikes, which pikes the ſaid one ſouldier
can neither by any agility come to offend, or elſe
at handy blowes otherwiſe annoy: And thoſe
which are behind him are not only unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
their force, but alſo with conveniency to uſe
their own weapons. Whereby it may eaſily be
gathered, that it is impoſſible that any battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſaulted by the front of a phalanx, ſhould be
able to ſuſtain the violence thereof, if it have his
due and proper compoſition.</p>
                        <p>What then is the cauſe that the <hi>Romans</hi> do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
and that thoſe that do uſe the phalanx
are voyd of the hope of victory? Even from
hence, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies have infinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
both of places and of times to fight
in. But the phalanx hath onely one time, one
place, and one kind whereto it may profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
apply it ſelf: ſo that if it were of neceſſity
that their enemy ſhould encounter them at that
inſtant, eſpecially with their whole forces, it
were queſtionleſſe not only not without danger,
but in all probability likely that the phalanx
ſhould ever carry away the better. But if that
may be avoyded, which is eaſily done, ſhall not
that diſpoſition then be utterly unprofitable,
and free from all terrour? And it is farther evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the phalanx muſt neceſſarily have
plain and champain places, without any hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
or impediments, as ditches, uneven places,
vallies, little hils and rivers; for all theſe may
hinder and disjoyn it. And it is almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to have a Plain of the capacity of twenty
<hi>ſtadia,</hi> much leſſe more, where there ſhall be
found none of theſe impediments. But ſuppoſe
there be found ſuch places as are proper for the
phalanx: if the Enemy refuſe to come unto them,
and in the mean time ſpoil and ſack the Cities
and country round about, what commodity or
profit ſhall ariſe by any Army ſo ordered? for
if it remain in ſuch places, as hath been before
ſpoken of, it can neither relieve their friends,
nor preſerve themſelves. For the convoies which
they expect from their friends are eaſily cut off
by the Enemy, whiles they remain in thoſe open
places.</p>
                        <p>And if it happen at any time that they leave
them upon any enterpriſe, they are then expoſed to
the Enemy. But ſuppoſe that the <hi>Roman</hi> Army
ſhould find the phalanx in ſuch places, yet
would it not adventure it ſelf in groſſe at one
inſtant, but would by little and little retire it
ſelf; as doth plainly appear by their uſuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
For there muſt not be a conjectur of theſe
things by my words only, but eſpecially by that
which they do. For they do not ſo equally
frame their battel, that they do aſſault the Enemy
altogether, making as it werebut one front: but
part make a ſtand, and part charge the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that if at any time the Phalanx do preſſe
them that come to aſſault them and be repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the force of their order is diſſolved. For
whether they purſue thoſe that retire, or fly from
thoſe that do aſſault them, theſe do diſjoyn
themſelves from part of their Army; by which
meanes there is a gap opened to their Enemies,
ſtanding and attending their opportunity: ſo
that now they need not any more to charge
them in the front, where the force of the pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx
conſiſteth, but to aſſault where the breach
is made, both behind and upon the ſides. But
if at any time the <hi>Roman</hi> Army may keep
his due propriety and diſpoſition, the phalanx
by the diſadvantage of the place being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do the like, doth it not then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
demonſtrate the difference to be great
between the goodneſſe of their diſpoſition, and
the diſpoſition of the phalanx?</p>
                        <p>To this may be added the neceſſities impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon an Army: which is, to march through
places of all natures, to encamp themſelves, to
poſſeſſe places of advantage, to beſiege, and to
be beſieged; and alſo contrary to expectation
ſometimes to come in view of the Enemy. For
all theſe occaſions neceſſarily accompany an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and oftentimes are the eſpeciall cauſes of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
to which the <hi>Macedonian</hi> phalanx is no
way fit or convenient; foraſmuch as neither in
their generall order, nor in their particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
without a convenient place, they are
able to effect any thing of moment: but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Army is apt for all theſe purpoſes. For
every ſouldier amongſt them being once armed
and ready to fight, refuſeth no place, time nor
occaſion; keeping alwayes the ſame order, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he fight together with the whole body of the
Army, or particularly by himſelf man to man.</p>
                        <p>And hence it happeneth, that as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
of their diſpoſition is advantageous, ſo the
end doth anſwer the expectation.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things I thought to ſpeak of at large,
becauſe many of the <hi>Graecians</hi> are of an opinion
that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> are not to be overcome.
And again, many wondered how the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
phalanx ſhould be put to the worſe by the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army, conſidering the nature of their
weapons.</p>
                        <p>Thus far goeth <hi>Polybius</hi> in comparing the
weapons and embattelling of the <hi>Romans,</hi> with
the uſe of Arms amonſt the <hi>Macedonians:</hi>
wherein we ſee the Pike truly and exactly orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
according as the wiſe <hi>Gracians</hi> could beſt
proportion it with that form of battel, which
might give moſt advantage to the uſe thereof: ſo
that if our ſquadrons of Pikes jump not with the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51174:64"/>
perfect manner of a phalanx, (as we ſee they do
not) they fall ſo much ſhort of that ſtrength,
which the wiſdome of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of other nations imputed unto it.
But ſuppoſe we could allow it that diſpoſition
in the courſe of our warres, which the nature
of the weapon doth require; yet foraſmuch as
by the authority of <hi>Polybius,</hi> the ſaid manner of
imbattelling is tied to ſuch dangerous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of one time, one place, and one kind of
fight, I hold it not ſo profitable a weapon as
the practice of our times doth ſeem to make it,
eſpecially in woody countries, ſuch as <hi>Ireland</hi> is,
where the uſe is cut off by ſuch inconveniences
as are noted to hinder the managing thereof.
And doubtleſſe, if our Commanders did but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of the incongruity of the Pike and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they would not proportion ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them in every company as there is;
for commonly half the company are Pikes, which
is as much as to ſay in the practice of our wars,
that half the Army hath neither offenſive nor
defenſive weapons, but onely againſt a troup
of horſe. For they ſeldome or never come to
the puſh of pike with the foot companies, where
they may charge and offend the enemy: and for
defence, if the enemy think it not ſafe to buckle
with them at hand, but maketh more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to play upon them afarre off with ſhot, it
affordeth ſmall ſafety to ſhake a long pike at
them, and ſtand fair in the mean time to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a volley of ſhot with the body of their
battalion. As I make no queſtion but the pike
in ſome ſervices is profitable, as behind a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
or at a breach; ſo I aſſure my ſelf there are
weapons, if they were put to triall, that would
countervail the pike, even in thoſe ſervices where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is thought moſt profitable.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Target, we ſee it take the
hand, in the judgement of <hi>Polybius,</hi> of all other
weapons whatſoever, as well in regard of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and ſundry ſorts of imbattelling, as the
quality of the place whereſoever: for their uſe
was as effectuall in ſmall bodies and centuries,
as in groſſe troups and great companies; in
thin and ſpacious imbattelling, as in thick-thronged
<hi>Teſtudines.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither could the nature of the place make
them unſerviceable; for whether it were plain
or covert, levell or unequall, narrow or
large, if there were any commodity to fight, the
target was as neceſſary to defend as the ſword to
offend: beſides the conveniency which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth
the target in any neceſſity impoſed upon
an Army, whether it be to march through places
of all natures, to make a faſt march, or a ſpeedy
retreat, to incamp themſelves, to poſſeſſe places
of advantage, to beſiege and to be beſieged,
as <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaith, with many other occaſions
which neceſſarily accompany an Army. The
uſe of this weapon hath been too much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in theſe later ages, but may be happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renewed again in our Nation, if the induſtry
of ſuch as have laboured to preſent it unto theſe
times in the beſt faſhion, ſhall find any favour
in the opinion of our Commanders. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which target I muſt needs ſay thus much,
that the light target will prove the target of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
whenſoever they ſhall happen to be put in
execution: for thoſe which are made proof are
ſo heavie and unwieldy (although they be
ſomewhat qualified with ſuch helps as are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the uſe thereof) that they overcharge a
man with an unſupportable burthen, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his agility and execution in fight with a
weight diſproportionable to his ſtrength. For
our offenſive weapons, as namely the Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers
and Musketiers, are ſtronger in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
part, then any armes of defence, which
may be made manageable and fit for ſervice.
Neither did the <hi>Romans</hi> regard the proof of their
targets further then was thought fit for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
uſe of them in time of battel, as it appeareth
in many places both in the Civil wars, and in
theſe Commentaries: for a <hi>Roman</hi> Pile hath
oftentimes darted through the Target, and the
body of the man that bare it, and faſtened them
both to the ground; which is more then a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
can well do, for the bullet commonly reſteth
in the body. And although it may be ſaid that
this was not common, but rather the effect of an
extraordinary arme; yet it ſerveth to prove that
their targets were not proof to their offenſive
weapons, when they were well delivered, and
with good direction. For I make no doubt but
in their battels there were oftentimes ſome hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances,
which would not ſuffer ſo violent
an effect as this which I ſpeak off: for in a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of ſhot we muſt not think that all the bullets
fly with the ſame force, and fall with the like hurt;
but as Armour of good proof will hardly hold
out ſome of them, ſo ſlender Armes, and of no
proof, will make good reſiſtance againſt others.
And to conclude, in a battell or incounter at
hand, a man ſhall meet with more occaſions ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature and commodity of this light Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
then ſuch as will advantage the heavy Target
of proof, or countervail the ſurplus of weight
which it carrieth with it.</p>
                        <p>Some men will urge, that there is uſe of this
Target of proof in ſome places and in ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices:
which I deny not to thoſe that deſire to
be ſecured from the extremity of peril. But this
falleth out in ſome places, and in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſervices; and hindereth not but that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
benefit of this weapon conſiſteth in the
multitude of light Targetiers, who are to manage
the moſt important occaſions of a warre.</p>
                        <p>Thus much I am further to note concerning
the ſword of the Targetiers, that according to
the practice of the <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hang on the right ſide; for carrying the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51174:65"/>
upon the left arm, it cannot be that the ſword
ſhould hang on the left ſide, but with great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and annoiance. And if any man ſay,
that if it hang on the right ſide it muſt be very
ſhort, otherwiſe it will never be readily drawn
out: I ſay, that the ſword of the Targetiers, in
regard of the uſe of that weapon, ought to be of
a very ſhort ſcantling, whenas the Targetier is
to command the point of his ſword within the
compaſſe of his Target, as ſuch as look into the
true uſe of this weapon will eaſily diſcover. But
let this ſuffice concerning the uſe of the Pike and
the Target.</p>

<hi>Caeſar</hi> perceiving likewiſe the ſeventh legion,

and little to joyn the two legions together, and ſo

to guard the carriages, hearing of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
doubled their pace, and were deſcried by the

ſuch an alteration and change of things,
that even ſuch as were ſunk down through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

by the very great favour and aſſiſtance
of the gods; who as they give aid in all caſes
of war, ſo eſpecially in thoſe where reaſon and
good skill are at a loſſe. For ſo it fell out in this
battel, and the danger proceeded from the ſame
cauſe that brought him to that puſh in the battel
with <hi>Pharnaces:</hi> for he well underſtood that the
<hi>Nervii</hi> attended his coming on the other ſide the
river <hi>Sabis:</hi> Neither was he ignorant how to
fortifie his Camp in the face of an enemy without
fear or danger, as we have ſeen in his warre with
<hi>Ariovistus;</hi> when he marched to the place
where he purpoſed to incamp himſelf with three
battels, and cauſed two of them to ſtand ready
in Armes to receive any charge which the enemy
ſhould offer to give, that the third battel in the
mean time might fortify the Camp. Which courſe
would eaſily have fruſtrated this ſtratagem of the
<hi>Nervii,</hi> and made the hazard leſſe dangerous:
but he little expected any ſuch reſolution, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the rules of Militarie diſcipline, that an
enemy ſhould not ſtick to paſſe over ſo broad a
river, to climbe up ſuch ſteep and high Rocks,
to adventure battel in a place ſo diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
and to hazard their fortune upon ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities.
And therefore he little miſtruſted any
ſuch unlikely attempt, wherein the enemy had
plotted his own overthrow, if the legions had
been ready to receive them.</p>
                        <p>Which may teach a Generall that which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>

too ſecure in his moſt aſſured courſes, nor too
carefull in his beſt adviſed directions; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the greateſt means may eaſily be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
and the ſafeſt courſe weakened with an
unreſpected circumſtance: ſo powerfull are weak
occurrences in the main courſe of the weightieſt
actions, and ſo infinite are the wayes whereby
either wiſdome or fortune may work. Neither
did this warm him to provide for that which an
enemy might do, how unlikely ſoever it might
ſeem unto him; as appeareth by that accident in
the battel with <hi>Pharnaces.</hi> Which practiſe of
attempting a thing againſt reaſon and the art of

way of their overthrow, returned
home again; and forſaking all the reſt of their
Towns and Caſtles, conveyed themſelves and
their wealth into one ſtrong and well-fortified
town, which was compaſſed about with mighty
rocks and ſteep downfalls, ſaving in one place of
two hundred foot in breadth, where there was
an entry by a gentle and eaſy aſcent: which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
they had fortified with a double wall of a
large altitude, and had placed mighty great
ſtones and ſharp beames upon the walls, ready
for an aſſault. This people deſcended from the
<hi>Cimbri</hi> and <hi>Teutoni,</hi> who in their journey into
<hi>Italy,</hi> left ſuch carriages on this ſide of the
<hi>Rhene,</hi> as they could not conveniently take along
with them, and 6000 men to look to them: who,
after the death of their fellowes, being many
yeares diſquieted by their neighbours, ſometimes
invading other States, and ſometimes defending
themſelves, at length procured a peace, and
choſe this place to ſettle themſelves in.</p>
                     <p>At the firſt coming of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army,
they ſallied out of the town, and made many light
skirmiſhes with them: but after that <hi>Caeſar</hi>
had drawn a rampier about the town of twelve
foot in height, fifteen miles in compaſſe, and had
fortified it with Castles very thick about the
town, they kept themſelves within the wall. And
as they beheld the Vines framed, the Mount rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and a tower in building afarre off; at firſt
they began to laugh at it, and with ſcoffing ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
from the wall, began to aske with what
hands, and with what ſtrength, eſpecially by men
of that ſtature (for the <hi>Romans</hi> were but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
men in reſpect of the <hi>Galles)</hi> a tower of that
huge maſſie weight ſhould be brought unto the
walles. But when they ſaw it removed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
near unto the town (as men aſtoniſhed
at the ſtrange and unaccuſtomed ſight thereof)
they ſent Embaſſadours to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to intreat a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51174:66"/>
peace, with this meſſage; They believed that the
<hi>Romans</hi> did not make war without the ſpeciall
aſſiſtance of the Gods, that could with ſuch faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
tranſport engines of that height, and bring
them to incounter at hand, againſt the ſtrongeſt
part of their town: and therefore they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
both themſelves and all that they had
to <hi>Caeſars</hi> mercy, deſiring one thing of him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
which was, that if his goodneſſe and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
(which they had heard ſo high praiſes of)
had determined to ſave their lives, he would not
take away their Arms from them; foraſmuch as
all their neighbours were enemies unto them, and
envied at their valour; neither were they able
to defend themſelves, if they ſhould deliver up
their Armour: ſo that they had rather ſuffer
any inconvenience by the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> then to
be butcherly murthered by them, whom in former
time they had held ſubject to their command.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Caeſar</hi> anſwered; that he would ſave
the City rather of his own cuſtome, then for any
deſert of theirs, ſo that they yielded before the
Ram touched the wall; but no condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
ſhould be accepted without preſent delivery
of their Armes: for he would do by them as he
had done by the <hi>Nervii,</hi> and give commandment
to their neighbours, that they ſhould offer no
wrong to ſuch as had commended their ſafety to
the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> This anſwer being returned
to the City, they ſeemed contented to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he commanded them: and thereupon caſting
a great part of their Armour over the wall into
the ditch, inſomuch as they fill'd it almoſt to the
top of the rampier, and yet (as afterward was
known) concealing the third part, they ſet open
the gates, and for that day carried themſelves
peaceably. Towards night <hi>Caeſar</hi> commanded
the gates to be ſhut, and the ſouldiers to be
drawn out of the town, leaſt in the night the
townſmen ſhould be any way injured by them. But
the <hi>Aduatici,</hi> having conſulted together before
(foraſmuch as they believed that upon their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
the <hi>Romans</hi> would either ſet no watch at
all, or at the leaſt keep it very careleſly) partly
with ſuch Armour as they had retained, and
partly with targets made of bark, or wrought of
wicker, which upon the ſuddain they had cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over with Leather, about the third watch,
where the aſcent to our fortifications was eaſieſt,
they iſſued ſuddainly out of the town with all
their power: but ſignification thereof being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
given by fires, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> had commanded,

A Ram, ſaith he, is a mighty great beam,
like unto the maſt of a ſhip, and is ſtrengthened
at one end with a head of iron faſhioned like
unto a Ram, and thereof it took the name. This
Ram is hanged by the midſt with ropes unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
beam, which lieth croſſe a couple of pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
and hanging thus equally balanced, it is by
force of men thruſt forwar and recoild back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

and ſo beateth upon the wall with his iron
head: neither is there any tower ſo ſtrong, or
wall ſo broad, that is able to ſtand before it.</p>
                        <p>The length of this Ram was of a large ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
for <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirmeth that <hi>Antony</hi> in the
<hi>Parthian</hi> war had a Ram foureſcore foot long.
And <hi>Vitruvius</hi> ſaith that the length of a Ram
was uſually one hundred and ſix, and ſometimes
one hundred and twenty; and this length gave
great ſtrength and force to the engine. It was
managed at one time with a whole Century or
order of ſouldiers; and their forces being ſpent,
they were ſeconded with another Century; and
ſo the Ram played continually upon the wall
without intermiſſion. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith that <hi>Titus,</hi>
at the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had a ram for every le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
It was oftentimes covered with a Vine,
that the men that managed it might be in more
ſafety. It appeareth by this place, that if a town
had continued out untill the ram had touched
the wall, they could not preſume of any accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

they had brought in perill the lives of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

For as it imported greater danger, and
diſcovered a more deſperate ſpirit, to break
through the thickeſt troups of their enemies,
and ſo by ſtrong hand to ſave themſelves by
the help of ſome other fortune; ſo it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
a greater apprehenſion of terrour, and

nothing but deſperate remedies: for
deſperate and inconſiderate raſhneſſe riſeth
ſooner of fear, then of any other paſſion of the

of death with the life of their ſpirit, reſerving
extremity of help to extremity of perill, and in
the mean time attended what chances of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
might happen unto them upon any

that the reſt that are buſily imployed in the aſſault

how barbarous ſoever, have generally conceived
of the quality and condition of Embaſſadours:
and what the grounds are of this univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
cuſtome, which in all ages and times hath
held authenticall. And firſt we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that all mankind (as indued with the ſame
nature and properties) are ſo linked together in
the ſtrict alliance of humane ſociety, that albeit
their turbulent and diſagreeing paſſions (which
in themſelves are unnaturall, as proceeding from
corruption and defect) drive them into extream
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51174:69"/>
diſcord and diſunion of ſpirit, and break the
bonds of civile converſation, which otherwiſe
we do naturally affect; yet without a neceſſary
entercourſe and traffick of ſociety, we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to keep on foot the very diſcord it ſelf in
terms of reaſon and orderly proceeding, but all
parts will be blended with diſordered confuſion
and go to wrack, for want of theſe mutuall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
performed by meſſengers: ſo ſtreight are
the bonds of Nature, and ſo powerfull are the
laws which ſhe enacteth. And therefore if it
were for no other end which might ſort to the
benefit of either party, (as there are many good
uſes thereof) yet to hold up the quarrell and
keep it from falling, making war according to
the grounds of reaſon, the entercourſe of meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
is not to be interrupted, nor their perſons
to be touched with hatefull violence: but that
which the common reaſon of nations hath mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
a law, ought as religiouſly to be obſerved as an

principally to be confirmed, to the end that no
people may ſeem ſo barbarous as to maintain a
war which onely intendeth bloud, and propoſeth
as the chiefeſt object the death and mortality of
mankind, no way reſpecting peace and civile go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
ſuch as refuſe the entercourſe of meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
as the means of amity and concord, are
juſtly condemned in the judgement of all nations
as unworthy of humane ſociety. Laſt of all, it is
an injury of great diſhonour, and deſerveth the

which may as well tend to the advancement and
honour of that City to which they are ſent, as to
the diſhonour and ruine of the ſame, whereof the

of the <hi>Roman</hi> knights; their rebellion after

hoſtages of their loyalty; the conſpiracy of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

incite other nations and States to the like

all the <hi>Galles</hi> were inclining to novelty and

and ready to undertake a war; and further, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that all men by nature deſired liberty,

prevented all further inſurrections of the other

                        <hi>Treviri,</hi> that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

ſuch forces as might peradventure be tranſported
over the river by the <hi>Germans,</hi> to further this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious

                        <p>IN the firſt book I obſerved the authority which
the <hi>Roman</hi> Leaders had to undertake a war,
without further acquainting the Senate with the
conſequence thereof: in this place let us obſerve
the care and circumſpection which the Generals
had, who did not undertake a troubleſome and
dangerous war upon a humour, or any other
flender motion; but diligently weighing the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
thereof, and meaſuring the perill and
hazard of the war, with the good and conſequence
of the effect, informed their judgements of the
importance of that action, and ſo tried whether
the benefit would anſwer their labour. And thus
we find the reaſons particularly delivered that
moved <hi>Caeſar</hi> firſt to undertake the <hi>Helvetian</hi>

                        <p>Further, let us obſerve the means he uſed to
prevent the inclination of the <hi>Galles,</hi> and to keep
them in ſubjection and peaceable obedience, by
ſending his men into divers quarters of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
and ſo ſetling the wavering diſpoſition

he ſent ready to ſtifle all motions of rebellion in

And if the <hi>Romans</hi> went about to ſhut out the
ſea with mounts which they raiſed equall to the
walls of the town, and were at the point of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and taking it; yet the townſmen having
ſuch store of ſhipping, would eaſily convey both
themſelves and their carriages into the next
towns, and there help themſelves with the like
advantage of place. And thus they deluded <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
the greateſt part of the ſommer: for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
fleet by reaſon of continuall windes and foul
weather, durſt not adventure to put out of the
river <hi>Loire</hi> into ſo vaſt a ſea, wherein the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and roads were few, and farre diſtant one
from another, and the tides great. The ſhipping
of the <hi>Galles</hi> was thus built and rigged: the
keel was ſomewhat flatter then the <hi>Romans</hi>
ſhipping, the better to bear the ebbes and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
of that coaſt: the fore-deck was altogether
erect and perpendicular; the poupe was made to
bear the hugeneſſe of the billowes and the force
of the tempeſt. And in a word they were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
built for ſtrength: for the ribs and ſeats
were made of beams of a foot ſquare, faſtned
with iron pinnes of an inch thick: in ſtead of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
they uſed chaines of iron; and raw hides
and skins for ſailes, either for want of linen, or
ignorant of the uſe thereof, or becauſe ſailes of
linen would hardly ſerve to carry ſhips of that
burthen, or endure the tempeſtuouſneſſe of thoſe
ſeas, and the violence of the winds.</p>
                     <p>The meeting and conflict of the <hi>Roman</hi> navy
with this kind of ſhips was ſuch, that they only
excelled them in celerity and ſpeedy nimbleneſſe
with force of oars; but in all other things, either
concerning the nature of the place, or the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the foul weather, were farre inferiour
unto them: for the ſtrength of them was ſuch
that they could neither hurt them with their
beak-heads, nor caſt a weapon to any purpoſe into
them by reaſon of their altitude, and high-built
bulkes. And if any guſt chanced in the mean
time to riſe, that forced them to commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the mercy of the weather, their ſhipping
would better bear the rage of the ſea, and with
greater ſafety ſhelter it ſelf amongſt flats and
ſhallowes, without fear of rocks or any ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard:
of all which chances the <hi>Roman</hi> navy
ſtood continually in danger.</p>

uſe which we Iſlanders have of navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
briefly to ſet down the moſt eminent cauſes
of the flowing and ebbing of the ſea, as far forth
as ſhall ſeem neceſſary to the knowledge of a
ſouldier: which albeit they may fall ſhort of the
true reaſons of this great ſecret: yet foraſmuch
as they ſtand for true principles of regularity, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51174:70"/>
well-approved rules in our Art of navigation,
let us take them for no leſſe then they effect, and
give them that credit in our imagination, which
tract of time hath gained to thoſe forged circles
in the heavens: that albeit their chiefeſt eſſence
conſiſteth in conceit and ſuppoſall; yet foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they ſerve to direct our knowledge to a
certainty in that variety and ſeeming inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of motion, we eſteem of them as they effect,
and not as they are.</p>
                        <p>Conſidering then the globe of the world, as it
maketh a right ſphear (for in that poſition the
Naturaliſts chiefly underſtand celeſtiall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to have operation in this liquid element of
the water) it is divided by the Horizon and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
into four quarters: the firſt quarter is that
between the eaſt horizon and the noon meridian,
which they call a flowing quarter; the ſecond
from the noon meridian to the weſt horizon,
which they make an ebbing quarter; the third
from the weſt horizon to the midnight meridian,
which they likewiſe call a flowing quarter; and
again from the midnight meridian to the eaſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
the ſecond ebbing quarter: And ſo they
make two flowing quarters, and two ebbing
quarters of the whole circuit of heaven. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of theſe ſenſible qualities and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
effects are the ſun and the moon, as they are
carried through theſe diſtinct diſtinct parts of
the heaven. And although experience hath noted
the moon to be of greateſt power in watry moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet we may not omit to acknowledge the
force which the ſun yieldeth in this miracle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>Firſt therefore we are to underſtand, that
when the moon or the ſun begin to appear above
the right horizon, and enter into that part of the
heaven which I termed the firſt flowing quarter,
that then the ſea beginneth to ſwell: and as they
mount up to their meridian altitude, ſo it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
untill it come to a high floud. And again,
as thoſe lights paſſing the meridian decline to the
weſt, and run the circuit of the ebbing quarter,
ſo the water decreaſeth and returneth again
from whence it came. Again, as they ſet
under the weſt horizon, and enter into the
ſecond flowing quarter, ſo the ſea beginneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to flow, and ſtill encreaſeth untill they come
to the point of the night meridian: and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
it refloweth, according as the ſun and
moon are carried in the other ebbing quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the night meridian to the weſt horizon.</p>
                        <p>And hence it happeneth that in conjunction or
new of the moon,<note place="margin">Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                              </gap>ides.</note> when the ſun and the moon
are carried both together in the ſame flowing and
ebbing quarters, that then the tides and ebbs are
very great: and likewiſe in oppoſition or full of
the moon, when theſe lights are carried in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
quarters, which we have deſcribed to be of the
ſame nature, either ebbing or flowing, that then
in like manner the tides are great: foraſmuch as
both theſe Planets, through the ſymbolizing quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
wherein they are carried, do joyn their forces
to make perfect this work of Nature in the ebbing
and flowing of the Sea. And contrariwiſe in a
quadrate aſpect (as the Aſtronomers call it) or
quarter age of the moon, whenas the moon is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in a flowing quarter, and at the ſame inſtant
the ſun doth happen to be in an ebbing or decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
quarter, as the courſe of Nature doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
require, then are the tides leſſened, as daily
experience doth witneſſe.</p>
                        <p>And foraſmuch as both the right horizon and
the meridian alſo divide every diurnall circle,
which either the ſun or the moon make in their
revolutions, into equall parts; it followeth that
every tide is continually meaſured with the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of ſix houres: and therefore that which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
here ſaith muſt needs be true, that in the ſpace
of twelve houres there are alwayes two high tides.
And leaſt any man ſhould imagine that every
inland City ſtanding upon an ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
river, may take the computation of the tide
according to this rule; let him underſtand that
this which I have delivered is to be conceived
principally of the ſea it ſelf, and ſecondarily of
ſuch ports and havens as ſtand either near or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſea: but where a river ſhall run many
miles from the ſea, and make many winding Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders
before it come to the place of calculation,
it muſt needs loſe much of this time before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
And thus much I thought convenient to
inſert in theſe diſcourſes touching the ebbing and
flowing of the ſea, as not impertinent to martiall
knowledge.</p>

ſenſe they may underſtand theſe vocabularies,
<hi>Triremes, Quadriremes,</hi> and <hi>Quinqueremes:</hi>
whether they were ſo termed in regard of the

at an oare, as the cuſtome of the Gallies
is at this day; or otherwiſe, becauſe a <hi>Trireme</hi>

meeting with <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> in the ſtreights of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bralta,</hi>
each of them had a <hi>Quinquereme</hi> and
ſeven or eight <hi>Triremes</hi> a piece: the current in
that place was ſo great that it gave no place to
Art, but carried the veſſels according to the fall
of the Billow: in which uncertainty the <hi>Trire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>

for that <hi>pluribus remorum ordinibus ſcindenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
vertices, facilius regeretur,</hi> in regard of
the pluralitie of banks of oares which reſiſted the
billow and ſteamed the current, ſhe ſunk two of
the <hi>Triremes,</hi> and ſo got the victorie. From hence
they prove that a <hi>Quinquereme</hi> had <hi>plures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morumordines</hi>
then a <hi>Trireme</hi> had; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it took the name from the plurality of banks

                        <p>But the contrary opinion doth interpret <hi>Ordo

another on each ſide of the veſſell, which we call
a pair of oares: So that a <hi>Quinquereme</hi> being
far greater and longer then a <hi>Trireme,</hi> had more
paires of oares then a <hi>Trireme</hi> had, and thoſe

wanting the uſe of Artillery, and managing

to make uſe of their Art in their conflicts and
encounters by ſea: for all their ſhips of ſervice,
which we term men of war, carried a ſtrong

them. And herein Art gave great advantage;
for he that could beſt skill to turn his ſhip with
greateſt celerity, and ſo fruſtrate an offer, or with
ſpeedy and ſtrong agitation follow an advantage,
commonly got the victory.</p>
                        <p>In the battel which <hi>D. Brutus</hi> had with the

when they ſhould come to the hurt, they ſpeedily
in a trice of time wound themſelves from between
them, and the two <hi>Triremes</hi> met with ſuch a

coming of his navy. Which was no ſooner arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but the enemy deſcrying it, preſently made
out 220 ſaile of ſhips wel-appointed and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all reſpects to oppoſe them. Neither did
<hi>Brutus</hi> the Admiral, nor any Tribune or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion
in his navy know what to do, or what
courſe of fight to take: for the ſhipping of the
<hi>Galles</hi> was ſo ſtrong, that the beak-head of their
<hi>Quinqueremes</hi> could perform no ſervice upon
them; and although they ſhould raiſe turrets
according to their uſe, yet theſe would not equall
in height the poup of the Enemies ſhipping; ſo
that therein alſo the <hi>Galles</hi> had advantage.
For as the <hi>Romans</hi> could not much annoy them
with their weapons, in regard they lay ſo low un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them; ſo on the contrary their darts muſt
needs fall with great advantage upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
Yet one thing there was amongſt their
proviſions which ſtood them in great ſtead: for
the <hi>Romans</hi> had provided great ſharp hooks
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51174:71"/>
or ſickles, which they put upon great and long
poles; theſe they faſtened to the tackling which
held the main-yard to the mast; and then haling
away their ſhip with force of Oares, they cut the
ſaid tackling, and the main-yard fell down.
Whereby the <hi>Galles,</hi> whoſe only hope for their
navy conſiſted in the ſailes and tackling, loſt at
one inſtant both their ſailes and the uſe of their
ſhipping: And then the controverſy fell within the
compaſſe of valour, wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the <hi>Galles;</hi> and the rather, inaſmuch
as they fought in the ſight of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the

in ſecret; for all the hills and clifts which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
near proſpect into the ſea, were covered with
the <hi>Roman</hi> Army.</p>
                     <p>Their main-yards being cut down, and the
<hi>Romans</hi> (though every ſhip of theirs had two or
three of the enemyes about it) indeavouring with
great fury to boord them, failed not to take many
of their ſhips: which the <hi>Galles</hi> perceiving, and
finding no remedy nor hope of reſiſtance, began
all to fly, and turning their ſhips to a fore-wind,
were upon a ſudden ſo becalmed, that they were
able to make no way at all. Which fell out very
fitly for the <hi>Romans,</hi> who now fighting ſhip to
ſhip eaſily took them, inſomuch that of ſo great
a navy very few (through the help of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
eſcaped to land, after they had fought the
ſpace of eight houres: with which battel ended
the warre with the <hi>Veneti,</hi> and the reſt of the

young and old, in whom there was either cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
counſell, or dignity, were preſent at this

make was here ingaged, taken and loſt; ſo that
ſuch as remained knew not whither to go, nor

being lodged within leſſe then two miles of <hi>Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

putting them in battel gave him opportunity to
fight if he would: which <hi>Sabinus</hi> refuſed in ſuch
ſort, that he began not only to be ſuſpected by the
Enemy of cowardiſe, but to be taunted with the
reprochfull ſpeeches of his own ſouldiers. The
opinion of his being fearfull thus ſetled in the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51174:71"/>
minds of the enemy, he uſed all means to increaſe
it, and carried it ſo well, that the Enemy durſt
approach the very rampier of the Camp. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
that he pretended was, that he thought it
not the part of a Legate, in the abſence of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
to ſight with an Enemy of that ſtrength,
but upon ſome good opportunity, or in a place of
advantage. In this generall perſwaſion of fear,
<hi>Sabinus</hi> choſe out a ſubtle-witted <hi>Gall,</hi> an aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliarie
in his army, whom he perſwaded with
great rewards and further promiſes to fly to the

and that the night following <hi>Sabinus</hi> was
about to withdraw his forces ſecretly out of his

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which advertiſement, they

was not to be omitted; but ſetting apart all
other deviſes, they would go and aſſault the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
camp. Many circumſtances perſwaded the
<hi>Galles</hi> to this reſolution: as firſt the lingring and
doubt which <hi>Sabinus</hi> had made, when he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
battel; ſecondly, the intelligence which this
fugitive had brought; thirdly, the want of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
wherein they had been negligent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly
careleſſe; fourthly, the hope they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the war of <hi>Vannes;</hi> and laſtly, for
that men willingly believe that which they would
have come to paſſe. The force of theſe motives
was ſo ſtrong, that they would not ſuffer <hi>Virido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vix</hi>
nor the reſt of the Captains to diſmiſſe the
Councell, untill they had yielded that they ſhould
take Armes, and go to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp. Which
being granted, they gathered rubbiſh and faggots
to fill up the ditch; and with cheerfull hearts, as
though the victory were already gotten, they
marched to the place where <hi>Sabinus</hi> was incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
which was the top of a hill, riſing gently

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sabinus</hi> incouraging his ſouldiers, gave the

purſued after and ſlew great numbers of them:

                        <p>The chiefeſt thing in this place which brought
them to their overthrow was diſappointment:
for it is a thing hardly to be digeſted in buſineſſes
of ſmall conſequence, to be fruſtrated of a ſetled
expectation, when the mind ſhall diſpoſe her
ſelf to one only intent, and in the upſhot meet
with a counterbuffe to croſſe her purpoſes, and ſo
defeat her of that hope which the ſtrength of her
reaſon hath entertained: how much more then
in things of ſuch importance, when we ſhall
proceed in a courſe of victory, and humour our
conceits with that we wiſh and would have to
happen, and in the end meet either with bondage
or death, muſt our beſt wits be appalled, having
neither reſpite nor means to think how the evil
may be beſt prevented? Which the wiſe <hi>Romans</hi>
wel underſtood, and counted it no diſhonour to
be reproched with ſhamefull cowardiſe, by ſuch
as knew not the ſecrets of wiſdome; while they

this truth: but let the battel of <hi>Dreux</hi> ſerve
for all; wherein the Proteſtants, overcharging

that they quickly became Maſters of the field;
and then neglecting martiall diſcipline, fell in
confuſedly with the broken multitude, to make
the victory more glorious by ſlaughter and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> all this while budged

having raiſed an exceeding high mount, the <hi>Jews</hi>
undermined the ſame with ſuch Art, that as they
digged underneath, they ſupported the Mount
with huge props and planks that it might not
ſhrink: and watching a time of greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
they ſet all the timber-work which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped
the mount on fire; which taking fire
with the help of Brimſtone and Pitch, the Mount
fell upon a ſudden, to the great terrour &amp; amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>Galles</hi> by undermining did take the earth from
the Mount, as faſt as it was carried unto it by the
<hi>Romans;</hi> and ſo kept it from riſing, and made
it uneffectuall. But if it were for the moſt part
made of wood, or other combuſtible matter, they
ſought then by all means to burn it; as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
at the ſiege of <hi>Maſſilia:</hi> and oftentimes
when both burning and undermining failed,
they confronted it with another Mount within

of the Mine, that we may not erre in our courſe
which the Compaſſe affordeth. Thirdly, the
ſtrengthening of the Mine with timber-work, if
need require. Laſtly, the countermining and
croſſe-meeting. All which parts have very many
circumſtances, and require a larger diſcourſe then
may be thought pertinent for this place.</p>

the deeds and monuments of former ages, we
may obſerve two eſpeciall means which the great
Commanders of the world have entertained to
atchieve victory,<note place="margin">Two meanes to atchieve victory and to over-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter our enemies.</note> and over-maſter their enemies:
the firſt by cunning and wiſe carriage of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before it come to triall by blows; the ſecond
by forceable means and waging of battel: the one
proceeding from wiſdome and the better facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the ſoul; and the other depending upon
the ſtrength and ability of the body.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the firſt, it hath ever been held
more honourable, as better ſuting the worth of
the ſpirit and the divine eſſence of our nature, ſo
to direct the courſe of an action, that the adverſe
part may be weakned by wit, and prevented in
the projects of their better fortunes by anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

taken from their own proceedings, to
be driven to that exigent which may determine
of the controverſy before they come to blows,
and conclude the matter by terms of Art taken
from the directions of good providence. For to
ſpeak a truth, the action of battel, as it is the laſt
part in that faculty, ſo it is the worſt in regard of
Chriſtian duty, and better fitteth the progeny of
<hi>Lamech</hi> his ſecond wife (which the Divines do

                           <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the firſt of the Civile wars reſpected
the ſame thing, but from other grounds: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſhut up <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Petreius</hi> in a place
of diſadvantage, ſo as he might have cut them off
without further trouble; yet foraſmuch as he
foreſaw the victory coming towards him without
blow or wound, he thus anſwered his Captains
that were earneſt upon the enemy; <hi>Cur, etiam
ſecundo praelio, aliquos ex ſuis amitteret? cur
vulnerari pateretur optime de ſe meritos mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes?
cur denique fortunam periclitaretur?</hi>
Why ſhould he loſe any of his ſouldiers in battel,
though he got the day? why ſhould he ſuffer
thoſe to be wounded who had deſerved ſo highly
at his hands? or why ſhould he hazard his good
fortune? And this courſe did theſe <hi>Galles</hi> take
which under <hi>Sertorius</hi> had learned the <hi>Roman</hi>
Art, and the <hi>Roman</hi> induſtry: and were now
become ſo expert, that they had almoſt beaten
the <hi>Romans</hi> at their own weapon.</p>
                        <p>This firſt means is principally to be imbraced,
as the ſafeſt way in theſe uncertain and caſuall
events: for that which reſteth upon corporall
ſtrength, and maketh execution the means to a
concluſion, is very terrible even to the better par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
full of hazard, and of little certainty. For it
were a miracle of Fortune never heard of yet, ſo
to carry a battel upon what advantage or means
ſoever, that the victor Army ſhould buy ſo
great a fortune without bloudſhed or loſſe of
men; and erect a Trophy to Honour at the ſole
coſt of the Enemy, without loſſe or expenſe of his
own treaſure.</p>
                        <p>And for the uncertainty in a battel, who
knoweth not what infinite chances and changes
may happen in every ſmall moment of time, to
turne the fortune of the day to this or that partie,
and make both ſides unconſtant in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by preſenting them interchangeably with
hope and fear, joy and ſorrow? And therefore
<hi>Caeſar</hi> thought it not beſt to tempt the wayward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Fortune, when by other means he might
obtain his deſires.</p>
                        <p>This, I ſay, is chiefly to be imbraced, if our
means will afford us that happineſſe: but howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I hold it wiſedome ſo to entertain this courſe
of victory, that we omit not the chiefeſt helps of
furtherance when it cometh to blows; but to think
of this conqueſt by art and wit, as neceſſary if our
means will ſerve us to compaſſe it; &amp; of the other,
as neceſſary whether we will or no: for the hiſtory
maketh it plain, that when <hi>Brutus</hi> found himſelf
deſtitute of means to undertake that courſe of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
which proceedeth from providence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet
carriage, he then betook himſelf neceſſarily
to the later, and by the help of battel ſought to
free himſelf from thoſe diſadvantages into which
the <hi>Galles</hi> had brought him.</p>

for their uſuall manner was to make a triple bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
that the firſt might have a ſecond and a third

in the diſpoſition of his troups to battel, which is
here ſaid to be in <hi>mediam Aciem;</hi> for as their
Armies were divided into three battels, ſo every
battel was divided into three parts, the two cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and the battel, wherein theſe Auxiliary forces
were in this ſervice beſtowed: of theſe he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſaith, that inaſmuch as he durſt not put any
confidence in them, he commanded them to ſerve
the <hi>Romans</hi> in time of battel with ſtones and
weapons, and to carry earth and turf to the
Mount. The reaſon why ſuſpected troups are
placed in the battel, rather then in either of the
cornets, is, for that the battel hath not ſuch ſcope
to fling out, or take advantage of place to do
miſchief, as the cornets have: for whereſoever
there have been ſet battels fought, the ſtrength of
their Army conſiſted alwayes in the cornets, as
the two principall inſtruments of the battel; and
as long as theſe ſtood ſound, the victory went
alwayes certain on that part; for the cornets
both kept the enemy from incompaſſing about
the body of their Army, and had the advantage
alſo of charging upon the open ſide of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
                        <p>At the battel of <hi>Cannae, Hannibal</hi> put the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of his forces in the battel, and advancing them
towards the enemy left the two cornets behind:
ſo that when the enemy came to charge upon the
battel, they eaſily beat them back, and as they
followed the retreat fell in between the two cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
wherein the ſtrength of the Army conſiſted;
and being by them incompaſſed on each ſide,
were defeated and overthrown. And thus we ſee
the advantage which a Generall hath when his
two cornets ſtand firm, although the battel ſhrink
in the encounter. <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the battel he had
with <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> placed the Strangers in the

ſpeedily came to the place of the fortifications

                        <hi>Menapii</hi> ſtood out in Armes, and had never
either ſent Embaſſadour, or otherwiſe treated of
Peace; <hi>Caeſar</hi> thinking that war might quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be ended, led his Army into their Countrey.
At his coming he found them to carry their
warres farre otherwiſe then the reſt of the
<hi>Galles</hi> had done: for underſtanding that the
greateſt Nations of <hi>Gallia,</hi> which had waged
battel with the <hi>Romans,</hi> were beaten and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown;
and having whole continents of woods
and bogs in their territories, they conveyed both
themſelves and their goods into thoſe quarters.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> coming to the beginning of the woods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fortify his Camp, not diſcovering any ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
near about him; but as his men were diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in their charges, they ſuddenly ſallyed out of
the woods, and aſſaulted the <hi>Romans;</hi> but being
ſpeedily driven in again, with the loſſe of many
of them, as the <hi>Romans</hi> followed them farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the woods, they had ſome few of their men
ſlain.</p>
                     <p>The time that remained <hi>Caeſar</hi> reſolved to
ſpend in cutting down the woods: and leaſt the
ſouldiers might be taken unawares while they
were buſied in that work, he cauſed them to
place all the trees which they cut down on either
ſide of the Army, that they might ſerve for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
againſt ſudden aſſaults. A great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of ground was thus rid within a few dayes, ſo
that their goods and cattell was ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſuch a continuall rain, as forced them to leave
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51174:75"/>
off the work; and the ſouldiers could no longer
indure to ly in ſents of skinnes: and therefore
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> after he had waſted and ſpoiled their
Countrey, burned their towns and their houſes,
carryed back his Army, and placed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Aulerci, Lexovii,</hi> &amp; in other cities to

                        <p>THe <hi>Iriſh</hi> rebels having the like commodity of
woods and bogges, do entertain the like
courſe of warre as the <hi>Morini</hi> did with <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
The meanes which he uſed to diſappoint them of
that practice was, to cut down the woods; which
if it be thought monſtrous in this age, or ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to our men of war, let them conſider that
the <hi>Roman</hi> diſcipline wrought greater effects of
valour, then can be made credible by the uſe of
theſe times. For beſides their exquiſite diſcipline,
which of it ſelf was able to frame patterns of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled
magnanimitie, their induſtry was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
in the execution thereof, and carried it
with ſuch unceſſant travell, that the ſouldiers
thought it great happineſſe when they came to
wage battel with the Enemy; and could have
meanes to quit their continuall travell with the
hazard of their lives.</p>
                        <p>Neither let it ſeem ſtrange that the <hi>Romans</hi>
undertook to cut down the woods; but rather
let us admire their facility in ſo difficult a task:
for as the hiſtory witneſſeth, <hi>magno ſpacio pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
diebus confecto, incredibili celeritate,</hi> a great
quantity of ground was rid in a few dayes, with
incredible ſpeed. And after the woods were cut
down, they took more paines in placing it on
each ſide of the legions to hinder any ſuddain
aſſault, then they did in cutting it down: which
deſerveth as great admiration as the former part.
There is another place in the ſixth book of theſe
Commentaries, which expreſſeth more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the nature of ſuch warres, and may ſerve to
acquaint us with that which <hi>Caeſar</hi> did in theſe
difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Eburones,</hi> or the men of <hi>Liege,</hi> had the
like commodity of woods and bogges, and made
uſe of them in the warre they had with <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
The matter, ſaith he, required great diligence, not
ſo much in regard of the perill of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
(for there could no danger come from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
that was frighted and diſperſed) as the
ſafety of every particular ſouldier, which in part
did pertain to the welfare of the whole Army.
For the deſire of a bootie carried many of the
ſouldiers farre from the body of the Army; and
the woods being full of unknown and ſecret paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
would not ſuffer them to go either thick
together, or cloſe imbattelled. If he deſired to
have the warre ended, and the race of thoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men to be rooted out, he muſt of force make
many ſmall companies, and divide his men into
many bodies: but if he would have the Maniples
to keep at their Enſignes, as the diſcipline and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army required, then the
place was a ſhelter and defence to the enemy.
Neither did they want courage to lay Ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to circumvent ſuch as they found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
ſtraggling from their companies. In theſe
difficulties there was as much done as diligence
could do, providing rather to be wanting in the
offenſive part (although all mens minds were
ſet on fire with revenge) then to hurt the enemy
with the loſſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldier. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent
meſſengers to the bordering States, to come out
and ſack the <hi>Eburones,</hi> and they ſhould have
all the prey for their labour: that the life of the
<hi>Galles</hi> rather then his legionary ſouldiers, might
be hazarded in thoſe woods; as alſo that with ſo
great a multitude, both the race and name of that
people might be quite extinguiſhed.</p>
                        <p>There are many particularities in this relation
which concern the true motion of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> wars,
which may be better obſerved by ſuch as know

paſſed over the <hi>Rhene</hi> with
great multitudes of people, not farre from the

their ſlitting was, the ill intreaty which for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years together they had received of the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi>
the greateſt and warlikeſt nation amongſt the
<hi>Germans.</hi> For theſe <hi>Suevi</hi> had one hundred
Cantons or ſhires, which yearly furniſhed their
warres with a thouſand men apiece; and kept as
many at home to maintain both themſelves and
their Armies abroad: and theſe the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
were in Armes, and the other ſtayed at
home and performed the like duty; and ſo by this
means they all continued their experience both
of tillage and matter of warre. No man had
any ground proper to himſelf, neither might they
abide longer then a year in one place. They li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
chiefly upon cattell and milk, and uſed much
hunting; which was the cauſe (what through
the quality of their diet, their continuall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
and liberty of life, being never brought up
to any calling or tyed to any diſcipline, nor urged
to any thing against their diſpoſition) that they
were ſtrong and of a large ſtature: and they had
uſed themſelves ſo to it, that they never cared
for any cloathing in the coldeſt place they came
in, more then skins and hides, which covered
but part of their body, the reſt being naked: and
they waſh their bodies uſually in the rivers.
They have merchants that frequent their ports,
not ſo much to bring them any commodities from
abroad, as to buy the prey and ſpoil they take in
warre. And whereas the <hi>Galles</hi> take much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in oxen and other beaſts, and ſtick not to
give any price for them; the <hi>Germans</hi> care not
for the bringing of them amongſt them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſe their own miſhapen ugly cattel, which
by daily inuring they bring to perform any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Their horſemen oftentimes in time of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
forſook their horſe, and fought on foot; their
horſes being taught to ſtand ſtill in one place,
that when they would they might return unto
them. Neither was there any thing accounted
more baſe, or uſeleſſe in the courſe of their life,
then to uſe furniture for horſes: and therefore
they would adventure to charge upon great
troups of horſe that uſed Equipage, with a few of
their own quality. They admitted no wine to be
brought in unto them, leaſt it might effeminate
their warlike inclination, or make them unapt
for labour. The greateſt honour in their opinion
was, to have then bordering Territories ly waſte
and deſolate: for ſo it would be thought that
many States together could not reſiſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
valour: and it was reported that the

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51174:77"/>
climate, and under the ſame parallel, receiving
the vertue of the celeſtiall bodies by the ſame
downfall and rebound of their beams, being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced
only by Eaſt and Weſt, are ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
in nature, and ſo unlike in diſpoſition, is
not ſo apparant: whether it be, as ſome have i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined,
foraſmuch as the all-incloſing ſphear,
which remaineth quiet and immoveable above
the circuit of the firſt motor, hath his parts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
diſtinguiſhed with variety of properties,
which by continuall reference and mutuall aſpect
are imprinted in the correſpondent quarters of the
earth, and ſo keep a perpetuall reſidency of one
and the ſame quality in one and the ſame place,
and make alſo the variety of faſhions in ſuch
parts as otherwiſe are equall favourites of the
heavens majeſty, by receiving an equall meaſure
of light, heat and vertue; or whether the ſaid
quarters of the earth are in themſelves diverſly
noted with ſeverall qualities, which appropriate
the ſelf-ſame influence to their particular nature,
and ſo alter it into many faſhions; or whether
there be ſome other unknown cauſe: I will leave
every man to ſatisfy himſelf with that which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
moſt probable unto him, and proceed to the
diſcovery of this cholerick paſſion. Wherein I
will endeavour to ſhew how impatiency, ſudden
reſolution, and deſire of novelty, are naturall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts
of this humour. And if <hi>Caeſar</hi> made uſe of
this Philoſophy in the managing of that war, let
it not be thought impertinent to the knowledge
of a Generall to enter into the conſideration of
this learning. Wherein firſt I muſt lay for a
maxime that which long experience hath made
authenticall, that the motions of the mind are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quick or ſlow, according as the complexion
is tempered either with heat or cold: for as the
phlegmaticall humour is of a moiſt, cold and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
nature, begetting weak and groſſe ſpirits, and
benumming the inſtruments with a liveleſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability;
ſo is the motion of the internall faculties
proceeding likewiſe after a ſlow manner, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quality of the inſtruments whereby it
moveth: and therefore men of this wateriſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
are no way apt to receive an impreſſion,
nor to entertain any ſenſible apprehenſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be beaten into them with often and ſtrong
repetitions; and then alſo they proceed as ſlowly
in diſcourſing of the conſequence, and linger in
the choice of their reſolutions. On the contrary
part, this <hi>flava bilis,</hi> being of a hot piercing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and reſembling the active vertue of the fire,
doth ſo purify the inſtruments of ſenſe, and
quicken the ſpirits with the vivacity of motion,
that they take the firſt impreſſion as perfectly, as
if it had been oftentimes preſented unto them with
many ſtrong circumſtances. And thence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth,
that inaſmuch as the <hi>Species</hi> is ſo readily
received, and poſſeſſeth the apprehending faculty
with ſuch facility of entrance, that it moveth the
other powers of the ſoul with as great efficacy at
the firſt conception, as if it had been brought in
with troups of probabilities, and ſtrengthened
with manifeſt arguments of undoubted truth. It
followeth therefore (by reaſon of the ſubtile and
fit diſpoſition of the inſtruments, which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from heat the chiefeſt quality in choler) that
the object is at the firſt moment ſo ſtrongly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the firſt receiving faculty, that the other
powers of the mind with as great ſpeed manifeſt
their offices concerning the apprehenſion, and
deliver a ſentence anſwerable to the ſtrength of
the firſt conception: which maketh them ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of delay, and ſo ſuddenly to alter their
former reſolutions, not ſuffering the diſcourſive
power to examine the ſubſtance thereof by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of circumſtances, nor to give judgement
according to the courſe of our intellectuall court.
It behoveth therefore every man in that unſteady
diſpoſition, eſpecially in matter of moment, to be
ſuſpicious of his own credulity, and not to give
place to reſolution, before his judgement be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by diſcourſe of the ſtrength or weakneſſe
of the conceived opinion.</p>
                        <p>But to leave theſe ſpeculative meditations to
Philoſophers of learned conceit; foraſmuch as
the right uſe of paſſions is either true wiſdome, or
cometh neareſt to the ſame; I will only touch
in a word what degree of choler beſt befitteth a
ſouldier, or how it availeth or diſadvantageth in
matter of war. And firſt it cannot be denied,
that there is almoſt no paſſion that doth more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe
the light of reaſon, or ſooner corrupteth the
ſincerity of a good judgement, then this of anger
which we now ſpeak of: Neither is there any
motion that more pleaſeth it ſelf in his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or followeth them with greater heat in the
execution. And if the truth chance to ſhew it
ſelf, and convince a falſe pretended cauſe as the
authour of that paſſion, it oftentimes redoubleth
the rage even againſt truth and innocency. <hi>Piſo</hi>
condemned a ſouldier for returning from forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
without his companion, being perſwaded
that he had ſlain him: but at the inſtant of the
execution the other that was miſſing returned,
and with great joy of the whole Army they were
carried to the Generall, thinking to have much
gratified him with the manifeſtation of the truth:
but he through ſhame and deſpight, being yet in
the torture of his wrath, redoubled his anger, and
by a ſubtilty which his paſſion furniſhed him
withall, he made three culpable for that he found
one innocent; the firſt becauſe the ſentence of
death was paſt againſt him, and was not to be
recalled without the breach of law: the ſecond
for that he was the cauſe of the death of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion:
and thirdly the executioner, for not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
his commandment.</p>
                        <p>Concerning matter of war, as it conſiſteth of
differenced parts, ſo hath choler divers effects.
In caſe of diſcourſe and conſultation, whenas the
powers of the mind ought to be clear of all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51174:77"/>
affections, it greatly darkeneth the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and troubleth the ſincerity of a good
judgement, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> noted in his ſpeech to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
concerning <hi>Catiline:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Saluſt.</note> and therefore a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
muſt by all means endeavour to avoyd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the leaſt motions of ſo hurtfull a paſſion, and
ſeaſon his affections with that gravity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of ſpirit, that no turbulent diſpoſition may
either hinder his underſtanding, or withhold his
will from following that courſe, which reaſon
appointeth as the beſt means to a fortunate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe;
alwayes remembring that all his actions
are preſented upon a ſtage, and paſſe the cenſure
of many curious beholders, which applaud grave
and patient motions, as the greateſt proof of true
wiſdome, and diſallow of paſſionate and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong
affection, as derogating from the ſincere
carriage of an action, how juſt ſoever otherwiſe
it ſeemeth.</p>
                        <p>Concerning execution and fury of battel, I
take anger to be a neceſſary inſtrument to ſet va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
on foot, and to overwage the difficulties of
terrour with a furious reſolution: for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the nobleſt actions of the mind ſtand in
need of the impulſions of paſſions, I take anger
to be the fitteſt means to advance the valiant car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of a battel; for as fear is treacherous and
unſafe, ſo anger is confident and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencheable
heat. And therefore a Commander
ought by all means to ſuggeſt matter of anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
an Enemy, that his men may behold them
with a wrathfull regard, and thirſt after the day
of battel, to ſatisfy their fury with the bloud of their
adverſaries. If any urge that it hath been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obſerved of the <hi>Galles,</hi> that in the beginning
of a battell they were more then men, and in the
later end they were leſſe then women; and
therefore a cholerick diſpoſition is not ſo fit for
ſervice, as we ſeem to make it: I anſwer, that
there is a difference between a diſpoſition to cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
ſuch as was obſerved in the <hi>Galles,</hi> and the
paſſion of anger well kindled in the mind: for
the firſt is ſubject to alteration and contrariety
of actions; but the other is furious, invincible,
never ſatisfyed but with revenge. And ſo that of
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is proved true, that anger ſerveth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as a weapon to vertue: whereunto ſome
anſwer very pleaſantly, ſaying, it is a weapon of
a ſtrange nature; for we do manage other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and this doth manage us; our hand gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not it, but it guideth our hand; it poſſeſſeth
us,<note place="margin">Tacit.</note> &amp; not we it, as it happened in the reign of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
amongſt the mutinous legions at <hi>Vetera:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Annal.</note>
and therefore a Commander ought to take great
heed, whom he maketh the object of that anger
which kindleth in his Army. For as it is a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of terrible execution, and therefore needeth to
be wiſely directed; ſo is it dangerous in regard
of obedience, which was the only thing which
<hi>Caeſar</hi> required in his ſouldiers.</p>
                        <p>But to leave this haſty matter, and fall nearer
that which we ſeek after: I may not omit the
Prognoſtication which <hi>Caeſar</hi> made of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this accident, by the naturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people; the event whereof proved the
truth of his predictions: which ſheweth what
advantage a learned Generall that hath been
ſomewhat inſtructed in the ſchool of Nature,
hath gained of him whom only experience hath
taught the active rudiments of the war, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of no further leſſion in that art, then that
which the office of a Serjeant or Lancepreſado
containeth.</p>

thought it best to diſſemble what he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

he commanded certain troups of horſe to be levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and reſolved to make war upon the <hi>Germans:</hi>
and having made proviſion of corn, he directed
his march towards them. From whom, as he
was on the way within a few dayes journey of
their Camp, he received this meſſage: The
<hi>Germans</hi> as they were not willing to make war
upon the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt, ſo they would not refuſe
to make triall of their manhood if they were
juſtly provoked; for their ancient cuſtome was
to anſwer an Enemy by force, and not by treaty:
yet thus much they would confeſſe, that they came
thither very unwillingly, being driven by violence
out of their poſſeſſions. If the <hi>Roman</hi> people
would accept of their friendſhip, and either give
them territories to inhabit, or ſuffer them to
keep that which they had got by the law of
Armes, they might prove profitable friends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. They only yielded to the <hi>Suevi,</hi> to whom

                     <p>To this <hi>Caeſar</hi> anſwered what he thought

through the <hi>Nantuates, Helvetii, Sequani, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diomatrices,

                     <p>When <hi>Caeſar</hi> was come within twelve miles

were in number five thouſand
(whereas the <hi>Germans</hi> had not above eight
hundred horſe, thoſe that went over the <hi>Moſa</hi> to

the <hi>Romans</hi> not expecting any hoſtile incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
inaſmuch as their Embaſſadours were new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
departed from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and had obtained that
day of truce: but being ſet upon, they made what
reſiſtance they could. The <hi>Germans,</hi> according
to their uſuall cuſtom, for ſook their horſe, and
fighting on foot ran our horſes into the bellies,
and overthrew many of our men, ſo that they
eaſily put the <hi>Romans</hi> to flight; who never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
back, untill they came into the ſight of the
legions. In that battel were ſlain 74 <hi>Roman</hi>
horſemen, &amp; amongſt the reſt <hi>Piſo</hi> an <hi>Aquitane,</hi>
a valiant man, and born of noble parentage, whoſe
grandfather was the chief ruler in his city, and
called friend by the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate. This <hi>Piſo</hi>
ſeeing his brother compaſſed about by the enemy,
brake in upon them and reſcued him: but having
his horſe wounded under him in the action, and
being diſmounted, he fought ſtoutly on foot, till
ſuch time as the enemy hemm'd him in, and
gave him in, and gave him ſeverall wounds; then he fell down.
Which his brother ſeeing afarre off (for he had
left the battel) he clapp'd ſpurrs to his horſe,
and ruſhing upon the throng to reſcue him, was
there ſlain.</p>
                     <p>After this battel <hi>Caeſar</hi> thought it not ſafe
either to hearken to any conditions, or to receive
any meſſage from them that by fraud and deceit
had ſought for peace, and meant nothing but
warre: And to attend any longer untill their
horſemen returned, was but to give them that
advantage againſt him, eſpecially conſidering
the weakneſſe of the <hi>Galles,</hi> amongſt whom the

                        <p>THis cunning of the <hi>Germans</hi> offereth occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſpeak ſomewhat concerning that main
controverſie of policie, which is, whether the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Princes and great Commanders are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to be attended with integrity and faithfull
accompliſhment thereof. Wherein I will only
ſet down ſuch arguments and grounds of reaſon,
which vertue and morall honeſty on the one
part, (for we will make it no queſtion to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51174:79"/>
on the other ſide, alledge to make good their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
aſſertions.</p>
                        <p>The great Politicians of the world, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

and ſtudy to maintain their ſtates only with
humane reaſon, not regarding the authority of
divine ordinance, ſet this down as a <hi>maxime</hi> in
their Art; That he that is to negotiate a matter,
and meaneth to bring it to an end ſorting to his
contentment, muſt in all reſpects be like qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both in judgement and diſpoſition, as the
party is with whom he dealeth: otherwiſe he
cannot be ſufficiently prepared to hold himſelf
ſtrong in the matter, which he undertaketh. For
a wraſtler that cometh with mere ſtrength to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
another that hath both ſtrength and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
may beſhrew his ſtrength that brought him
thither, to be caſt by skill, and be laught at as an
unworthy Champion for ſerious ſports: in like
manner in this univerſall confuſion of infidelity,
wherein ſubtilty flyeth at ſo high a pitch, he that
thinketh with ſimplicity of ſpirit to wind through
the labyrinths of falſhood, and avoyd the ſnares
of deceit, ſhall find himſelf too weak for ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a task, and beſhrew his honeſty, if he regard
his commodity. For it is the courſe that every
man taketh which muſt bring us to the place to
which every man goeth: and he that oppoſeth
himſelf againſt the current of the world, may
ſtand alone in his own conceit, and never attain
that which the world ſeeketh after. Foraſmuch
therefore as craft and deceit are ſo generall, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth
a man of publick negotiations to carry a
mind apt and diſpoſed to theſe qualities. This
was ſignified by that which ancient writers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who was ſent to <hi>Chiron</hi> the
Centaur, half a man and half a beaſt, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the rudiments of Princely carriage;
that of the brutiſh part he might learn to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
himſelf with force and courage, and of the
humane ſhape ſo to manage reaſon, that it might
be a fit inſtrument to anſwer or prevent whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mans wit might forge to overthrow it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought a private man to wonder at the
ſtrangeneſſe of theſe poſitions, conſidering that
the government of kingdoms and Empires is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with another bias, then that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
particular affairs in a wel-ordered State:
wherein truth-breakers and faithleſſe diſſemblers
are worthily condemned, inaſmuch as they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
enforce the ruine thereof. But theſe that
ſit at the helm of government, and are to ſhape
the courſe of a State according to the variation of
times and fortunes, derive their concluſions from
other principles, whereof inferiour ſubjects are
no more capable then men are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the works of the Gods: and therefore
they are called <hi>arcana imperii,</hi> ſecrets of State,
to be reverenced rather then lookt into.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, the affairs of particular perſons
are of ſo ſhort extenſion, and incircled in ſo ſmall
a compaſſe, that a mean capacity may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the advantages or inconveniences which
may enſue upon the contract; and therefore it
is requiſite they ſhould ſtand to the adventure,
and their judgement is worthily taxed with the
loſſe: but the buſineſſes of the Commonweal are
both ſubject to ſo many caſualties of fortune, and
rely upon ſuch unexpected accidents, that it is
impoſſible for any ſpirit, how provident ſoever,
to foreſee the iſſue in that variety of chances. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that every particular ſubject is much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed
in the fortune of the event, and may juſtly
chalenge an alteration of the intended courſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then ſuffer ſhipwrack through the errour of
their Pilot: And ſo the ſafety of the State doth
balance out the loſſe of credit in the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, ſuch as zealouſly affect true
honour, affirm vertue to be the ſame both in
Prince and people; neither doth condition of
ſtate or calling, or the quality of publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
buſineſſes alter the nature and eſſence of
goodneſſe: for to deprive the tongue of truth
and fidelity were to break the bond of civile ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is the baſis and ground-plot of all
States and Commonweals. They do not deny
but that a wiſe Prince may ſo carry a treaty, that
he may ſeem to affect that moſt which he leaſt
intendeth; or anſwer doubtfully concerning the
propoſitions; and that he may uſe with great
honour the practices and ſtratagems of war, when
the fortune of both parties conſiſteth upon their
own induſtry: but to break any covenants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon may well get a kingdome, but never
honourable reputation.</p>
                        <p>And thus they contend concerning the means
whereby a State is continued in happy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

Princes and chiefest of the <hi>Germans</hi> came unto
<hi>Caeſar</hi> into his Camp, to excuſe their fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

glad, and cauſed them to be kept in hold; and
at the ſame inſtant brought his Army out of
the Camp, commanding his horſemen to follow
the legions, becauſe they had been daunted with
ſo late an overthrow: And making a triple
battel, marched ſpeedily eight miles, and ſo
came upon the <hi>Germans</hi> before they had notice
what had happened. Who being terrified with our
ſudden arrivall, and the departure of their own
leaders, knew not whether it were their best
courſe to bring forth their forces, or defend
their Camp, or otherwiſe to ſeek their ſafety by
flight. Which tumult and fear was no ſooner
perceived by the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers, but calling
to mind their perfidious treachery, they brake
into the Camp, and were at first a little reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
In the mean time the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(for they had brought all they had over

caſt themſelves into the river; where what
through fear, wearineſſe, and the force of the

of horſe which were abſent at the late overthrow

To whom when <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent Meſſengers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was limited by the

all the reſt of the <hi>Germans</hi> had only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of <hi>Caeſars</hi> friendſhip, and given pledges of

to ſend them aid againſt the <hi>Suevi;</hi> or at the
leaſt to tranſport his Army over the <hi>Rhene:</hi>
that would ſerve their turns, that would be help
and incouragement enough to them; for the
name and opinion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was ſo
great, and of ſuch fame, what with <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow,
and this laſt ſervice, that it ſounded
honourable amongſt the fartheſt Nations of
<hi>Germany,</hi> ſo that it was the greateſt ſafety to
have them their friends. For theſe reaſons <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
reſolved to paſſe the <hi>Rhene;</hi> but to carry his
Army over by boat was neither ſafe, nor for his
own honour, nor the majeſty of the people of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And albeit it ſeemed a matter of great
difficulty, by reaſon of the breadth, ſwiftneſſe
and depth of the river, to make a bridge: yet he
reſolved to try what he could do, otherwiſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
not to paſſe over at all. And ſo he
built a bridge after this manner.</p>
                     <p>At two foot diſtance he placed two trees of a
foot and halfe ſquare, ſharpened at the lower
end, and cut anſwerable to the depth of the river:
theſe he let down into the water with engines,
and drove them in with commanders, not perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51174:80"/>
after the faſhion of a pile, but gable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and bending with the courſe of the water:
oppoſite unto theſe he placed two other trees,
joyned together after the ſame faſhion, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
foot diſtant from the former, by the dimenſion
between their lower parts in the bottome of the
water, and reclining against the courſe of the
river. Theſe two pair of couples thus placed he
joyned together with a beam of two foot ſquare,
equall to the diſtance between the ſaid couples,
and faſtened them at each end on either ſide of
the couples with braces and pins: whereby the
ſtrength of the work and nature of the frame was
ſuch, that the greater the violence of the ſtream
was, and the faſter it fell upon the timber-work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the ſtronger the bridge was united in the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plings
and joynts. In like manner he proceeded
with couples and beams, untill the work was
brought unto the other ſide of the river: and
then he laid ſtraight planks from beam to beam,
and covered them with hurdles; and ſo he made
a floor to the bridge. Moreover on the lower
ſide of the bridge he drove down ſupporters, which
being faſtened to the timber-work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the bridge againſt the force of the water: and
on the upper ſide of the bridge, at a reaſonable
diſtance, he placed piles to hinder the force of
trees or boats, or what elſe the enemy might caſt
down to trouble the work or hurt the bridge.
Within ten dayes that the timber began to be cut
down and carried<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the work was ended, and the
Army tranſported. <hi>Caeſar</hi> leaving a strong
gariſon at either end of the bridge, went into the

effects of magnanimous induſtry, that ſucceeding
ages might not boaſt either of Art or proweſſe
which his vertue had not expreſſed, or otherwiſe
might wonder at that worth which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

he entertained <hi>Vuruvius</hi> the Father of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,
and as worthily to be imitated in that
faculty, as his Maſter <hi>Caeſar</hi> is in feats of Armes.
By whoſe example a great Commander may
learn, how much it importeth the eternity of his

and to eſteem of ſuch as are able to intreat the
Mathematicall Muſes to ſhew themſelves under

of the truth of their intellectuall nature, yet their

                        <p>The workmanſhip of this bridge conſiſted
chiefly in the oblique ſituation of the double poſts,
whereof the firſt order bending with the ſtream,
and the lower rank againſt the ſtream, when
they came to be coupled together with overthwart
beams, which were faſtened in the couplings
with braces which he nameth <hi>Fibulas,</hi> the more
violent the ſtream fell upon the work, the faſter
the joynts of the building were united, as may

then can be expreſſed by any circumſtance of

                        <p>I might hence take occaſion to ſpeak of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity

negligent in this duty. <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the life of

                           <pb n="94" facs="tcp:51174:81"/>
It is recorded by ancient Writers, that
thoſe demi-gods that governed the world in their
time, gave great honour to the exerciſe of hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the perfect image of war in the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of all parts, and namely in the diſcovery
and knowledge of a Country; without which
all enterpriſes, either of ſport in hunting, or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
in wars, were frivolous and of no effect.
And therefore <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the life of <hi>Cyrus</hi>
ſheweth, that his expedition againſt the King of
<hi>Armenia</hi> was nothing but a repetition of ſuch
ſports as he had uſed in hunting. Howſoever, if
the infinite examples regiſtred in hiſtory, how by
the dexterity of ſome Leaders it hath gained great
victories, and through the negligence of others
irrecoverable overthrows, are not ſufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to perſwade them to this duty; let their own
experience in matters of ſmall moment mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
the weakneſſe of their proceedings, when
they are ignorant of the chiefeſt circumſtances of
the matter they have in hand. But let this ſuffice
in the ſecond place to prove the neceſſity of good
diſcovery, and let us learn of <hi>Caeſar</hi> what is
principally to be inquired after in the diſcovery
of an unknown country: as firſt, the quantity
of the land; ſecondly, what Nations inhabite it;
thirdly, their uſe of war; fourthly, their civile
government; and laſtly, what Havens they have
to receive a Navy of great ſhipping. All which
circumſtances are ſuch principall Arteries in the
body of a State, that the diſcovery of any one of
theſe demands would have given great light
concerning the motion of the whole body.</p>

He himſelf arrived upon the coaſt about the

the Clifts poſſeſſed with the forces of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
The nature of the place was ſuch, that
the hils lay ſo ſteep over the ſea, that a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
might eaſily be caſt from the higher
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51174:81"/>
ground upon the lower ſhore: and therefore
he thought it no fit landing-place; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he caſt anchour untill the reſt of the

                     <p>In the mean time calling a Councell of the

beck, and in due time. The Councell being
diſmiſſed, having both wind and tide with
him, he weighed anchours, and ſailed eight
miles from that place, unto a plain and open
ſhore.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> perceiving the <hi>Romans</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
ſent their horſe and chariots (which
they commonly uſe in war) before, &amp; the reſt of
their forces followed after to the place where
the <hi>Romans</hi> intended to land. <hi>Caeſar</hi> found it
exceeding difficult to land his men for theſe
reſpects: the ſhips were ſo great that they
could not be brought near unto the ſhore; the
ſouldiers in ſtrange and unknown places, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their hands laden with great and heavy
weapons, were at one inſtant to go out of the
ſhip, to withſtand the force of the billow, and
to fight with the enemy; whereas the <hi>Britains</hi>
either ſtanding upon the ſhore, or making
ſhort ſallies into the water, did boldly caſt their
weapons in known and frequented places, and
managed their horſes accuſtomed to ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> being terrified with theſe
things, and altogether unskilfull of this kind
of fight, did not uſe the ſame courage as they
were wont to do in land-ſervices. Which when
<hi>Caeſar</hi> perceived, he cauſed the Gallies, that
were both ſtrange to the <hi>Britains,</hi> &amp; readier for
uſe, to be removed from the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to be rowed up and down, and laid againſt
the open ſide of the enemy; that from thence
with ſlings, engines, and arrowes, the Enemy
might be beaten up from the water ſide: which
ſtood the <hi>Romans</hi> in good ſtead. For the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
being troubled with the ſtrangeneſſe of
the Gallies, the motion of their Oares, and the
unuſuall kind of engines, were ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed,
and began to retire back, and give way

and eſpecially for fear of the depth of the
ſea, the Eagle-bearer of the tenth legion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
the Gods that it might fall out happily
to the legion, If you will, ſaith he, forſake your

caſt himſelf into the Sea, and carried the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
towards the Enemy. The <hi>Romans</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one another not to ſuffer ſuch a diſhonour
to be committed, they all leaped out of the ſhip:
which when others that were near at hand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
they followed them with as great ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity,
and preſſed towards the enemy to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with them.</p>
                     <p>The fight on both parts was very eager: the
<hi>Romans</hi> (not being able to keep any order of
battel, nor to get any firm footing, nor to follow
their Enſignes, foraſmuch as every man kept
with thoſe Enſignes which he firſt met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
were wonderfully troubled. But the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
acquainted with the flats and ſhallows, as
they beheld them from the ſhore to come ſingle
out of their ſhips, putting ſpurs to their horſe,
would ſet upon them incumbred and unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and many of them would over-lay a few:
others would get the advantage of the open
ſide, and caſt their weapons amongſt the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
troups of them. Which when <hi>Caeſar</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
he cauſed the ſhipboats and ſmaller

he ſaw need of help, he ſent them to reſcue ſuch

                     <p>Aſſoon as the <hi>Romans</hi> got footing on the firm
land, they made head together and charged
the enemy, and ſo put them to flight: but they

juſtly take occaſion to handle that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
which hath been often debated by our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>

queſtion of an invaſion, and in the abſence of

upon our Coaſt, or quietly to ſuffer him to ſet his
men on ſhore, and retire our forces into ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land

It ſeemeth that ſuch as firſt ſet this queſtion on
foot, and were of an opinion that we ought not
by any meanes to incounter an enemy at his
landing, for ſo we might much endanger our
ſelves and our Countrey, did ground themſelves
upon the authority of <hi>Monſieur de Langey</hi>
not obſerving the difference between an Iſland

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51174:82"/>
at his landing, not as being urged by that
party (for I never heard any probable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
from them which might induce any ſuch
opinion) but ſet down by ſuch as have looked
into the controverſies, both with experience and
good judgement.</p>
                        <p>And firſt it may be objected, that it is a hard
matter to reſiſt an enemy at his landing, as well
in regard of the uncertainty of place, as of time:
for being ignorant in what place he will attempt
a landing, we muſt either defend all places of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
or our intentions will prove m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>re frivolous;
and to perform that, it is requiſite that our defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
forces be ſufficient according to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
quality of every place ſubject to danger:
which, conſidering the large extenſion of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
parts, and the many landing-places on
our Coaſt, will require a greater number of men
then this Iſland can afford. And although it
could furniſh ſuch a competent number as might
ſeem in ſome ſort ſufficient, yet the uncertainty of
the time of the enemies arrivall would require that
they ſhould be lodged either upon, or near the
places of danger many dayes at leaſt, if not many
weeks, before the inſtant of their attempt; which
would exhauſt a greater maſſe of Treaſure, then
could be well afforded by the State.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it may be objected that all our land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-places
are of ſuch diſadvantage for the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
that it were no ſafety at all to make head
againſt him at the landing: for inaſmuch as ſuch
places are open and plain, they yield no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
to ſhelter the defendants from the fury of the
artillery, wherewith the Enemy will plentifully
furniſh their long boats and landing veſſels;
which beating upon the beach (for moſt of our
landing-places are of that quality) will ſo ſcatter
them, that no man ſhall be able to endure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
thereof.</p>
                        <p>The third objection may ariſe from the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
both of numbers, and condition of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of either party. For the firſt, it muſt needs be
granted that the defendants, being to guard ſo
many places at once, cannot furniſh ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to every particular place for defence, as the
aſſailants may for offence.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the quality of the forces, it is
without queſtion that a great and potent Prince
(for ſuch a one it muſt be that undertaketh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the territories of ſo abſolute and well-obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Princeſſe as her Majeſty is) would draw out

                           </gap>s qualified and drawn into one head,
and being to make as it were but one body,
how can it be reaſonably imagined (the time
and place of their attempt being uncertain)
that the defendants ſhould equall them with
forces of like vertue and experience.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the reaſons which may be drawn
from the diſadvantage which they have that
go about to oppoſe an enemy at his landing:
the reſt that have been urged by ſuch as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap> to the
queſtion, or taken altogether from falſe
grounds. But before I proceed to the anſwer of
theſe reaſons, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ay this down for a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
That it is impoſſible for any forreign
Prince, how puiſſant ſoever, to make ſuch a
preparation as ſhall be fitting to invade a State
ſo populous, and reſpective of their Sovereign
(notwithſtanding the pretences deviſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the ſame) but it muſt of neceſſity be
diſcovered before it can be made able to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in execution: which I might enlarge
by particularizing the infinite equipage which
is required for ſo great a fleet. But I will reſt
my ſelf in the example of the year eighty eight,

cannot indeed be denied but the place of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies

                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>re muſt generally extend it ſelf to all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of acceſſe: but that our defenſive forces are
not ſufficient in a competent manner to guard
all ſuch places, according as the neceſſity of
them ſhall require, that is the point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                        <p>To prove that our forces are ſufficient, we
muſt neceſſarily enter into particularities,
wherein I will take <hi>Kent</hi> for a preſident, as not
altogether unacquainted with the ſtate thereof;
which, if I deceive not my ſelf, is a ſhore of as
large extenſion upon the maritime parts as any
other within this kingdome. For the breadth
thereof enlarging it ſelf from the point of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

by <hi>Lyd,</hi> which is the uttermoſt skirt upon the
coaſt of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> unto <hi>Margate</hi> upon the coaſt
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> is by computation about twenty four
miles: but notwithſtanding this large circuit,
who knoweth not that the ſixth part thereof is
not ſubject to the landing of ſuch an enemy as
we ſpeak of; partly in regard of the hugeneſſe
of the cliffs, which do incloſe a great part of that
skirt, and partly in regard that much of that
quantity which may be landed upon hath ſuch
eminent and difficult places near adjoyning, as
an Army that ſhould put it ſelf there on ſhore,
ſhould find it ſelf, being oppoſed but by a ſmall
force, ſo ſtreightened, as they would not eaſily
find a way out, without apparant ruine of their
whole forces.</p>
                        <p>Further, it cannot be denied but that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
along the coaſt of <hi>Kent</hi> there are ſo many
rocks, ſhelves, flats, and other impediments, that
a Navie of great ſhips can have no commodity
to anchour near the ſhore; and for the moſt part
the coaſt lieth ſo open to the weather that the
leaſt gale of wind will put them from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chour:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51174:82"/>
all which particularities duly conſidered,
it will appear that this large sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>t of <hi>Kent</hi> will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a far leſſer part fit for the landing of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
then was thought of at the firſt. And were it
that ſo publick a treatiſe as this is would admit
with good diſcretion ſuch an exact relation as
falleth within my knowledge concerning this
point, I would undertake to make it ſo evident,
by the particular deſcription both of the number,
quantity, and quality of the places themſelves, as
no man of an indifferent judgement would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
our forces to be inſufficient to afford every
of them ſuch a ſafe and ſure guard, as ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e
thought requiſite for the ſame. But foraſmuch as
it is unfitting to give ſuch particular ſatisfaction
in this publick diſcourſe, give me leave, ſubmitting
my ſelf alwayes to better judgements, to give a
generall taſte of that means as would ſecure all
places with a competent number of men.</p>

which you may ſee, how great a force would in

of theſe out-skirts; and the rather, foraſmuch as
the one half of the whole forces are thus lodged

would alſo in the quartering of them an eſpeciall

to ſtretch them out along the coaſt by regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                        <p>Now concerning the later part of this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

which would proportion our attendance with the
neceſſity which is impoſed upon us to be carefull
in buſineſſes of this nature. Let this ſuffice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to prove that our forces are ſufficient to keep
the Sea-coaſt, and that the uncertainty of time
when the enemy will make his attempts, ought
not to hinder us from performing that duty which
the care and reſpect of our Prince and Countrey
impoſeth upon every good ſubject; which is the
ſubſtance of the firſt reaſon which I ſet down in
the beginning of this diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning the ſecond reaſon,<note place="margin">The anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> which
urgeth the diſadvantage of the place in regard of
the fury of the Enemies artillery; true it is, that
ſuch places as yield the Enemy commodity of
landing are for the moſt part plain and open, and
afford naturally no covert at all. What then?
ſhall a ſouldier take every place as he findeth it,
and uſe no Art to qualify the diſadvantages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
Or ſhall a man forgo the benefit of a place
of advantage, rather then he will relieve with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
the diſcommodity of ſome particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance?
I make no queſtion but an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Commander, being in ſeaſonable time lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with convenient forces upon any of thoſe
places, yea upon the beach it ſelf, which is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
to make defenſible as any place whatſoever,
would uſe ſuch induſtry as might give ſufficient
ſecurity to his forces, and over-weigh the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with advantage of place; eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that this age hath afforded ſuch plentifull
examples of admirable inventions in that behalf.
But this cannot be done, if our forces do not
make head before the inſtant of the Enemies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
that our Commanders may have ſome
time to make ready ſtore of Gabio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s, and hand-baskets,
with ſuch moveable matter as ſhall be
thought fit for that ſervice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="96" facs="tcp:51174:83"/>
Neither let this trouble any man; for I dare
avouch it, that if our forces are not drawn into
a head before the Enemy be diſcovered upon the
Coaſt, although we never mean to oppoſe their
landing, but attend them in ſome in-land place
to give them battel, our Commanders will be far
to ſeek of many important circumſtances, which
are requiſite in a matter of that conſequence.
And therefore let us have but a reaſonable time
to bethink our ſelves of theſe neceſſaries, and
we will eaſily overcome all theſe difficulties, and
uſe the benefit of the firm land to repell an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
weakned with the Sea, toſſed with the billow,
troubled with his weapons, with many other
hinderances and diſcouragements, which are
preſented unto him both from the Land and the
Sea. He that ſaw the landing of our forces in the
Iſland of <hi>Fiall</hi> in the year ninety ſeven, can
ſomewhat judge of the difficulty of that matter:
for what with the working of the Sea, the ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Cliffs, and the troubleſomneſſe of
their Armes, the ſouldiers were ſo incumbred,
that had not the Enemy been more then a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
he might well with two hundred men have
kept us from entering any part of that Iſland.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the third Objection,<note place="margin">The anſwer to the third reaſon.</note> this briefly
ſhall be ſufficient, that we are not ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that our forces do equall them in number,
as to ſee that they be ſufficient for the nature of
the place, to make it good againſt the Enemies
landing: for we know that in places of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and difficult acceſſe, a ſmall number is able
to oppoſe a great; and we doubt not but, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
duly conſidered, we ſhall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
equall the Enemy both in number and
quality of their forces: alwayes preſuppoſed,
that our State ſhall never be deſtitute of ſufficient
forces trained and exerciſed in a competent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to defend their Country from forreign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
For the neglect thereof were to draw
on ſuch as of themſelves are but too forward to
make a prey of us, and to make us unapt not
only to oppoſe an Enemies landing, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our ſelves from being overrun, as other

Now if we do but look a little into the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
which follow upon the landing of an
Enemy, we ſhall eaſily diſcover the dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this opinion: as firſt, we give him leave
to live upon the ſpoil of our Country; which
cannot be prevented by any waſting, ſpoiling,
or retiring of our proviſions, in ſo plentifull a
Country as this is, eſpecially conſidering that we
have no ſtrong towns at all to repoſe our ſelves
upon. Whereof we need no further teſtimony
then is delivered unto us out of the ſeventh book
of theſe Commentaries, in that war which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>

                        <p>Secondly obedience, which at other time is
willingly given to Princes, is greatly weakned
at ſuch times; whereby all neceſſary means to
maintain a war is hardly drawn from the ſubject.
Thirdly, opportunity is given to malecontents
and ill-diſpoſed perſons either to make head
themſelves, or to fly to the Enemy. Fourthly,
'tis madneſſe to adventure a kingdome upon one

as ignorant of it, and ſo deſiring to be

notwithstanding at his coming they made
war againſt him without any cauſe or reaſon

commanded hoſtages to be delivered unto him:

ſhould likewiſe be rendered within a ſhort
time. In the mean while they commanded their
people to return to their poſſeſſions, and their
Rulers and Princes came out of all quarters
to commend themſelves and their States to
<hi>Caeſar.</hi> The peace being thus concluded, four
dayes after that <hi>Caeſar</hi> came into <hi>Britany,</hi> the
eighteen ſhips which were appointed for the
horſemen, put out to ſea with a gentle wind:
and approching ſo near the coaſt of <hi>Britany,</hi>
that they were within view of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Camp, there aroſe ſuch a ſudden tempeſt, that
none of them were able to hold their courſe;
but ſome of them returned to the port from
whence they came, other ſome were caſt upon
the lower part of the Iſland, which lieth to the
Weſt-ward, and there caſting anchour took in
ſo much water, that they were forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves again to the ſea, and direct
their courſe to the coaſt of <hi>Gallia.</hi> The ſame
night it happened that the moon being in the
full, the tides were very high in thoſe ſeas;
whereof the <hi>Romans</hi> being altogether ignorant,
both the Gallies that tranſported the army
which were drawn up upon the ſhore were filled
with the tide, and the ſhips of burthen that lay
at anchour were ſhaken with the tempeſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there any help to be given unto them;
ſo that many of them were rent and ſplit in
pieces, and the reſt loſt both their anchours, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and other tackling, and by that means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
altogether unſerviceable. Where at the
whole Army was exceedingly troubled; for
there was no other ſhipping to recarry them
back again, neither had they any neceſſaries to
new furniſh the old; and every man knew that
they muſt needs winter in <hi>Gallia,</hi> foraſmuch
as there was no proviſion of corning thoſe places
where they were. Which thing being known to
the Princes of <hi>Britany,</hi> that were aſſembled to
conferre of ſuch things as <hi>Caeſar</hi> had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to perform, when they underſtood
that the <hi>Romans</hi> wanted both their horſemen,

they thought it their beſt courſe to rebell, and

ſo capable of celeſtiall power as the Ocean it ſelf;
it conſequently followeth that the <hi>Tuscan</hi> ſeas,
wherewith the <hi>Romans</hi> were chiefly acquainted,
were not ſo anſwerable in effect to the operation
of the moon as the main ſea, whoſe bounds are
ranged in a more ſpacious circuit, and through
the plentious abundance of his parts, better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth
the vertue of the Moon. The Ocean
therefore being thus obedient to the courſe of the
celeſtiall bodies, taking her courſe of ſlowing
from the North, falleth with ſuch a current be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Orcades</hi> and the main of <hi>Norvegia,</hi>
that ſhe filleth our channel between <hi>England</hi>

it happeneth that our river of <hi>Thames,</hi> lying with

and having withall a plain levelled belly,
and a very ſmall freſh current, taketh the tide as

up hoſtages, provided againſt

of ſuch Ships as were moſt diſmembred, and
with the timber and braſſe thereof he mended
the rest that were beaten with the tempest,
cauſing other neceſſaries to be brought out of
<hi>Gallia.</hi> Which being handled with the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
and travell of the Souldiers, he loſt only
twelve ſhips, and made the other able to abide
the Sea.</p>
                     <p>While theſe things were in action, the ſeventh
legion being ſent out by courſe to fetch in corn,
and little ſuſpecting any motion of war, as part
of the ſouldiers continued in the field, and the
reſt went &amp; came between them and the Camp,
the ſtation that watched before the gate of the
Camp gave advertiſement to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that the
ſame way which the legion went there appeared
a greater dust then was uſually ſeen. <hi>Caeſar</hi>
ſuſpecting that which indeed was true, that the
<hi>Britans</hi> were entred into ſome new reſolution,
he took thoſe two cohorts which were in ſtation
before the port, commanding other two to take
their place, and the reſt to arm themſelves, and
preſently to follow him; and went that way
where the duſt was deſcried. And when he had
marched ſome diſtance from the Camp, he ſaw
his men overcharged with the Enemy, and
ſcarce able to ſuſtain the aſſault, the legion
thronged together on a heap, and weapons cast
from all parts amongſt them. For when they
had harveſted all other quarters, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
one piece of corn, whither the Enemy
ſuſpected the <hi>Romans</hi> would at laſt come, and in
the night time conveighed themſelves ſecretly
into the woods, where they continued untill the
<hi>Romans</hi> were come into the field: and as they
ſaw them diſarmed, diſperſed, and occupied in
reaping, they ſuddenly ſet upon them, and
ſlaying ſome few of them, routed the reſt, and
incompaſſed them about with their horſemen
and Chariots. Their manner of fight with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
was, firſt to ride up and down, and caſt
their weapons as they ſaw advantage; and
with the terrour of their horſes and ratling of
their wheels to diſorder the companies; and
when they had wound themſelves between any
troups of horſe, they forſook their Chariots, and
fought on foot: in the mean time the guiders of
their chariots would drive a little aſide, and ſo
place themſelves, that if their maſters needed
any help, they might have an eaſy paſſage unto
them. And thus they performed in all their
fights both the nimble motion of horſemen, and
the firm ſtability of footmen; &amp; were ſo ready
with daily practice, that they could ſtay in the
declivity of a ſteep hill, &amp; turn ſhort or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
their going as it ſeemed beſt unto them, and
run along the beam of the coach &amp; reſt upon the
yoak, or harneſſe of their horſes, &amp; return as
ſpeedily again at their pleaſure. The <hi>Romans</hi>
being thus troubled, <hi>Caeſar</hi> came to reſcue them
in very good time: for at his coming the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
ſtood ſtill, &amp; the ſouldiers gathered their
ſpirits unto them, &amp; began to renew their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
that was almoſt ſpent. <hi>Caeſar</hi> taking it an
unfit time either to provoke the Enemy or to
give him battel, continued a while in the ſame

thought it beſt to expect ſome other opportunity.
And again, to avoid the inconveniences of a
fearfull retreat, he continued a while in the ſame
place, to imbolden his men with the ſight of
the Enemy. And this manner of proceeding
wrought a full perſwaſion in his ſouldiers that
his actions were directed with knowledge, and
with a carefull reſpect of their ſafety: which
gave his men reſolution when they were carried

they might with reaſon have drawn
back from ſuch imployments, and valued their

forces, and amplifying the greatneſſe of
the booty, and the eaſy means offered unto them
of perpetuall liberty, if they could take the
<hi>Roman</hi> Camp. Shortly upon this, having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
a great company both of horſe &amp; foot, they
came to the place where the <hi>Romans</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> (although he foreſaw the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
by that which before had hapned, that if
the Enemy were beaten back, he would avoid
the danger by flight) yet having ſome thirty
horſe, which <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras</hi> had carried with
him at his coming into <hi>Britany,</hi> he imbattel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his legions before his Camp, and ſo gave
them battel. The Enemy not being able to bear
the aſſault of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers, turned
their backs and fled: the <hi>Romans</hi> followed
them as far as they could by running on foot,
and after a great ſlaughter, with the burning
of their towns far and near, they returned to
their Camp. The ſame day the <hi>Britans</hi> ſent
meſſengers to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to intreat for peace; whom
he commanded to double their number of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages,
which he commanded to be carried into
<hi>Gallia.</hi> And foraſmuch as the <hi>Aequinoctium</hi>
was at hand, he thought it not ſafe to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the ſea in winter with ſuch weak ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
and therefore having got a convenient
time he hoiſed ſail a little after midnight, and
brought all his ſhips ſafe unto the Continent.
Two of theſe ſhips of burthen, not being able to
reach the ſame haven, put in ſomewhat lower
into the land: the ſouldiers that were in them
which were about three hundred being ſet on
ſhore, and marching towards their Camp, the
<hi>Morini,</hi> with whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> at his going into <hi>Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
had made peace, in hope of a booty, firſt with
a few of their men stood about them, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them upon pain of death to lay down their
weapons: and as the <hi>Romans</hi> by caſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into an Orbe began to make defence, at
the noiſe and clamour amongſt them there were
ſuddenly gathered together about ſix thouſand
of the Enemy. Which thing being known, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
ſent out all the horſemen to relieve them. In
the meantime the <hi>Romans</hi> ſuſtained the force of
the Enemy, and fought valiantly about the
ſpace of four hours; and receiving themſelves
only ſome few wounds, they ſlew many of the
Enemy. As ſoon as the <hi>Roman</hi> horſemen came
in ſight, the Enemy caſt away their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51174:85"/>
and fled, and a great number of them fell
by the horſemen.</p>

                        <p>OF all the figures which the <hi>Tactici</hi> have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to make uſe of in military affairs, the
circle hath ever been taken for the fitteſt to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in the defenſive part, as incloſing with an
equall circuit on all parts whatſoever is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within the circumference of that <hi>Area:</hi> and
therefore Geometry termeth a circumference a
ſimple line, foraſmuch as if you alter the ſite of
the parts, and tranſport one arch into the place
of another, the figure notwithſtanding will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the ſame, becauſe of the equall bending of
the line throughout the whole circumference.
Which property as it proveth an uniformity of
ſtrength in the whole circuit, ſo that it cannot be
ſaid that this is the beginning or this is the end,
this is front or this is flank: ſo doth that which
<hi>Euclide</hi> doth demonſtrate in the third of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,
concerning the ſmall affinity between
a right line and a circle (which being drawn to
touch the circumference, doth touch it but in a
point only) ſhew the greatneſſe of this ſtrength
in regard of any other line, by which it may be
broken. Which howſoever they ſeem as ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
qualities, conceived rather by intellectuall
diſcourſe then manifeſted to ſenſible apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet foraſmuch as experience hath proved
the ſtrength of this figure in a defenſive part, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
any other manner of imbattelling, let us
not neglect the knowledge of theſe naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
which diſcover the cauſes of this effect:
neither let us neglect this part of military know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
being ſo ſtrong a means to maintain va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and the ſinew of all our ability: for order
correſpondent to circumſtances is the whole
ſtrength and power of an Army. Neither ought
there any action in a wel-ordered diſcipline to
be irregular, or void of order. And therefore the
<hi>Romans</hi> did neither eat nor ſleep without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Conſul, or chief Commander; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
their valour might rather have been ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
fury then vertue: but when their courage
was ranged with order, and diſpoſed according
to the occurrences of the time, it never failed as
long as the ſaid order continued perfect.</p>
                        <p>It appeareth therefore how important it is for a
Commander to look into the diverſity of orders
for imbattelling, and to weigh the nature thereof,
that he may with knowledge apply them to the
quality of any occaſion. The <hi>Romans</hi> termed
this figure <hi>Orbis,</hi> which ſignifieth a round body
both with a concave and a convex ſurface: in
reſemblance whereof I underſtand this Orbe of
men imbattelled to be ſo named; which might
peradventure conſiſt of five, or more, or fewer
ranks, incloſing one another after the nature of
ſo many circles deſcribed about one Centre; ſo
that either the midſt thereof remained void, or
otherwiſe contained ſuch carriages and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
as they had with them in their march.
This form of imbattelling was never uſed but in
great extremity: for as it was the ſafeſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo it gave ſuſpicion to the ſouldiers of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
danger, which abated much of their heat
in battel; as will hereafter appear by the teſtimony
of <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf in the fifth Commentary, upon
the occaſion which happened unto <hi>Sabinus</hi> and
<hi>Cotta.</hi>

came to hear of. When he ſaw he must go with
the rest, first he beſought with all the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
he could that he might stay in <hi>Gallia;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging
one while that he was afraid of the
ſea, having as yet never been uſed to ſailing,
another while that he had ſome religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51174:86"/>
that kept him here. When he perceived
this would not ſerve his turn, but go he muſt,
he began to deal with the rest of the chief men
of the <hi>Galles,</hi> taking them man by man, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
them to continue in their own country;
telling them that it was not without ground
<hi>Caeſar</hi> went about to deſpoile <hi>Gallia</hi> thus of its
nobility, his drift being to carry them over into
<hi>Britain</hi> and there murther them, whom he was
affraid to put to death amongst their friends
at home. He went farther, to ingage them to
fidelity, and to tye them by oath to proceed upon
joynt conſultation to the acting of what ſhould
be thought of moſt concernment and behoof for
the good of <hi>Gallia.</hi> Theſe things were by divers
perſons related to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> who as ſoon as he knew
thereof, in regard of the great reſpect he bare
to the <hi>Heduan</hi> State, he reſolved by all meanes
poſſible to curb and deter <hi>Dumnorix</hi> from thoſe
courſes: &amp; in regard that he ſaw him thus to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
in his madneſſe, he thought it ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to prevent his endamaging either the
Commonwealth or himſelf. So staying in the
place where he was about twenty five dayes, the
North-west wind (a wind that uſually blowes
in thoſe parts) all that while hindering his
putting to ſea; he made it much of his buſineſs
to keep <hi>Dumnorix</hi> quiet, and yet at the ſame
time to ſpye out the whole drift of his deſigns.
At last the wind and weather ſerving, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his ſouldiers and horſemen on ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.
And whilst every mans mind was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up about this, <hi>Dumnorix</hi> with the rest of the
<hi>Heduan</hi> horſemen, unknown to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> had
left the camp, and were marching homewards.
Which when <hi>Caeſar</hi> heard, he stopt his voyage,
and letting every thing elſe alone, ſent a great
part of his cavalry to attach him, and bring
him back, with command that if he stood upon
his defenſe and did not readily obey, they ſhould
diſpatch him. For he could not believe that
this man could mean any good to him if
he once got home, ſince he made ſo light of his
commands when preſent with him. The horſe
having overtaken him, he stood upon his guard
and made reſistance, imploring alſo the aide
of thoſe that were with him; still crying out,
that he was a Free-born man and of a Free ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Whereupon they, as they were commanded,
hemm'd him in, and ſo killed him: the <hi>Heduan</hi>
horſemen returning every man to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>

                        <p>IN the deſcriptions of the ancient <hi>Britans</hi> we
may firſt obſerve their pedegree, according to
the Heraldry of that time: wherein we muſt
underſtand, that in thoſe ages the Nations of the
world thought it no ſmall honour to derive their
deſcent from a certain beginning, and to make
either ſome of their Gods, or ſome man of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
memory the Father of that progeny, and
founder of their State; that ſo they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
a fortunate continuance to their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being firſt laid and eſtabliſhed by ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
a means. But if this failed, they then brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of antiquity, and caſt all their glory upon
the fertility of their ſoil, being ſo ſtrong and
fruitfull that it yielded of it ſelf ſuch a people as
they were. And ſo we read how the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
foraſmuch as they were ignorant from whence
they came, ware an Oaken leaf, in token that
they were bred of the earth where they dwelled.
And hereupon alſo grew the controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the <hi>Scythians</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
antiquity: wherein the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſeemed
to have great advantage, becauſe of the fertility
and heat of of their country; whereas the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
inhabited a cold climate, unfruitfull, and an
enemy to generation. Of this ſort were the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
that inhabited the mediterranean part of the
Iſland: who not knowing from whence they
came, nor who firſt brought them thither, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
themſelves with that common received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they were born and bred of the earth.
The ſea-coaſt was poſſeſt by ſuch as came out of

Cities from whence they came, as a memoriall of
their progenitours.</p>
                        <p>The form of the Iſland is very well deſcribed,
and meaſured out according to the ſcale of our
modern Geographers. For concerning the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of longitude between the Eaſtern angle
of <hi>Kent,</hi> and the furtheſt point of <hi>Cornewall,</hi>
they make it eight degrees; which in a manner
jumpeth with <hi>Caeſars</hi> dimenſuration. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſides are ſomewhat longer: and therefore
<hi>Tacitus</hi> in the life of <hi>Agricola,</hi> compareth it to
a Carpenters Axe, making that ſide which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
upon <hi>France</hi> to reſemble the edge, and
the other two ſides to incline by little and little
one towards another, and ſo make the Iſland
narrower at the top, according to the form of
that inſtrument. He ſetteth down the whole
compaſſe of the Iſland, according to the manner
of the ancient Geographers; who by the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the circuit did uſually judge of the content:
not conſidering that the <hi>Area</hi> of every figure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
as well on the quantity of the angle, as
the length of the ſide.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the temperature of <hi>Britany</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the cold Winters in <hi>France,</hi> we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that <hi>Britany</hi> hath ever been found of a
more temperate conſtitution in regard of ſharp
and cold winters, then any other country lying
under the ſame parallel: Whether the cauſe
thereof may be imputed to the continual motion of
the ſea about the Iſland, which begetteth heat, as
ſome have imagined; or to the ſite thereof in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of other Continents from whence the wind
alwayes riſeth, &amp; carrieth with it the nature of the
Country by which it paſſeth; (&amp; ſo the Iſland ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other Continent lying North to it, from
whence the wind may riſe, but all for the moſt part
upon the South, hath no ſuch cold winds to diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
it, as other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> which are under
the ſame parallel: but the Southern wind, which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51174:88"/>
is ſo frequent in <hi>Britany,</hi> tempereth the air with a
mild diſpoſition, and ſo keepeth it warm; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it beſome other unknown cauſe, our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
reſt unſatisfied. But as touching <hi>Gallia</hi> it
may be ſaid, that foraſmuch as it beareth more to
the South then this Iland doth, the aire thereof (by
reaſon of the continual heat) is of a far purer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
and ſo pierceth more then this groſſer
aire of <hi>Britany,</hi> and carrieth the cold further
into the pores; and ſo ſeemeth ſharper, and of
a far colder diſpoſition.</p>
                        <p>This Iland which <hi>Caeſar</hi> nameth <hi>Mona,</hi> is
known at this time by the name of <hi>Man,</hi> and
lieth between <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Ireland. Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>

the land of <hi>Mon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning thoſe places where the night
continueth in the midſt of winter for thirty daies
together, they muſt be ſited 6. degrees beyond
the circle <hi>Artick,</hi> and have a day in ſummer of
like continuance, according to the rules of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy.
In that he found the nights in <hi>Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
ſhorter then in the Continent, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it to be onely in ſummer: for the more
oblique the horizon is, the more uneven are the
portions of the diurnall circles which it cutteth;
and the nearer it cometh to a right horizon, the
nearer it cometh to an equality of day and
night: and hence it happeneth, that in ſummer
time, the nights in <hi>France</hi> are longer then here
in <hi>England;</hi> and in winter, ſhorter. The like
we muſt underſtand of all Southern and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Countries.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, I may not omit the civility of the
<hi>Kentiſh</hi> men, and their courteous diſpoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reſt of the <hi>Britans,</hi> which muſt be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

little thought of them, and were buſied in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
their Camp, came ſuddainly out of the

Theſe two cohorts ſtanding with a ſmall

charged being terrified with that ſtrange kind

happened in the view of all the Camp, it was
plainly perceived that the legionary ſouldiers,
being neither able for the weight of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to follow the enemy as he retired, nor yet
daring to go far from their ſeverall Enſigns,
was not a fit adverſary to conteſt this kind of
enemy: and that the horſemen likewiſe fought
with no leſſe danger, inaſmuch as the enemy
would retire back of purpoſe, and when they
had drawn them a little from the legions, they
would then light from their chariots, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
them with that advantage which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a footman and a horſeman. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
they never fought thick and cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                        <p>UPon this occaſion of their heavy Armour, I
will deſcribe a Legionary ſouldier in his
compleat furniture, that we may better judge of
their manner of warfare, and underſtand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their greateſt ſtrength conſiſted. And firſt we
are to learn, that their legionary ſouldiers were
called <hi>milites gravis armaturae,</hi> ſouldiers wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
heavy Armour, to diſtinguiſh them from
the Velites, the Archers, Slingers, and other light-armed
men. Their offenſive Armes were a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Piles, or as ſome will but one Pile, and a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51174:88"/>
                           <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſword, ſhort and ſtrong, to ſtrike ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the point then with the edge. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
Armes were a helmet, a corſlet, and boots
of braſſe, with a large Target; which in ſome ſort
was offenſive, in regard of that <hi>umbo</hi> which
ſtuck out in the midſt thereof. The Pile is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
at large in the firſt book, and the Target in
the ſecond. The ſword, as <hi>Polybius</hi> witneſſeth,
was ſhort, two-edged, very ſharp, and of a
ſtrong point. And therefore <hi>Livy</hi> in his 22.
book ſaith, that the <hi>Galles</hi> uſed very long ſwords
without points; but the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſhort
ſwords, readier for uſe. Theſe they called <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
ſwords, becauſe they borrowed that faſhion
from the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The old <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo
girt with their ſwords, as appeareth by <hi>Polybius,</hi>
and their monuments in Marble, that from their
left ſhoulder it hung upon their right thigh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the uſe of theſe times; which, as I have
noted before, was in regard of their target, which
they carried on their left arme. This ſword was
hung with a belt of leather, beſet with ſtuds, as
<hi>Varro</hi> noteth.<note place="margin">Lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> And theſe were their offenſive
weapons.</p>
                        <p>Their Helmet was of braſſe,<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 10</note> adorned with
three Oſtrich feathers of a cubit in length; by
which the ſouldier appeared of a larger ſtature,
and more terrible to the Enemy, as <hi>Polybius</hi>
ſaith in his ſixth book. Their breaſt-plate was
either of Braſſe or Iron, jointed together after
the manner of ſcales, or platted with little rings
of Iron: their boots were made of bars of braſs,
from the foot up to the knee. And thus were the
legionary ſouldiers armed, to ſtand firme, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to uſe any nimble motion, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
themſelves into a body of that ſtrength,
which might not eaſily recoile at the oppoſition
of any confrontment: for agility ſtandeth indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to help either a retreat or a purſuit; and
nimble-footed ſouldiers are as ready to flie back,
as to march forward; but a weighty body keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a more regular motion, and is not hindered
with a common counterbuffe. So that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they came to firme buckling, and felt the
enemy ſtand ſtiff before them, ſuch was their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
and exerciſe in continuall works, that they
never fainted under any ſuch task, but the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
went alwaies clear on their ſide. But if the
enemy gave way to their violence, and came not
in but for advantage, and then as ſpeedily
retired before the counterbuffe were well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
then did their nimbleneſs much help
their weakneſs, and fruſtrate the greateſt part
of the <hi>Roman</hi> diſcipline. This is alſo proved in
the overthrow of <hi>Sabinus</hi> and <hi>Cotta,</hi> where <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biorix</hi>
finding the inconvenience of buckling
at handy-blowes, commanded his men to fight
a far off; and if they were aſſaulted, to give
back, and come on again as they ſaw occaſion:
which ſo wearied out the <hi>Romans</hi> that they all fel
under the execution of the <hi>Galles.</hi> Let this ſuffice
therefore to ſhew how unapt the <hi>Romans</hi> were to
flie upon any occaſion, when their Armour
was ſuch that it kept them from all ſtarting moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and made them ſutable to the ſtaied and well
aſſured rules of their diſcipline, which were as
certain principles in the execution of a ſtanding
battell; and therefore not ſo fit either for a
purſuit, or a flight.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the unequal combat between a
horſeman and a footman, it may be thought
ſtrange that a footman ſhould have ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
againſt a horſeman, being overmatched
at leaſt with a Sextuple proportion both of
ſtrength and agility: but we muſt underſtand
that as the horſe is much ſwifter in a long cariere,
ſo in ſpeedy and nimble turning at hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſubſtance of the combate conſiſteth, the
footman far exceedeth the horſeman in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
having a larger mark to hit by the Horſe,
then the other hath. Beſides the horſeman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth
both his valour and his fortune in the
good ſpeed of his horſe, his wounds and his
death do conſequently pull the rider after, his
fear or fury maketh his maſter either deſperate or
ſlow of performance, and what defect ſoever ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
from the horſe, muſt be anſwered out of the
honour of the rider. And ſurely it ſeemeth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
that what thing ſoever draweth us into
the ſociety of ſo great a hazard, ſhould as much
as is poſſible be contained in the compaſſe of our
own power.</p>
                        <p>The ſword which we manage with our owne
hand affordeth greater aſſurance then the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſe,
wherein there are many parts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the action, as the powder, the ſtone, the
ſpring, and ſuch like; whereof if the leaſt fail of
his part, we likewiſe faile of our fortune. But
how probable ſoever this ſeemeth, this is certain,
that in the courſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> wars the horſe
were ever defeated by the foot, as is manifeſtly
proved in the firſt of theſe books.</p>

to get forrage, under the conduction of
<hi>Caius Trebonius</hi> a Legate, they made a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain

                        <p>THis attempt of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſeemeth ſo ſtrange to
<hi>Brancatio,</hi> that he runneth into ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
concerning this matter: as firſt, that he
that imitateth <hi>Caeſar</hi> may doubt of his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
for his proceeding in this point was not
directed by any order of war: and that a great
Commander hath nothing common with other
Leaders: but eſpecially he crieth out at the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the <hi>Britans,</hi> that would ſuffer themſelves
ſo cowardly to be beaten. But if we look into the
circumſtances of the action, we ſhall find both
Art and good direction therein: for being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
by the fugitives that the river was paſſable
in that place, and in that place only, he knew
that he muſt either adventure over there, or leave
<hi>Caſſivellaunus</hi> for another Summer, which was
a very ſtrong inducement to urge him to that
enterpriſe. The difficulty whereof was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by good direction, which conſiſted
of two points; Firſt, by ſending over the
horſemen in the front of the legions, who
might better endure the charge of the enemy
then the footmen could, that were up to the neck
in water; and withall to ſhelter the footmen
from the fury of the Enemy.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he ſent them over with ſuch ſpeed,
that they were on the other ſide of the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the enemy could tell what they attempted:
for if he had lingered in the ſervice, and given
the enemy leave to find the advantage which he
had by experience, his men had never been able
to have endured the hazard of ſo dangerous a
ſervice. It is hard to conjecture at the place
where this ſervice was performed; for ſince the
building of <hi>London</hi> bridge, many foords have
been ſcoured with the current and fall of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which before that time carried not ſuch a
depth as now they do.</p>

he underſtood that <hi>Caſſivellaunus</hi> his town was
not far off, fortified with woods &amp; bogs, &amp; well
stored with men &amp; cattell. The <hi>Britans</hi> call a
town, a thick wood incloſed about with a ditch
and a rampier, made for a place of retreat,
when they ſtood in fear of incurſions from the

himſelf out of the town by a back way: and ſo
he took it. Where he found great ſtore of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,

concurring with the former loſſes, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of <hi>Caeſar</hi> by <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras. Caeſar</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to winter in the Continent, for fear of
ſuddain commotions in <hi>Gallia,</hi> and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the Summer was now far ſpent, and
might eaſily be lingred out, he commanded pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to be brought unto him, and ſet down what
yearly tribute the <hi>Britans</hi> ſhould pay to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>

ſoon as he had cauſed to be ſet aflote, in regard
partly of the great number of priſoners he had,
and that ſome of his ſhips were caſt away, he
determined to carry his Army over at twice.
And ſo it happened, that of ſo great a fleet,
at ſo many voyages, neither this year nor the

he ſhould take hold of them, and ſend them to

                        <head>THE FIRST OBSERVATION.</head>
                        <p>I Have heard it oftentimes contradicted by
ſome that underſtand not the weight of a
multitude, when it was ſaid, that an Army kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
head continually in one part of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
was more burthenſome to the Common-wealth
in regard of the expence of victuals, then
when it was diſperſed into particular Cities and
Families, before the time of the maſter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollment:
for, ſay they, in the general account of
the publick weale it differeth nothing, whether a
multitude of 30000. men be maintained with
neceſſary proviſions in one intire body together,
or diſperſed particularly throughout every part
of the Countrey; foraſmuch as every man hath
but a competent quantity allotted unto him,
which he cannot want in what ſort or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of life ſoever he be ranged: neither doth the
charge of a multitude grow in regard they are
united together, but in regard they amount to
ſuch a multitude whereſoever. But ſuch as look
into the difference with judgement, ſhall find a
marvellous inequality, both in regard of the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of victualls which is ſpent, and the means
whereby it is provided: for firſt we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that an Army lying continually in
one place, falleth ſo heavy upon that part that it
quickly conſumeth both the fat and the fleſh, (as
they ſay) and leaveth nothing unſpent, which
that part can afford them; and without further
ſupply of proviſions would in a ſmall time come
to utter deſtruction. This want then muſt be
relieved by taking from the plenty of other bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
quarters, to furniſh the wants of ſo great
a multitude: wherein there cannot be obſerved
that proportion of moderate taking, to victuall
the Army with a ſufficient competency, but the
partiall reſpect which the purveiours and victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers
will have to their private commodity, will
quickly make an inconvenience either in the
countrey from whence it is taken, or in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for which it is provided, according as the
errour may beſt advantage their particular, what
diſcipline ſoever be eſtabliſhed in that behalf.
Whereas on the contrary part, when every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
man of that multitude ſhall be billetted in
a ſeverall family, throughout all parts of the
kingdome, the charge will be ſo inſenſible in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the expence of the ſaid families, that the
country will never feel any inconvenience. And
if every houſholder that had received into his
houſe one of the ſaid Army, ſhould give a true
account of that which riſeth above his ordinary
expence by the addition of one man, it would
fall far ſhort of that treaſure which is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
required to maintain the ſaid number of men
united together into one body.</p>
                        <p>Neither doth the difference conſiſt in the
quantity of victualls which every man hath for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51174:90"/>
his portion, whether they be diſperſed or united;
but in the manner of proviſion, and the means
which is uſed to maintain them: wherein every
maſter or ſteward of a family endeavoureth to
make his proviſions at the beſt hand, and ſo to
husband it that it may ſerve for competency, and
not for ſuperfluity; and by that means the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
plenty of the countrey is maintained, and
the common-wealth flouriſheth by well-direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
moderation. But in the victualling of an
Army there is no ſuch reſpect had which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way advantage the publick good; for there the
gain of the purveiour riſeth by expence and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
waſting, rather then by thrift and
ſaving frugality: and ſo the common-wealth is
weakened by the ill-husbanding of that great
portion of victuall which is allowed for ſo great
a multitude. And if they ſhould have ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of viands in an Army as they have when
they are in ſeverall families, it were unpoſſible
it ſhould continue any time together. And
therefore the <hi>Romans,</hi> notwithſtanding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe
of their diſcipline, could afford their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
no other proviſion but corn and larde, as
well in regard of the commodity which that
kind of diet afforded them in the courſe of their
wars, as alſo for the good of that country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were reſident. And if it ſo fell out, that
the extremity of the ſeaſon, or any other cauſe
had brought a dearth into the land, there was
no readier way to help that inconvenience, then
by diſperſing their Armies into divers quarters;
which <hi>Caeſar</hi> diſpoſed with that care, that they
might be as near together as they could.</p>

and had overmatched them in a skirmiſh
of horſe, which made a ſally out of the camp
upon the <hi>Galles; Ambiorix</hi> deſpairing of good

and then after their manner they cryed unto
us, that ſome of our company ſhould come and
ſpeak with them, for they had ſomewhat to
diſcover touching the publick state, whereby
they hoped all controverſies might be ended.
Whereupon <hi>Caius Carpineius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

and one <hi>Q. Junius</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who divers times

were ſent out to treat with them. <hi>Ambiorix</hi>
first acknowledged himſelf much indebted to
<hi>Caeſar</hi> for many courteſies; in that by his means
he was freed from a penſion which he payed to
the <hi>Aduatici;</hi> and for that both his own ſon and
his brothers ſon, whom the <hi>Aduatici</hi> had held
in priſon under the name of hostages, were by
<hi>Caeſar</hi> releaſed and ſent home again. And
touching the aſſault of the camp, he had done
nothing of himſelf, but by the impulſion of the
State; among whom ſuch was his condition,
that the people had as great authority over
him, as he himſelf had in regard of the people:
who were likewiſe inforced to this war, becauſe
they could not withstand the ſudden inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Galles,</hi> whereof his ſmal means might

was not ſo little, to think himſelf able with ſo

but it was a generall appointment throughout

was, that they had valiantly withſtood the

them to ſeek a remedy, when a greater power
of the Enemy, accompanied with the <hi>Germans,</hi>
were aſſembled againſt them; or when any blow
were given to any of the next wintering-camps.
He took <hi>Caeſar</hi> to be gone into <hi>Italy;</hi> for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

the <hi>Rhene</hi> was not far off, and he knew well

ſhould enterpriſe ſuch a matter without
any ground or certainty therof? but howſoever
things ſtood, his counſell was ſure and could
bring no harm: for if there were no worſe thing
intended, they ſhould but go ſafely to the next
garriſons; or otherwiſe, if the <hi>Galles</hi> conſpired
with the <hi>Germans,</hi> their onely ſafety conſiſted
in celerity. As for the counſell of <hi>Cotta</hi> and
ſuch as were of the contrary opinion, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
could be had thereof? wherein if
here were not preſent danger, yet aſſuredly
famine was to be feared by long ſiege. The
diſputation being thus continued on either
part, and <hi>Cotta</hi> with the Centurions of the firſt
orders earneſtly repugning it; Do as pleaſe
you, ſince you wil needs have it ſo, ſaith <hi>Sabinus,</hi>
(and that he ſpake with a loud voice, that a
great part of the ſouldiers might well heare
him) for I am not he that most feareth

not periſh with famine and ſword, like a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

After theſe words they began to riſe out of the

entreaty was made that they would not by their

they went or ſtaied, ſo that they all agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one thing; whereas in diſagreeing there
was no liklihood of well doing. The diſputation
was prolonged untill midnight; at length
<hi>Cotta</hi> yielded, and the ſentence of <hi>Sabinus</hi>
took place. And thereupon it was proclaimed
that they ſhould ſet forth by the break of day.
The reſt of the night was ſpent in watching.
Every ſouldier ſought out what he had to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

how little a grave and wiſe deliberation
availeth, when it is impugned with the violence
of paſsion, according to the truth of my former
obſervation: for the matter was well reaſoned
by <hi>Cotta,</hi> and his poſitions were grounded upon
things certain, and well known to the whole

that it carried the concluſion by ſuch ſuppoſed
aſſertions as the quality of his paſsion had rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for true principles; being grounded altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon that which the Enemy had ſuggeſted,
and not upon any certain knowledge of the

diſputeth upon matters of ſuch conſequence,
that their deliberations are altogether clear from
ſuch troubleſome motions, but that it will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

carried unto the apprehenſion are diſpoſed into
formes and degrees, according as they either
concur or diſagree in their ſeverall properties;
from whence there ariſe intellectuall notions,
and rules of Art, wherein the ſcience of the ſaid

concerning ſuch particularities as are incident to

as it freely cenſureth the quality of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
circumſtances, it may give great light to
that which we ſeek after.</p>
                        <p>The modern example is taken out of <hi>Guicer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardin,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 9.</note>
from the wars which <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
King had with the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the State of <hi>Ferrara</hi> and the Dutchy of
<hi>Millain:</hi> wherein there aroſe a controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>French</hi> Captains, whether it were
better to go directly to ſeek the Enemy, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they were lodged in a ſtrong and ſecure
place, yet there was hope that with the vertue of
Arms and importunity of artillery they might be
diſlodged, and driven to retreat; or otherwiſe
to take the way either of <hi>Modena</hi> or <hi>Bolognia,</hi>
that ſo the Enemy for fear of loſing either of
thoſe towns might quit their hold, and by that
means <hi>Ferrara</hi> ſhould be freed from the war.
Monſieur <hi>Chaumont</hi> the General of the <hi>French</hi>
inclined to the former adviſe: But <hi>Trivulce,</hi> a
man of great authority and experience, having
been an executioner in 18. battells, reaſoned
thus in particulars to the contrary. We debate
(ſaith he) to go ſeek the Enemy to fight with
him; and I have alwayes heard great Captains
hold this as a firm principle, Not to attempt the
fortune of a battell, unleſs there be either an offer
of an eſpecial advantage, or otherwiſe compulſion
by neceſſity. The rules of war give it to the enemy
that is the invader, and hath undertaken the
conqueſt of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> to ſeek to aſſail and charge
us; but to us, to whom it is ſufficient to defend our
ſelves, it cannot be but impertinent to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
an action contrary to all direction and
diſcipline of war. I am of opinion, which is
confirmed by evident reaſon, that there is no
poſſibility to execute that deviſe but to our harms
and diſadvantage: for we cannot go to their
camp but by the ſide of a hill, a ſtreight and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way, where all our forces cannot be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and yet they with ſmall numbers will make
reſiſtance, having the opportunity of the place
favourable to their vertues. We muſt march by
the riſing of a hill, one horſe after another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have we any other way to draw our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
our baggage, our carts and bridges, but by
the ſtreight of the hill: and who doubteth not
but in a way ſo narrow and cumbrous, every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
every cart, or every wheel that ſhall
break will ſtay the Army a whole hour at
the leaſt? By which impediments every contrary
accident may put us to diſorder. The Enemy is
lodged in covert, provided of victuals and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
and we muſt incamp all bare and naked,
not carrying with us that which ſhould ſerve for
our neceſſary nouriture, but expect the things to
come after, which in reaſon ought to go with us.
To attempt new enterpriſes, whereof the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is leſſe certain then the perill, is contrary to
the gravity and reputation of a Leader; and in
actions of the war, thoſe enterpriſes are put to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
that are done by will and not by reaſon.
Many difficulties may compell us to make our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
there two or three dayes; yea the ſnows and
rains, joined with the extremity of the ſeaſon,
may ſuffice to detain us: how ſhall we then do
for victualls and forrages? What ſhall we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do in the wars, wanting the things that
ſhould give us ſtrength and ſuſtenance? what is
he that conſidereth not how dangerous it is to go
ſeek the Enemy in a ſtrong camp, and to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at one time to fight againſt them &amp; againſt
the diſcommodity of the place? If we compell
them not to abandon their camp, we cannot but
be inforced to retire; a matter of great difficulty in
a country ſo wholly againſt us, and where every
little disfavour will turn to our great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,

confeſſe that I have been <hi>Sejanus</hi> friend, and
that I deſired ſo to be, and that after I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

him joint-officer with my father in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

ſo he was graced by <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſuch as were not in his favour lived in fear,
and diſtreſſed with poverty. Neither do I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
any man for an example of this; all of us
who were not privy to his laſt attempts, with the
danger of my only eſtate I will defend: not <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus</hi>
the <hi>Vulſinienſis,</hi> but a part of the <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

entred into. Thy ſon in law, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the Conſulſhip, and him who took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him thy charge of adminiſtring the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
we did reverence and honour. It is not
our part to judge of him whom thou doſt exalt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reſt, nor for what conſiderations: to
thee the higheſt judgement of things the gods
have given, and to us the glory of obedience is
left. We look into thoſe things which we ſee
before our eyes, whom thou doſt inrich, whom
thou doſt advance to honours, who have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
power of hurting or helping; which <hi>Sejanus</hi>
to have had no man will deny. The Princes
hidden thoughts, or if he go about any ſecret
drift it is not lawfull to ſound, and dangerous;
neither ſhalt thou in the end reach unto them.
Think not only, Lords of the Senate, of <hi>Sejanus</hi>

likewiſe fawn upon and court <hi>Satrius</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius;</hi>
and to be known unto his freed men
and partners was reckoned for a high favour.
What then? ſhall this defence be generall, and
not diſtinguiſhed, but a confuſion made of times
paſt and his later actions? No: but let it by
juſt bounds and terms be divided: let the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

was not wanting in any thing that
concerned their common ſafety: for both in
calling upon the ſouldiers and incouraging
them, he executed the place of a Commander;
and in fighting, the duty of a ſouldier. And
when they found that, by reaſon of the length of

in every place; they cauſed it to be proclaimed,
that they ſhould all for ſake their baggage, and

although in ſuch a caſe it be not to be reproved,

the courage of the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp; gave the Enemy
greater incouragement, inaſmuch as it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that that courſe was not taken but upon a

it hapened, as it could not otherwiſe chuſe,
that the ſouldiers went from their Enſignes, to
take from the carriages ſuch things as were
moſt dear unto them: and there was nothing
heard amongst them but clamours and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
But the Barbarous <hi>Galles</hi> were not to
learn how to carry themſelves. For their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
cauſed it to be proclaimed, that no
man ſhould ſtir out of his place; for the prey
was theirs, and all that the <hi>Romans</hi> had laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

was eleven foot high, and the

had learned of the <hi>Romans,</hi> partly by being
converſant among them certain years before,
and partly by the priſoners and captives which
they had taken. But they had no iron tools fit
for that purpoſe, but were driven to cut up
turf with their ſwords, and gather earth with
their hands, and carry it away with their

towers to the height of the rampier, prepared
great hooks and ſtrong penthouſes, or ſafegards

of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers, that albeit they were

that the hindmoſt hindred the foremoſt from
retiring back. The flame at length abating,
and the enemies having brought on one of
their towers to the very works, the Centurions
of the third cohort drew back themſelves and
their men from the place where they ſtood, and
with ſigns and voices called to the enemies to
enter if they thought good: but none of them

                        <p>THis one example may ſerve to ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the <hi>Roman</hi> diſcipline, and the

they perceiving that the fortune of wars conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
chiefly in the maſtering of particular occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
trained their ſouldiers in that forme of
diſcipline as might ſtruggle with inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and ſtrong oppoſitions of contradicting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents;
and ſo overwage all difficulties and
hinderances with a conſtant perſeveration and
a courage invincible. For the great attempting
ſpirit of an ambitious Commander, that ſeeketh to
overtop the trophies of honour with the memory
of his exploits, will quickly periſh by his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
if the inſtruments of execution be weaker
then the means w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> lead him to his deſignments.
For where the weight is greater then the ſtrength,
the engine will ſooner break then lift it up. Let a
diſcreet Leader therefore ſo levell his thoughts,
that his reſolution may not exceed the ability of
his particular means: but firſt let him be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
what his ſouldiers can do, before he reſolve
what he will do: or otherwiſe let him ſo inable
them by diſcipline and inſtructions, according
to the example of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> that their
worth may anſwer the height of his deſires, and
follow his aſpiring mind with a reſolution
grounded upon knowledge and valour; and ſo
making their ability the ground of his deſigns, he
ſhall never faile of means to perform what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth.
The want of this conſideration hath

                        <p>A vertue rare and unknown in theſe dayes,
and would hardly find ſubjects to be reſident

is followed to the uttermoſt of our malice,

Which maketh me wonder, when I look into
the difference of theſe and thoſe ages, whether
it were the diſcipline of that time which brought
forth ſuch honeſt effects of vertue, to their glory
and our ignominy, having learned better rules
then were known unto them; or whether the
world weakened with age, want ſtrength in
theſe times to bring forth her creatures in that
perfection as it did in thoſe dayes; or what other
cauſe hath made our worſt affections ſo violent,
and our better faculties ſo remiſſe and negligent,
that vertue hath no part in us but words of praiſe,
our whole practice being conſecrated to actions
of reproach. The injuries, murthers, ſcandalous
carriages of one towards another, which in
theſe dayes are ſo readily offered and ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently

private combate; which in the firſt Monarchies
was granted only againſt ſtrangers &amp; forreign

ſhew the crookedneſſe of our diſpoſition, in
diſdaining to acknowledge that fault which we

when honour firſt came to be meaſureD with

which he ſent writ in <hi>Greek</hi> Characters, leaſt

that he was on the way with the legions, and
would be there inſtantly to raiſe the ſiege, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to perſevere in his wonted gallantry.
The <hi>Gall</hi> fearing ſome danger, followed the
directions, and cast it into the works by a Dart;
which fell by chance upon a turret, and there
ſtuck two dayes before it was perceived: the

which put them out of all doubt of the

                     <p>The <hi>Galles</hi> being advertiſed thereof by their

adviſing him to be wary and diligent in his

towards him. Which Letters being brought unto
<hi>Caeſar</hi> about midnight, he certified his party of
the contents thereof, and prepared them by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to fight. The next day as ſoon as it
began to be light he removed his Camp; &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
marched about four miles, he diſcovered
the multitude of the enemy beyond a great Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
and a River. It was a matter of exceeding
danger to give battell to ſo great a number in a
place of diſadvantage: and foraſmuch as
he knew that <hi>Cicero</hi> was freed of the ſiege, he
thought he might the better forbeare to make
ſuch haſte; and thereupon ſate down, and in
as indifferent a place as he could chuſe fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Camp. Which being of it ſelf very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
as not having ſcarce ſeven thouſand men,
and thoſe without any carriages; yet he leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it as much as he could by narrowing the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
streets ther of, to the end he might the
better defend it, if happily the enemy might be
drawn to ingage himſelf ſeriouſly in any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon the ſame. In the mean time having
ſent out Diſcoverers into all parts, he informed
himſelf which way he might moſt conveniently
paſſe over the valley.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day, after ſmall incounters of the
Cavalry at the water, either party contained
themſelves within their fortifications: the
<hi>Galles,</hi> as expecting greater forces, which
were not yet come; and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that by a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
fear he might draw the Enemy to the
place where he was lodged on this ſide the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
and ſo strike the battell before his Camp;
and if he could not bring it ſo about, then upon
diſcovery of the wayes, to paſſe the valley and
the river with leſſe danger. As it began to be
day-light the Cavalry of the enemy came near
unto the Camp, and began to skirmiſh with
our horſemen. <hi>Caeſar</hi> of ſet purpoſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the horſemen to fall back, and to betake

their camp on all ſides with a higher ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
to stop up the Gates; and in doing of theſe
things to carry themſelves tumultuouſly, and

(to make the matter more apparent) they
were imboldened to come nearer, and to caſt
weapons from all parts into our works: ſending
Heralds round about with Proclamation, That
if any <hi>Gall</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> would come over unto
them before the third hour, he ſhould be taken
into their ſafe protection; but after that time
there was no hope of any ſuch reception. And
they did ſo contemn our party, that whereas the
Ports were ſhut up for a ſhew with a ſingle row
of turfs, to the end they might appear to be
made up in ſuch manner that they could not be
broken open; ſome of them began to break
down the rampier with their hands, and others
to fill up the ditches.</p>
                     <p>Which <hi>Caeſar</hi> perceiving, ſallied out at all
the Ports at once; and ſending out the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
put the enemy ſo ſuddainly to flight, that
not one of them reſiſted by way of fighting: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
as he ſlew a great number of them, and
put them all beſides their Arms. But becauſe
he feared to follow them far, in regard of the
woods and bogs that lay in their paſſage, (being
unwilling to hazard himſelf upon the least oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

<hi>Cicero.</hi> Where he admired the towers, the mant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets

<hi>Cicero</hi> and the legion according to their

in that ſervice; informed himſelf by

to the ſouldiers, opened the particulars of that
matter, and then ſeaſoned them with comfort
and incouragement; ſhewing that the loſſe which
happened through the fault and temerity of a
Legate, was to be born with better patience: and
the rather foraſmuch as by the aſſistance of
the immortall Gods, and by their own vertue,
the loſſe was redeemed in ſuch a faſhion, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the <hi>Nervii</hi> and <hi>Aduatici</hi> made proviſion of war
againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that he ſhould not
want voluntary forces, if he did but once go
out of his confines; he gave order to call a
Councell of Arms: which according to the
manner of the <hi>Galles,</hi> was alwayes the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a war, being ſuch as conſtrained all
the men that were of years, by the common
law of the land, to aſſemble together in Arms:
and he that came laſt, was in the ſight of all
the reſt put to death with exquiſite torture. In
that Councel he took order to proclaim <hi>Cingeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rix</hi>
the chief of the other faction, and his ſon
in law, (who, as we have before declared, had
followed <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and not left him in any of
thoſe ſervices) a Traytor to the State, and
that his goods ſhould be confiſcated.</p>
                     <p>That being done, he publiſhed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
that he was ſent for by the <hi>Senones</hi> and
the <hi>Carnutes,</hi> and many other States of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia:</hi>
whether he meant to go through the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of the inhabitants of <hi>Rhemes;</hi> and
that he would harry and waſte their country.
But firſt his purpoſe was to take the camp of
<hi>Labienus,</hi> and accordingly gave order what
he would have done. <hi>Labienus</hi> being in a camp
exceedingly fortified, as well by Nature as by
Art, did not fear any danger that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to himſelf or the legion; but rather ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
not to let paſſe any occaſion to carry the
matter handſomely and to purpoſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being advertiſed by <hi>Cingetorix</hi> and his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
what ſpeech <hi>Induciomarus</hi> had delivered
in the Councell, he ſent Meſſengers to all the
confining cities, and commanded horſemen to
be ſent unto him by a certain day.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Induciomarus</hi> rid up and
down almoſt every day with all his cavalry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his camp; ſometimes to view the ſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
otherwhile to parlee, or elſe to terrifie the
ſouldier: and his horſemen for the moſt part
would caſt their weapons within the rampier.
<hi>Labienus</hi> kept all his men within the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and did what he could to make the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lieve that he was ſore afraid. And
as <hi>Induciomarus</hi> came daily with greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to the camp, one night having taken in the
cavalry of the bordering cities, which he had
formerly ſent for, he kept all his party (by good
guarding) within his camp with ſuch diligence,
that their reception could not poſsibly be brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
abroad, or carried to the <hi>Treviri.</hi> In the
mean time <hi>Induciomarus,</hi> according to his
wonted cuſtome, approached near the camp,
and there ſpent a great part of the day: the
horſemen caſt their weapons, and with words
of high reproach called out our men to fight;
without any word given in anſwer by them.
And a little before the evening, as they diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves and departed, upon a ſuddain
<hi>Labienus</hi> let out all the cavalry at two Ports,
commanding them that after the Enemy was
put to ſlight (which he ſaw would neceſſarily
happen) that every one ſhould make after <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciomarus;</hi>
and that no man ſhould ſo much
as wound any other enemy, before they ſaw him
ſlain; being very unwilling to give him time
to eſcape, while the ſouldiers were ingaged with
the rest: and propounded great rewards to
them that ſlew him. He ſent out alſo ſeveral co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
to aſſist the horſe. Fortune made good
that direction: for as all made after one, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciomarus</hi>
was ſurpriſed in the foord of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and ſlain, and his head was brought back
into the camp. The horſemen returning, ſlew
as many of the reſt as they could take. This
thing being known, all the forces of the <hi>Eburo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Nervii</hi> which were met together depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

which enrollment they firſt choſe fourteen Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
out of the body of their Gentlemen, whom
they called <hi>Equites.</hi> Theſe fourteen were ſuch
as had ſerved five years in the wars, whereby
they became eligible of that dignity. And again,
they choſe ten other Tribunes out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty,
being ſuch as had ſeen ten years ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
grounding this cuſtome upon another
law, which commanded the <hi>Equites</hi> to ſerve
ten, and the <hi>Pedites</hi> or Commons twenty whole
years before they could be freed and diſcharged
from the wars. And therefore according to the
proportion of their ſtipendary time, as the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites</hi>
were admitted Tribunes at five years, ſo
were the legionary footmen at ten, as at half
their compleat time of ſerving in the wars. The

of their age, and of their wealth. The age
which they deemed fit to endure the labours of

number of twenty years ſtipend; if there were
occaſion of ſo many wars in that ſpace of nine
and twenty years, which is comprehended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſeventeen and forty ſix. The wealth,
which is the ſecond circumſtance that made
men capable of military dignity, was neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
required to amount to the value of <hi>Drachmas
quadringentas,</hi> as <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaith, which by the
Latine phraſe was termed <hi>quaterna millia aeris:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Thirteen pounds ſterling, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts.</note>
ſuch as were not worth ſo much, were neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this choiſe, and reſerved for ſea-ſervice:
neither was it lawfull for any man to attain to
any office or magiſtracy within the city, untill
he had merited ten years ſtipend. Upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to make an inrolement, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every year, the Conſuls did proclaim a
day when all men of military age were to preſent
themſelves. Upon which day the <hi>Roman</hi> youth
being aſſembled in the city, and then in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol,
the fourteen Tribunes elected out of the
body of the <hi>Equites,</hi> divided themſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they were choſen by the people into four
parts; foraſmuch as in former time the whole
forces of their Empire conſiſted of four legions or
regiments, whereof I have diſcourſed at large in
the former book. And the four Tribunes firſt
choſen were allotted to the firſt legion, the three
next to the ſecond legion, the four other to the
third, and the three laſt to the fourth. In like
manner the ten Tribunes which were taken out
of the common body of the people, divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into four parts: and the two firſt choſen
were inrolled in the firſt legion, the three next
in the ſecond legion, the two following in the
third legion, and the three laſt in the fourth. By
which ingenious and diſcreet allotment it came
to paſſe that the communalty were intermingled
in the government of their Armies with the
Gentlemen, in ſuch an excellent mixture, that
the <hi>Equites</hi> were either ſuperiour or equal to the
<hi>Plebeii;</hi> notwithſtanding that every legion had
an equall number of Tribunes. The election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus far carried, the Tribunes of every legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſate them down by themſelves: the people
being divided firſt into their Tribes, and then
into their claſſes and centuries, caſting lots
which Tribe ſhould be taken; and out of that
Tribe whereon the lot fell they drew fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> men, as
equall as they could both in age and habitude,
who being brought forth, the Tribunes of the
firſt legion made the firſt choiſe of one of thoſe
four; then the Tribunes of the ſecond legion
had their choiſe, they of the third legion took
the next, and the fourth had the laſt man. And
again out of the ſame Tribe were other four cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen;
and then the Tribunes of the ſecond legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
began firſt to make their choiſe, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the firſt legion had the laſt man. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
four other being choſen, the Tribunes of
the third legion had the firſt election, and in
that courſe the ſecond legion had the laſt
man. And by this alternate and ſucceſſive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
it came to paſſe, that every legion was
equally compounded both in quality and in
number. The inrolement proceeding in this
manner untill their numbers were full; the
Tribunes of every legion aſſembled their ſeverall
troups together, and took one out of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
and gave an oath unto him that he
ſhould execute and obey, according to his power,
whatſoever was commanded him by his Generall:
the reſt being particularly called, were ſworn
to keep the ſame oath which their fore-man had
taken. And thus we ſee both who were the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors,
who were eligible, and the manner of
their choiſe. Wherein we may obſerve what
means they uſed to ingage every particular man
with an intereſt in the generall cauſe: for they
thought it not ſufficient to force men out by
publick authority, and to bind them ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mply to
that ſervice by the mandates of their Empire,
conſidering the labours and difficulties of war,
which oftentimes are able to dull the edge of the
greateſt ſpirit, and to cauſe omiſſions of duty in
the moſt honeſt and obedient minds; but they
tyed them likewiſe with ſuch particular reſpects,
as did both concern the poſſeſſions of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and the religion of their ſoul. For it is
obſerved concerning mans actions, that unleſſe
the mind do faithfully affect the execution, it may
be carried with ſuch a perfunctory ſervice, as ſhal
betray the true intent to no effect, and deceive
the end of that which was promiſed by deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And therefore they refuſed to inrole any
man that had not a convenient proportion of
wealth, to maintain a ſtedfaſt and well-reſolved
courage, and to ſettle the motions of a ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
mind, when they bethought themſelves
that the publick duties wherein they were inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
were the defenſive powers of their Empire,
and the means whereby the publick weale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
happy: and ſo by conſequence their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

preſerved onely by an effectuall obſervance of

the ſpirit of a people, and turneth the pride of a

that work which with much difficulty and

end that maketh any labour to be undertaken,
being a otherwiſe nothing but a pain of the body
&amp; vexation of the ſpirit. And herefore when it
ſhall be found either circular, or of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontments,
before it can anſwer the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our mind, we chuſe rather to forgo
that contentment which the accompliſhment of
our deſires would afford us, then to buy it with
ſuch a meaſure of trouble, as exceedeth that
which the proportion of our means ſeemeth able
to effect. In regard whereof the ancient ſages of
the world made a task of this quality to be one
of <hi>Hercules</hi> labours, by faining the ſerpent <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>
to be of this nature, that when one head
was ſmitten off, two other heads grew out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
from the ſame ſtump: and ſo his labour
multiplied his travell, and his valour increaſed
the difficulty of his work. It was <hi>Caeſars</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
in other caſes, to have ſuch a beginning of
ſtrength at his firſt entrance into a war, as by
continuance might be augmented, and rather
increaſe then decay upon the reſiſtance of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
So he began the war in <hi>Gallia</hi> with ſix
legions, continued it with eight, and ended it
with ten: he began the civile war but with one
legion; he arrived at <hi>Brunduſium</hi> with ſix; he
followed <hi>Pompey</hi> into <hi>Greece</hi> with fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
foot and five thouſand horſe; and ended
that war with two and twenty thouſand foot
and a thouſand horſe. He began the war at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi>
with three thouſand two hundred

                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with ſix, and ended it with

being ſtronger in the end then in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and made his army as a plant like to

fore whereas they were drawn out of their

and were carried unſeaſonably upon a ſervice,
he rewarded them with the booty and ſpoil of
the enemy, contrary to the ordinary courſe of
the <hi>Roman</hi> warfare, which reſerved either all or
the moſt part thereof for the publick Treaſury,
and left the ſouldier to his ſtipendary enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.
Which is a point very obſervable

Spring, whereas all the reſt ſaving
the <hi>Senones, Carnutes,</hi> and <hi>Treviri</hi> made their
appearance; he conceived of it as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of war and defection, and thereupon ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all other things aſide, he transferred the
Councell to the city of <hi>Paris</hi> in the confines of
the <hi>Senones,</hi> which in the time of their fathers
had united their State unto them, but were
held clear of this confederacy. This thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
publiſhed from the Tribunall, the ſame
day he carried the Legions againſt the <hi>Seno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
and by great journeys came into their
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51174:100"/>
country. His coming being known, <hi>Acco</hi> the
chiefeſt authour of that rebellion commanded
the multitude to go into cities and towns of
defence: but as they endeavoured, before it
could be accompliſhed, news was brought that
the <hi>Romans</hi> were already come; whereby they
neceſſarily left off their purpoſe, and ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to intreat for favour.
They uſed the mediation of the <hi>Hedui,</hi> whoſe
State had of old time been in faith and league
with the <hi>Romans. Caeſar</hi> at the ſuit of the
<hi>Hedui</hi> did willingly afford them pardon, and
accepted their excuſe, foraſmuch as he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſummer time fitter to be ſpent in the
war which was coming on him, rather then in
matter of question and judgement: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
commanded an hundred pledges, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
them to be kept by the <hi>Hedui.</hi> The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes</hi>
likewiſe ſent meſſengers and pledges, and
by the intreaty of the men of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> whoſe
clients they were, received the ſame anſwers.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> ended the Councell, and commanded
horſemen to be ſent him from all the States of
<hi>Gallia.</hi>

ſpecially States and Commonweals, as ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing

a treaty or parlee, and a renewing of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

granted by this Councel as a ſubſidy, which in the
<hi>Roman</hi> army received ſtipend and pay by the
name of Auxiliary or aſſociate forces, whereof
we read in many places of theſe Commentaries,
and particularly in this book. But the <hi>Romans</hi>
uſed ſpecially the ſervice of their horſemen, as
the flower of their ſtrength, and far exceeding
their foot companies in execution of arms and

The laſt ſaying which I obſerve concerning this
councel is, the time wherein it was ſummoned,
which was the beginning of the Spring, rather
then any other part of the year, whereof there is
this reaſon; that if any State neglected the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and refuſed to make their appearance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to cuſtome, the ſummer time coming on,
gave good means to the <hi>Roman</hi> legions to puniſh
the inſolency of ſuch a contempt: as it happened
in this place to the <hi>Senones, Carnutes</hi> and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri,</hi>
whoſe abſence from this meeting was a
ſufficient argument to <hi>Caeſar</hi> of their rebellion,

to an enemy: for beſides this particular,
we may read in the fourth Commentary, that the

into <hi>Britain</hi> was, for that the <hi>Britans</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand
given ſuccour and aſſiſtance to the

judgement, whether it were in regard of any

the <hi>Galles,</hi> or otherwiſe to keep the <hi>Romans</hi>
occupied there, that they in the mean time might
live quietly at home, which I need not here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute:
but the matter proveth it ſelf plainly by
<hi>Caeſars</hi> own confeſſion, that the continuall
ſupplies ſent from <hi>Britain</hi> were a ſufficient
cauſe to move him to that war. And as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in this Commentary concerning the ſelf
ſame matter, the only cauſe that drew him to
paſſe the <hi>Rhene</hi> the ſecond time into <hi>Germany,</hi>
was the ſuccours which the <hi>Germans</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſent to the <hi>Treviri;</hi> according to reaſon

brought to a tryall of battel; and therefore he
laboured to underſtand his other projects. From
whence a Commander may receive direction
what courſe to hold in a refuſall of open en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter:
for as the art and ſleight of war is to
ſubdue an enemy ſo are there more wayes and

<hi>Labienus</hi> ſuſpecting that which now had
happened, to the end he might draw them all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

on forward. At length ſending the carriages
a little before, and placing them upon a hill,
Ye have now, (ſaid he) fellow ſouldiers, that
opportunity which ye deſired, the enemy in a
cumberſome and unequall place; only afford
me your Leader at this time that valour, which
oftentimes heretofore you have ſhewed to your

this ſervice with his own eyes. And withall be
commanded the Enſignes to be carried towards
the enemy, and the army to be imbattelled:

aſſault them, whom they had thought had fled

that even in the first cloſe they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

purſuing them with his horſemen, killed
many of them, and took more priſoners, and
within a few dayes took in the whole ſtate of the

returned home again; and with them went

in the ſeventh Commentary, being imbattel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon the ſide of a hill right over againſt the
army of the <hi>Galles,</hi> which ſtood likewiſe in a

would not ſuffer his men to hazzard themſelves

his ſouldiers, diſdaining the confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

rather then to buy a victory with the danger of
ſo many worthy men, and patiently to attend

by the Commanders, whether they ſhould leave
the Downes, and go charge the enemy where he
ſtood imbattelled upon the ſands, or attend him
in the faſtneſſe of the Downes whereof they
were poſſeſt. The whole Councell of war were
earneſtly bent to forſake the Downes, and to
hazzard the fight on equall terms, as impatient
that their paſſage and retreat to <hi>Oſtend</hi> ſhould
be cut off. But Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> well knowing
how much it imported the buſineſſe of that day to
hold a place of ſuch gain and advantage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
Count <hi>Maurice</hi> by many reaſons, and
ſpecially by this of <hi>Caeſar</hi> which I laſt alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not to forgo the help of the Downs, but to
expect the enemy in that place, and ſo make uſe
of that benefit upon the firſt encounter, rather
then to adventure the ſucceſſe of the battel in
worſe terms, in hope of clearing the paſſage:
and ſhewing alſo many probable conjectures,
that the enemy would not continue long in that
gaze. Wherein as his opinion then prevailed,
ſo all that were preſent were eye-witneſſes both
of the truth of his conjecture, and the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his judgement. For the enemy within
a while after coming on to charge the troups of
the States, was received with ſuch a counterbuffe
from the hils, and were violently beaten back in
ſuch rude manner, as our men had the execution
of them for the ſpace of a quarter of a mile or
more, which was no ſmall advantage to the
fortune of that day. Touching the opportunity
of time, which <hi>Pindarus</hi> calleth the Mother of
worthy exploits, and oftentimes dependeth upon
the circumſtance of place, a Generall ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to adviſe that he neither precipitate nor
foreſlow the occaſion, which is well expreſſed in
this particular ſervice of <hi>Labienus.</hi> For where
his purpoſe was to draw the enemy over a river
that had ſteep and uneaſy banks, and thereby of
a hard and difficult paſſage, he would not ſhew
his reſolution untill he had drawn them all over
the river: for he was well aſſured that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
legions would ſo charge the enemy upon
their firſt encounter with the unreſiſtable weight
of their piles, that in their giving back they
could not eſcape the danger of the river. And
therefore to make the victory more abſolute and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51174:102"/>
compleat, he ſuffered them all to come over the
water, that all might be endangered in their
paſſage back again. And this is the benefit which
opportunity bringeth, which is the rather to be
attended with all carefulneſſe, foraſmuch as

may be, for that our diſcourſe (diligently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

calleth the lives of both parties in queſtion, and
valuing every circumſtance at the utmoſt) doth
alwayes preſuppoſe a cauſe anſwerable to ſuch
an effect of joy and aſsurance. For theſe ſhouts
and acclamations are properly the conſequents
of joy, and are ſo availeable that they deceive
both parties: for ſuch as take up the ſhout by
way of anticipation, do ſeem to conclude of
that which is yet in queſtion; and the enemy
thereupon apprehendeth danger when there is

the authority of Holy Writ, but that it
might ſeem both unſavoury and unſeaſonable to
make a commixture of ſuch diverſities. I will
therefore content my ſelf with a practice of our
time at the battel of <hi>Newport,</hi> where after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
retreats and purſuits, either ſide chaſing the
other as it were by turn and mutuall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and as it often falleth out in ſuch
confrontments; at laſt commandement was
given to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to make head again, and
after ſome pauſe to charge the enemy with a
ſhout: which being accordingly performed, a
man might have ſeen the enemy ſtartle before
they came to the ſtroak; and being charged
home, were ſo routed, that they made not head
again that day. For the prevention of ſuch a

Amongſt other advertiſements (being but four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

the Boats being prepared ready, as uſually they
are in camp-royals, ſuch a bridge may be made in

with great wonderment and admiration. And
therein I hold well with <hi>Brancatio,</hi> that for the

and of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and wherein
thoſe two Nations do differ. In <hi>Gallia</hi> not onely
in every city, village, and precinct, but almoſt
in every particular houſe there are parties and
factions, the heads whereof are ſuch as they
think to be of greateſt authority, according to
whoſe opinion and command the main courſe of
their actions is directed. And this ſeemeth a
cuſtome inſtituted of old time, to the end that
none of the common people, how mean ſoever,
might at any time want means to make their
party good againſt a greater man: for if they
ſhould ſuffer their parties and followers to be
either oppreſſed or circumvented, they ſhould
never bear any rule or authority amongſt them.
And this is the courſe throughout all <hi>Gallia,</hi>
for all their States are divided into two facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
When <hi>Caeſar</hi> came into <hi>Gallia,</hi> the <hi>Hedui</hi>
were chief ring-leaders of the one party, and
the <hi>Sequani</hi> of the other. Theſe finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be the worker ſide, (foraſmuch as the

<hi>Arioviſtus</hi> by many great promiſes on their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and after many great victories all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the <hi>Hedui</hi> being ſlain, they went ſo far
beyond them in power and authority, that they
drew the greateſt part of Clients from the <hi>Hedui</hi>
to themſelves, and took the children of their
Princes for pledges, and cauſed them to take a
publick oath not to undertake any thing againſt
the <hi>Sequani;</hi> beſides a great part of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
which they took from them by force: and
ſo they obtained the principality of <hi>Gallia.</hi> And
thereupon <hi>Divitiacus</hi> went unto <hi>Rome</hi> to ſeek
aid of the Senate, but returned without effecting
any thing. <hi>Caeſars</hi> coming into <hi>Gallia</hi> brought
an alteration of theſe things, for the pledges
were restored back again to the <hi>Hedui,</hi> and their
old followers and clients did likewiſe return to
their protection: beſides other new followers
which by <hi>Caeſars</hi> means did cleave unto them:
for they ſaw that thoſe which entred into friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with them, were in a better condition, and
more fairly dealt with. Whereby their nobleneſs
and dignity was ſo amplified and enlarged, that
the <hi>Sequani</hi> loſt their authority, whom the men
of <hi>Rhemes</hi> ſucceeded. And foraſmuch as the
world took notice that they were no leſs favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Caeſar</hi> then the <hi>Hedui,</hi> ſuch as by reaſon
of former enmities could not endure to joyn with
the <hi>Hedui,</hi> put themſelves into the clientele of the
men of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and found reſpective prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from that State; which cauſed a new and
ſodain raiſed authority of the men of <hi>Rhemes.</hi>
So that at that time the <hi>Hedui</hi> went far beyond
all the other States of <hi>Gallia</hi> in power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and next unto them were the men of
<hi>Rhemes.</hi>

                        <p>FActions are generally the rent of a State,<note place="margin">Factions and parties.</note> and
a disjoynting of thoſe parts which common
unity hath knit together for the preſervation of
good government. But the <hi>Galles</hi> maintained
ſides and parties throughout the whole body of
their Continent, and found it neceſſary for the
upholding of their policy at home; and as it fell
out in the courſe of theſe wars, rather a help then
otherwiſe in their generall defence againſt a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
enemy. The reaſon of the former benefit
was grounded upon two cauſes, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> noteth:
the one proceeding from the oppreſſion uſed by
the rich and mighty men towards the poorer and
meaner people; and the other from the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of thoſe of inferior condition, refuſing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
any authority or preeminency at all,
rather then to endure the wrongs and contumelies
of the mighty. And therefore to prevent the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
might of the great ones, and to give
countenance and reſpect to the lower ſort, theſe
factions and ſides were deviſed: wherein the
foot had alwayes a head ſenſible of the wrongs
which were done unto it. Things of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
are alwayes injurious to leſſer natures,
and cannot endure any competency; not ſo
much as in compariſon, or by way of relation. In
things without life, the prerogative of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
doth ſwallow up the leſſer riſing of the
downs, and the ſwelling of the downs, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs
of the mole-hils: the Stars are dimmed
at the riſing of the Moon, and the Moon loſeth
both her light and her beauty in the preſence of
the Sunne. So amongſt bruit beaſts and fiſhes,
the greater do alwayes devour the leſs, and take
them as their due by the appointment of nature:
and men more injurious in this point, then either
mountains or brute beaſts, inaſmuch as they do
alwayes overvalue themſelves beyond their own
greatneſs, have in all ages verified the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi> One man's a Wolf to
another. And on the other ſide, as nature ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
nothing in vain, but hath given a being to
the leaſt of her creatures: ſo do they endeavour
not to be annulled, but to keep themſelves in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and continuance. <hi>Habet &amp; muſca ſplenem,</hi>
The very Fly hath her ſpleen, ſaith the Poet: and
the Piſmires and Bees have their common-weales,
though not equall to a Monarch. And therefore
that the mighty and great men of <hi>Gallia</hi> might
not devour the loweſt of the people, but that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man might ſtand in his own condition, and
by the help of a <hi>Rowland</hi> live by an <hi>Oliver;</hi> and
again, that the poorer ſort might give as a tribute
for their protection, that reſpect and obedience
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51174:104"/>
to their ſuperiors, as belongeth to ſuch high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
theſe factions and bandies were ordained:
whereby the Nobles were reſtrained from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the poor, and the poor compelled to obey
the Nobility, which is the beſt end that may be
made of any faction.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the advantage which the <hi>Galles</hi>
received by theſe factions againſt forraign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
it was rather in regard of the multiplicitie
of States and Common-weals which were in the
continent of <hi>Gallia,</hi> then otherwiſe: for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
appeareth, that their factions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
for ſoveraign authority, cauſed one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to bring in <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> and the <hi>Germans;</hi>
and the other party the <hi>Romans,</hi> to make good
their bandy. But foraſmuch as <hi>Gallia</hi> had many
diviſions, and contained many ſeverall States,
relying chiefly upon their own ſtrength, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming
the ſubverſion of their neighbour city,<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note>
as a calamity befalling their neighbour, from
which the reſt ſtood as yet free, it was not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

The battell which <hi>Caeſar</hi> had with the <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vij,</hi>

nor of ſix hundred Senators above three; nor

that ſcholars might not truſt ſo much
to their writings as to their memory, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
for the moſt part, that men rely upon the
truſt of books and papers, and in the mean time
omit the benefit of good remembrance. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
chiefly to teach men that their ſouls do
not die, but that they do remove out of one body
into another after death; and this they think to
be very important to ſtir men up to vertue neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the fear of death. They diſpute further,
and give many traditions to the youth touching
the ſtars and their motion, the magnitude of
the earth and the world, the nature of things,
and the might and power of the Gods.</p>

                        <p>THe quality and condition of the <hi>Druides</hi> is
in this place very particularly deſcribed by
<hi>Caeſar,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Druides.</note> and may be reduced to theſe heads. Firſt,
their Office, extending both to things Divine
and things temporall, whereby they executed the
place both of Prieſts and of Judges. And for
that purpoſe there was one known place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
where they ſate in judgement: and as I
underſtand it, there was but one Terme in the
year, which both began and ended their ſuits in
law. The ſecond thing is their Authority, having
power to reward vertue and to puniſh vice.
Thirdly, their priviledges and immunities, being
free from contribution, from warfare, and all
other burthens of the State. Fourthly, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and learning, which was partly Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall,
concerning the might and power of the
gods, the immortality of the Soul; and partly
philoſophicall, touching the ſtars and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the earth and the magnitude thereof. And
laſtly, their manner of learning, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<hi>Pythagoricall,</hi> refuſing the help of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and books, and committing their doctrine
to the tradition of their Elders. But that which is
ſpecially to be obſerved,<note place="margin">England.</note> is, that this learning was
not onely found out here in <hi>Brittanie,</hi> but ſuch
as would perfectly attain to the knowledge
thereof, came into <hi>England</hi> to ſtudy the ſame,
contrary to the experience which heretofore
hath been obſerved of the Northern and Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
parts of the world: for as the South giveth
a temper to the body fit for the ſcience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of Arts, whereby the mind being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
and purified in her faculties, doth dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſecret depth of all learning, and cenſure
the hidden myſteries thereof; ſo the Northern
climats do bind in the powers of the ſoul, and
reſtrain all her vertues to the uſe of the body,
whereby they are ſaid to have <hi>animam in digi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">By reaſon of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and artificiall works.</note>
their ſoul in their fingers, not affording her
that delight and contentment which is uſually
received by ſpeculation. And thence it happeneth
that all ſpeculative arts and ſciences, and what
elſe ſoever concerneth the inward contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the mind, was found out and perfected by
ſuch as border upon the South, and from them it
was brought by litle and litle into the Northern
regions: and ſuch as would be maſters in the
Arts they profeſſed, went alwayes Southward
for the attaining thereof. But here the South was
beholding to the North, as well for their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Divinity, as for their Philoſophie and
morall learning, being as pure, as that which
any heathen people ever drank of. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
an ancient ſingularity in the inhabitants of
this Iland, touching the ſtudie of Arts and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of learning, and may with like evidence be
proved from age to age even to this time. In
witneſs whereof I appeal to the two Univerſities
of this land,<note place="margin">Oxford &amp; Cambridge.</note> as a demonſtration of the love which
our Nation hath ever born to learning, being
two ſuch Magazins of arts and ſciences, ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified

are either grievouſly diſeaſed, or converſant

                        </gap>ving the life of one man for
the life of another: and to that purpoſe they
have publick ſacrifices appointed. Others have
Images of a monſtrous magnitude, whoſe limbs
and parts being made of Oſiers, are filled with
living men, and being ſet one fire, the men are
burned to death. The execution of ſuch as are
taken in theft or robbery, or any other crime,
they think to be beſt pleaſing to the gods; but
wanting ſuch, they ſpare not the innocent. They
worſhip chiefly the god <hi>Mercurie,</hi> and have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his images amongſt them; him they adore
as the inventor of all Arts, the conductor and
guide in all voyages and journeys, and they
think him to have great power in all merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
and gain of moneys. Next unto him they
prefer <hi>Apollo, Mars, Jove</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> and of
theſe they carrie the ſame opinion as other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do: <hi>Apollo</hi> to be powerfull in healing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
<hi>Minerva</hi> in finding out artificiall
works, <hi>Jove</hi> ruling the celeſtiall Empire, and
<hi>Mars</hi> for Warre. When they are to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with an enemy, they vow all the ſpoil
unto him; and ſuch beaſts as are taken they
ſacrifice, other things they lay up in ſome one
place: and many ſuch heaps of things ſo taken
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51174:105"/>
are to be ſeen in the holy places of diverſe of
their cities. Neither doth it often happen, that
any man neglecting his religion in that point,
dare either keep back any thing ſo taken, or take
away ought laid up in their Repoſitories; for
they incur a heavie puniſhment and torture for
that offence. The <hi>Galles</hi> do all boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the ſtock from whence they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,
underſtanding by the <hi>Druides,</hi> that they
come of the god <hi>Dis.</hi> And therefore they end
the ſpace of all their times by the number of
nights rather then by the number of dayes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the dayes of their nativity, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of their moneths and their years, in ſuch
ſort as the day doth alwayes follow the night.
And herein they differ from other nations,
that they ſuffer not their children to come open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto them, but when they are grown fit for
war: thinking it ſhamefull and diſhonest, that
a ſon in his childhood ſhould in publike places
ſtand in the ſight of his father. To the portions
which they have with their wives, they add as
much more of their own goods; and the uſe of
this money thus added together, is kept apart,
and the longer liver hath both the principall
and the intereſt for all the former time. The
men have power of life and death, both over
their wives and their children. And when a
man of great place and parentage ſhall happen
to deceaſe, his kinsfolks aſſemble themſelves
together, to enquire of his death: if there be
any occaſion of ſuſpition, they put his wife to
torture after the manner of a ſervant; and if
it be found, ſhe dies tormented with fire and all
other tortures as may be imagined. Their fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
(according to the reſt of their life) are
magnificall and ſumptuous, burying with the
dead corps all that he took delight in while he
lived, not ſparing living creatures: and not
long out of memory, the cuſtome was to bury
with the body ſuch clients and ſervants as were
favoured by him in his lifetime. Such States
as are carefull in the government of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weals,
do prohibite by a ſpeciall law, that
no man ſhall communicate a rumour or report
touching the State to any man ſaving a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate;
foraſmuch as it had been often found,
that raſh and unskilfull men were ſo terrified
with falſe reports, and moved to ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
attempts, that they entered into reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
touching the main points of State. The
Magistrates do keep ſecret ſuch things as they
think fit, and that which they think expedient
they publiſh: but it is not lawfull to ſpeak of
matter of State, but in aſſemblies of State.</p>

preceded the day time, contrary to the uſe of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
where the day began at Sun-riſing, and the
night followed the artificiall day as the ſecond
part of the day naturall;) we are to underſtand,
that as all time, and the diſtinction of the parts
thereof, dependeth upon the two motions of the
Sunne: the one as it moveth in its own orb from
Weſt to Eaſt, begetting the revolution of years,
and the ſeaſons of Sommer and Winter, the
Spring and the Autumne, with the meaſure of
moneths as it paſſeth through the ſignes of the
Zodiack; and the other, as it is carried from
Eaſt to Weſt by the firſt moving ſphear, making
the diſtinction of nights and dayes, houres and
minutes: ſo the beginnings of theſe times and
ſeaſons are diverſly taken amongſt diverſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and nations of the earth. The <hi>Iewes</hi> had the
ſame computation touching the beginning of
the day as the <hi>Galles</hi> had, but upon other
grounds and reaſons then could be alledged for
this cuſtome in <hi>Gallia:</hi> for they began their day
in the evening at Sunne-ſetting, as appeareth by
many places of the Scripture: and <hi>Moſes</hi> in the
repetition of the firſt ſeven dayes work, upon the
accompliſhment of a day, ſaith, The evening
and the morning were one day, giving the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
precedency before the morning, as though
the day had begun in the evening. The <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
in like manner do obſerve the beginning of
their day in the evening, and do herein follow
the uſe of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Other nations do begin at
Sun-riſing, and take the computation of their
day naturall from the firſt appearing of the Sun
in the Eaſt. The <hi>Greeks</hi> begin and end their day
at midnight, obſerving the certainty of that time,
and the correſpondence between the equall and
planetary houres in the meridian Circle: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
otherwiſe by reaſon of the inequality of the
dayes and the nights, out of a right ſphare there
is alwayes ſome difference between the ſaid
houres. And this uſe alſo is obſerved by us in
<hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This god <hi>Dis,</hi> whom he nameth for the father
of that nation, is the ſame whom the heathen
called <hi>Pluto,</hi> the god of hell and darkneſs; and
for that cauſe they put darkneſs before light,
touching the beginning of their naturall day.</p>
                        <p>But foraſmuch as this circumſtance giveth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſpeak of dayes and times, give me leave
to inſert the reformation of the year, which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
ſo happily eſtabliſhed, that ſucceeding times
have had no cauſe to alter the ſame.</p>
                        <p>And although it neither concerneth the art
of war, nor happened within the compaſs of theſe
ſeven ſommers: yet foraſmuch as it was done
by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and deſerveth as often memory as
any other of his noble acts, it ſhall not ſeem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to the reader to take thus much by the
way concerning that matter. There is no nation
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51174:105"/>
of any civill government, but obſerveth a courſe
or revolution differenced with times and ſeaſons,
in ſuch manner as may be anſwerable to the
motion of the Sun, in the circuit which it maketh
through the ſignes and degrees of the Zodiack.
But foraſmuch as the government of a civill year
doth not well admit any other compoſition of
parts, to make it abſolute and complete, then by
naturall dayes; and on the other ſide, the Sun
requireth odde houres and minutes to finiſh his
race, and return again to the goal from whence
it came; there hath alwayes been found a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the civill and the Solar year. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Caeſars</hi> time, the <hi>Romans</hi> uſing the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
computation of the year, had not onely ſuch
uncertainty and alteration in moneths and
times, that the ſacrifices and yearly feaſts came
by litle and litle to ſeaſons contrary for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they were ordained: but alſo in the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sun or Solar year, no other nation
agreed with them in account; and of the <hi>Romans</hi>
themſelves, onely the Prieſts underſtood it: and
therefore when they pleaſed (no man being able
to controll them) they would upon the ſodain
thruſt in a moneth above the ordinary number,
which as <hi>Plutarch</hi> noteth,<note place="margin">Plutarch</note> was in old time cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Mercedonius,</hi> or <hi>Menſis intercalaris.</hi> To

                           <hi>Caeſar</hi> calling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the beſt and moſt expert Aſtronomers of
that time, made a Kalender more exactly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
then any other that was before: and yet
ſuch a one as by long continuance of time hath
bred a difference, for the matter ſtandeth thus.</p>
                        <p>It is found by certain obſervation of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
of all ages, that the Sun being carried
from the Weſt to the Eaſt by the motion of his
own Sphear, finiſheth his yearly courſe in the
ſpace of 365. dayes, five houres, nine and fourty
minutes, and ſome odd ſeconds: whereupon it
was then concluded that their civill year muſt
neceſſarily contain three hundred threeſcore
and five dayes, which maketh two and fifty
weeks and one day. And foraſmuch as thoſe five
odd hours, nine and fourty minutes, and ſome
ſeconds, did in four years ſpace amount unto a
naturall day, (wanting two and fourty minutes
and ſix and fifty ſeconds, which was thought
nothing in compariſon) they deviſed every fourth
year to add a day more then ordinary, to anſwer
that time which is uſually added to <hi>February:</hi>
whereby it happeneth that in every fourth year
<hi>February</hi> hath nine and twenty dayes. And
ſo they made an order to reform their year with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſenſible errour for a long time. But ſince
that time, being one thouſand ſix hundred years
and more, thoſe two and fourty minutes and ſix
and fifty ſeconds, which as I ſaid do want of the
naturall day of four and twenty hours which is
inſerted in every fourth year, have bred a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
and an apparant errour: for whereas the civil
year is by that means made greater then the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
years, the Sun ending his task before we can
end our times, it happeneth that ſuch feaſts as
have relation to ſeaſonable times, do as it were
foreſlow the opportunity, and fall out further in
the year, as though they had a motion towards
the ſommer ſolſtice. And as theſe go forward,
ſo doth the Equinoctiall return backwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the beginning of the moneth. For <hi>Caeſar</hi>
by the help of the Aſtronomers obſerved the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctium</hi>
the five and twentieth of <hi>March.
Ptolemy</hi> in his time obſerved the <hi>Aequinoctium</hi>
the two and twentieth of <hi>March.</hi> And it was
obſerved the one and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> in the
year from the incarnation 322. what time was
holden the firſt generall Councill at <hi>Nice</hi> a city
of <hi>Pontus,</hi> in reſpect whereof the Paſchall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and other rules were eſtabliſhed for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of Eaſter. But ſince that time there are
paſſed 1281. years, and the <hi>Aequinoctium</hi>
cometh before the one and twentieth of <hi>March</hi>
ten dayes.</p>
                        <p>As this errour is reformed among other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and reduced to that ſtate as it was at the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Councill: ſo there might many reaſons
be alledged to prove the reformation convenient
of a greater number of dayes then ten. For if the
Kalender were ſo ordered, that every moneth
might begin when the Sun entreth into that Sign
which is for the moneth, and end when the Sun
goeth out of that ſigne, it would avoid much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and be very eaſy to all ſorts of people as
have occaſion to obſerve the ſame: which
doubtleſſe was the purport of the firſt inſtitution
of moneths; and was obſerved (as it ſeemeth)
by the old <hi>Romans,</hi> who began the year at the
winter ſolſtice, as <hi>Ovid</hi> noteth:</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Bruma novi prima eſt, veteriſque noviſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
ſolis:</l>
                           <l>Principium capiunt <hi>Phoebus</hi> &amp; annus i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>And therefore they called that moneth <hi>Ianuary</hi>
of <hi>Ianus</hi> that had two faces, and ſaw both the
old and the new year. Such therefore as would
go about to reform the year to this courſe, muſt
not cut off ten dayes onely, but one and twenty;
and for one year make <hi>December</hi> to continue
but ten dayes, and then <hi>Ianuary</hi> to begin, and
ſo ſucceſſively to the reſt of the moneths. But it
may be ſaid, that although we help our ſelves,
and put off the inconvenience which is fallen
upon us, yet in tract of time the like error will
fall again upon ſucceeding ages, and put their
yearly Feaſts beſides the dayes appointed for
them. For remedy whereof it may be anſwered;
That whereas this error hath happened by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
every fourth year a naturall day, which in
true calculation wanted two and fourty minutes
and ſix and fifty ſeconds of four and twenty
houres, and in very 136. years hath accrued
within one minute to a day more then needed:
the onely way is every 136. years, to omit the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51174:106"/>
addition of that day, and to make that year to
contain but 365. dayes, which by the order of
<hi>Caeſars</hi> Kalender, is a leap year, and hath one day
more, which hath brought this error. And ſo
there would not happen the error of a day in the
ſpace of 111086. years, if the world ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſo long.</p>
                        <p>But leaſt we ſhould ſeem more curious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming

manners of our civill life, I will proceed to that

gained two ſpeciall points for the maintenance

that ſuch matters of conſequence as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

in ſuch places and at ſuch times as might

for they have neither Prieſts nor
ſacrifices. They worſhip no gods
but ſuch as are ſubject to ſenſe,
and from whom they dayly receive profits and
help, as the Sun, the Fire, and the Moon; for
the reſt they have not ſo much as heard of.
Their life is onely ſpent in hunting, or in uſe
and practiſe of war. They inure themſelves to
labour and hardneſs even from their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
and ſuch as continue longeſt beardleſs are
moſt commended amongſt them: for this ſome
think to be very available to their ſtature, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to their ſtrength and ſinews. They hold it
a moſt diſhoneſt part for one to touch a woman
before he be twenty years of age: neither can
any ſuch matter be hid or diſſembled, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they bathe themſelves together in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and uſe skins and other ſmall coverings
on the reins of their backs, the reſt of their
body being all naked. They uſe no tillage, the
greateſt part of their food is milk, or cheeſe, or
fleſh: neither hath any man any certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of land to his own uſe; but their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and Princes do every year allot a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
portion of land to kindreds and tribes that
inhabite together, as much and in ſuch places
as they think fit, and the next year appoint
them in a new place. Hereof they give many
reaſons: leſt they ſhould be led away by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
cuſtome from the practiſe of war to the
uſe of husbandry, or lest they ſhould endeavour
to get themſelves great poſſeſsions, and ſo the
weaker ſhould be thrust out and diſpoſſeſt of
their livings by the mighty, or leſt they ſhould
build too delicately for the avoiding of cold
or heat, or leſt they ſhould wax covetous and
thirſt after money, which is the beginning of
all factions and diſſenſions; and laſtly, that they
might keep the Commons in good contentment,
conſidering the parity between their revenues
and the poſſeſsions of the great ones. It is the
greateſt honour to their States to have their
confines lie waſte and deſolate far and near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them: for that they take to be an argument
of valour, when their borderers are driven to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51174:106"/>
forſake their countrey, and dare not abide near
them; and withall they think themſelves by
that means much ſafer from any ſodain incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
When a State maketh war, either by way
of attempt or defence, they chuſe Magiſtrates
to command that war, having power of life and
death: but in time of peace they have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Magiſtrate, but the chiefeſt men in the
countrey and the villages, do interpret the Law
and determine of Controverſies. Theft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
out of the confines of their State is not
infamous or diſhonest, but commended as
an exerciſe of the youth, and a keeping
them from ſloth. When any one of their
Princes and chief men ſhall in an aſſembly or
councel publiſh himſelf for a leader upon ſome
exploit, and deſire to know who will follow him
upon the ſame, they that have a good opinion of
the man and the matter, and do promiſe him
their help and aſſiſtance, are commended by the
multitude: the reſt that refuſe to accompany
him, are held in the number of traitors, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have any credit afterwards. They hold it
not lawfull to hurt a ſtranger that ſhall come
unto them upon any occaſion, but do protect him
from injuries; to ſuch every mans houſe is
open, and his table common. The time was
when the <hi>Galles</hi> excelled the <hi>Germans</hi> in prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
and valour, and made war upon them of
their own accord, and by reaſon of the multitude
of their people and want of ground for habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they ſent many colonies over the <hi>Rhene</hi>
into <hi>Germany.</hi> And ſo thoſe fertile places of
<hi>Germ</hi> which are near unto the wood <hi>Hercynia,</hi>
(which <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> and other <hi>Grecians</hi> took

ſtill continue in the ſame poverty, want, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
as in former time; do uſe the ſame diet
and apparell for their bodies: but the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
and knowledge of other nations hath
made the <hi>Galles</hi> live in a more plentifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who by litle and litle have been weakned
and overthrown in divers battels, ſo that now
they ſtand not in compariſon with the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
The breadth of the wood <hi>Hercynia</hi> is nine
dayes journey over, for they have no other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of ſpace but by means of days iourneys.
It beginneth at the confines of the <hi>Helvetii, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes,</hi>
and <hi>Rauraci,</hi> and runs along the river
<hi>Danubius</hi> to the territories of the <hi>Daci;</hi> thence
it declineth to the left ſide from the ſaid river,
and by reaſon of the large extenſion thereof, it
bordereth the confines of many other countries.
Neither is there any <hi>German</hi> that can ſay, that
either he durſt adventure, or did go to, or had
heard of the beginning of the ſame, although he
had travelled therein threeſcore dayes journey.
In this wood are many ſorts of wild beaſts,
which are not to be ſeen in any other place:
amongst the reſt, the moſt unuſuall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
are, An Oxe like unto a Hart,
that in the middeſt of his forehead between his
ears carieth a horn longer and ſtraighter then
uſuall, divided at the end into many large
branches, the female is in all reſpects like unto
the male, and beareth a horn of the ſame mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
and faſhion. There is likewiſe another
ſort of beaſts called <hi>Alces,</hi> not unlike unto a
Goat, but ſomewhat bigger, and without horns:
their legs are without joynts, that when they
take their reſt they neither ſit nor lie upon the
ground, and if they chance to fall they cannot
riſe again. When they take their reſt in the
night, they lean against trees. The Hunters
having found out their footſteps and their
haunt, do either undermine the roots of ſuch
trees, or ſo cut them aſunder that a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will overthrow them; ſo that when they
come according unto their uſe to reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt thoſe trees, they overthrow them
with their weight, and fall withall themſelves,
and ſo are taken. The 3. kind of beaſts are thoſe
which are called <hi>Uri,</hi> ſomewhat leſſer then an
Elephant, and in colour, kind and ſhape, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
unto a Bull. They are both ſtrong and ſwift,
and ſpare neither man nor beaſt that cometh
in their ſight: theſe they catch with greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and diligence in pits and ditches, and ſo
kill them. The youth do inure and exerciſe
themſelves in this kind of hunting, and ſuch
as kill many of theſe beaſts, and ſhew moſt
horns, are highly commended: but to make
them tame, or any their litle ones, was never
yet ſeen. The largeneſs of their horns, as alſo
the faſhion and kind thereof, doth much differ
from the horns of the Oxen, and are much
ſought after for cups to be uſed in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
banquets, being firſt bound about the brim
and trimmed with ſilver.</p>

                           <hi>CAeſar</hi> in this Chapter deſcribeth the courſe
of life which the <hi>Germans</hi> in his time held
throughout the whole policy of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the ſcope whereof was to make them war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
to which he ſaith, That in times paſt the
<hi>Galles</hi> were as valiant and as warlike people as
the <hi>Germans;</hi> but the neighbourhood and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of other nations had taught them a more
plentifull manner of life, which by litle and litle
had weakned their ſtrength, and made them far
inferiour to the <hi>Germans.</hi> Which bringeth to
our conſideration that which is often attributed
to a civill life, that ſuch as taſte of the ſweetneſs
of eaſe,<note place="margin">Whether a civill life do weaken a warlike diſpoſition.</note> and are qualified with the complements
of civilitie, have alwayes an indiſpoſition to
warlike practices. The reaſon is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
uſe and cuſtome: for diſcontinuance doth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51174:107"/>
alwayes cauſe a ſtrangeneſſe and alienation,
benumming the apteſt parts with unready and
painfull geſtures; and is ſo powerfull, that it
doth not only ſteal away naturall affection,
and make parents forget to love their children;
but like a tyrant it is able to force us to thoſe
things which naturally we are unfit for, as
though the decrees of nature were ſubject to the
controllment of cuſtome. Much more then,
the things got by uſe and practice, are as eaſily
forgot by diſcontinuance, as they were obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſtudious exerciſe. On the other ſide,
there is nothing ſo horrible or dreadfull, but uſe
maketh eaſy. The firſt time the Fox ſaw the
Lion, he ſwooned for fear, the next time he
trembled, but the third time he was ſo far from
fear, that he was ready to put a trick of craft
upon him: whereby it appeareth, that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had no further intereſt in deeds of arms
above the <hi>Galles,</hi> then what the uſe of war had
gained them: for as uſage continueth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of a tenure, ſo non-uſage implieth a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.
<hi>Cato</hi> was wont to ſay, that the <hi>Romans</hi>
would looſe their Empire, when they ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue to be taught amongſt them:
for by that means they would eaſily be drawn
from the ſtudy and practice of war, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
delight of ſpeculative thoughts. And
<hi>Marcellus</hi> was blamed for being the firſt that
corrupted <hi>Rome</hi> with the delicate and curious
works of <hi>Greece:</hi> for before that he brought
from the ſacking of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> the well-wrought

knew any ſuch delicacy, but ſtood full fraught
with armour and weapons of barbarous people,
of the bloudy ſpoyls and monuments of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and triumphs; which were rather fearfull
ſhews to inure their eyes to the horrour of war,
then pleaſant ſights to allure their minds to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of peace. Whereby it appeareth, that
ſuch as ſuffer themſelves to be guided by the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy

<hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf into ſuch a tumult and confuſion,
that no man knew what way to take for his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for ſuch as were out of <hi>Rome</hi> came flying
thither from all parts, and thoſe on the other ſide
that were in <hi>Rome,</hi> went out as faſt, and forſook
the citie. And the amazement was ſuch, that
<hi>Pompey</hi> and the Senate fled into <hi>Greece,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it happened that <hi>Caeſar</hi> in threeſcore dayes,
was Lord of all <hi>Italy</hi> without any bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this manner of prevention by ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſurprize, we may ſee the like expedition in
the very carriage and form of his wars.<note place="margin">Veni, Vidi, Vici.</note> For
if the enemy had taken the field, he laboured
by all means to bring him to ſight; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
if he refuſed to take the field, he then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
with the like ſpeed to beſiege him or
block him up in ſome hold, to the end he might
bring the matter to a ſpeedy upſhot, as he did
with <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> at <hi>Aleſia.</hi> But that which
is moſt memorable touching this point, at the
firſt taking in of <hi>Spain</hi> in the garboil of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
wars,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. bell. civil.</note> he defeated two armies, overthrew
two Generals, and took in two Provinces in
the ſpace of fourty dayes. Neither did he make
uſe of expedition only in his carriage of a war,
but alſo in the action and execution of battel:
for he never forſook an enemy overthrown and
diſcomfited, untill he had taken their camp,
and defeated them of their chiefeſt helps, which
<hi>Pompey</hi> felt to his utter overthrow; for the
ſame day he routed him at <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> he took
his camp, and incloſed a hill with a ditch and a
rampler, where 25000. <hi>Romans</hi> were fled for
their ſafety, and brought them to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto him: and ſo making uſe (as
he ſaith) of the benefit of fortune, and
the terrour and amazement of the enemy,
he performed three notable ſervices in one
day.</p>
                        <p>And this he uſed with ſuch dexterity and
depth of wiſdome, that commonly the firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory

                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude this point, I may not forget the
like ſpeed and expedition in his works. In
fifteen dayes he caſt a ditch and a rampier of
fifteen foot in height, between the lake at <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
and S. <hi>Claudes</hi> hill,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. bell. civil.</note> containing nineteen
miles. He made his bridge over the <hi>Rhene</hi> in
ten dayes. At the ſiege of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> he made
twelve gallies, and furniſhed them out to ſea
within thirty dayes after the timber was cut
down. And the reſt of his works with the like
expedition.</p>

having examined the matter by the torture of
the captives, commanded them, that if any of
the <hi>Eburones</hi> ſhould flie unto them, to bring
them unto him, and in ſo doing he would ſpare
their countrey. Then dividing his forces into
three parts, he left the baggage of the whole
army at <hi>Vatuca,</hi> a caſtle in the middeſt of the
<hi>Eburones,</hi> where <hi>Titurius</hi> and <hi>Aurunculeius</hi>
were lodged. He made choice of this place the
rather, for that the fortifications made the year

might eaſe the ſouldier of ſome labour; and
there left the fourteenth legion for a guard to
the cariages, being one of the three which he

                     <p>The army being thus divided, he commanded

that he would return after the ſeventh dayes

there left in garriſon. He counſelled <hi>Labie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

                        <p>THis ſudden ſurpriſe upon <hi>Ambiorix</hi> and the

their making head together, and put the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy

And albeit the <hi>Treviri</hi> were by this
means diſperſed, yet they were not overthrown,
nor utterly vanquiſhed, but continued ſtill in
the nature and quality of an enemy, although
they were by this occaſion defeated of their
chiefeſt means. And therefore the better to
proſecute them in their particular ſlights, and to
keep them diſjoyned, he divided his army into
three parts, and made three ſeverall inroads upon
their country, hoping thereby to meet with ſome

concern the ſafety of the whole army: for hope
of booty did draw many far off out of their
ranks, and the woods through uncertain and
unknown paſſages would not ſuffer the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to go in troups. If he would have the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
take an end, and the very race of thoſe
wicked people rooted out, the army muſt be
divided, and many ſmall bands muſt be made
for that purpoſe: but to keep the Maniples at
their enſigns, according to the cuſtome and
uſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> army, the place it ſelf was
a ſufficient guard for the barbarous people,
who did not want courage in particular, both
to lye in wait for them, and circumvent them
as they were ſevered from their companies.
Yet in extremities of that nature what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
could attain unto was provided, but in
ſuch manner, that ſomewhat was omitted in
the offenſive part, though the ſouldiers minds
were bent upon revenge, rather then it ſhould
be done with any detriment or loſſe to the
ſouldier. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent meſſengers to the next

in the wood, then the legionary ſouldiers; as
alſo that there might be many ſpoilers and
deſtroyers, to the end that both the name and
race of that State might be taken away.
Hereupon a great multitude ſpeedily aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
from all quarters. Theſe things were
acted in all parts and quarters of the <hi>Eburones,</hi>
and the ſeventh day drew near which he had

                        <p>IT is a commoditie which a Generall hath,

for ſo he may be ſure that the weight
of the buſineſſe will reſt upon militarie vertue
and proweſs of armes, as ready way-makes to a

the country doth afford covert and protection to
him that is more malicious then valorous, and
through the faſtneſſe of the place refuſeth to
ſhew himſelf unleſſe it be upon advantage, the
war doubtleſſe is like to prove tedious, and the
victory leſſe honourable. In ſuch caſes there is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51174:109"/>
no other way, then ſo to harry and waſt a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that the enemy may be famiſhed out of his
holds, and brought to ſubjection by ſcarcity and
neceſſity. Which is a means ſo powerfull, as
well to ſupplant the greateſt ſtrength, as to meet
with ſubterfuge and delay, that of it ſelf it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth
all oppoſition, and needeth no other help
for atchieving of victory, as may appear by the
ſequele of this ſommers action. And herein let
us further obſerve the particular care which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
had of his ſouldiers, adjudging the whole
army to be intereſſed in every private mans ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
A matter ſtrange in theſe times, and of
ſmall conſequence in the judgement of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
to whom particular fortunes are
eſteemed nonentities, and men in ſeverall of no
value; foraſmuch as conqueſts are made with
multitudes. Concerning which point, I grant
it to be as true, as it is often ſpoken in places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,
that the loſſe of one man is not the loſſe
of a town, nor the defeating of twenty the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of a thouſand: and yet it cannot be
denied but the leſſer is payd for the lawrell
wreath, the more precious is the victory: and it
ſitteth then at a hard rate, when it maketh the
buyer bankerout, or inforceth him to confeſſe
that ſuch another victory would overthrow him.
And therefore he that will buy much honour with
little bloud, muſt endeavour by diligent and
carefull labour to provide for the particular ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his ſouldiers. Wherein albeit he cannot
value, an unity at an equal rate with a number;
yet he muſt conſider that without a unity there
can be no multitude: and not ſo only, but the
life and ſtrength of a multitude conſiſteth in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;
for otherwiſe, neither had <hi>Nero</hi> needed

within the camp, not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſo much as a boy to go out of
the trenches; the ſeventh day diſtruſting of
<hi>Caeſars</hi> return according to his promiſe, for
that he underſtood he was gone further into
the country, and heard nothing of his return;
and withall being moved with the ſpeeches of
the ſouldiers, who termed their patient abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
within their trenches, a ſiege, foraſmuch
as no man was ſuffered to go out of them, and
expecting no ſuch chance within the compaſſe
of three miles: which was the furtheſt; he
purpoſed to ſend them for corn: eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that nine legions were abroad, beſides
great forces of horſe, the enemy being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
diſperſed and almoſt extinguiſhed.
Accordingly he ſent five cohorts to gather
corn in the next fields, which were ſeparated
from the garriſon only with a little hill lying
between the camp and the corn. There were
many left in the camp of the other legions that
were ſick, of whom ſuch as were recovered to
the number of three hundred, were ſent with
them all under one enſign: beſides a great
company of ſouldiers boyes, and great ſtore of
cattel which they had in the camp. In the
mean time came theſe <hi>German</hi> Rutters, and
with the ſame gallop as they came thither,
they ſought to enter in at the Decumane gate;
neither were they diſcovered, by reaſon of a
wood which kept them out of ſight, untill they
were almoſt at the trenches; inſomuch as
ſuch trades-men and merchants as kept their
booths and ſhops under the rampier, had no
time to be received into the camp. Our men
were much troubled at the unexpectedneſſe of
the thing; and the cohort that kept watch did
hardly ſuſtain the firſt aſſault. The enemy
was quickly ſpread about the works, to ſee if
they could find entrance in any other part.
Our men did hardly keep the gates: the reſt
was defended by the fortification and the place
it ſelf. The whole camp was in a great fear,
and one inquired of another the reaſon of the
tumult: neither could they tell which way to
carry their enſigns, or how any man ſhould
diſpoſe of himſelf. One gave out that the
camp was taken; and another that the army
and General was overthrown, and that the
Barbarous people came thither as conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
many took occaſion from the place to
imagine new and ſuperſtitious Religions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling
to mind the fatall calamity of <hi>Cotta</hi>
and <hi>Titurius</hi> that died in that place. Through
this fear and confuſion that had poſſest the
whole camp, the <hi>Germans</hi> were confirmed in
their opinion which they had received from
the priſoner, that there was no garriſon at all
in the works. They endeavoured to break in,
and incouraged one another not to ſuffer ſo
great a fortune to eſcape them. <hi>Publius Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Baculus,</hi> that had been Primipilus under
<hi>Caeſar</hi> (of whom mention hath been made in
the former battels) was there left ſick, and
had taken no ſuſtenance of five dayes before.
He hearing the danger they were in, went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
out of his cabbin, and ſeeing the enemy
ready to force the gates, and the matter to be
in great hazard; taking arms from one that
ſtood next him, he went and ſtood in the port,
The <hi>Centurions</hi> of the Cohort that kept watch
followed him, and they for a while ingaged the
enemy. <hi>Sextius</hi> having received many great
wounds, fainted at length, and was hardly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by thoſe that ſtood next him. Upon this
reſpite the reſt did ſo far aſſure themſelves,
that they durſt ſtand upon the works, and
make a ſhew of defence.</p>

                        <p>IN the former obſervation I diſputed the intereſt
which the whole army hath in one particular
man, which out of <hi>Caeſars</hi> opinion I concluded
to be ſuch as was not to be neglected: but if we

ſuch ſingular worth as was in <hi>Sextius,</hi> I then
doubt by this example, whether I may not equall
him to the multitude, or put him alone in the

it importeth a great Commander, not only in

The ſecond is the faithfull endeavour
in executing ſuch projects, as the rules of warre
do propound for their ſafety. Both which parts
are gotten onely by uſe. For as the knowledge
of Military diſcipline is beſt learned by practiſe;
ſo the often repetition thereof begetteth aſſurance
in action, which is nothing elſe but that which
we call Valour. In which two parts theſe new

It were a hard condition to expoſe a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
party to the malice of an enemy, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
him with the loſs of his ſight. An
army without a guard at any time is merely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and more ſubject to ſlaughter, then thoſe
that never took arms: and the rather where the
watch is wanting, for there ſudden chances can
hardly be prevented: and if they happen to
avoid any ſuch unexpected caſualtie, they have
greater cauſe to thank Fortune for her favour,
then to be angry with her for her malice; for
prevention at ſuch times is out of the way, and
they are wholly at her mercy; as <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath
rightly delivered touching this accident. And
therefore, whether an army march forward or
continue in a place, ſleep or wake, play or work,

were burned to the ground; pillage and booty
was taken in every place; the corn was not

ſome that thought to demerit <hi>Caeſars</hi> higheſt

himſelf away through dens and woods and
dales, and in the night time ſought other
countreys and quarters, with no greater a
guard of horſe then four, to whom only he durſt
commit the ſafety of his life. The countrey
being in this manner harried and depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> with the loſs of two Cohorts,
brought back his army to <hi>Durocortorum</hi> in the

him and his people. The firſt, of ſtrength and
ability; and the other, of quality and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of affection: upon the aſſurance of
which proportion he grounded the auſterity of
his command. For it appeareth that his firſt
beginning was by perſwaſion and intreaty,
and would indure no direction, but that which
was guided by a looſe and eaſy reine; hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it neither ſafe nor ſeemly, but rather a ſtrain
of extreme madneſſe, firſt to puniſh or threaten,
and then to want power to make good his

from themſelves, and backed with an
army able to controll their diſobedience, he
then added puniſhment as the enſign of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy,

                        <p>Touching the reſemblance and proportion

aſſoon as he underſtood that
the matters in the city were by the
wiſdome of <hi>Pompey</hi> brought into
better ſtate, he took his journey into
<hi>Gallia,</hi> and being come thither he was much
troubled how to get to his army. For if he
ſhould ſend for the Legions into the Province,
he underſtood that they ſhould be certainly
fought withall by the way in his abſence. If
he himſelf ſhould go unto them, he doubted
how he might ſafely commit his perſon to any,
although they were ſuch as were yet in peace.
In the mean time <hi>Lucterius</hi> of <hi>Cahors</hi> being
ſent againſt the <hi>Rutheni,</hi> doth eaſily unite
that State to the <hi>Arverni:</hi> and proceeding
further againſt the <hi>Nitiobriges</hi> and the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bali,</hi>
he received hostages of both of them,
and having raiſed a great power, he laboured
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51174:113"/>
to break into the Province, and to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Narbo.</hi> Which being known, <hi>Caeſar</hi>
reſolved by all means to put him by that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and went himſelf to <hi>Narbo.</hi> At his
coming he incouraged ſuch as ſtood doubtfull
or timorous, and placed garriſons amongſt the
<hi>Rutheni,</hi> the <hi>Volſci,</hi> and about <hi>Narbo,</hi> which
were frontier places and near unto the enemy,
and commanded part of the forces which were
in the Province, together with thoſe ſupplies
which he had brought out of <hi>Italy,</hi> to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Helvii,</hi> which are adjoyning upon
the <hi>Arverni.</hi> Things being thus ordered,
<hi>Lucterius</hi> being now ſuppreſſed and removed
holding it to be dangerous to enter among the
garriſons, he himſelf went towards the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vii.</hi>
And albeit the hill <hi>Gebenna,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth
the <hi>Arverni</hi> from the <hi>Helvii,</hi> by reaſon
of the hard time of winter and the depth of
the ſnow, did hinder their paſſage; yet by the
industry of the ſouldier making way through
ſnow of ſix foot deep, they came into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of the <hi>Arverni:</hi> who being ſuddenly and
unawares ſuppreſſed, little mistruſting an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
over the hill <hi>Gebenna,</hi> which incloſeth
them in as a wall, and at that time of the year
doth not afford a path to a ſingle man alone,
he commanded the horſemen to ſcatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
far and near to make the enemy the
more afraid. Theſe things being ſpeedily
carried to <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi> all the <hi>Arverni</hi> full
of fear and amazement flocked about him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
him to have a care of their State, and
not to ſuffer themſelves to be ſacked by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
eſpecially now at this time, when as all
the war was transferred upon them. Upon
their inſtant intreaty he removed his camp
out of the territories of the <hi>Bituriges,</hi> and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
towards the country of the <hi>Arverni.</hi> But
<hi>Caeſar</hi> having continued two dayes in thoſe
places, foraſmuch as he underſtood both by uſe
and opinion, what courſe <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> was
like to take; he left the army, pretending ſome
ſupplies of horſe, which he went to raiſe, and
appointed young <hi>Brutus</hi> to command thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
admoniſhing him to ſend out the horſemen
into all quarters, and that he himſelf would
not be abſent from the camp above three dayes.
Theſe things being thus ſettled, none of his
followers knowing his determination, by great
journeys he came to <hi>Vienna;</hi> where taking
freſh horſe, which he had layd there many
dayes before, he ceaſed neither night nor day,
untill he came through the confines of the <hi>Hedui</hi>
to the <hi>Lingones,</hi> where two legions wintered:
to the end if the <hi>Hedui</hi> ſhould undertake any

was perplexed how to get to his army: and
the matter ſtood in ſuch terms, as brought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the legions or his own perſon into hazard.
For (as he ſaith) if he ſhould ſend for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
to come unto him, they ſhould doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
be fought withall by the way, which he
was loath to adventure, unleſſe himſelf had

of the revolting <hi>Galles,</hi> and might have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
his army, by the loſſe of his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
In this extremity of choice, he reſolved
upon his own paſſage to the army, as leſſe
dangerous and more honourable, rather then to
call the legions out of their wintering camps,
where they ſtood as a check to bridle the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the mutinous <hi>Galles,</hi> and ſo to bring
them to the hazard of battel in fetching their
Generall into the field: whereby he might have
loſt the victory before he had begun the wars.
And for his better ſafety in this paſſage, he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this cunning. Having aſſured the <hi>Roman</hi>

<hi>Carbo</hi> ſpake it to the commendation of <hi>Sylla,</hi>
that he had to do both with a Lion and a Fox,
but he feared more his Foxes pate then his Lions
skin. It is reported that <hi>Anniball</hi> excelled
all other of his time for abuſing the enemy in
matter of ſtratageme, for he never made fight but
with an addition of aſſiſtants, ſupporting force
with art, and the fury of armes with the ſubtiltie

                        <p>Of late time amongſt other practiſes of this
nature, the treaty at <hi>Oſtend</hi> is moſt memorable,

                        <p>In theſe foiles and tricks of wit, which at all

in men of warre, as ſpeciall vertues beſeeming
the condition of a great Commander, if it be

abuſing an enemy by deeds or words; I cannot
ſpeak diſtinctly to the queſtion: but ſure I am,
that <hi>Surena,</hi> Lieutenant generall of the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

<hi>Craſſus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall by fair promiſes;

encourage them to continue loyall, and nobly to
reſiſt the aſſaults of the enemy: and leaving
two Legions with the carriages of the whole

it about with a ditch and a rampier. The

much perplexed, whether he ſhould forbear to

the hazard of long and tedious convoyes. A
matter often falling into diſpute, although it be
in other terms, whether honeſty or honourable
reſpect ought to be preferred before private eaſe
and particular commodity. <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himſelf touching this point, preferring the
honour of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the majeſty of
their Empire, and the reputation which they
deſired to hold, touching aſſiſtance and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their friends, before any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which might happen to their army. And
not without good reaſons, which may be drawn
as well from the worthineſs of the cauſe, as from
the danger of the effect: for duties of vertue and
reſpects of honeſty, as the nobleſt parts of the
mind, do not onely challenge the ſervice of the
inferiour faculties of the ſoul; but do alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the body and the caſaulties thereof, in

choſe rather to adventure the army upon the

the <hi>Roman</hi> name with the infamy of diſloyalty.
Which was leſs dangerous alſo in regard of the
effect: for where the bond is of value, there the
forfeiture is great: and if that tie had been broken,
and their opinion deceived touching the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation

have had juſt cauſe of revolt, and diſclaimed the

given, while the reſt were in delivering over,
divers Centurions and a few ſouldiers being
admitted into the town, to ſeek out their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
and their horſes, the horſemen of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

took up a ſhout, and betook themſelves to their

perceiving ſome new reſolution of the <hi>Galles,</hi>
with their ſwords drawn poſſeſt themſelves of

men that were in the town. <hi>Caeſar</hi> commanded

charged the enemy with ſuch fury, that the
<hi>Galles</hi> could no way endure the aſſault, but
were preſently put to flight; and many of them

Upon their overthrow, the townſmen were

                        <p>The practiſe of the <hi>Romans</hi> in taking in any

they might ſtand affected, their nails ſhould
be ſurely paied for ſcratching, and their power
confined to the circuit of their mind. For as it
appeareth by this and many other places of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
no rendry of any town was accepted, untill
they had delivered all their arms, both offenſive

of warre as might any way make for the
defence of the ſame. Neither that onely, but
ſuch beaſts alſo, whether Horſe or Elephant, or
any other whatſoever, as might any way advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the uſe of thoſe weapons. Which as it was
a great diſmay and weakning to the enemy; ſo
was it ſhort of the third condition, commanding
the delivery of ſo many hoſtages or pledges as
were thought convenient, being the prime of
their youth, and the flower of their manhood,
and were as the marrow to their bones, and the
ſinewes to that body. Whereby it came to paſs,
that the remnant was much diſabled in ſtrength,
concerning their number of fighting men; and
ſuch as were left had neither arms nor means to
make reſiſtance.</p>

                        <p>Oftentimes we reade, that a conquered peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

were made and wrought: for where the people

he calleth his men to councel,
and telleth them that the war must be carried
in another courſe then it hath been heretofore;
for they muſt endeavour by all means to keep
the <hi>Romans</hi> from forrage and convoy of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall:
which would eaſily be brought to paſs,
foraſmuch as they themſelves did abound in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51174:115"/>
horſemen: and for that the time of the year
did not yet ſerve to get forrage in the field, the
enemy muſt neceſſarily ſeek it in houſes and
barns, whereby the forragers would dayly be
cut off by their horſemen. Moreover, for their
ſafety and defence they were to neglect their
private commoditie: their houſes and their
villages were to be burnt up round about as far
as <hi>Boia,</hi> whereſoever the <hi>Romans</hi> might go to
fetch their forrage. For themſelves they
thought it reaſon that they ſhould make ſupply
of victuall and proviſion, in whoſe poſſeſſions
they were, and for whom they fought. By this
means the <hi>Rom.</hi> would never be able to endure
that want as would befall them, or at the leaſt
be constrained to fetch their proviſions farre
off, with great danger and perill to themſelves:
neither did it make any matter whether they
killed them or put them beſides their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages;
for without neceſſary ſupplies they were
never able to hold war. And to conclude, ſuch
towns were likewiſe to be ſet on fire, as by the
ſtrength of their ſituation were not ſafe from
danger, leſt they ſhould prove receptacles to
linger and detract the warre, and ſerve the
<hi>Romans</hi> for booty and ſupplies of proviſion.
And albeit theſe things might ſeem heavie and
bitter; yet they ought to eſteem it more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to have their wives and their children
led away into ſervitude, and themſelves to be
ſlain by the ſword of the enemy: which doth
neceſſarily fall upon a conquered people. This
opinion was generally approved by the conſent
of all men, and more then twenty cities of the
<hi>Bituriges</hi> were burnt in one day: the like was
done in other States, great fires were to be
ſeen in all parts. And although all men took
it very grievouſly, yet they propounded this
comfort unto themſelves, that the enemy being
by this means defeated, they ſhould quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their loſſes. Touching <hi>Avaricum</hi> they
diſputed it in common councel, whether it
ſhould be burnt or defended. The <hi>Bituriges</hi> do
prostrate themſelves at the feet of all the
<hi>Galles,</hi> that they might not be forced to ſet on
fire with their own hands, the faireſt citie in

which was not ſhut in with the river nor the bog,
and afforded but a narrow and ſtreight paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
began to make a mount, to drive vines,
and to raiſe two towers; (for the nature of
the place would not ſuffer him to incloſe it
round about with a ditch and a rampier;) and
never reſted to admoniſh the <hi>Hedui</hi> and the
<hi>Boii</hi> to bring in ſupplies of corn: of whom the
one, by reaſon of the ſmall care and pains they
took, did little help him; the other, of no great
ability, being a ſmall and a weak State, did
quickly conſume all that they had. The army
was diſtreſſed for want of corn, by reaſon of
the poverty of the <hi>Boii,</hi> and the indiligence of
the <hi>Hedui,</hi> together with the burning of the
houſes in the country, in ſuch manner as they
wanted corn for many dayes together, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
their lives with beaſts and cattell which
they had fetched a great way off: and yet no
one voice at all was heard to come from them,
unworthy the majeſty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
and their former victories. And whenas <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
did ſpeak unto the legions ſeverally as they
were in the works, that if their wants were
heavy and bitter unto them, he would leave off
the ſiege; all of them with one voice deſired
him not to do ſo, for ſince they had ſo ſerv'd many
years under his command, as they never had
received any diſhonour, neither had they at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time departed and left the buſineſſe undone;
it would be imputed unto them as an ignominy
and diſgrace to leave this ſiege; and that they
had rather undergo all difficulties, then not to
revenge the death of the citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> that
by treachery were ſlain at <hi>Genabum.</hi> The
ſame ſpeeches they delivered to the Centurions

Some <hi>Italian</hi> writers are of an opinion,<note place="margin">Boteras di Principe.</note> that
the two chiefeſt parts of a ſouldier, Valour and
Sufferance, are in theſe times divided unto two
nations, the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
making war rather by ſufferance then by
violence of aſſaults; and the <hi>French</hi> impatient
of delay, and furious in aſſaults: ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his opinion, a <hi>Spaniard</hi> &amp; a <hi>French</hi>-man
will make one good ſouldier. Touching
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> I cannot deny but that he hath
the name of one of the beſt ſouldiers in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and I do gladly allow all that vertue can
challenge, for truth will prevail againſt all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
yet I may ſay thus much on the behalf
of our own people, that we have ſeldome loſt
honour in confronting any nation. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſufferance, and patient induring of
hardneſſe, which is ſaid to be in the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
being able to live long with a little, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
not unfitly be attributed to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their country, and the nature of their cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
which will not bear nor digeſt ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of food, as is required in colder countries:
and thereupon being born to ſo weak a digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they are as well ſatisfied with a root or a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
as others with better plenty of food; and
therein they goe beyond other Nations. Of

the horſemen, to lye in ambuſh in that
place where he thought our men would come a
forraging the next day. Which being known,
ſetting forward about midnight in ſilence, in
the morning he came to the enemies camp.
They having ſpeedy advertiſement by their
ſcouts of <hi>Caeſars</hi> coming, did hide their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
in the woods, and imbattelled all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in an eminent and open place. Which being
told <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he commanded the baggage to be
ſpeedily laid together, and their arms to be
made ready. There was a hill of a gentle ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
from the bottome to the top, incompaſſed
round about with a difficult and troubleſome
bog of fifty foot in breadth. Upon this hill, the
bridge being broken, the <hi>Galles</hi> kept themſelves,
truſting to the ſtrength of the place, and being
diſtributed into companies according to their
ſeverall States, they kept all the fords and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of the bog with watches, with this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that if the <hi>Romans</hi> did paſſe over the bog,
they might eaſily from the higher ground keep
them under, as they ſtuck in the mire, who
little reckoning of ſo ſmall a diſtance, would
deem the fight to be upon equall terms, whereas
they themſelves well knowing the inequality of
the condition, did make but a vain and idle
oſtentation. The ſouldiers diſdaining that
the enemy could endure their preſence ſo near
at hand, and requiring the ſign of battel, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
acquainted them with what detriment and
loſſe of many valiant men, the victory muſt at

they refuſed no danger to purchaſe him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
he might well be condemned of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
and villany, if their lives were not
dearer unto him then his own ſafety: and ſo
comforting the ſouldiers, he brought them
back again the ſame day into the camp, and
gave order for ſuch things as were requiſite for

                        <p>THis Chapter hath divers ſpeciall particulars
worthy obſervation. The firſt is, the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51174:116"/>
which <hi>Caeſar</hi> took to viſite the army of
the <hi>Galles,</hi> when <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> was abſent and
gone to lie in ambuſh for the <hi>Roman</hi> forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
which was a caveat to <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi>
not to be too buſie with the <hi>Roman</hi> convoyes,
leſt his abſence might draw on ſuch an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
as might make him repent for going
a birding.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, the inequality which the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the place giveth to a party: which I have
already ſo often ſpoken of, as I am almoſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to repeat it; and the rather, for that I have
produced this paſſage in the former book, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the benefit of ſuch an advantage. Yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as it is ſo pregnant to that effect, as may
well deſerve a double conſideration, and was
alſo produced by <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf upon occaſion
at <hi>Gergovia,</hi> give me leave to note how much it
ſwayeth to counterpoiſe the want of the adverſe
party. Wherein as it cannot be denied, but that
it may give ſuch help as may make a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
equall a farre greater proportion of men; ſo
in <hi>Caeſars</hi> judgement it countervaileth the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Generall,<note place="margin">The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the place doth countervail the abſence of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> and maketh the body per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
without the head. Neither were they weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
onely with the abſence of their Generall;
but their cavalry wherein they ſo much truſted
was abſent likewiſe; and yet more then that too,
by how much the <hi>Roman</hi> legions excelled the
<hi>Galles</hi> in valour and proweſs of arms: which
being all put together is no ſmall advantage.
For doubtleſs if the matter had ſtood upon equal
tearms touching the place, neither the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi> nor the addition of
their cavalry to aſſiſt them, had hindered the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
or turned the <hi>Romans</hi> back to their camp.</p>
                        <p>The third thing is, the moderation which he
ſhewed, forbearing to fight, the <hi>Galles</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
vaunting, and the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and diſdaining the enemies pride: whereby
he ſettled ſuch a confidence of his directions in
the minds of his men, by ſhunning the perill of
apparent danger which might fall upon them in
particular, as afterwards they would make no
queſtion of his commands, but take them as the
onely means of their ſafetie, being never better
aſſured then in performing what he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The practice of later times hath not ſo well
deſerved of that vertue, but hath often ſhewed it
ſelf more prodigall of bloud, as though men
were made onely to fill up ditches, and to be the
wofull executioners of other mens raſhneſs.</p>
                        <p>The laſt thing is, the making ready of their
weapons, <hi>arma expediri iuſſit.</hi> Concerning
which point, we muſt underſtand that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
alwayes carried their targets in caſes, and
did hang their helmets at their backs, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their piles as might be moſt convenient with
the reſt of their carriages. And therefore when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they were to give battel, they were firſt to
put on their helmets, to uncaſe their targets,
to fit their piles, and to make them ready for
the charge: and this was called <hi>Arma ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedire.</hi>

he removed the camp for want of forrage, they
themſelves deſiring it. He came near unto
the <hi>Romans,</hi> being led thereunto by the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of the place, which was ſuch as might
defend it ſelf by its own ſtrength; the cavalry
was of no uſe in a boggy place, but might do
good ſervice there where it went. He left no
man to command the army of purpoſe, leſt
by the perſwaſion of the multitude he ſhould be
forced to fight, which he knew they all deſired,
as not able long to endure any labour. If the
<hi>Romans</hi> came by chance, they were to thank
fortune; if by any mans direction, they were
beholding unto him that had brought them,
where they might from the higher ground
both ſee how ſmall a number they were, and
contemn their valour; who not daring to
fight, did ſhamefully return into their camp.
He deſired to receive no imperiall dignity by
treachery from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which he might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have by lawfull victory, which was now
moſt certain and ſure, both to himſelf and the
rest of the <hi>Galles.</hi> And for that authority
which he had received from them, he was
ready to give it up into their hands again, if
they thought the honour which they gave him
to be greater then the help and ſafety which
they received from him. And to the end you
may underſtand theſe things to be truly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by me, (ſaith he) hear the <hi>Roman</hi> ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
And therewithall he brought forth
ſervants which were taken forraging a few
dayes before, miſerably tormented with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and irons. They being taught before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
what to anſwer, ſaid they were legionary
ſouldiers, and had stole out of the camp to ſee
if they could meet with any corn or cattel in the
fields: the whole army ſuffered the like penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and mens ſtrength began to fail them, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51174:117"/>
much that they were not able to undergo any
labour: and therefore their Generall had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
that if he prevailed not againſt the
Town, he would withdraw his army within
three dayes. Theſe benefits (ſaith <hi>Vercinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torix)</hi>
you have of me, whom you accuſe of
treaſon: for by my means without ſhedding
of your bloud, you ſee ſo great a conquering
army almoſt conſumed with hunger; and by
me it is provided, that when they fly from
hence, no State ſhall receive them into their
territories. The whole multitude applauded
his ſpeech, by ſhaking and ſtriking their hands
together, as their manner is in ſuch caſes,
commending <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> for a great ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whoſe loyalty as it was not to be diſtruſted,
ſo the war could not have been carried with
better directions. They agreed further to ſend
10000 choiſe men out of all their forces into
the town, as not thinking it fit to commit the

and make any thing which they ſee other
men do before them: for they turned aſide the
hooks with ropes, and drew them into the town
with engines: they withdrew the earth from
the Mount with Mines with their great
skill, by reaſon of their iron mines wherein
they are much practiſed: they ſet up towers
upon every part of the wall, and covered them
with raw hides: they ſallied out of the town
night and day, and either ſet fire to the
Mount, or aſſaulted the ſouldiers as they were
at work: they did every day make their towers
equal to that height of our towers, which the
daily increaſe of the Mount had added to their
height: they hindred the open trenches, and
kept them from approaching the walls with
ſharp burned ſtakes, caſt into them with hot
pitch and with great ſtones. All their walls
are almoſt of this faſhion: Long ſtrait beams
are placed upon the ground, with an equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

together on the inſide of the wall, and fastned
with great ſtore of earth: the distances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

another ſuch a courſe is laid upon that, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwayes the ſame distance, ſo as one beam

it is a work not deformed either in ſhew or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
obſerving alternate courſes of beams
and ſtones which keep their order by even lines;
ſo is it profitable alſo and very much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taging

keeps it from burning, ſo doth the wood from
the violence of the ramme, foraſmuch as the

the means which the defendant had to fruſtrate
the aſſaults and approaches of the enemy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Ram which the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed to ſhake
and overthrow the wall, (whereof I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſpoken) they had commonly great hooks of
iron to catch hold of a turret, and to pull it over
the wall, or to pull down the parapet, or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
any work which was to be made upon the
wall. Theſe hooks were uſed by the legionary
ſouldiers, being covered with vines in the ſame
manner as they handled the Ram: and were
averted and put off by the ingenious practiſes of
the <hi>Galles,</hi> with ropes caſt and inſnared about
them, and then by force of engines drawn into
the town. In like manner the open trenches,
by which the <hi>Romans</hi> made their approaches to
the wall, were anſwered from the town with
ſtakes or piles, hardned at the end with fire, and
then caſt into them to hinder ſuch as were at
work, together with ſeething pitch and great
ſtones. Furthermore, as the <hi>Romans</hi> raiſed their
Mount, and brought matter unto it to enlarge
it in breadth and height, ſo did the <hi>Galles</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
it, and drew the earth away, or ſet it
on fire to burn it: for as I have already noted
in the deſcription of a mount, it was made as
well with wood and timber, as with earth and
ſtones. They ſtrengthened their walls with
turrets and towers, and covered them with raw
hides to keep them from burning: and as the
<hi>Romans</hi> mounted in height with their turrets
and engines, ſo the <hi>Galles</hi> raiſed their towers
anſwerable unto them, that in the defence of

as the old manner of fortification is here
in part delivered by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> give me leave to have
a word or two touching the fortifications of theſe
times.</p>
                        <p>And firſt touching the art it ſelf,<note place="margin">Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion defined.</note> in reſpect
of the matter and the manner, it is a member
of architecture, but the end is military: for to
fortify is nothing elſe but to make a building
anſwerable to neceſſity and the occurrences of
war. Neither is it the end of fortification to
make a place inexpugnable, or unpoſſible to be
taken, for ſo it were <hi>Ars artium,</hi> but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to a good and reaſonable defence.</p>
                        <p>Whereſoever then any ſuch defence is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the myſtery of fortification is to raiſe ſuch
a fort, and to apply ſuch a figure, anſwering the
quality and ſite of that place, as may give great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſtrength thereunto: for as all places are not
capable in the diſpoſition of their beſt ſtrength
of all ſorts of figures, ſo there is a difference of
ſtrength between this and that figure. And as
the place wanteth the advantage of motion and
agility for its own defence, ſo is it requiſite it
ſhould be furniſhed with the beſt means and
commodities both to annoy the enemy, and to
defend its own people.<note place="margin">Circular forts.</note> And in that reſpect all
circular forms, as compounded of parts of one
and the ſame nature, are unfit for fortification:
for where a fort ought ſo to be diſpoſed, that it
may have as many hands to ſtrike as <hi>Briar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and as a <hi>Hydra</hi> never to want a head, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the figure thereof be of different and
unlike parts, as apt to work divers effects. For
unleſſe it be able to diſcover a far off, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the country about as far as the artillery
will play, to ſtop the paſſages, to hinder ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and aſſaults, to damnify the enemy at
hand and far off, ſometimes with the artillery,
ſometimes with ſmall ſhot, ſometimes with fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
and other times by ſallies, it hath not that
perfection as is requiſite.</p>
                        <p>Admitting therefore compoſition of parts,<note place="margin">Triangular forts.</note>
next unto the circle the triangular fortreſſe is
moſt unperfect; firſt in regard it is a figure of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51174:118"/>
leſſe capacity then any other of equall bounds,
which is a great inconvenience in a hold, when
the ſouldiers ſhall be pinn'd up for want of room,
and through the ſtraightneſſe of the place, not
to be able to avoid confuſion. Secondly, the
bulwarks of all ſuch triangular fortreſſes, have
alwayes ſuch ſharp cantons as are eaſily ſubject
to breaking, which giveth the enemy means to
approach them without diſturbance from the
fort.</p>
                        <p>The quadrangle fortreſſe hath almoſt the

diſadvantages are, that it is not in our choice to
make it in the beſt form of ſtrength, but muſt
give it ſuch a figure as may beſt fit the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſometimes too large and ſpacious, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
too ſtrait. The enemies artillery hath
greater force againſt it playing upward, and the
artillery of the fort playeth not ſo ſure down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

all the time with cold and
continuall rain, yet they overcame
all theſe lets with continuall labour,
and in five and twenty dayes they raiſed a
mount of three hundred and thirty foot in
breadth, and fourſcore in height. When it
came almost to touch the wall, <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf
attending the work, as his cuſtome was, and
encouraging the ſouldiers to omit no time from
the ſame: a little before the third watch of the
night, the mount was ſeen to ſmoak, the enemy
having ſet it on fire with a mine. And at the
ſame inſtant of time, a ſhout being taken up by
them that ſtood upon the wall, they made a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out at two gates on both ſides the towers.
Some caſt firebrands and dry matter from the
wall unto the mount, pouring pitch and other
things to nouriſh the fire; that no man knew
whither to run firſt, or where to give help.
Notwithſtanding foraſmuch as <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
two legions by turn to watch before the
camp, and two other to follow the works, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
and that quickly, that ſome were ready
to confront the ſallies, and others to draw back
the towers from the front of the mount, and to
cut the mount aſunder, the whole multitude
coming out of the camp to quench the fire.
The rest of the night being now ſpent, the
fight continued every where, and ever the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
took new ſpirits, and had hope of victory,
the rather becauſe they ſaw the ſheds or hovels
belonging to the towers burnt, and that the
ſouldiers could not come near the ſaid towers
to manage them as was fitting, without ſhelter
and covert, and that they ever ſent freſh men
to take the rooms of ſuch as were weary and
over-laboured: ſuppoſing the ſafety of all
<hi>Gallia</hi> to conſiſt in that inſtant of time. There
happened, our ſelves beholding it, an accident
worthy memory, which I think not fit to omit.
A certain <hi>Gall</hi> before the gate of the town,
caſting with his hands balls of tallow and pitch
to increaſe the fire, right over againſt the
tower, was ſhot through the right ſide with a
croſ-bow, and fell down dead. One that ſtood
next him ſtept over him, and began to do the
like ſervice: he likewiſe was ſlain with a ſhot
out of a croſ-bow. Him a third man ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded;
and the third, a fourth. Neither was
the place forſaken, untill the mount was
quenched, the enemy removed, and the fight
ceaſed.</p>

                        <head>THE FIRST OBSERVATION.</head>
                        <p>IT were a matter worthy obſervation to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">Whether there need not as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men to defend a town, as to beſiege it.</note>
whether there need not as many men to
defend a town, as to beſiege it. Which at the
firſt ſight may peradventure ſeem frivolous:
foraſmuch as the defendants are but to make
good the place which they hold, and to ſtand
only upon their defenſive guard, having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the place, the ſhelter of the walls, the
ſtrength of the ditch, and many other like helps
for their defence and ſafety; whereas the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailant
is to ſtrive againſt all theſe advantages,
and to oppoſe himſelf to the danger of ſo many
difficulties. But if we look a little nearer into
the matter, and conſider the ſervice to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
on either part, we ſhall find, that to ſay,
As many men are neceſſary to defend a town as
to beſiege it, is no Paradox.</p>
                        <p>For the better underſtanding thereof,<note place="margin">The defence of a town conſiſteth in four points.</note> we are
to know, that the defence of a town touching
matter of fight, conſiſteth chiefly in theſe four
points. Firſt, in manning and making good
all parts of the wall. For if the defendant be
not able to ſtrengthen all parts with a competent
force, then he hath not men enough to defend
the town; foraſmuch as all parts are ſubject to
aſſault, and what part ſoever is not made good,
that lieth open to an enemy: or otherwiſe if the
aſſault be only to be made at a breach, the reſt of
the wall being ſtrong enough to defend it ſelf,
there is required a competent ſtrength within
the town to defend that breach. In this point
there is little difference touching a competent
number of men between the aſſailant and the
defendant: for if he that layeth ſiege to a town
hath men enough to aſſault all parts at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
the enemy muſt have an anſwerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to defend all; or if he have no uſe of
more men then may ſerve to give an aſſault
at a breach, the defendant muſt have the like
proportion for the defence of the breach.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond point is, in relieving wearied
men, either fighting or working, with freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to continue that buſineſſe, as oftentimes it
falleth out in the ſiege of a town. Wherein
likewiſe there is ſmall or no difference touching
an equality between both parties. For if the
defendant be not as well able to relieve his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſouldiers with freſh ſupplies, as the enemy
is to continue the aſſault, the town may quickly
have a new maſter.</p>
                        <p>The third point is, in defeating and making
void ſuch works as the enemy ſhall make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the town, as mounts, mines, approaches,
and ſuch like inconveniences; which being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to go on without oppoſition and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the town cannot hold out long. In this
point the defendant hath the diſadvantage, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
need of more men to overthrow and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the works, then the aſſailant hath to make
them good. For there he that beſiegeth the
place fighteth with the advantage, and hath the
ſame helps as the defendant hath in the faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his hold: which cauſed this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
accident, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> noteth, touching
the ſucceſſive ſlaughter of ſo many <hi>Galles,</hi> who
labouring to burn the <hi>Roman</hi> works with
balls of tallow and pitch, were all ſlain with the
blow of one mans bow.</p>
                        <p>The laſt point is in ſallies, which is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the defence of a town as any thing elſe
whatſoever. For if the defendant be not able
to ſally out, the enemy will quickly coop him
up, and tread upon his belly. And herein the
defendant needeth more men then the aſſailant.
For he that is in the field, lyeth in the ſtrength
of his trenches; whereas the other cometh out
naked upon him.</p>
                        <p>And thus much touching this queſtion in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
Concerning the generall, if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
whether there have been more men loſt
in the defence of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> then in beſieging it;
I anſwer, That neither ſide can much vaunt of a

The next day <hi>Caeſar</hi> having advanced forward
the tower, and perfected thoſe works which

to fall a great rain, which he thought to
be a fit occaſion for his purpoſe. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch

his men to work fair and ſoftly, and

the ſweetneſs of victory for their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
labours; he provided a reward for ſuch
as were ſeen firſt upon the walls, and gave
them the ſigne to begin. The ſouldiers fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuddenly out of all parts, did quickly
poſſeſs themſelves of the walls. The enemie
being frighted with ſo ſudden an accident, and
put from the towers and walles, imbattelled
themſelves angle-wiſe in the market-place, and
in other ſpacious ſtreets of the citie, with this
reſolution, that if they were aſſaulted in any
part, they would reſiſt in form of battell. But
when they ſaw no man to deſcend on even
ground, but to incloſe them round about upon
the wall, fearing lest there would be no way to
eſcape, they caſt their armes away, and fled all
to the furtheſt part of the town. Part of them
ſticking in a throng at the gate, were there ſlain
by the ſouldiers; and part being got out of the
gate, were ſlain by the horſemen. Neither was
there any man that looked after pillage,
but being moved to anger with the ſlaughter
of our men at <hi>Genabum,</hi> and with the travell
and labour of thoſe great workes, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpared old men, women nor children. In
the end, of all that number, which was about
fourty thouſand, ſcarce eight hundred (that
upon the firſt noiſe forſook the town) came
ſafe to <hi>Vercingetorix.</hi> Theſe he received with
great ſilence, being now farre in the night, leſt
any ſedition ſhould have grown in the camp,
through the pity and commiſeration of the
vulgar people; and ſent out his familiar friends
and chiefeſt men of each State to meet ſuch as
had eſcaped away, and to bring them to their
own people as they lay quartered in the camp.</p>

                        <p>WE may ſee here the ſaying verified touching
the diſpoſition of the <hi>Galles</hi> for matter of
valour:<note place="margin">The Galles in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning are more then men, and in the end leſs then wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> which in the beginning ſeemed ſo great,
that it needed no further ſtrain to countervail
the worth of <hi>Caeſars</hi> army, and was expreſſed
with ſuch induſtry and reſolution, both in ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diſappointing the <hi>Roman</hi> works, as alſo
by ingenious fortifying and making good their
own labours; that a man would have deemed
them <hi>virtute pares,</hi> equall in valour. But being
a little ſpent in the action, like a pot that hath a
mouth as big as the belly, and powreth out all
the liquor at an inſtant, they fell at length to
that baſeneſs, as ſhewed leſs ſpirit then the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
did, who choſe rather to betray their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
purpoſes to the enemy, then to hazard
their lives by eſcaping to <hi>Vercingetorix.</hi> And
this is that which is ſo often noted by Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers;
<hi>Quod multa bella impetu valida per
taedia &amp; moras evanuere:</hi> That many warrs
which are hot at the firſt, ſlacken and vaniſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a tedious continuance. The firſt thing that
I obſerve, is, that which <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf noteth:
<hi>Quod plerumque in ſummo periculo, timor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordiam
non recipit;</hi> That uſually in caſe
of extreme danger, fear hath no mercy. Which
was true on either ſide. For the <hi>Galles</hi> were ſo
ſet upon flying to <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi> that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
not the wofull laments of the women
and children, whom they were well content
to hazard, whileſt they themſelves might eſcape
in ſafety. And on the other ſide, the women
did forget to be pitifull to their husbands, whom
they would not ſuffer to eſcape, and leave them
in their weakneſs behind as a prey to appeaſe
the wrath of the bloudy ſouldier, which would
conſequently follow in that eſcape. Which
ſheweth, that there is notice comparable to the
bond of nature, ſpecially when it concerneth the
preſervation of life. For as in other things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and affection may eaſily work a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of good things unto others, as alſo a
participation of their evils for their relief: ſo
herein we are altogether ſenſeleſs, and the love
we owe to our lives is ſo great, that it admitteth
no reſpect. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to his friend was without
reſpect a friend: and yet notwithſtanding being
driven one day to remove upon the ſudden, and
to leave one ſick behind him whom he loved
dearly; the ſick man calling him by his name
as he was going away, beſought him that he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51174:119"/>
would not forſake him. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> turning
back again, anſwered; O how hard it is both to

                        <p>And as it ſeemeth, it was the more carefully
handled in reſpect of the condition of the enemy
being revolters: for ſuch Provinces as have
rebelled, are harder to be recovered after their
revolt, then they were at firſt to be ſubdued. For
at the firſt, they have no occaſion to fear any
hard condition, but yielding to ſubjection do
look for favour: whereas rebels and revolters,
beſides the condition of an enemy, are in the
nature of offenders, and ſtand in fear of the

they brake the arrowes ſticking in them. Again,
ſtriving by force to pluck out the barbed heads,
that had pierced farre into their bodies through
their veins and ſinews, they opened the wounds
wider, and ſo caſt themſelves away.</p>
                        <p>The diſorder or routing of an enemy which
is cauſed by the bow-men, cometh from the
fearfull ſpectacle of a drift of arrowes: for a

for a while is ſo terrible to the eye, and
ſo dreadfull in the ſucceſs, that it is almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible

                        <p>The two great victories which our Nation
had in <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Creſſie</hi> and <hi>Agincourt,</hi> next
to the valour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> are attributed to our
archery: and the effect of our archery at thoſe
times, was firſt diſorder, and conſequently
ſlaughter.<note place="margin">The battell of Creſſie.</note> In the battell of <hi>Creſſie</hi> the King of

the galling which he feared from
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> archery: but it fell out as ill as if he
had tied their heads and their tails together in
file; for the drift of arrowes fell ſo terribly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, that they ran together on heaps
with ſuch confuſion, as made the ſlaughter
great, and their particular deſtinies moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

to ſpeak of; for ſome report that many of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> had ten priſoners apiece: which hapned
chiefly from the diſorder which fell amongſt the
<hi>French,</hi> and that diſorder came by our archery.
And doubtleſs if ever we ſhould have occaſion
to go againſt an enemy that ſo aboundeth in

I know it hath been ſaid, that now the

are ſo generally received, and of ſuch reputation
in the courſe of our modern wars, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon

the uſe of either of theſe weapons, as
knowing them to be both very ſerviceable upon

available againſt an enemy, as well in ſuch
arrowes as do not hit, as in ſuch as do hit: for
whereas the cloud of arrowes is ſubject to our
ſight, and every arrow is both ſuſpected and
able to bring death ſitting on the head, an enemy
is as much troubled at ſuch arrows as come fair
upon him and do not hit, as at thoſe that do hit;
for no man is willing to expoſe his fleſh to an

the enemy doth hardly eſcape diſorder, which
is the greateſt diſadvantage that can befall him.
Moreover, the arrowes having barbed heads, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they make but a light hurt, yet they are
not eaſily pulled out, which maketh the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
not to intend the fight untill they be delivered

them, and aſſiſt their State in a time of great
need, the matter being in extreme danger:
foraſmuch as their ancient uſage was for one
to be created their annuall Magiſtrate, having
regall authority for that year; whereas now
two had taken upon them the ſaid office, both of

bridges which <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> had commanded
to be broken. The next day he kept himſelf

them to go on as far as they could;
and making conjecture by the time of the day,
that they were come to their camping-place,
upon the ſame piles, (the lower part whereof
remained there whole) he began to reedify the

made a very terrible ſhew into all parts where

did he omit any day to skirmiſh with his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

put by the garriſon, poſſeſſed himſelf of the

all our horſemen and our Nobility are
ſlain, the Princes of our State, <hi>Eporedorix</hi> and
<hi>Viridomarus,</hi> being falſly accuſed of treaſon,
are put to death by the <hi>Romans</hi> without calling

from them that are eſcaped from the ſlaughter:
for I my ſelf (my brethren and kinſmen being
ſlain) am hindred with grief from telling you
what hath happened. Preſently thoſe were
brought forth, whom he had taught beforehand

ſpoken: that all the horſemen of the <hi>Hedui</hi> were
ſlain, foraſmuch as they were ſaid to have had
ſpeech with the <hi>Arverni:</hi> for themſelves they
were hid amongst the multitude of ſouldiers,
and were eſcaped out of the midst of the
ſlaughter. The <hi>Hedui</hi> cry out all together, and
do beſeech <hi>Litavicus</hi> to look to himſelf, and to
them alſo. As though (ſaith he) the matter
needeth any advice or counſell, and that it were
not neceſſary for us to go directly to <hi>Gergovia,</hi>
and to joyn our ſelves with the <hi>Arverni.</hi> For do
we doubt, but that the <hi>Romans,</hi> having begun
ſo wickedly, will run preſently upon us to take
away our lives? And therefore if there be any
courage at all in us, let us perſecute their death
that have periſhed ſo undeſervedly, and let us
kill theſe thieves. He ſhewed them divers
<hi>Roman</hi> citizens that were in the troups for
ſafety of convoy: and forthwith he ſeized upon
a great quantity of corn and other proviſions,
and tortured them cruelly to death. He ſent
out meſſengers throughout all the State of the

touching the ſlaughter of the horſemen, and the

odious and deteſtable, that vertue grieveth to
think that a man ſhould be capable of any ſuch

Ingratitude is culpable of all ſorts of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

by him. Between theſe two there was alwayes
contention who ſhould be the chiefeſt, and in

for <hi>Convictolitanis,</hi> and the other for <hi>Cotus.</hi>
Of theſe two <hi>Eporedorix</hi> underſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of <hi>Litavicus,</hi> opened the matter to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
almoſt about midnight. He prayed him
not to ſuffer their State to fall away from the
friendſhip of the people of <hi>Rom:</hi> by the wicked
counſell of young men, which would neceſſarily
fall out, if he ſuffered ſo many thouſand men
to joyn themſelves to the enemy, whoſe ſafety
as neither their kinsfolks would neglect, ſo the
State could not lightly eſteem of. <hi>Caeſar</hi> being
much perplexed at this meſſage, foraſmuch as
he had alwayes cheriſhed the State of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dui,</hi>
without any further doubt or diſpute, he
took four expedite and unburthened Legions
and all the horſe out of the camp: neither was
there ſpace at ſuch a time to make the camp
leſſer, foraſmuch as the matter ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in expedition. He left behind him <hi>C. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
a Legate with two legions for a garriſon
to the camp. And having given order for the
apprehending of <hi>Litavicus</hi> brethren, he found
that a little before they were fled to the enemy.
Thereupon adhorting the ſouldiers not to think
much of their labour in ſo neceſſary a time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man being most willing, he went five and
twenty miles, and then met with the forces of
the <hi>Hedui.</hi> The horſemen being ſent to ſtay
their march, he commanded not to kill any one
of them, and gave order to <hi>Eporedorix</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridomarus</hi>
(whom they thought to be ſlain)
to ride up and down amongſt the horſemen,
and to call to their countrymen. They being

the <hi>Hedui</hi> ſtretched out their hands,
making ſigns of ſubmiſſion, and caſting away

<hi>Litavicus,</hi> with his clients and followers, who by
the cuſtome of <hi>Gallia</hi> muſt not forſake their

Caeſar</hi> having diſpatched meſſengers
to the State of the <hi>Hedui,</hi> to acquaint them
that he had ſaved their people, which by the law
of arms he might have ſlain, gave the army
three hours rest that night, and then returned
towards <hi>Gergovia.</hi> In the mid-way certain
horſemen ſent by <hi>Fabius</hi> made known unto <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
in what danger the matter ſtood: that the
camp was aſſaulted with all the enemies forces;
and foraſmuch as ſuch as were wearied were
ſtill relieved with freſh men, it came to paſſe
that our men fainted with continuall labours:
for the camp was ſo great, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to ſtana upon the rampier to make it good:
and that many were wounded with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of arrowes and other ſorts of weapons;
wherein their engines had ſerved them to good
purpoſe for their defence. <hi>Fabius</hi> when theſe meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
came away, had ſhut up two gates, and
left other two open, and had made ſheds and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
for the better defence of the wall, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

Theſe things being known by the exceeding tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell

the Conſul or Generall had authority to call

<hi>Equites,</hi> as for their long ſervice were freed by
the laws from giving in their names at a muſter:
and theſe they called <hi>Evocati,</hi> as a man would
ſay, called out, being all men of ſpeciall note

advice for matter of war. Theſe <hi>Evocati</hi> went
all for the moſt part under an enſigne, and were
lodged together in the camp behind the pavilion
of the Generall, near unto the gate which they
called <hi>Porta Praetoria,</hi> and were alwayes free
from ordinarie duties, as watching, incamping
and fighting, unleſſe it came to ſuch a paſſe, that
every man would put to his helping hand: but

                        </gap>ſtring away. And as he thought upon theſe
things, he ſeemed to ſpy an occaſion of doing
ſomewhat to purpoſe: for coming into the
leſſer camp to view the works, he obſerved a
knoll which was kept by the enemy to be bare of
men, which the day before could ſcarce be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by reaſon of the multitude of people: and
wondering at it, be enquired the cauſe of the
runawaies which came daily in great numbers
unto him. They all agreed of that which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
had before understood by the diſcoverers,
that the back of that hill was almoſt levell, but
narrow and woody where it gave paſſage to the
other part of the town. The <hi>Galles</hi> did much
fear that place, for the <hi>Romans</hi> having took
one knoll, if they ſhould poſſeſſe themſelves of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
the <hi>Galles</hi> were almoſt block in round
about, and cut off from forraging, or any other
iſſuing out of the town: and therefore <hi>Vercin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getorix</hi>
had called them all to fortify that place.
This being known, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent many troups of
horſe to that place about midnight, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to ride up and down all thereabout
ſomewhat tumultuouſly. And early in the
morning he cauſed many horſes and mules for
carriage to be taken out of the camp with horſe-keepers
upon them, having casks upon their
heads the better to reſemble horſemen, and to
be carried round about the hills. And to them
he added a few horſemen, to the end they might
ſpur out the more freely, and ſo make a better
ſhew, commanding them all to go to the ſame
place by a long circuit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were done in view of the town; for <hi>Gergovia</hi> ſo
ſtood, that they might from thence ſee into the
camp; but yet in ſo great a diſtance they could
not certainly perceive what was done. He
ſent likewiſe one Legion to the ſame hill, and
appointed them to go a little way, and then to
make a ſtand in a dale, and to hide themſelves
in the woods. The <hi>Galles</hi> began more to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that place, and all their forces were drawn
thither for the ſtrengthening of it. <hi>Caeſar</hi>
perceiving the enemies camps to be void of men,
hiding his enſigns and colours, he drew the
ſouldiers by little and little out of the greater
into the leſſer camp, and acquainted the legates
to whom he had given the ſeverall legions in
charge, what he would have done; warning
them eſpecially to keep in the ſouldiers, lest they
ſhould be carried out either with a deſire of
ſighting, or in hope of booty. He propounded

but they could overcome it by their valour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
as they deſisted not from following, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they came to the wall and the gates of the

all parts of the town, ſuch as were further off
being terrified with the ſuddenneſſe of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
thinking the enemy had been within the
gates, did cast themſelves out of the town:
and the women cast down their apparell and
their ſilver from the walls; and holding out
their naked breasts, with their hands ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
adjured the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſave them, and
that they would not (as they had done at <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum)</hi>
destroy both women and children: and
ſome women ſlipt down by their hands from the
wall, and gave themſelves freely to the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<hi>L. Fabius</hi> a centurion of the eighth leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who was heard to ſay that day, that the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which he had got at <hi>Avaricum</hi> ſo ſtirred him
up, that he would ſuffer no man to get up upon
the wall before himſelf; having got three of
his manipular ſouldiers, with their help he
climbed up to the top of the wall, and then he
himſelf did help up his fellowes. In the mean

being at length come together, the women that

whereby it happened, that both the enemy had

in the place and in the multitude, and our
men in their valour, the <hi>Hedui</hi> ſuddenly appeared
on the open ſide of our men, whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> had
ſent up by another aſcent on the right hand,
to keep off part of the enemy. Theſe by the
likeneſſe of their armour did wonderfully asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
our men: who although they ſaw their
right arms ſhewed or put forth, which was a
ſign of peace, yet they doubted lest the enemy
had uſed that policy to deceive them. At the
ſame instant <hi>L. Fabius</hi> the Centurion, and thoſe
that climbed up upon the wall with him, being
ſlain, were cast down from the wall again, and
<hi>M. Petreius</hi> a Centurion of the ſame legion, as
he was about to cut down the gates, being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with the multitude, and deſpairing of
his own life, having received many wounds;
Foraſmuch (ſaith he to his ſouldiers that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him) as I cannot ſave my ſelf and you too,
I will certainly provide for your ſafety, whom I
have brought into danger whilst I thirsted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honour. You, while you may, ſhift for your
ſelves. And withall he brake through the
thickeſt of the enemy, and with the ſlaughter
of a couple he removed the rest from the gate.
And as his ſouldiers went about to help him,
In vain (ſaith he) do you endeavour to ſave
my life, which bloud and ſtrength have already
forſaken: and therefore get you hence while
you have means, and betake your ſelves to the
legion, and ſo fighting fell down dead, but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his men. Our men being overcharge don
all ſides, with the loſſe of ſix and fourty Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
were beaten down from the place: but the
tenth legion, which ſtood for a reſcue in a more
equall place, hindred the <hi>Galles</hi> from following
over eagerly. And again, the cohorts of the
thirteenth legion, which <hi>Sextius</hi> had brought out
of the camp, ſeconded that legion, having got
the advantage of the upper ground. The legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
aſſoon as they came into the plain, ſtood
ſtill, and turned head to the enemy. <hi>Vercinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torix</hi>
drew back his men from the foot of the
hill, and brought them into their camps. That
day few leſſe then ſeven hundred ſouldiers were
wanting.</p>

                        <p>At this ſervice the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtood in theſe

only they truſted in their valour, and thought
by vertue to clear all difficulties. The <hi>Galles</hi>
had the favour of the place, a far greater number
of fighting men, they came freſh to the battel,
and were alwaies ſeconded with freſh ſupplies.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> ſeeing the two armies ingaged one with
another, could neither part them nor recall his

convenient places, as might reſcue his people in

the chaſe, or making any great ſlaughter of the

were not ſeven hundred men loſt of the <hi>Roman</hi>

and did think that the departure of theſe

did not think it fit to detain them, leſt he ſhould
either ſeem to do them wrong, or to give any

propounded unto them briefly, how well he had
deſerved of their State, how low and weak they
were when he received them, confined within
their towns, their lands extended, all their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates

he had brought them again, that not only
they had recovered their former ſtate, but did
exceed the dignity and favour of all former

and a great part of the Senate were
come unto him, and that publick meſſengers
were ſent to <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> touching a league of
peace and amitie; they did not think it fit to
omit ſo great an opportunitie. And thereupon
having ſlain the Guard at <hi>Noviodunum,</hi> with
ſuch others as were there either by way of
trade or travell, they divided the money and the
horſes between them, and took order that the
hoſtages of the other States ſhould ſafely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to <hi>Bibract.</hi> For the town, foraſmuch
as they thought they were not able to keep it,
leſt the <hi>Romans</hi> might make any uſe of it, they
burned it: ſuch corn as they could carry on the
ſudden, they conveyed away in boats, the reſt
they either burnedor caſt it into the river. They
began to raiſe forces in the countrie, next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning;
to diſpoſe of watches and garriſons
on the bank of the river <hi>Loire;</hi> to ſhew their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie
in all places, to ſtrike fear into the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
to the end they might exclude them from
proviſion of corn, or drive them through ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of want to forſake the Province. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they were the rather aſſured, foraſmuch as
the <hi>Loire</hi> was much ſwelled by a fall of ſnow,
whereby it was unpaſſable at any foard. Theſe
things being known, <hi>Caeſar</hi> thought it neceſſary
for him to make haſte, (eſpecially if he muſt
make up the bridges) to the end he might give
them battel before they had gathered a greater
head: for touching his pupoſe for returning
into the Province, he did not think it fit by any
means, both in reſpect of the ſhame and in famy
thereof, as alſo foraſmuch as the oppoſition of
the hill <hi>Gebenna,</hi> and the difficultie of the
paſſage did hinder him; but eſpecially for that
he did exceedingly deſire to joyn himſelf with
<hi>Labienus</hi> and the Legions that were with him.
And therefore making great journeys both by
day and night beyond all mens expectation,
he came to the river <hi>Loire,</hi> where the horſemen
having ſound a convenient foard for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie
of the time, that the ſouldiers might
paſs over with their arms and ſhoulders above
the water, to hold up their weapons, dispoſing
the horſe in the river to break the force of the

their first ſhew, he carried over his Army in
ſafety. And having ſatisfied his ſouldiers
with corn which he found in the fields, and
good ſtore of cattell, he determined to march
towards the <hi>Senones.</hi>

priviledges and prerogatives above the reſt,
as might tie them with an inviolable bond of

neither to conceit himſelf in a matchleſs ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,

this is that which is ſo often recommended to the

                           <hi>Fabius</hi> the great <hi>Roman</hi> thought it no ſcorn

the courſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> warfare according to
the time, and overthrew that enemy by ſhunning
to encounter him, which in a battell would
have hazarded the conqueſt of <hi>Rome.</hi> In like

when as he dealt with an enemy, which time and

Omnem ſibi commutandam belli rationem exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimavit,</hi> thought
it his beſt way to alter the

up the river, commanding them to make

ſought out all barges and boats, and ſent them
up the river with much noiſe and beating of

quietly with three legions to the place where he
had commanded the ſhips to abide him. At
his coming thither, the enemies diſcoverers
which were diſpoſed on all parts of the river,
were ſuddenly and at unawares ſurpriſed by
our men, by reaſon of a ſudden tempeſt that did

horſe were by the diligence of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Knights (to whom he had committed that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe)
carried over. At the ſame time a

that there was an extraordinary noiſe and
tumult in the <hi>Roman</hi> camp, and a great troup
went up the river, and the beating of oars was
heard that way, and a little below the ſouldiers
were carried over. Which being known, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as they judged that the legions were
carried over in three places, and that they were

fled away; they divided their forces alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and to ſuppoſe that <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf was preſent,
under whoſe leading they had oftentimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
the enemy; he gave the ſign of battel.
Upon the firſt affront, on the right wing, where
the ſeventh legion ſtood, the enemy was beaten
back and put to flight; in the left cornet, where
the twelfth legion was, the former ranks of the
enemy being pierced through and beaten dead
down with the piles, the reſt notwithſtanding
did ſtoutly reſiſt, neither did any man give ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of flying. <hi>Camulogenus</hi> the Generall
was preſent with his men, and encouraged them
to ſight, the victory being uncertain. When
the Tribunes of the ſeventh legion underſtood
what was done in the left wing, they ſhewed the
legion behind on the back of the enemy, and
there began to charge them: and yet none of
them for ſook his place, but were all incloſed and
ſlain, <hi>Camulogenus</hi> ending his dayes by the ſame
fortune. Such of the enemy as were left over

that the time of victory was now come; for the

which was ſufficient for the obtaining of their

If the foot did aſſist their horſe, then they
were not able to make any way or proceed in
their journey. But if (which he hoped would
rather happen) forſaking their carriages every
man ſhifted for himſelf, they would depart both
robbed of their neceſſaries and of their honour:
for they need not doubt of the enemies horſe, of
whom he was moſt aſſured that they durſt not
go out from amongſt the foot forces. And to the
end they might be the better incouraged, he
would draw all the forces in a readineſſe out of
the camp, and place them ſo as they might be
a terror to the enemy. The horſemen cried out
all together, that this reſolution might be

being known, <hi>Caeſar</hi> divided his horſes likewiſe
into three parts, and ſent them to make head

fought in all parts, the army ſtood ſtill, the

our men were overcharged any where, <hi>Caeſar</hi>
bent the Legions that way, which did both

town round about with a ditch and a rampier.
<hi>Aleſia</hi> was ſited on the top of a hill, in a very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent

rivers on each ſide of the town: before the town
there lay a plain of three miles in length:
the other ſides were incloſed round about in
a reaſonable diſtance with hills of equall
height with the town. Under the wall on the Eaſt
ſide lay all the forces of the <hi>Galles,</hi> having
drawn a ditch and a drie wall on that part of
eight foot in height: the whole circuit of the
works which the <hi>Romans</hi> made to incloſe the
town about, contained eleven miles. Their camp
was ſited in a convenient place, where there were
made three and twentie caſtles, which in the

night by ſtrong watches. The work being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
there happened a skirmiſh between the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie
of both ſides in that plain which lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the town of three miles in length. They
fought eagerly on both ſides. Our men being
overcharged, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent the <hi>Germans</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
them, and ſet the Legions before the camp,
leſt there might happen any ſuddain ſally by
the foot of the enemy. Upon the ſafegard of
the Legions our men took courage. The enemy
was put to flight, and being many in number
one hindred another, and ſtuck in heaps in the
ſtreight paſſage of their gates. The <hi>Germans</hi>
followed them cloſe to their fortifications, and
made a great execution amongst them. Many
of them forſaking their horſes attempted to
leap the ditch, and to climbe over the drie wall.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> commanded the legions imbattelled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the camp to advance a little forward. The
<hi>Galles</hi> that were within the fortification were
no little troubled: for thinking the enemie would

into the town. <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> commanded the

thirty dayes, but by ſparing and good husbandry
it might be made to ſerve longer. With theſe
mandates he ſent out the horſemen in ſilence

the corn he began to meaſure out very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly.
All the forces which he had placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Which being known by therunne-awayes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> appointed to make theſe fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
He drew a ditch of twenty foot in breadth
and depth, with ſtreight ſides, as broad at the
bottome as at the top. The reſt of the work
he made fourty foot ſhort of that ditch, which
he did for theſe reaſons; that the whole
body of the <hi>Romans</hi> might not eaſily be incloſed
about with an army of ſouldiers, which he
thought to prevent by taking in ſo great a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit
of ground; and ſecondly, leſt the enemy
ſallying out upon a ſuddain, ſhould in the night
come to deſtroy the works, or in the day-time
trouble the ſouldiers with darts and caſting
weapons as they were buſied about the works.
This ſpace of fourty foot being left, he made two
ditches of fifteen foot in breadth and depth, the
innermoſt whereof being carried through the
fields and the lower ground, he filled with water
drawn out of the river. Behind them he made
a ditch and a rampier of twelve foot, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
it with a parapet and pinacles, and with
great boughes of trees cut in cags like unto a
Harts horn, which he ſet where the hovels were
joyned to the rampier, to hinder the enemy from
climbing up; and made towers round about the
whole work, in the diſtance of fourſcore foot
one from another. At the ſame time the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ſouldiers were both to get ſtuffe for the
fortification, to go a harveſting for proviſion of
corn, and to make ſuch great works. Our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being much weakened, and being to ſeek corn
and ſtuffe farre off from the camp; the <hi>Galles</hi>
alſo oftentimes attempting to deſtroy the works,
and to ſally out of the town at divers ports: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Caeſar</hi> thought it fit to adde thus much
more to the foreſaid works, that the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
might be made good with the leſſe number

of five foot deep, and in them he planted either

at the bottome, that they might not be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>Cippi.</hi> Before theſe, in oblique courſes, after
the manner of a <hi>quincunce,</hi> were digged holes of
three foot deep, narrow at the bottome like a
ſugar loaf: theſe they ſet with round ſtakes of
the bigneſſe of a mans thigh, with a ſharp hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
point, in ſuch ſort that they ſtuck not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
four fingers out of the earth; and for the
better faſtening of them, they ſtuck all a foot
within the ground: the rest of the hole for the
better ordering of the matter, was hid with
oſiers and ſpreads. Of theſe were eight courſes
three foot diſtant one from another: and theſe
they called Lillies, from the reſemblance they
had to the figure of that flower. Before theſe
were galthrops of a foot long faſtened in the
earth, and headed at the top with barbed hooks
of iron, ſowed up and down in all places in a
reaſonable diſtance one from another: and
theſe they called <hi>Stimuli.</hi> The inner fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being thus perfected, he followed the even
and level ground as much as the nature of the
place would give him leave, and took in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
miles in circuit, and made the like for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
in all points againſt the enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
as he had done againſt the town; to the end
that if he were driven upon occaſion to depart
and leave the works, it might be no danger for
him to leave the camp; foraſmuch as a few
men would defend it. He commanded every
man to have forrage and proviſion of corn for
thirty dayes.</p>

ſomewhat touching the <hi>Roman</hi> works, and to
ſhew the uſe they made of them in their greateſt
occaſions: but this deſcription of the works at
<hi>Aleſia,</hi> doth ſo far exceed the inlargement of
commenting words, that it hath drowned the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
of great Hiſtorians, and in ſtead of
expoſitions and inforcements, hath drawn from
them ſpeeches expreſſing greater admiration then
belief. <hi>Circa Aleſiam</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paterculus)
tantae res geſtae, quantas audere vix hominis,
perficere nullius niſi Dei fuerit:</hi> So great things
were done at <hi>Aleſia,</hi> that they might ſeem too
great for any man to attempt, or any but a god to
effect. To incloſe a town with a ditch and a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
of eleven miles in circuit, was a matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the <hi>Roman</hi> army: but to adde ſuch variety of
works, and to make ſuch ſtrange trapes and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
againſt an enemy, was admirable to the
hearer; and not that only, but to make the like
works without, to keep the <hi>Galles</hi> from raiſing
the ſiege, did double the wonder: by which
works he did beſiege and was beſieged, took the
town and overthrew the enemy in the field.</p>
                        <p>Such as ſince that time have imitated this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
only by a ſmall ditch and a rampier
(for I think no man ever made ſuch works) have
wrought wonders in matter of warre. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi>
got the name of renewing the ancient military
diſcipline in <hi>Italy,</hi> chiefly for that he beſieged
<hi>Piſtoia,</hi> and with the help of a double trench,
according to the example of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he kept in
the <hi>Piſtoyans</hi> on the one ſide, and kept out an
army on the other ſide of thirtie thouſand foot
and three thouſand horſe, in ſuch manner as in
the end he took the citie and made their ſuccours
of no effect. The States army of the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
under the leading of <hi>Grave Maurice,</hi> did
the like at the town of <hi>Grave</hi> in the year 1602.
But of this at <hi>Aleſia</hi> may well be ſaid that which
<hi>Livy</hi> ſpeaketh of the battell at <hi>Nola: Ingens eo
die res, ac neſcio an maxima illo bello geſta ſit:</hi>
A great piece of ſervice was done that day, and I

it not expedient to raiſe ſo great a number: for
they would have accrewed to ſuch a multitude of

ſervice. <hi>Xerxes</hi> army which he carried into
<hi>Greece,</hi> was famous for two reſpects: Firſt, in
regard of the multitude, which was ſo great, that
when he himſelf returned back into <hi>Aſia,</hi> he left
behind him three hundred thouſand of the beſt
ſouldiers choſen out of the whole army, under
the conduct of one <hi>Mardonius.</hi> Secondly, that
of ſo many fighting men, there were two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and threeſcore thouſand ſlain in one battell,
with the loſſe of one thouſand and three hundred
<hi>Grecians.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of a kingdome doth not neceſſarily follow
the multitude of ſouldiers in an army; for either
<hi>Xerxes</hi> army was too few in number to conquer
<hi>Greece,</hi> or too many to be well martialled.</p>
                        <p>

He was a man of great birth and authority
amongſt the <hi>Arverni.</hi> I will ſay nothing (ſaith
he) of their opinion, that call baſe ſervitude by
the name of rendry: neither do I think them fit
to be accounted citizens, or to be admitted to
councell of State. With them will I deal that
like well of ſallies, in whoſe advice and counſell,
even by all your conſents, the memory of ancient
vertue ſeemeth to conſiſt. It is no vertue, but a
weakneſſe of the mind, not to be able to bear
want a little while. It is an eaſier matter to
find men that will offer themſelves willingly
to death, then ſuch as will endure labour with
patience. For mine own part, I could like well
of that opinion, (for honour much prevaileth
with me;) if I did not ſee a further loſſe then
of our lives. But in theſe our conſultations let
us look upon all <hi>Gallia,</hi> whom we have called
together to ſuccour us. What ſpirits do you think
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51174:131"/>
would our friends and kinſmen conceive, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
thouſand men being ſlain in one place, if
they were conſtrained to wage battell upon their
dead carcaſes? I would not have you to defraud
them of your help, that do neglect all perill for
your ſake; nor by your fooliſhneſſe and your
raſhneſſe, or the weakneſſe of your mind, throw
down all <hi>Gallia,</hi> and caſt it into perpetuall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
Do you doubt of their faith and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
becauſe they came not by a day? What do
the <hi>Romans</hi> then mean in theſe outward works?
Do you think they make them for exerciſe, or
to paſſe away the time? If you cannot then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
aſſurance by their meſſengers, all paſſage
being ſtopt, uſe them for witneſſes that
their coming is at hand, for fear whereof
they labour night and day. What then? my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is that we do as our forefathers did in a
warre againſt the <hi>Cimbri</hi> and <hi>Teutones,</hi> not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to this, who being ſhut up within their
towns, and brought to the like neceſſity, did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their hunger with the bodies of ſuch as
were found unfit for warre, neither did they
yield themſelves unto the enemy: whereof
if we had not an example, yet I would judge it
an excellent thing to be begun now for liberties
ſake, and to be left to poſterity. For what
warre was like this? <hi>Gallia</hi> being waſted
and diſpeopled, and the kingdome brought into
great miſery, the <hi>Cimbri</hi> at length forſook our
countrey, and ſought out other territories, and
left unto us our laws, cuſtomes, lands &amp; libertie.
For the <hi>Romans,</hi> what is it they deſire? or what
would they have? But being drawn on with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and envy, whom they underſtood to be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and a warlike nation, their fields and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they did deſire to take from them, and to
yoke them with eternall bondage; as never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
warre with other condition. For if you be
ignorant what they do farre off in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
look at home in that part of <hi>Gallia</hi> which
is reduced into a Province. Their laws and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
being changed, it is ſubjected to the axe
and to perpetuall ſervitude. Their opinions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered, they decree, that ſuch as through
age or ſickneſſe were unfit for warre, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the town; and that they ſhould prove all
means, before they yielded to <hi>Critognatus</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and yet if the matter ſo required, to conſent
unto it, and to attend their ſuccours rather
then to yield to any rendry and condition of

They coming to the <hi>Roman</hi>
works, did with weeping tears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
them to receive them into bondage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them with food. <hi>Caeſar</hi> gave order they
ſhould not be received, and ſet a guard on the
rampier to keep them out. In the mean time <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi>
and the reſt of the Captains, that had the
chief command given them, came to <hi>Aleſia</hi> with
all their forces, and having taken a hill on the
out-ſide, they ſate down not above half a mile
from our works. The next day bringing their
cavalrie out of their camp, they filled all that
plain, which, as I have already ſaid, extended
three miles in length before the town, ſetting
their foot-forces a little diſtant from that place,
and hiding them upon higher ground. The
proſpect lay open out of the town into the
field: and upon the ſight of theſe ſuccours they
ran together, and congratulated each other, and
all their minds were filled with gladneſſe. And
thereupon the next day they brought their forces
and placed them before the town, and began to
cover the next ditch unto them with hurdles,
and to fill it up with earth, and to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſally out, and to endure all chances.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> having diſpoſed of all his army on each
ſide of the works, that if there were occaſion,
every man might both know and keep his place,
he commanded the cavalrie to be carried out of
the camp, and to charge the enemy. There was
a fair view out of all the camps, which were
ſeated round about upon the ridge of the hill,
and all mens minds were bent upon the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the event of the fight. The <hi>Galles</hi> had
mingled amongſt their horſe ſome few archers
and light-armed ſouldiers, which might relieve
their fellows being overcharged, and ſuſtain the
force and aſſault of our horſe. By theſe were
many hurt upon a ſuddain, and forſook the fight.
The <hi>Galles</hi> being perſwaded that their men had
the better of the fight, perceiving our men to be
overcharged with multitude on all ſides, as well
thoſe that were beſieged, as the other that came
to relieve them, they took up a ſhout and a how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to encourage their people. And foraſmuch
as the matter was carried in the ſight of all
men, ſo that nothing could be hid whether it
were well or ill done; the deſire of honour and
the fear of ignominie did ſtirre up both ſides
to proweſſe and valour. And having fought
with a doubtfull fortune from noon-tide untill
almoſt Sun-ſetting, the <hi>Germans</hi> on the one
ſide with thick-thronged troups gave a fierce
charge upon the enemy, and put them to flight
whereby it happened that the archers were cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumvented
and ſlain. In like manner on the
other ſide, our mea finding them to give
ground, did follow them even to their camps,
and gave them no time to recover themſelves.
Such as were come out of <hi>Aleſia,</hi> returned back
ſad into the town deſpairing of victory. One
day being intermitted, in which time they made
proviſion of great ſtore of hurdles, ladders and
hooks, about midnight they marched ſilently out
of their camp, and came to the works on the
field ſide; and taking up a ſuddain ſhout, to
give notice of their coming to them of the town,
they caſt their hurdles upon the ditches, and
with ſlings, arrows, and ſtones they began to
put our men from the rampier, and to put in
practiſe ſuch things as belong to a ſiege. At the
ſame time the ſhout being heard, <hi>Vercingetorix</hi>
ſounded the trumpet, and brought his men out
of the town. Our men betook themſelves to the
fortifications, according as every mans place
was allotted him the day before; and with ſlings
and bullets which they had laid ready upon the
works, they did beat down the <hi>Galles,</hi> their
ſight being taken away through the darkneſſe of
the night. Many wounds were received on both
ſides, and many weapons were cast out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.
<hi>M. Antonius,</hi> and <hi>C. Trebonius,</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
who had the charge of thoſe parts where
our men were moſt laid to, cauſed men to be
taken out of the further Caſtles, and to be
brought to ſecond them. The <hi>Galles</hi> being a
good way diſtant from the works, did much
hurt with multitude of weapons: but approching
nearer, either they ſtruck themſelves unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
upon the galthrops, or falling into the
holes, were ſtruck through the bodies with the
ſharp ſtakes, or died with murall piles, being
caſt from the rampier and the towers. Many
wounds being received on all ſides, as the day
appeared, the <hi>Galles</hi> fearing lest they ſhould be
charged on the open ſide by a ſallie from the
upper camp, retired back again to their fellows.
On the inner ſide, whilſt they brought out ſuch
things as were prepared beforehand by <hi>Vercin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getorix,</hi>
and were filling up the firſt ditches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomewhat long in the execution of theſe
things, they underſtood that the other <hi>Galles</hi>
were departed before they themſelves could come
near the works: and thereupon they returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the town without doing any thing.</p>

lay a hill, which by reaſon of the greatneſſe of

compaſſe of their works: and thereupon were
neceſſarily conſtrained to lay their camp in an

was kept by <hi>Caius Antiſtius Rheginus,</hi> and <hi>Caius

known by the diſcoverers, the Captains of the

which carried the greateſt opinion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and did ſecretly determine amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
how and in what ſort they would have

command thoſe forces, being one of the four
Captains, and kinſman to <hi>Vercingetorix.</hi> He
going out of the camp in the firſt watch of the
night, came to the end of his journey a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
day, and hiding himſelf behind a hill, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his ſouldiers to refreſh themſelves from
the former nights travell. And when it began
to be towards noon, he made towards that part of
the camp which I have before mentioned: and
at the ſame time the horſemen began to approach
towards the works, and the reſt of the forces
ſhewed themſelve; before the camp. <hi>Vercinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torix</hi>
perceiving this out of the watch-tower of
<hi>Aleſia,</hi> went out of the town, and carried with
him long poles, hooks, and ſuch other proviſions
which he had made ready before hand for a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.
They fought at one inſtant in all places,
all wayes were tryed: and where they thought
it to be weakeſt, thither they ran. The <hi>Roman</hi>
forces were diſmembred by reaſon of the large
extenſion of their works, ſo that they could not
eaſily defend many places: and the ſhout which
was made behind their backs, did much affright
our men, foraſmuch as they perceived that their
danger did conſist in other mens valour. for
ſuch things as are abſent do for the moſt part
greatly perplex and trouble mens minds. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
having got a convenient place, doth ſee what
is done in every part: if any were overcharged
he ſent them ſuccour, and was ready to anſwer
all occaſions on both ſides the camp. He told
them that that was the time, wherein it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovefull
for them to fight. The <hi>Galles</hi> would
deſpair of all good ſucceſſe, unleſſe they brake
down the works. The <hi>Romans</hi> if they obtained
their purpoſe, might expect an end of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
The greateſt contention was about that
place to which <hi>Vergaſilaunus</hi> was ſent. A
ſmall riſing in a place doth give much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in a ſhelving deſcent. Some caſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
others put themſelves into a Teſtudo, and
came under the works. The wearied and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboured
were ſeconded by freſh ſupplies. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man caſt earth into the works, which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it ſo high, that the <hi>Galles</hi> had advantage of
aſcent: and the pikes and ſharp ſtakes which
the <hi>Romans</hi> had cunningly hid under the earth
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51174:132"/>
to annoy the enemy, were thereby covered. It
came at laſt to that paſſe that our men wanted
both ſtrength and weapons. Which being known,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent <hi>Labienus</hi> with ſix cohorts to relieve
thoſe hat were overcharged, commanding him
(if the could not bear out the charge) to ſally
out upon them, but not unleſſe he were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto it. He himſelf went about to the reſt;
adhorting them not to faint under their labour,
foraſmuch as the fruit and benefit of all their
former battels conſiſted in that day and that
hour. The enemy within being out of hope of
doing any good upon the works made in plain
and champain places, by reaſon of the ſtrength
of the fortifications, tried what they could do in
ſteep and broken places; and thither they brought
thoſe things which they had prepared. With the
multitude of their caſting weapons, they caſt
out ſuch as fought from turrets, they filled their
paſſages with hurdles and earth, they brake
down the parapet and the rampier with hooks.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent firſt young <hi>Brutus</hi> with ſix cohorts,
and after him <hi>Fabius</hi> a Legate with ſeven
more, and at length as the fight waxed hot, he
went himſelf with a freſh ſupply. The fight
being renewed and the enemy beaten off, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to that place whither he had ſent <hi>Labienus,</hi>
and took four cohorts out of the next Caſtle.
Part of the horſemen he commanded to follow
him, and the reſt to compaſſe about the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
works, and to ſet upon the enemy behind.
<hi>Labienus</hi> finding that neither rampier nor
ditches were able to keep out the enemy, having
got ſuch forces together as were drawn by chance
from the works neareſt hand, to the number of
thirty nine cohorts, he acquainted <hi>Caeſar</hi> by
meſſengers what he thought fit to be done. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
made haſte to be at the fight. <hi>His</hi> coming
being known by the colour of his garment, which
he was accuſtomed to wear in time of battell,
and the troups of horſe and the cohorts being
diſcovered which he had commanded to follow
him, as the ſhelving and declining places were
ſubject to the view of higher grounds; the enemy
begun the fight. a great ſhout was taken up on
both ſides. Our men having thrown their piles,
betook themſelves to their ſwords. Suddenly
the horſemen were diſcovered behind them, and
other cohorts made their approches towards
them. The enemy turned his back and fled:
the horſemen met them as they fled. the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was great in that place. <hi>Sedulius,</hi> a Captain
and Prince of the <hi>Lemovici,</hi> was ſlain. <hi>Verga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaunus</hi>
was taken alive. Threeſcore and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
enſignes were brought unto <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and
very few of ſo great a number returned ſafe
into their camp. Thoſe of the town beholding
the ſlaughter and flight of their friends, being
out of all hope, drew back their forces from the
works. This being known, the <hi>Galles</hi> fled pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
out of their camp: and if the ſouldiers
had not been wearied with that dayes labour,
they might eaſily have deſtroyed all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
About midnight the horſe being ſent out
to fall upon the rereward, a great number was
taken and ſlain, the reſt eſcaped into their

came to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp; rode round about him as he ſate
in his chair of Eſtate; then lighting off his horſe,
he took off his capariſon and furniture, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
himſelf, and laid all on the ground, and
went and ſate down at <hi>Caeſars</hi> feet, and ſaid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

a priſoner taken in the warres, to be led afterwards
in his triumph at <hi>Rome:</hi> but the civile warres did
cut off that ſolemnitie.</p>
                        <p>If it be demanded, what became of theſe great
Princes and perſonages after the triumph: It will
appear that they did not ſtroke their heads, or
make more of them then of miſerable captives.

                        <note place="margin">Caeſar.</note> it was
hardly obtained by the extreme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
of the Tribunes, to get
them read in the Senate: but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
thereof, or to bring the Contents in queſtion,
would not be granted. The Conſuls propounded
buſineſſes concerning the ſtate of the City. <hi>L.
Lentulus,</hi> Conſul, proteſted his aſſiſtance ſhould
not be wanting, neither to the Senate nor to the
Commonweal, if they would ſpeak their minds
freely and boldly: but if they reſpected <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
and had an eye to his favour (as in former
times they uſually had) he would then take a
courſe for himſelf, and not regard the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Senate; neither wanted he means of
entrance into <hi>Caeſar's</hi> friendſhip and good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.
To the ſame effect ſpake <hi>Scipio;</hi> That
<hi>Pompey</hi> was reſolved to be aiding to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal,
if the Senate would ſtand to him: but
if they temporized, and dealth coldly, in vain
hereafter ſhould they ſeek aid from him, albeit
they inſtantly deſired it. This ſpeech of <hi>Scipio's</hi>
ſeemed to come from <hi>Pompey</hi>'s own mouth, he
himſelf being preſent, and the Senate kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Citie. Some others ſpake more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.
As firſt <hi>M. Marcellus,</hi> who thought it
not convenient that the Senate ſhould bring theſe
things in queſtion, untill they had made a levie
of ſouldiers throughout all <hi>Italie,</hi> and inrolled
an Army; by whoſe protection, they might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and freely determine what they thought fit.
At alſo <hi>M. Calidius,</hi> who thought it requiſite,
that <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould go to his Provinces and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
to remove all occaſions of taking
Arms: For <hi>Caeſar</hi> having two Legions newly
taken from him, feared that <hi>Pompey</hi> kept them
near about the citie to his prejudice. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>M. Rufus,</hi> varying ſome few words, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himſelf of <hi>Calidius</hi> opinion. All theſe were
bitterly reproved by <hi>L. Lentulus</hi> the Conſul;
who utterly denied to publiſh what <hi>Calidius</hi> had
ſentenced. <hi>Marcellus</hi> feared with theſe mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
retracted his opinion. And ſo, what with
the clamor of the Conſul, the terrour of the
preſent Army, and the threatning uſed by <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
faction, moſt of the Senators were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
againſt their will, to allow that which <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
thought fit: which was, that by a certain
day <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould diſſolve and diſmiſſe his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
which if he did refuſe to do, that then he
openly ſhewed himſelf an Enemy to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal.
<hi>M. Antonius</hi> and <hi>L. Caſſius,</hi> Tribunes
of the people, did oppoſe this decree. Their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
was inſtantly ſpoken unto; and many
ſharp and hard cenſures were given upon the

                        <p>The hiſtories of that age do all intimate, that
when <hi>Rome</hi> had ennobled <hi>Pompey</hi> with her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and ſtiled him by imployments with the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Greatneſſe, as a ſatisfaction for the injuries
done unto his father; he (forgetting the rights
of a State, which challengeth the renown of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens labours, and ſuffereth no ſubject to be
co-partner therein, further then by approbation
of ſervice and obedience) aſſumed to himſelf the
honour due to the Commonweal, and became
proud of that which was none of his: in which
conceit, the ambition of his ſpirit kept no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but over-valued his merits ſo far, that he
thought himſelf rather a Sovereign then a ſervant.
So eaſily are men bewitched, when the favour of
a State hath once made them abſolute, and put it
ſelf under the awe of private command. In this
height of greatneſſe and authority, he made way
for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> his father in law; who had a ſpirit as
ſubject to ambition, and as capable of publick
dignities, as any one amongſt all the Patrician
Families: and upon the ending of his firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip,

about the beginning of the evening forſook their

had conference with the Tribunes of the

obtained touching his own ſafety, might give
hope to the reſt: amongst whom ſome were ſo

leave, he departed. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as ſoon as it was

In the mean time <hi>L. Manlius,</hi> the Praetor, fled
from <hi>Alba</hi> with ſix cohorts; and <hi>Rutilius Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
Praetor, fled from <hi>Tarracina</hi> with three co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts:

came in as they marched, ſome to the
foot troups, and ſome to the horſe. <hi>Cn. Magius</hi>
of <hi>Cremona,</hi> maſter of the works and of the

way, and brought back to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> whom he ſent
back again to <hi>Pompey,</hi> with commiſſion to treat
with him to this effect: Foraſmuch as there had
yet happened no opportunity of meeting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
he was now determined to ſeek him at
<hi>Brunduſium;</hi> for it much imported the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal,
and every mans ſafety in particular,
that they two might conferre together. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could things be ſo well handled upon ſo
great a diſtance of way, where the articles of
treaty muſt be carried to and fro by a third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as when they met face to face to conclude of
the conditions.</p>
                     <p>This meſſage being firſt given, he came to
<hi>Brunduſium</hi> with ſix legions; four legions of old
ſouldiers, and the other raiſed by new inrollments,
or made up as he came along the Countrey: for
he had preſently diſpatched <hi>Domitius</hi> his cohorts
from <hi>Corfinium</hi> into <hi>Sicily.</hi> At his coming, he
found the Conſuls gone over to <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> with
the greateſt part of the Army, and <hi>Pompey</hi>
remaining at <hi>Brunduſium</hi> with twenty co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts.
Neither could he certainly be informed,
whether he remained at <hi>Brunduſium</hi> to make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51174:144"/>
good the town, whereby he might the eaſier
be maſter of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> ſea, and command
both the utter parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Regions
of <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſo to keep the warre on foot

he ſtaied there for want of ſhipping. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he would not endure that <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould
think he could not be forced to quit <hi>Italy;</hi>

he raiſed great mounts of earth on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide near unto the ſhore; for there the
Sea was ſhallow: but going further into the
deep, where no ſuch mounts could be raiſed,
he placed double ſlottes of wood, right againſt
the ſame mounts, of thirty foot ſquare; and
at the corners caſt out four Anchors to faſten
them, that they might not be toſſed up and
down by the waves. Theſe flottes being thus
placed, he then added other flottes of the ſame
ſcantling, and covered them with bavin and
earth, to the end men might come readily upon
them to defend them. He armed them in front
and on each ſide with hurdies and gabions;
and on every fourth flotte made a tower of two
ſtories high, the better to defend them from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of ſhipping, and from burning.</p>
                     <p>Againſt this work <hi>Pompey</hi> ſent out great ſhips

with towers of three ſtories high, full of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

their forbearance with better advantage to

not carrying his heart in his mouth, but pretending
that which he never meant. For they could not be

<hi>Afranius,</hi> as it is ſaid in the ſtory, had
three legions, and <hi>Petreius</hi> two legions, together
with 80 cohorts of Auxiliarie forces, ſupplied
unto them by the two Provinces of <hi>Spain;</hi> which
cohorts equalled the number of eight legions, and
ſo in all made thirteen legions; and according
to the uſuall rate at that time of 5000 in a legion,
amounted to 65000 men: together with 5000

<hi>Caeſar</hi> had five legions, 12000 Auxiliary troupers

the one exceeding the other well-near in a
double proportion of ſtrength, and yet failing in

that proverb in queſtion, <hi>Ne Hercules contra

Beſides, the inequalitie of the place where the

the greater partie, was a matter of no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
For he that maketh war in a Countrey
abſolutely favouring the enemie, and confronting
his purpoſes, had need of more forces then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe

throughout the whole courſe of his wars, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
as near the enemie as conveniently he
could; that ſo he might the better obſerve his

whereof <hi>Sertorius</hi> may be an inſtance;

                     <p>The manner of fight which thoſe ſouldiers
uſed, was firſt to run furiouſly upon an enemy,
to ſeize any place boldly and with great courage;
not much reſpecting their orders or ranks, but
fighting in a ſcattered and diſperſed faſhion. If

                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> encouraging his men, brought out the
ninth legion to ſecond them; by that means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
the enemy (inſolent of good ſucceſſe, and
ſhrewdly purſuing our men) to turn their backs,
and to retire to the town of <hi>Ilerda,</hi> and there to
make a ſtand under the walls. But the ſouldiers
of the ninth legion, carried on with endeavour,
and going about to repair their loſſe, raſhly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the enemy into a place of diſadvantage,
and came under the Hill whereon the town ſtood:
and as they would have made their retreat, they
were charged afreſh from the upper ground. The
front of the place had an uneaſie broken aſcent,
and was on each ſide ſteep; extended onely ſo
much in breadth, as would ſerve three cohorts to
imbattell in: neither could the Cavalrie come to
help them. The Hill declined eaſily from the
town about four hundred paces in length: and
that way our men had ſome conveniency of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
from the diſadvantage to which their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
had unadviſedly led them. The fight conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in this place: which was very unequall, both
in regard of the ſtraightneſs thereof, as alſo for
that they ſtood under the foot of the Hill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
no weapon fell in vain amongſt them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
by proweſſe and valour they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
endured all the wounds they received.
The enemies forces were ſupplied and renewed,
by ſuch cohorts as were often ſent out of the
Camp through the town, that freſh men might
take the place of ſuch as were wearied out. And
the like was <hi>Caeſar</hi> fain to do, ſending freſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
to that place to relieve the wearied.</p>
                     <p>After they had thus continually fought for the
ſpace of five hours together, and that our men
were much over-charged with an unequall mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:
having ſpent all their weapons, they drew
their ſwords, and aſcended up the hill, to charge
and aſſault the enemy: and having ſlain a few
of them, the rest were driven to make retreat.
The cohorts being thus put back to the walls,
and ſome of them for fear having taken the
town, our men found an eaſie retreat. Our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie
did from a low ground get up unto the

                        <hi>Afranius</hi> party was ſo perſwaded, for that
they long ſtood to handy-blows, and reſiſted the
violence of our ſouldiers, although in all mens
judgement they were the weaker: as alſo, for that
they at firſt took and held the place which gave
occaſion of that fight; and in the firſt encounter,
compelled our men to turn their backs. Our men
in like manner thought they had the better, in
regard they had maintained fight for five houres
together, in a place of diſadvantage, and with an
unequall multitude; that they aſcended up the
hill with their ſwords drawn, and compelled

deſperate undertakings: According to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which being light and eaſy, are cured with mild

do require ſharp and ſtrong remedies. Which
doth alſo in like manner appear throughout the
whole courſe of Nature, and particularly in
weights: for as ponderous and heavy bodies are

force; no more can extremities of hazard be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but by like perilous enforcements.</p>
                        <p>And hence groweth the difference between

one and the ſame thing, if they were not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed

conſiſted of five thouſand men, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts;
and according to the ſufficiency and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

<hi>Principes;</hi> and the third and chief ſort,

place and precedency in the Army.</p>
                        <p>Again, each of theſe three kinds was divided
into ten companies, which they called Maniples;
and every Maniple was ſubdivided into two Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies

a Centurion or Captain. Theſe Orders were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
by the numbers of the firſt, ſecond,

which were the laſt and loweſt of each of theſe
three kinds. So that this <hi>Q. Fulginius,</hi> here

of the firſt order of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> which by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie

                        <p>Now concerning their imbattelling, we are to
note, that according to this former diviſion of
<hi>Haſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii,</hi> upon occaſion

for ſuch a tempeſt happened, that
the like waters were never ſeen in thoſe places.
And further beſides, the ſnow came down ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
from the Hills, that it overflowed the
banks of the River; and in one day brake down
both the bridges which <hi>Fabius</hi> had made: and
thereby brought <hi>Caeſar</hi> into great extremity.
For, as it is formerly related, the Camp lay
between two Rivers,<note place="margin">Cinga ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus magis quam mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> 
                        <hi>Sicoris</hi> and <hi>Cinga;</hi> and
within thirty miles neither of theſe Rivers were
paſſable, ſo that all the Army were of neceſſity
couped up in that ſtraightneſſe: neither could
the Cities which had formerly ranged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s party, furniſh any ſupplies
of victuall and proviſion; nor ſuch of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as had gone far for forrage, being hindred
by the rivers, could return to the Camp; nor
yet the great convotes and reenforcements, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to him out of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gallia,</hi> could get to
the Camp.</p>
                     <p>The time of year was very hard; for there
was neither old corn left of their winter provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
nor that on the ground was as yet ripe.
The cities and towns near about were all empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
for <hi>Afranius</hi> before <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s coming, had
cauſed all the Corn to be brought into <hi>Ilerda;</hi>
and that which remained, was ſince <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
all ſpent. And for Cattell (which
might have relieved this neceſſity) by reaſon
of the warre, they were removed by the border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towns, and carried farther off. Such as
were gone out to forrage, and to ſeek Corn, were
by the light-armed <hi>Portugalls,</hi> and the Buckler-bearers
of the hither <hi>Spain,</hi> much troubled and
moleſted: for theſe men could eaſily paſſe the
river, foraſmuch as none of them uſed to go
to warre, without bladders for that purpoſe.
On the contrary part, <hi>Afranius</hi> abounded with
all neceſſary proviſions: great quantity of Corn
was formerly provided and ſtored up, much was
brought in from all the Provinces round about,
there was alſo great plenty of forrage in his
Camp: for the bridge at <hi>Ilerda</hi> afforded means
of all theſe things without danger, and the
Countrey beyond the river was whole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched,
which <hi>Caeſar</hi> could not come unto by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51174:154"/>
any means. The waters continued for many
dayes together. <hi>Caeſar</hi> uſed all means to re-edifie
the Bridges; but neither the ſwelling of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
would permit him, nor yet the cohorts of the
Enemy, placed on the banks of the other ſide,
ſuffer him to go forwards with it: which they
might eaſily hinder, both in regard of the nature
of the river, and the greatneſſe of the water,
as alſo for that they might eaſily caſt their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
from along the bank, unto one place or point.
Whereby it was very hard, at one and the ſame
time (the river running ſo violently as it did)
to do the work, and to ſhun the weapons.</p>

                        <p>THe ſuddain alterations of warre are like the
changings of mens minds upon ſmall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
which are ſo forceable to ſhake our reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
as made a great Philoſopher to deſcribe a
man by the propertie of <hi>mutabile Animal,</hi> or a
changeable living creature. And it is notably ſeen
in this; That <hi>Afranius,</hi> in the compaſſe of a few
daies, triumphed of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s overthrow, and fled
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51174:157"/>
away for fear of his power. Whence we may note
the advantage coming to a party, when they ſhake
off any eminent diſtreſſe: for as the extremity
thereof threatneth ruine and deſtruction, ſo the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
bringeth with it an opinion of victorie.
And ſurely, ſuch is the condition of all ſorts of
Miſerie, that when the ſtorm is over, and the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of the affliction alaid, good times come re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
upon the Patients; as though the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

of ſuch an opportunity, muſt indeavour to improve

with the two legions which formerly he had
carried over. There remained nothing for <hi>Caeſar</hi>
to do, but with his Cavalrie to impeach and
trouble the enemy in their march. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it was a great compaſſe about to go by
the bridge (whereby it would come to paſſe, that
the Enemy would get to <hi>Iberus</hi> a farre nearer
way) he paſſed over his horſemen by the foord.
About the third watch, as <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afranius</hi>
had raiſed their Camp, upon a ſuddain the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie
ſhewed themſelves in the rere, &amp; ſwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about them in great multitudes, began to
ſtay and hinder their paſſage. As ſoon as it began
to be day-light, from the upper ground where <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
lay incamped, it was perceived, how the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the enemy was hard laid to by our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie,
and how ſometimes they turned head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and were nevertheleſſe broken and routed:
ſometimes their Enſignes ſtood ſuddenly still,
and all their foot troups charged our horſe, and
forc't them to give way; and then turning
back, went on their way again. The ſouldiers
walking up and down the Camp, were grieved
that the enemy ſhould ſo eſcape their hands,
whereby the matter would conſequently be spun
out into a long war: and went unto the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions
and Tribunes of the ſouldiers, praying them
to beſeech <hi>Caeſar</hi> not to ſpare them for any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or labour; for they were ready and willing to
paſſe the River where the horſe went over. <hi>Caeſar</hi>
moved through their deſire and importunity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he feared to expoſe his Army to a river of
that greatneſs, yet he thought it expedient to put
it to triall, and therefore commanded that the
weakeſt ſouldiers of all the Centuries ſhould be
taken out, whoſe courage or ſtrength ſhewed a
diſabilitie to undertake that ſervice: and theſe
he left in the Camp, with one legion to defend the
ſame, bringing out the other legions without
carriage or burden: and having ſet a great
number of horſes and cattell both above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the river, he tranſported his Army over.
Some few of the ſouldiers, being carried away
with the ſtream, were ſuccoured and taken up
by the horſemen; inſomuch as not one man
periſhed.</p>
                     <p>The Army carried thus over in ſafety, he
ranged them in order, and marched forward
with a three-fold battell. Such was the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the ſouldier, that albeit they had ſet a
circuit of ſix miles to the foord,<note place="margin">Three of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</note> and had ſpent
much time in paſſing the river, yet by the ninth
houre they did overtake the enemie that roſe
about the third watch of the night.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Petreius</hi> had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the legions afarre off (being terrified
with the noveltie of that purſuit) they betook
themſelves to the upper ground, and there
imbattelled their troups. In the mean time <hi>Caeſar</hi>
refreſhed his Armie in the field, and would not
ſuffer them (being wearie) to give battell: and as
the enemy tried again to go on in their march, he
followed after and ſtaied them; whereby they
were forced to incamp ſooner then was purpoſed:
for there were hills a little before them, and for
five miles together, the paſſages were very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and narrow.</p>
                     <p>By which means (being advanced between
the hills) they hoped to be free from <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie,
and by keeping the paſſages, to hinder
the Armie from following after; to the end
they themſelves might without perill or fear,
put their forces over the river <hi>Iberus:</hi> which
by all means was to be effected. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
being wearied with travailing and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all day, they put off the buſineſs to the next
morning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo incamped himſelf on the next
hill; and about midnight, ſome of their partie
being gone out from the Camp, ſomewhat far
off, to fetch water, were taken by the horſemen.
By them <hi>Caeſar</hi> was advertiſed, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with ſilence began to remove, and to lead
their troups out of their Camp. Whereupon he
commanded the ſigne of riſing to be given,<note place="margin">Vaſa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamari.</note> and
the cry (diſlodging and truſſing up their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage)
to be taken up, according to the diſcipline
and uſe of ſouldiers.</p>
                     <p>The Enemy hearing the cry, fearing leaſt they
ſhould be impeached in the night, and forced to
fight with their burdens on their backs, or to be
ſhut up in thoſe ſtraight paſſages by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s

were of opinion, that it was not poſſible to ſteal

their removing: and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s horſemen did ſo
range abroad in the night, that all places and

                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> having ſent his Cavalry before, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber
and retard the rere-guard, followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himſelf with the legions. The hindmoſt
troups of their Army were conſtrained (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intermiſſion of time) to fight with our
horſemen. And their manner of fight was
thus. Certain expedite Cohorts, free of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
marched in the rere of their Army, and
in open and champain places many of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
made a ſtand, to confront our Cavalry.
If they were to aſcend up a Hill, the nature of
the place did eaſily repell the danger wherewith
they were threatned; foraſmuch as ſuch as went
before, might eaſily from the higher ground pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them that followed after: but when they
came to a valley or deſcent, that thoſe that were
in the former ranks could not help them in the
rere, the horſemen from the upper ground, did caſt
their weapons with great eaſe and facility upon
the Enemy. And then continually they were in
great hazzard &amp; danger: and ſtill as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
near unto ſuch places, they called to
the legions, and willed them to make a ſtand with
their Enſignes, and ſo by great force and violence
repelled our Cavalry.</p>
                     <p>Who being retired back, they would ſuddenly
take a running, and get all down into the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.
And preſently again, being to aſcend into
higher ground they would there make a ſtand,
for they were ſo far from having help of their own
Cavalry (whereof they had a great number) that
they were glad to take them between their troups,
(being much affrighted with former incounters)
and ſo to ſhelter and protect them: of whom if any
chanced (upon occaſion) to ſtray aſide out of the
rout the Army held, they were preſently attached
by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s horſemen.</p>
                     <p>The fight continuing in this manner, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

their way (being very hardly laid to, and much
preſſed by our Cavalry) they took to an exceeding
high hill; and there putting themſelves into one
front of a battel, fortified their Camp, keeping
their carriages laden upon their horſes. Aſſoon

battell. For having made ſuch a ſhew of unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe
to buckle with the enemy, againſt the

howbeit he was reſolved (for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

and the rather at this time, for that the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Camp and the enemies was ſo little,
that if he had put them to flight, it could not have
much availed him, for the gaining of a perfect
and abſolute victory. For their Camps were not
above two thouſand foot aſunder;<note place="margin">Vincitur haud gratis jugulo qui provocat hoſtem.</note> whereof the
Armies took up two parts, and the third was
left for incurſion and aſſault. So that if he
had given battel in that nearneſſe of the Camp,
they would have found a ſpeedy retreat upon

legions: the ſecond, of three; and the third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
of three of each legion, following in order.
The Archers and Slingers were in the midſt,
and the Cavalry on the ſides. Being thus both
imbattelled, they ſeemed to obtain their ſeverall
ends: <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not to fight unleſſe he were forced
to it; and the Enemy, to hinder <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

they thought they went about to procure the
ſafety of all their fellows. So that the whole courſe
of his proceeding with them conſiſted of clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Howbeit their Commanders abhorred the
name of Peace, and had not kept the laws either
of treaty or truce: for they had cauſed many
ſimple men to be maſſacred and ſlain, that were
deceived by a ſhew of treaty. And therefore it
had befallen them, as it happeneth for the moſt

their ſubmiſſion, or of any other opportunity of
time, either to augment his power, or to ſtrengthen
his party: but he onely required, that thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
might be diſcharged, which for many years
together had been maintained againſt him. For
neither were thoſe ſix Legions for any other
cauſe ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the ſeventh inrolled

nor ſuch experienced and skilfull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders

theſe needed to keep <hi>Spain</hi> in quiet;) nothing
hereof was prepared for the uſe and behoof of
the Province, which (by reaſon of their long
continuance of peace) needed not any ſuch aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
All theſe things were long ago provided
in a readineſſe againſt him: New forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
were made and ordained againſt him;
That one and the ſame man, ſhould be reſident at

Conſulſhip, to the government of Provinces, as
was alwaies accuſtomed; but in lieu of them,
were choſen ſome that were allowed and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

did nothing prevail: but whoſoever they were
that in former wars had made good proof of
their valour, were now called out to command
Armies. To him onely was denied that which was
granted to all other Generalls; that when
they had happily brought things to an end, they

the Town: One next unto the Port where
the Ships lay; and the other in the way leading
from <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> into the town, juſt upon
the creek of the ſea, near unto the mouth of the
<hi>Rhoſne.</hi> For three parts of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> are in
a manner waſhed with the ſea: and the fourth is
that which giveth paſſage by land; whereof
that part which belongeth to the Caſtle (by
reaſon of the nature of the place, and fortified
with a deep ditch) would require a long and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
ſiege. For the perfecting of thoſe works,
<hi>Trebonius</hi> had commanded out of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
great ſtore of horſes for carriage, and a
multitude of men; requiring them to bring rods
to make Hurdles, and other materials for the
work: which being prepared &amp; brought together,
he raiſed a Mount of fourſcore foot high.</p>

of munition and engines, that no Hurdles
made of rods or Oſiers were able to bear out the
force thereof. For out of their great Baliſtae,
they ſhot beams of twelve foot long, pointed with
Iron, with ſuch force, as they would pierce
through four courſes of Hurdles, and ſtick
in the earth. Whereby they were forced to roof

the height of the wall, and towers, together with

make account that he did but anticipate, for a
ſmall moment of time, the fatall end of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens,
who (upon taking of the town,)
were to undergo the ſame fortune of war. Our

give way to the nimbleneſs and mobility of their

well managed. And if it happened that our men
had found means to grapple with any of their

them; whereby they coming with their full

were both very much ſhaken with the blow: for
the beak-head of one being broken off, the water
was ready to come in on all ſides. Which being

there was not offered there unto them either the

that had the charge of the
right part of the work, that it would
much advantage them againſt the
often eruptions and ſallies of the
Enemy, if they built a tower of Brick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the town wall, in ſtead of a Hold or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle:
which at firſt they made low and
little, onely for the repelling of ſuddain aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults.
Thither they uſually retreated: and
from thence, if they were over-charged, they
made defence, either by beating back, or proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
an Enemy. This tower was thirty foot
ſquare, and the walls thereof five foot thick: but
afterwards (as uſe and experience is the
maſter of all things) it was found by inſight
and industrie of men, that this tower might
be of great uſe, if it were raiſed to any height;
which was accordingly performed in this
faſhion.</p>
                     <p>When it was raiſed to the height of a ſtory, they
ſo framed the floor, that the ends of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

leaſt any thing might be thruſt out, on which the
fire which the enemy ſhould cast might take
hold: and then paved that floor, with as much
brick as the Mantelets and Gabions would
ſuffer to be laid. Upon this tarras thus made they
laid croſſe beams along the ſides, as a foundation
to an upper story, for the top and covering of the
tower. And upon theſe beams they raiſed croſſe
timbers, thwarting each other for the ſides of
the tower, and coupled them at the top with ſide
beams.</p>
                     <p>Theſe croſſe timbers were longer, and bare
further out then the ſquare of the tower; that
there might be means to faſten coverings and
defences, againſt the blows and darts of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
whileſt the workmen were finiſhing the
walls and ſides of that building. The top or upper
ſtory of this tower they likewiſe paved with brick
and clay, that no fire might faſten on it; and laid
Mattereſſes on the top thereof, to the end the
floor might not be broken with any weapons ſhot
out of Engines, nor the pavement ſhivered in
pieces with ſtones cast out of Catapults.</p>
                     <p>Moreover they made three nettings or mats of
Hawſers, equall in length to the ſides of the
tower, and four foot in breadth. And upon thoſe
three ſides which confronted the Enemie, they
faſtened them upon poles to hang before the
tower: which kind of defence they had in other
places tried to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of proof, and not to be pierced
with any weapon or engine. And as one part of
the tower came to be covered, finiſhed, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
against any violence of the enemy, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
their Mantelets and defences to the rest
unfiniſhed. The top of which tower they framed
upon the firſt ſtory, and then raiſed it up with
wrinches or ſcrues, as far as the cloſe netting
would ſerve them for a defence. And ſo covered
with theſe ſhelters and ſafeguards, they built up
the ſides with brick; and then again ſcruing up
the top higher, they fitted the place to build the
ſides higher: and as they came to the height
of a ſtory, they laid the joysts of the floor in ſuch
ſort, as the ends thereof were hid and covered
with the wall or ſides that were of brick; and ſo
from that story they proceeded to another, by
ſcruing up the top, and raiſing their netting. By
which means they built very ſafely ſix sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
without any wound or other danger at all;
and left windows and loop-holes in the ſides,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51174:169"/>
for the putting out of Engines in ſuch places as
they thought convenient. When by means of that
tower, they were in hope to defend the works near
about it, they then made a Muſculum or mouſe
of ſixty foot in length, and of two foot timber
ſquare, to conveigh them ſafely from this tower of
Brick to another of the Enemies, and to the town
wall: whereof this was the form. They cut two
ſide groundſils of equall length, and made the
space between them to contain four foot; upon
them they erected little columns of five foot
high, and joyned them together, putting braces of
an eaſie ſloping in ſuch diſtances, as the rafters
were to be placed to bear up the roof: and upon
thoſe braces they laid rafters of two foot ſquare,
faſtning them both at the ridge, and at the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
with plates and bolts of Iron. They lathed
the roof with lath of four fingers broad: and ſo
the building being made with a gable-ridge
handſomly faſhioned, the top was laid all over
with clay, to keep the Mouſe from burning; and
then covered with tiles, which were fenced with
leather, to the end they might not be waſhed away
with pipes or gutters of water, which might be
laid to fall upon them. And leaſt thoſe hides
ſhould be ſpoiled, either with fire or great
ſtones, they laid Mattereſſes upon them.</p>
                     <p>This work being wholly finiſhed near unto the
tower, through the help and means of defenſive
mantelets &amp; gabions; ſuddenly before the enemy
was aware, with a ſhip-engine and rolers put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, they brought it ſo near a tower of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that it joyned to the wall thereof. The
townſmen being upon a ſuddain appalled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
brought the greateſt ſtones they could get,
and with levers tumbled them down from the
wall upon the mouſe: but the ſtrength of the
work d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fell upon it, ſlided down the ſloping of the roof.
Which when they perceived, they altered their
purpoſe, and got pots of Roſin and Pitch, and
ſetting them on fire, threw them d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>wn upon the
Mouſe; which tumbling down from the roof,
were removed away with long hooks and poles. In
the mean time, the ſouldiers that were within the
Mouſe, pulled out the lower ſtones that were in
the foundation of the tower. This Mouſe or
Mantelet was defended by our men out of the
brick tower, with weapons and engines: and by
means thereof the Enemy was put from the wall
&amp; the turrets, ſo that they could not well defend
the ſame. Many of the ſtones being ſapped out of
the foundation of the tower, part thereof ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
fell, and the reſt leaned as though it would
not ſtand long after.</p>

of defence, gave occaſion to let them ſee the
like or better uſe thereof in the offenſive part, if it
were raiſed to a height convenient for the ſame:
which they performed with as much Art as the wit
of man could uſe in ſuch a work. For having made
the firſt ſtory, they then made the roof, for the
ſhelter and ſafety of the ſouldier: and ſcruing it
up by little and little, they built the ſides, having
fenced the open ſpace with netting, for avoiding of
danger; arming it with brick and clay againſt
fire, and with Mattereſſes againſt ſtones and
weights. And then again they proceeded to the
making of that Mantelet or <hi>Muſculum,</hi> which
gave them paſſage to the wall; building it with
ſtrong, or rather ſtrange timber, of two footſquare,
framed ſo artificially with braces, and ridging
rafters, and thoſe ſo fitted, as neither fire, water,

thus they laboured to gain their own ends, and
bought Fortune with immeaſurabe indeavour.</p>

labours and endeavours ſort to no better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
and the truce broke by the treachery of the
Enemy, it was a great gall unto them to have their
valour thus derided. And foraſmuch as there
was nothing left in all the Countrey for the raiſing
of a Mount, all the trees being already cut down,
and brought far and near to make the firſt
Mount, they began a Mount of a ſtrange and
unheard-of faſhion, raiſed with two ſide-walls of
brick being ſix foot thick a piece,<note place="margin">Pauſ. in Meſſe.</note> and joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with floors. The walls were of equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to the latitude of the former Mount,
which was all of ſolid matter: and where the
ſpace between the walls, or the weakneſſe of the
work did require it, there were piles driven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,
and beams and planks laid athwart for
the strengthening thereof. The floors, made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thoſe walls, were laid with Hurdles, and
the Hurdles were covered with clay.</p>
                     <p>The ſouldiers being thus ſheltered on both
ſides with a wall, and defended in front by
Mantelets and Gab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

danger, bring whatſoever was neceſſary for that
building; whereby the work was carried on with
great ſpeed: and the loſſe of their former conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
labour was in a ſhort time recovered again,
through the admirable dexterity and valour of
the ſouldier. To conclude, they left gates in
the walls, in ſuch places as were fittest for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
                     <p>When the enemy perceived, that what they
hoped could not be repaired again in a long time,
was with a few daies labour re-edified and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
whereby there was no place left to practiſe
deceit, or to ſallie out with advantage, neither
was there any means left by which they could
prevail, either by force of Armes to hurt our
ſouldiers, or by fire to conſume our works; and
underſtanding likewiſe, that by the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of fortification, all that part of the town
which had paſſage and acceſſe from the firm
land, might be encompaſſed with a wall and with
towers, that their ſouldiers ſhould not be able to
ſtand upon their works; and perceiving withall,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51174:170"/>
that our Army had raiſed a counter-mure, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the wall of their town, and that weapons
might be cast by hand unto them; that the uſe
of their Engines (wherein they much trusted)
was by the nearneſs of ſpace quite taken away;
and laſtly, that they were not able to confront our
men (upon equall terms) from their walls, and
from their turrets; they deſcended to the ſame
Articles of rendry and ſubmiſſion, as were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

Cohorts out of the Province to keep the temple.

for driving out the Garriſons. To them
of <hi>Gades,</hi> that they traverſed and prevented
the projects of the adverſaries, and had restored

He restored the goods confiſcated of

I here were ſome opinions which
thought, that it was very expedient to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
and take <hi>Varus</hi> Camp for that there
was nothing more dangerous then idleneſſe, for
the breeding and increaſe of ſuch imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

rather then to be forſaken and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
of their own party, and left to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
moſt grievous and extreme torments.
There were others which thought it fit, to
return about the third watch of the night to
<hi>Cornelius Camp;</hi> that by interpoſing ſome
reſpite of time, the ſouldiers might be better
ſettled, and confirmed in their opinions; and
if any miſchance further happened, they might
(by reaſon of their ſtore of ſhipping) with
more eaſe and ſafety return back to <hi>Sicily.</hi>

                        <hi>Curio</hi> miſliking both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſaid, That there wanted as much good
reſolution in the one opinion, as abounded in
the other: for theſe entered into a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of a diſhonourable &amp; unbeſeeming flight;
and thoſe were of an opinion to fight in an
unequall and diſadvantageous place. For
with what hope (ſaith he) can we aſſault a
Camp ſo fortified, both by Nature and Art?
Or what have we gained, if with great loſſe
and damage,<note place="margin">Tam boni quam mali eventus cauſae vulgo in Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferri ſolent.</note> we ſhall go away and give it
over? As though things well and happily

great good will from the ſouldier; and things
ill carried, as much hate. Concerning the
removing of our Camp,<note place="margin">Dio Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

but a ſhamefull retreat, a deſpair in all men,
and an alienation of the Army? For it is
not fit, to give occaſion to the prudent and
well-adviſed, to imagine that they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted;
nor on the other ſide, to the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed,
that they are redoubted or feared:
and the rather, becauſe fear in this kind
will give them more liberty to do ill, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

And if (ſaith he) theſe things
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51174:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are well known unto us already, that are
ſpoken of the revolt and alienation of the
Army (which, for mine own part, I think
either to be altogether falſe, or at leaſt,
leſſe then in opinion they are thought to be)
is it not better to diſſemble and hide them,
then that they ſhould be ſtrengthened and
confirmed by us? Ought we not, as we do
hide the wounds of our bodies, to cover the
inconveniences of an Army, leaſt we ſhould
miniſter hope or courage to the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?
But ſome there are that adviſe to ſet
forward at midnight; to the end (as I
imagine) that ſuch as are deſirous to offend,
may perform it with more ſcope and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.
For ſuch diſorders are repreſſed
and reformed either with ſhame or fear; to

therefore, as I am not of that courage, to

                        <p>The gluttonous uſe of fleſh hath made men

the ſouldiers having for many daies
been without corn, they were fain to ſuſtain
their extreme hunger with cattell which they had
fetched afar off. And in the ſame place, <hi>Quod

becauſe there was but little corn, he gave order
for cattell. And again, <hi>Non illi hordeum cum

is doubtleſſe a firmer nutriment, leſſe excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,

whatſoever; as containing the prime ſubſtance

                     <p>The next day, having brought out his forces,
he made a ſtand, and imbattelled them in the
ſame place where he stood in Armes the day
before. And <hi>Varus</hi> likewiſe drew out his
troups; whether it were to ſolicite the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
or not to omit the opportunity of fighting,
if it might be afforded in an indifferent
place. There was a valley (as we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
declared) between the two Armies, of
no very hard or difficult aſcent; and either of
them expected who ſhould firſt come over it,
to the end they might fight in a place of more
advantage: when upon a ſuddain, all <hi>Varus</hi>
Cavalry that stood in the left Cornet of the
Army, together with the light-armed ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that stood mingled amongst them, were
ſeen deſcending into the Valley. To them <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>
ſent his Cavalry, together with two cohorts
of the <hi>Marrucini.</hi> The Enemies horſemen were
not able to indure the firſt incounter of our
men; but having loſt their horſes, fled back to
their party. The light-armed men that came
out with them, being left and forſaken, were
all ſlain by our men, in the view and ſight of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51174:176"/>
                        <hi>Varus</hi> whole Army. Then <hi>Rebilus, Caeſar's</hi>
Legate (whom <hi>Curio</hi> for his knowledge and
experience in matter of war, had brought with
him out of <hi>Sicily)</hi> ſaid; <hi>Curio,</hi> thou ſeest the
Enemy affrighted: why makeſt thou doubt to
uſe the opportunity of time? <hi>Curio</hi> without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any other anſwer, then willing the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to remember what they had aſſured unto
him the day before, commanded them to follow
him, and ran formost himſelf. The Valley was
ſo cumber ſome and difficult, that in gaining
the aſcent of the hill, the formost could
hardly get up, unleſſe they were lifted up
by their followers. Howbeit the Enemy was ſo
poſſeſſed with fear, for the flight and ſlaughter
of their fellows, that they did not ſo much as
think of reſisting; for they took themſelves
all to be already ſurpriſed by the Cavalry: ſo
that before any weapon could be cast, or that
our men could approch near unto them, all
<hi>Varus</hi> Army turned their backs, and fled into
their Camp.</p>
                     <p>In this flight, <hi>Fabius Pelignus</hi> (a certain
ſouldier of one of the inferiour Companies of
<hi>Curio</hi> his Army) having overtaken the first
troup of them that fled, ſought for <hi>Varus,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
after him with a loud voice; as though he
had been one of his own ſouldiers, and would
either adviſe him, or ſay ſome-thing elſe to
him. And as he, being often called, looked back,
and ſtood ſtill (inquiring who he was, and what
he would) he made at <hi>Varus</hi> ſhoulder (which
was unarmed) with his ſword, and was very
near killing him: howbeit he avoided the
danger, by receiving the blow upon his tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.
<hi>Fabius</hi> was instantly incloſed about by
ſuch ſouldiers as were near at hand, and
ſlain.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the gates of the Camp
were pestered and thronged with multitudes
and troups of ſuch as fled away, and the paſſage
was ſo ſtopped, that more died in that place
without blow or wound, then periſhed either in
the battell or in the flight. Neither wanted they
much of taking the Camp; for many left not
running untill they came to the town. But the
nature of the place and the fortification of the
Camp, did hinder their acceſſe; and <hi>Curio</hi> his
men coming out, prepared onely for a battell
wanted ſuch neceſſaries as were of uſe for the
taking of the Camp. And therefore <hi>Curio</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
back his Army, with the loſſe of no one
man but <hi>Fabius.</hi> Of the Adverſaries were ſlain
about ſix hundred; and many more wounded,
who all upon <hi>Curio</hi> his departure, beſides many
other that feigned themſelves hurt, left the
Camp for fear, and went into the town. Which
<hi>Varus</hi> perceiving, and knowing alſo the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of the Army, leaving a Trumpeter
in the Camp, &amp; a few Tents for ſhew, about the
third watch, he carried his Army with ſilence
out of the Camp into the town.</p>

                     <p>While theſe things were a doing, there came
meſſengers from King <hi>Juba,</hi> ſignifying, the
King was at hand with great forces, and willed
them to keep and defend the town. Which news
did much incourage and confirm the wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and affrighted minds of the Enemy. The
ſame was alſo reported to <hi>Curio:</hi> whereunto
for a while he gave no credit; ſuch was his
confidence in the ſucceſſe of things. And now
withall, came Letters and Meſſengers into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi>
of that which <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſo fortunately
atchieved in <hi>Spain:</hi> ſo that being abſolutely
aſſured with all theſe things, he was perſwaded
the king durſt attempt nothing againſt him.
But when he found by aſſured diſcovery, that
his forces were within twenty five miles of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi>
leaving his works already begun, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
himſelf into <hi>Cornelius Camp;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
there to fortifie his Camp, to get Corn
and other proviſions, and to furniſh it with all
neceſſaries materiall for a defence: and ſent
preſently a dispatch into <hi>Sicily,</hi> that the two
legions, and the reſt of the Cavalry might be
ſent unto him.</p>
                     <p>The Camp wherein he lay was fitly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
to hold out the war, as well by reaſon of
the nature of the place, as the artificiall forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
thereof, the nearneſs of the ſea, and
the plenty of water and ſalt; whereof there
was great quantity brought thither, from the
Salt-pits near adjoyning. No ſtuffe could
be wanting, through the great ſtore of wood
which was about the place, nor yet any Corn,
for the plenty that was to be found in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
fields: and thereupon, by the advice
and approbation of all men, <hi>Curio</hi> reſolved to
attend his other forces, and to draw out the war
in length.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus diſpoſed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and liking of all men, he heard by ſome
that lately came out of the town, that <hi>Juba</hi>
was called back, by occaſion of a war happened
upon the confines, and that by reaſon of the
controverſies and diſſentions of the <hi>Leptitani,</hi> he
was detained at home in his kingdome; but
that <hi>Sabura</hi> his Lieutenant was ſent with ſome

no way ſhort of the hope which <hi>Curio</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

having travelled all night, could by no means
follow after. Whereby it happened, that ſome
ſtaied in one place, ſome in another: yet
this did not hinder or diſcourage <hi>Curio</hi> in his
hopes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Juba</hi> being advertiſed by <hi>Sabura</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict

<hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> horſe, which he kept about
him for the ſafety of his Perſon, and ſuch of
the foot-troups as he moſt truſted, to ſuccour
and relieve him: he himſelf with the reſt of
the forces, and forty Elephants, followed ſoftly
after. <hi>Sabura,</hi> ſuſpecting by the horſemen co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
before, that <hi>Curio</hi> himſelf was at hand,
imbattelled all his forces; commanding them,
that under a pretence of counterfeit fear, they
ſhould retreat by little and little; himſelf, when
occaſion ſerved, would give them the ſigne of
battell, with ſuch other directions as ſhould be
expedient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Curio</hi> was ſtrengthened in his former hope,
with the opinion of the preſent occaſion. For
ſuppoſing the Enemy had fled, he drew his
forces from the upper ground into the Plain;
wherein after he had marched a good ſpace
(the Army having travailed ſixteen mile) he
made a ſtand. <hi>Sabura</hi> gave the ſigne to his men
of beginning the battell, led on his Army, went
about his troups, to exhort and encourage his
ſouldiers. Howbeit, he uſed his foot-men onely
for a ſhew a farre off, and ſent the Cavalry to
give the charge. <hi>Curio</hi> was not wanting to his
men; but wiſhed them to ſet all their confidence
in their valour. The ſouldiers, (howſoever
harried and wearied,) and the horſemen (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
but a very few, and thoſe ſpent with
travell) yet wanted no courage or deſire to
fight. But theſe being but two hundred in
number (for the reſt ſtaied by the way) what
part of the Army ſoever they charged, they
forced the Enemy to give way: but they
could neither follow them far as they fled,
nor put their horſes to any round or long
career.</p>
                     <p>At length, the Cavalry of the Enemy began
from both the wings to circumvent our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and to mall them down behind: and as our
Cohorts iſſued out from the battell towards
them, the <hi>Numidians</hi> (through their nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
did eaſily avoid the ſhock; and again,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51174:178"/>
as they turned back to their ranks, incloſed
them about, and cut them off from the battell:
ſo that it neither ſeemed ſafe to keep their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſight, having loſt the Army commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto him; and thereupon fighting valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was ſlain.</p>
                     <p>A few horſemen ſaved themſelves from
the furie of the battell; but ſuch of the Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as ſtaied by the way to refreſh their
horſes, perceiving a far off the rout and flight
of the whole Army, returned ſafe into the
Camp. The footmen were all ſlain to a man.
<hi>M. Rufus</hi> the Treaſurer, being left by <hi>Curio</hi> in
the Camp, exhorted his men not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.
They praied and beſought him, they
might be transported into <hi>Sicily.</hi> He promiſed
them they ſhould; and to that end gave order
to the Maſters of ſhips, that the next evening
they ſhould bring all the Skiffes to the ſhore.
But ſuch was the aſtoniſhment and terrour of
all men, that ſome gave out, that <hi>Juba</hi> his
forces were already come; others, that <hi>Varus</hi>
was at hand with the legions, and that they
ſaw the duſt of the Army marching towards
them; whereas there was no ſuch matter at all:
others ſuspected the Enemies Navie would
speedily make to them; inſomuch as every
man ſhifted for himſelf: ſuch as were already
on ſhip-board made haſte to be gone. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
gave occaſion to the ſhips of burthen
to follow after.</p>
                     <p>A few ſmall Barks were obedient to the
command: but the ſhore being thronged with
ſouldiers, ſuch was the contention, which of all
that multitude ſhould get aboard, that ſome of
the Barks were ſunk with preſs of people,
and the reſt, for fear of the like caſualtie,
durſt not come near them. Whereby it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that a few ſouldiers, and Maſters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
(that through favour or pitty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
to be taken in, or could ſwim unto
the ſhips) were carried back ſafe into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
The reſt of the forces, ſending by night ſome
of the Centurions as Embaſſadours to <hi>Varus,</hi>
rendered themſelves unto him.</p>
                     <p>The next day after, <hi>Juba</hi> ſeeing the Cohorts
of theſe ſouldiers before the town, cried out
preſently, that they were part of his booty:
and thereupon gave order that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them ſhould be ſlain, and ſelecting a
few of the reſt, ſent them into his kingdome:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51174:178"/>
                        <hi>Varus</hi> complaining in the mean while, that his

for in that year he was capable
by law to be choſen thereunto. Theſe things
being ended, foraſmuch as he found that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
was very ſcant throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> and
that money ſent upon truſt was not paid; he
gave order that Arbitratours ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
to make an eſtimation of poſſeſſions and
goods, according as they were valued before the
war; and that the Creditours ſhould take them
at that rate for their moneys. For this courſe
he thought to be fitteſt, and expedient, as
well for the taking away of any fear of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
or new aſſurances, for the quitting and
aboliſhing of all debts (which do commonly
fall out upon wars and civill broils,) as alſo
for the keeping and preſerving of the Debtors
credit.</p>

uſed in ſuing for Magiſtracy (which were
taken away by a law made in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s time,

and likewiſe reformed ſuch judgements
in ſutes and trialls of law, as were given in

whereas divers ſtood condemned, for offering

                     <p>The ſecond of the Nones of January, he
weighed Anchour, having (as is formerly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)

places of danger. For doubting how he might

the empty ſhips going back to <hi>Brunduſium:</hi>

move them of <hi>Salonae,</hi> neither with promiſe
nor threatnings, he reſolved to beſiege the
Town. The place was ſtrong by nature, through
the advantage of a Hill; and the <hi>Roman</hi>
Citizens (there inhabiting) had made towers
of wood to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

too weak to make reſistance (being
wearied out and ſpent with wounds) they
fell at length to the last refuge of all; which
was, to enfranchize all their bond-ſlaves,
above the age of fourteen years; and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their womens hair, they made Engines
thereof.</p>
                     <p>Their reſolution being known, <hi>Octavius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
the town about with five Camps:
and at one inſtant of time began to force them
by ſiege, and by aſſault. They being reſolved
to undergo all extremities, were much preſſed
through want of Corn; and thereupon ſending
Meſſengers to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſought help of him. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inconveniences they indured as they
might.</p>
                     <p>And after a long time, when the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the ſiege had made the <hi>Octavians</hi>
remiſſe and negligent (taking the opportunity
of the noon time, when the Enemy was retired
aſide, and placing their children and women
on the wall, that nothing might ſeem omitted
of that which was uſuall) they themſelves, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with ſuch as they had lately infranchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
brake into the next Camp unto the Town.
Which being taken, with the ſame violence
they ſet upon another; and then upon the third,
and ſo upon the fourth, and in the end, upon the
fifth; driving the Enemy out of all the Camps:
and having ſlain a great number, they forced
<hi>Octavius,</hi> and the reſt remaining, to betake
them to their ſhips; and ſo the ſiege ended.
For <hi>Octavius</hi> despairing to take the Town,
the Winter approaching, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Camp on the other ſide of the River <hi>Apſus;</hi>
and there aſſembled all his troups and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
aids. <hi>Calenus</hi> having (according to
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s directions) imbarked the legions and
Cavalry at <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> and taken in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as his ſhipping would contain, he ſet ſail:
but being gone a little out of the Port, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Letters of advice from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that
all the Havens and the Sea-coaſt was kept
with the Enemies fleet. Whereupon he made
again into the Haven, and called back all the
ſhips: only one, holding on her courſe, without
regard of the command, carrying no ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
but belonging to private men, arrived
at <hi>Oricum,</hi> and there was taken by <hi>Bibulus;</hi>
who ſpared neither bond nor free, of as many
as were of age, but put all to the ſword. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it happened, that in a moment of time, by
great chance the whole Army was ſaved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bibulus,</hi> as is before declared, lay at <hi>Oricum</hi>
with his Navy. And as he kept the Sea and
the Ports from <hi>Caeſar;</hi> ſo was he kept from
landing in any of thoſe Countries: for all the
Sea-coaſt was kept by Guards and Watches
ſet along the ſhore, that he could neither water,
get wood, nor bring his ſhips to land upon any
occaſion: Inſomuch as he was brought into
great ſtreightneſſe and exigence, for want of
all neceſſaries; and was conſtrained (beſides
all other proviſions) to fetch his water and
wood from <hi>Corfu.</hi> And one time amongſt the
reſt it happened, that the weather being foul,
they were forced to relieve themſelves with
the dew which in the night time fell upon
the skins, that covered the Decks of the ſhips.
All which extremities they patiently endured;
and would by no means be brought to leave the
Ports, or abandon the Sea-coaſt.</p>
                     <p>But as they were in theſe difficulties, and
that <hi>Libo</hi> and <hi>Bibulus</hi> were come together, they
both of them ſpake from a-ſhipboard to <hi>M. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi>
and <hi>Statius Murcus,</hi> Legates (of whom
one was Governour of the Town, and the
other had the charge of ſuch Guards as
were along the ſhore) ſignifying, that they
would willingly talk with <hi>Caeſar</hi> of matters
of great conſequence, if they might have
leave. For a better ſhew and aſſurance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they intimated ſomething concerning a
Compoſition. In the mean time they earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſired there might be a truce: for the
thing they propounded imported matter of
great weight, which they knew <hi>Caeſar</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
affected; and it was thought that
<hi>Bibulus</hi> was able to work ſomewhat to that
purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> at that time was gone with one legion
to take in ſome towns farther off, and to ſet
a courſe for proviſion of Corn, which was
brought ſparingly unto him; and was then
at <hi>Buthrotum,</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Corfu.</hi> Being certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
there by Letters from <hi>Acilius</hi> and <hi>Murcus,</hi>
of that which <hi>Libo</hi> and <hi>Bibulus</hi> had required,
he left the legion, and returned himſelf to
<hi>Oricum.</hi> At his arrivall thither, they were
called out to treat. <hi>Libo</hi> came forth, and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Bibulus,</hi> for that he was exceeding chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
and had beſides conceived a great anger
at <hi>Caeſar,</hi> about the Aedility and Praetorſhip:
and in regard of that, he did ſhun the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
leſt a matter of that utility and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
ſhould be diſturbed by his intemperate
carriage. <hi>Pompey,</hi> he ſaid, alwaies was deſirous
that matters might be accorded, and that
Arms might be laid aſide: but they of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
could do nothing therein; foraſmuch as
by the generall reſolution of a Councell, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency
of the warre, and the diſpoſition
of all things were referred to <hi>Pompey.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
when they underſtood what <hi>Caeſar</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they would ſend inſtantly a diſpatch unto
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and be a means that he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
all things with good ſatisfaction. In
the mean time let there be a truce; and untill
an anſwer might be returned from him, let
neither Party offend one another. To this he
added ſomewhat concerning the Cauſe in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
the forces and aids. To which <hi>Caeſar</hi> did
not think it fit at that time to make any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
nor do we think there is cauſe now to
make mention thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> required, that it might be lawfull
for him to ſend Embaſſadours to <hi>Pompey</hi>
without danger; and that they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
that ſuch as he ſent, might be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
or take them into their charge, and
bring them ſafely to <hi>Pompey.</hi> Concerning the
Truce, the courſe of the warre fell out to be ſo
carried, that they, with their Navy, did keep his
ſhips and ſuccours from coming unto him; and
he, on the other ſide, did prohibite them from,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51174:183"/>
landing, or taking in freſh water: and if they
would have that granted unto them, let them
ceaſe guarding of the Coaſt; but if they would
continue that, then would he continue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Notwithſtanding, he thought the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of accord might go on, albeit theſe were
not omitted; for he took them to be no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereunto. They would neither receive
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Embaſſadours, nor undertake for
their ſafety; but referred the whole matter to
<hi>Pompey:</hi> only they inſtanced, and very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
urged for the Truce. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that all this ſpeech tended only to avoid
the preſent danger, and to ſupply themſelves
of ſuch wants wherewith they were ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,
and that there was no condition of peace
to be expected, he began to think of proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the warre.</p>

conſumed both in courage, and in the parts

put by <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
from going on with a warre that might
have given him the poſſeſſion of the Crown of

                        <p>Concerning leagues, we are to note that
there are found three differences. The firſt is,
a league of Peace:<note place="margin">Poedus Pacis.</note> which by the Apoſtles rule,
ſhould extend to all men, <hi>Habete pacem cum
omnibus,</hi> have peace with all men; and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

Jacob</hi> with <hi>Laban)</hi> may lawfully be
made with Heathen Princes; being as the
golden chain, that tieth all the Nations of the
earth in peaceable community. The ſecond is,
a league of Entercourſe,<note place="margin">Foedus Commercil.</note> or Commerce; which
is likewiſe by the ſame Patriarch, ſending
for Corn into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with <hi>Hyram</hi> king of <hi>Tyre,</hi> together
with divers other examples, allowable with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.
For Nature being rich in variety of
commodities, doth therefore divide her works
amongſt the kingdomes of the earth, that there
might be a mutuall entercourſe of exchange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the parts of the ſame. The third is, a

when I ſhall be thought to enjoy it by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
favour? neither can the opinion thereof be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
untill the warre be ended; that of my
ſelf I return back into <hi>Italy,</hi> from whence I
am come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> underſtood this, from thoſe that were
preſent when he ſpake it: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
he endeavoured by other means, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Parlce of peace. For the two Camps of
<hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> were only ſeparated by the
River <hi>Apſus,</hi> that ran between them; where
the ſouldiers had often Colloquies, and by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongſt themſelves, threw no weapon
during the time of their treaty. Whereupon he
ſent <hi>P. Vatinius,</hi> a Legate, to the River bank,
to utter ſuch things as did chiefly concern a
Peace; and to ask oftentimes with a loud voice,
whether it were not lawfull for Citizens to ſend
to Citizens, touching a treaty of peace; being
a thing permitted to the Thieves of the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neian</hi>
Mountains: or at leaſt, to move that
Citizens ſhould not in Arms contend with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.
And having ſpoken much very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully,
as well concerning his own well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
as the ſafety of all the reſt, he was heard
with ſilence by the Souldiers on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>At length, it was anſwered from the other
Party, that <hi>A. Varro</hi> did offer himſelf for a
conference the next day; ſo that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
on both ſides might come and go in
ſafety, and deliver freely their opinions: for
which a certain time was then appointed.
The next day, great multitudes of either ſide
preſented themſelves at the place aſſigned;
and great was the expectation thereof, every
man ſeeming to incline to peace. Out of which
troup ſtept forth <hi>T. Labienus,</hi> and ſpake ſoftly
touching the peace: and at laſt, entered into
altercation with <hi>Vatinius.</hi> In the middle of
their ſpeech were weapons ſuddainly caſt
from all parts: which he avoided, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and defended with weapons. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
many were wounded; and amongſt
others, <hi>Cornelius Balbus, M. Plotius, L. Tibur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
Centurions, beſides many other ſouldiers.
Then ſaid <hi>Labienus,</hi> Leave off therefore to
ſpeak of any compoſition; for unleſſe <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
head be brought, there can be no peace.</p>

                        <p>THis ſmall piece of the Story containeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
notable paſſages of extremity, in the
carriage of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and others of his Party. As
firſt (to take them as they lie) that of wilfulneſſe
in <hi>Bibulus:</hi> whom neither ſickneſſe, nor deſpair
of help could move to intermit the task he had
undertaken; but choſe rather to ſuffer unto death,
in approving his zeal to the Cauſe, then to give
himſelf a breathing time for the ſaving of his
life: and may ſerve to admoniſh any other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi>
to value his life above that which a ſtiffe
and wilfull opinion may lead him unto, beyond
the meaſure of honourable endeavour, or what
elſe may any way be juſtly expected; leaſt in
ſtriving to do much, he happen to do nothing.
For that cannot be underſtood to be well done
in another mans behalf,<note place="margin">Fruſtra ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, qui ſibi non ſapit.</note> that is not well done
in his own.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s reſolution; being ſo
extreme, as no compoſition, or other thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
could give him ſatisfaction, but only a
victorious end of that warre. Our proverb ſaith,
Better a lean agreement, then a fat remedy. And
the caſualties of warre may move an experienced
Commander, to imbrace a ſafe and quiet peace;
as knowing, that he that goeth about to vex
another, ſhall have his turn of ſuffering the like
miſeaſes: and as war beginneth when one party
liſteth, ſo it endeth when the other ſide pleaſeth.</p>

ſtrook at the root; for his head was the head
of that war. But to ſay it, rather then to do it,
was no argument of <hi>Labienus</hi> worthineſſe.
For as <hi>Polybius</hi> noteth,<note place="margin">Lib. 16.</note> It is common to moſt

the equity and indifferency of the Decree, as
through the lenity of <hi>Trebonius</hi> (who was
of opinion, that thoſe times required an eaſy
and mild execution of justice) that none were
found, from whom the beginning of the Appeal
might grow: for to pretend poverty, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

man to acknowledge himſelf to be in debt, and
yet to keep his poſſeſſions whole and untouched,
was held to be a very ſtrange impudency: ſo
that there was no man found that would
require it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, <hi>Coelius</hi> carried a very hard
hand to ſuch as ſhould have received benefit
thereby. And having made this entrance (to
the end he might not ſeem to have undertook a
ſhamefull or diſhoneſt cauſe) he publiſhed a law,
That there ſhould be no Intereſt paid for any
Monies let out upon conſideration, for thirty
ſix dayes of the time agreed on. But when he
perceived that <hi>Servilius</hi> the Conſul, and the
reſt of the Magiſtrates did oppoſe themſelves
againſt him therein, and finding it not to
ſort with his expectation (to the end he might
incite and ſtirre up the humours and ſpirits
of men) he abrogated that law, and inſtead
thereof made two others. The one, which cut
off the yearly rents that Tenants were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to pay their Land-lords, for the houſes
they dwelt in: and the other, touching new
aſſurances, and the aboliſhing of old debts.
Whereupon the multitude ran violently upon
<hi>C. Trebonius,</hi> and (having hurt divers that
ſtood about him) pulled him out of his Chair.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe things <hi>Servilius</hi> the Conſul made
relation to the Senate: who thereupon decreed,
that <hi>Coelius</hi> ſhould be removed from his Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip.
And by means of that decree, the
Conſul interdicted him the Senate, and alſo
drew him from the<note n="*" place="margin">Roſtra.</note> Speaking-place, as he

(upon a ſlack wind) overtaken our men, the

by which means they eſcaped. Yet did not he

put in with their ſhips.</p>
                     <p>This Port lay ſheltered from the South-weſt

howſoever, they accounted an ill road leſſe

they were no ſooner put in, but the wind (which
had blown ſoutherly for two dayes together)
did now moſt happily come about to the South-weſt.</p>
                     <p>And here a man may ſee the ſuddain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration

ſtood in fear of a dangerous Road, were now
by that occaſion, received into a ſafe harbour:
and thoſe which threatened danger to them,
were forced to bethink themſelves of their own
ſafety. So that the time thus changing, the
tempeſt ſaved our Party, and ſunk theirs.
Inſomuch as ſixteen of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> ſhips

One of the ſhips carried two hundred and
twenty men, of the legion made of young ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
in the other were leſſe then two hundred
old Souldiers. And here a man may ſee, what
aſſurance and ſafety conſiſteth in courage

ſouldiers, terrified with the multitude of
ſhips that came againſt them, and ſpent with
Sea-ſickneſſe, upon oath made not to receive
any hurt, did yield themſelves to <hi>Otacilius:</hi>
who being brought all unto him, were contrary
to his oath, moſt cruelly ſlain in his ſight.
But the ſouldiers of the old Legions (howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
afflicted with the inconvenience of the
tempeſt, and noiſomneſſe of the Pump) did
not ſlack any thing of their ancient valour:
for having drawn out the firſt part of the
night in conditions of treaty, as though they
meant to yield themſelves, they compelled the
Maſter to run his ſhip a-ſhore; and having
got a convenient place, they there ſpent the
reſt of the night.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as it was day, <hi>Otacilius</hi> ſent four

which ran between him and
<hi>Domitius</hi> Camp. The third day, as
ſoon as it began to be light, he
paſſed his Army over the River by a Foord,
and incamped himſelf. The next day in the
morning, he imbattelled his forces before the
front of his Camp. <hi>Domitius</hi> in like manner,
made no difficulty of bringing out his legions,
reſolving to fight. And whereas there lay a
field of ſix miles between both the Camps, he
led his troups imbattelled under <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
Camp; who nevertheleſſe refuſed to move any

                     <p>A few daies after, he laid an ambuſhment

                        <p>IT appeareth here, that to ſhew a readineſs and
reſolution to fight, upon ſuch grounds as are
juſtifiable by the rules of War, is no ſmall
advantage to the proſperous carriage of the
ſame. For albeit <hi>Scipio</hi> was great in his own
ſtrength, and as great in the opinion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of men: yet when he found ſuch an
alacrity in the Enemy, to give and take blows,
and a deſire to entertain ſeriouſly all occaſions
of giving battell; he was ſo far from proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what he had pretended, as he rather choſe
the fortune of a ſafe retreat, and conſequently, to
turn the advantage which the world in opinion
had given to his Army, to his own reproach
and diſadvantage. Whereas on the other ſide, to
be found for the moſt part unwilling to hazard
the triall of a Field, or indiſpoſed to fight upon
any occaſion, doth invite an Enemy to attempt
that, which otherwiſe he would not; and giveth
them courage to beat him from all his purpoſes,
as knowing the reſolution of their Adverſary,
and the means they have, either to take or leave
at their pleaſure.</p>

He, for the better ſecurity of the ſhipping,
had drawn all the fleet into a back angle,

ſunk a great ſhip, and ſet another by her, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

took the ſhip, having caſt out ſuch as had the
guard; who fled all away with Skiffs and Boats.
At the ſame time, being likewiſe ſeized of a

been to pretend fear (and ſo ſlight) or want of

which he first took from the very
nature of the place wherein they
were: for whereas <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
Camp was incloſed about with many high
and steep Hills, he firſt took thoſe Hills,
and built Forts upon them; and then, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of each place would bear, he made
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51174:191"/>
works of fortification from one Fort to another,
and determined to incloſe <hi>Pompey</hi> about with
a Ditch and a Rampier. And eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe conſiderations; for that he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtraightened through want of Corn, and
that <hi>Pompey</hi> being ſtrong in horſe, he might
with leſſe danger ſupply his Army from all
parts with proviſion: as alſo to the end he
might keep <hi>Pompey</hi> from forraging, and ſo
make his Cavalry unſerviceable in that kind:
and further, that he might abate and weaken
the exceeding great reputation, which <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
had attained unto amongſt forreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
when it ſhould be noiſed throughout the
world, that he was beſieged by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and durſt
not fight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pompey</hi> would by no means be drawn to
leave the commodity of the Sea, and the town
of <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> having there laid up all his
proviſion of war, Arms, Weapons, Engines of
what ſort ſoever; beſides Corn, which was
brought from thence to his Army by ſhipping.
Neither could he hinder <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
unleſſe he would accept of battel, which
for that time he was reſolved not to do. Only
it remained, as the laſt thing he could think
of, to poſſeſſe himſelf of as many Hills as he
might, and to keep as much of the Country
as he could with good and ſtrong guard; and
by that means, to diſtract, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he might, <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s forces: as according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it fell out. For having made twenty
four Caſtles and Forts, he took in twenty five
miles of the Country in circuit, and did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
within that ſpace, and there cauſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things to be ſet and planted by hand, which
in the interim ſerved as food for horſes.</p>
                     <p>And as our men perceived their fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to be carried, and continued from one
Castle to another, without intermiſsion; they
began to fear, leaſt they had left ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to ſally out, and ſo would come upon them
behind, before they were aware.</p>
                     <p>And the reaſon they made their works
thus perfect, throughout the whole inward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
was, that our men might not enter in
upon them, nor circumvent them behind.
But they (abounding in number of Men)
exceeded in their works, having alſo on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
a leſſe compaſſe to fortifie.</p>

by ſome injurie offered; whereas now it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that they were far the ſtronger, both in

all ſieges is, to keep an enemy from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of Corn: but <hi>Caeſar,</hi> being then far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
in number of ſouldiers, did nevertheleſſe
beſiege an Army of intire and untouched
forces, especially at a time when they abounded
with all neceſſary proviſions; for every day
came great ſtore of ſhipping from all parts,
bringing plenty of all things needfull: neither
could there any wind blow, which was not good
from ſome part or other.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Caeſar</hi> having ſpent all the
Corn he could get, far or near, was in great
want and ſcarcity: and yet notwithſtanding,
the ſouldiers did bear it with ſingular pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
for they remembred how they had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the like the year before in <hi>Spain,</hi> and yet
with patience and labour had ended a great
and dangerous war. They remembred likewiſe
the exceeding great want they indured at <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
and much greater at <hi>Avaricum:</hi> and yet, for
all that, they went away Conquerers of many
great Nations. They refuſed neither Barlie
nor Peaſe, when it was given them in ſtead of
Wheat. And of Cattell (whereof they were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with great ſtore out of <hi>Epirus)</hi> they made
great account.</p>
                     <p>There was alſo a kind of root, found out by
them that were with <hi>Valerius,</hi> called <hi>Chara,</hi>
which eaten with Milk did much relieve their
want; and made withall a kind of bread, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they had plenty. And when <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party
happened in their Colloquies, to caſt in their
teeth their ſcarcity and miſery; they would
commonly throw this kind of bread at them,
and ſcatter it in divers places, to diſcourage
them in their hopes. And now Corn began to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51174:192"/>
be ripe, and hope it ſelf did relieve their want,
for that they truſted to have plenty within a
ſhort time. And oftentimes the ſouldiers, in
their watches and conferences, were heard to
let fall speeches, that they would rather eat the
bark of trees, then ſuffer <hi>Pompey</hi> to eſcape out
of their hands.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, they understood by ſuch as ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the Enemy, that their horſe of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
could ſcarce be kept alive, and that the
reſt of their Cattell were all dead, and that
the ſouldiers themſelves were in no good
health, as well through the narrowneſs of the
place wherein they were pent, as alſo by means
of the ill ſavour and multitude of dead bodies,
together with continuall labour, being unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to travel and pains, but especially,
through the extreme want of water; for all the
Rivers and Brooks of that quarter, <hi>Caeſar</hi> had
either turned another way, or dammed up with
great works. And as the places were moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous,
with ſome intermiſſion and diſtinction
of Valleys, in the form and faſhion of a Cave or
Den; ſo he ſtopped the ſame with great piles
beaten into the ground, and interlated with
fagots and hurdles, and then ſtrengthened with
earth, to keep back the water: inſomuch as they
were conſtrained to ſeek low grounds, and
Mariſh places, and there to ſink Wells. Which
labour they were glad to undertake, beſides
their daily works, albeit theſe Wells ſtood far
diſtant from their Garriſons, and were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dried up with heat.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army was in exceeding good
health, and had plenty of water, together with
all kind of proviſions, excepting Wheat; which
the ſeaſon of the year daily brought on, and
gave them hope of ſtore, Harveſt being ſo near
at hand.</p>
                     <p>In this new courſe of war, new policies and
devices of warfare were invented and put in
practice by either Partie. They, perceiving by
the fires that our Cohorts in the night time
kept watch at the works, came ſtealing out,
and diſcharged all their Arrows upon them,
and then preſently retreated. Wherewith our
men being warned, found out this remedy; that
they made their fires in one place, and kept
their watch in another.</p>

                        <p>AMongſt all the parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
their Watch deſerveth a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription;
ſupplying in the Army, the office
of the naturall eye in the bodie, which is, to give
notice of any approaching danger, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
of the ſame. <hi>Polybius</hi> hath left it to
poſterity in this manner; Of each ſort of the
Legionary foot, as namely the <hi>Hastati, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes,</hi>
and <hi>Triarii,</hi> and likewiſe of the horſe,
there was choſen one out of the tenth and laſt
Maniple, that was made free from watch and
ward. This party, as the Sun began to decline,
came daily to the Tent of the Tribune, and
there had given him a little Tablet, wherein the
watch-word was writ; which Tablet they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Teſſera:</hi> and then returning to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
delivered it to the Centurion of the next
Maniple, and that Centurion to the next, and
ſo in order, untill it came to the firſt and
chiefeſt Company, which was lodged next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Tribunes; and by the Centurion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was returned to the Tribune before Sun-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                        <p>And if all the Tablets were brought in, then
did the Tribune know the word was given to
all. If any wanted, they made inquirie, and
by the notes of inſcription finding which was
miſſing, they puniſhed the default as they ſaw
cauſe. And this was their watch-word, by which
their Party was diſtinguiſhed from an Enemy;
and in likelihood (for <hi>Polybius</hi> doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
ſo much) was by the Centurion given
to ſuch of his Maniple as were to watch that
night.</p>
                        <p>Their night-watches were thus ordered; A
Maniple, or Company, was alwaies appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to watch at the Generalls Pavilion. The
Treaſurer had three watches, and every Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
two. A watch conſiſted of four men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the generall diviſion of their night
into four parts: each of thoſe four having his
turn appointed him by lot, for the firſt, ſecond,
third, or fourth watch, and the reſt ſitting
by. The <hi>Velites</hi> kept watch without the Camp,
and the <hi>Decuries</hi> of horſe at the gates. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
every Maniple had private watch within
it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Of thoſe that were appointed to watch, a
Lieutenant of each Maniple did bring to the
Tribune in the evening, ſuch as were to keep the
firſt watch of the night: and to them were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
leſſer Tablets, then were given out at firſt,
called <hi>Teſſerulae,</hi> appropriated to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
watch; one for himſelf, and three other for
his fellows.</p>
                        <p>The truſt of giong the Round was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the horſemen: for it belonged to the firſt
Commander of horſe in each legion, to give
order to his Lieutenant, to appoint before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
four young men of his troup, to go the
Round the next night; and in the evening, to
acquaint the next Commander to appoint
Rounders for the night following. Theſe horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
being thus appointed, did caſt lots for the
firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth watch, and then
repaired to the Tribune; of whom they had order
what, and how many watches to viſit, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the watch-word before from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander:
and then all four went to attend at
the Tent of the <hi>Primipile,</hi> or chiefeſt Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion
of a Legion, who had the charge of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
the four watches of the night by a
Trumpet.</p>
                        <p>When time ſerved for him that was to go the
Round the firſt watch, he went out accompanied
with ſome of his friends, and viſited thoſe
watches which were aſſigned unto him. And
if he found the watch-man waking, and in
good order, he then took that Tablet from him
which he had received of the Tribune, and
departed. But if he found him ſleeping, or
out of his place, he took witneſſe thereof,
and departed. The ſame did the reſt of the Roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as their watches fell out in courſe. And
as the day began to break, all the Rounders
brought in the Tablets to the Tribunes. And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51174:193"/>
if all were brought in, there was no more to do:
but if any wanted, it was found out by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
what watch had failed; which being
known, the Centurion was called, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to bring thoſe that were faulty. If the
offence were in the watch-man, the Rounder
was to prove it by witneſſes: if not, it fell upon
himſelf; and a Councell of war being preſently
called, the Tribune gave judgement to kill him
with a club. And in this manner did the <hi>Romans</hi>
keep watch in the Camp.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ormer. For ſome few daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> (fearing that place, leaſt our
men ſhould be circumvented with their ſhips)
had cauſed double fortifications to be made
in that place; that if (peradventure) they
ſhould be put to their ſhifts, they might never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
make good reſiſtance. But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the works, and the continuall labour
they daily endured, the fortifications being
carried eighteen miles in circuit, would not
ſuffer them to finiſh it. Whereby it happened,
that he had not as yet made a Rampier along
the Sea-ſhore, to joyn theſe two fortifications
together, for the defence thereof: which was
informed <hi>Pompey</hi> by theſe two <hi>Savoiens,</hi> and
brought great damage and loſſe to our people.
For as the Cohorts of the ninth Legion kept
watch and guard upon the Sea, ſuddenly, by the
break of day, came <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army: which
ſeemed very ſtrange unto our men: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
thereupon, the ſouldiers from a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
aſſaulted with their weapons the inner
Rampier, &amp; the reſt began to fill up the Trench.</p>
                     <p>The legionary ſouldiers, appointed to keep
the inner fortifications, having planted a great
number of Ladders to the Rampier, did amuſe
the Enemy with weapons, &amp; Engines of all ſorts;
&amp; a great number of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>chers were thronged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
on each ſide. But the coverings of Oſiers
which they ware on their head-pieces, did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defend them from the blowes of ſtones, which
was the only weapon our men had for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
And as our men were overlaid with all
theſe things, and did hardly make reſiſtance,
they found out the defect of the fortification,
formerly mentioned: and landing their men
between the two Rampiers, they charged our
people in the rere, and ſo driving them from
both the fortifications, made them turn their
backs.</p>
                     <p>This Alarme being heard, <hi>Marcellinus</hi> ſent
certain Cohorts to ſuccour our men: who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them fly, could neither re-aſſure them by
their coming, nor withſtand the fury of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
themſelves: inſomuch as what relief
ſoever was ſent, was diſtracted by the fear and
aſtoniſhment of them that fled away. Whereby
the terrour and the danger was made much the
greater, and their retreat was hindered through
the multitude of people.</p>
                     <p>In that fight, the Eagle-bearer being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
wounded, and fainting for want of
ſtrength, looking towards the horſemen; This

ſuch a diſhonour, the like whereof never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened

in ſafety. By which accident the Eagle was
ſaved: all the Centurions of the first Cohort
being ſlain, but the firſt of the Maniple of the
<hi>Principes.</hi> And now the Enemy, with great
ſlaughter of our men, approached near <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>

                     <p>The reſt of the Cohorts being greatly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,

to the number of a Legion, were brought
behind a wood into the old Camp. The ſite
of the Camp was after this manner. The
dayes before, <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ninth Legion oppoſing
themſelves againſt <hi>Pompey</hi>'s forces, and
working upon the fortifications (as is before
declared) had their Camp in that place, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
unto a wood, and not diſtant from the
ſea, above four hundred paſes. Afterwards,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> changing his mind for ſome certain
cauſes, transferred his lodging ſomewhat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off from that place. A few dayes after
the ſame Camp was poſſeſt by <hi>Pompey.</hi> And
foraſmuch as he was to lodge more legions in
that place, leaving the inner Rampier ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he inlarged the fortification, ſo that the
leſſer Camp being included in the greater,
ſerved as a Caſtle or Cittadell to the
ſame. Beſides alſo, he drew a fortification
from the right angle of the Camp, four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paſes out-right, to a River, to the end the
ſouldiers might water freely, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
And he alſo changing his mind, for ſome
cauſes not requiſite to be mentioned, left the
place too: ſo that the Camp ſtood empty for
many dayes together, and all the fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were as perfect as at the firſt.</p>
                     <p>The Diſcoverers brought news to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
that they had ſeen an Enſign of a Legion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
thither. The ſame was likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed;
from certain Forts which ſtood upon
the higher grounds. The place was diſtant
from <hi>Pompey</hi>'s new Camp about five hundred
paſes. <hi>Caeſar</hi> hoping to cut off this legion, and
deſirous to repair that dayes loſſe, left two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
at work, to make a ſhew of fortifying,
and he himſelf (by a contrary way, in as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
a manner as he could) led the reſt of the
Cohorts, in number thirty three (amongſt
whom was the ninth legion, that had loſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Centurions, and was very weak in ſouldiers)
towards <hi>Pompey</hi>'s legion, and the leſſer camp,
in a double battel. Neither did his opinion
deceive him: for he came thither before
<hi>Pompey</hi> could perceive it.</p>
                     <p>And albeit the fortifications of the Camp
were great, yet aſſaulting it ſpeedily with the

long a reſpite of time, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
thereof, took the firſt Legion
from their works, and brought
them to ſuccour their fellows: and
at the ſame time his Cavalry did approch near
our horſemen, and our men that poſſeſſed the
Camp, did diſcover an Army imbattelled co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
againſt them; and all things were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
changed. For <hi>Pompey</hi>'s legion, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a ſpeedy hope of ſuccour, began to
make reſiſtance at the Decumane gate, and
voluntarily charged our men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Cavalry being got over the rampier
into a narrow paſſage, fearing how they might
retreat in ſafety, began to fly away. The
right Cornet, ſecluded and cut off from the
left, perceiving the terrour of the horſemen
(leaſt they might be indangered within the
fortifications) betook themſelves to the other
ſide from whence they came: and moſt of them
(leaſt they ſhould be ſurpriſed in the ſtraights)
caſt themſelves over works of ten foot high
into the ditches: and ſuch as firſt got over
being troden under foot by ſuch as followed
after, the reſt ſaved themſelves in paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their bodies.</p>
                     <p>The ſouldiers of the left Cornet perceiving
from the Rampier that <hi>Pompey</hi> was at hand,
and that their own ſide fled away, fearing leſt
they ſhould be ſhut up in thoſe ſtraights, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Enemy both without and within them,
thought it their beſt courſe to return back the
ſame way they came. Whereby there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing but tumult, fear, and flight: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as when <hi>Caeſar</hi> caught hold with his
hand of the Enſignes of them that ſled, and
commanded them to ſtand; ſome for fear
left their Enſigns behind them, others forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their horſes, kept on their courſe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there any one of them that would
ſtand. Notwithſtanding, in this ſo great a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
and mishap theſe helps fell out to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
us, when the whole army was in danger
to be cut off; that <hi>Pompey</hi> fearing ſome trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
(for that, as I think, it happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his expectation, who a little before ſaw
his men flie out of his camp) durſt not for a
good while approach near the fortifications;
and our men poſſeſſing the narrow paſſages
and the Ports, did hinder the horſemen from
following after. And ſo a ſmall matter fell
out to be of great moment, in the carriage of
that accident, on either ſide. For the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
which was carried from the Camp to
the River <hi>(Pompey</hi>'s Camp being already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
was the only hinderance of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite
and eaſy victory: and the ſame thing,
hindering the ſpeedy following of their horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
was the onely ſafety and help of our
men.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe two fights, there were wanting of
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s men nine hundred and threeſcore;
and horſemen of note, <hi>R. Felginas, Tuticanus
Gallus,</hi> a Senatours ſonne, <hi>C. Felginas</hi> of
<hi>Placentia, Agravius</hi> of <hi>Puteolis, Sacrativirus</hi>
of <hi>Capua,</hi> ten Tribunes of the ſouldiers, and
thirty Centurions. But the greateſt part of
theſe periſhed in the Trenches, in the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,

without any blow or wound given them.
There were loſt at that time thirty two mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pompey,</hi> upon that ſight, was ſaluted by the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Labienus</hi> having begged all the Captives,
cauſed them (for greater oſtentation) to be
brought out in publick; and to give the more
aſſurance to ſuch as were fled thither from
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s party, calling them by the name of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſouldiers,
in great deriſion asked them
whether old ſouldiers were wont to flie; and
ſo cauſed them all to be ſlain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pompey</hi>'s party took ſuch an aſſurance and
ſpirit upon theſe things, that they thought no
farther of the courſe of war, but carried
themſelves as though they were already Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors:
not reſpecting (as the cauſe of all this)
the paucity of our men, nor the diſadvantage
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51174:196"/>
of the place, and the ſtreightneſſe thereof, the
Camp being poſſeſſed, and the doubtfull ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
both within and without the works; not
yet the Army divided into two parts, in ſuch
ſort as neither of them were able to help or
ſuccour the other. Neither yet did they adde
to this, that the fight was not made by any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
incounter, or in form of battell; but that
they received more hurt from the narrowneſſe
of the place, and from their own diſorder, then
from the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>And to conclude, they did not remember
the common chances and caſualties of warre:
wherein oftentimes very ſmall cauſes, either of
falſe ſuſpicion, or of ſudden fear, or out of
ſcruple of Religion, do inferre great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
loſſes; as often as either by the negligence
of the Generall, or the fault of a Tribune,
the Army is miſordered. But as though they
had overcome by true force of their proweſſe,
and that no alteration of things could after
happen, they magnified that dayes victory,
by Letters and report throughout the whole
world.</p>

the command either of a Tribune or Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion:
every man impoſing upon himſelf as a

deſire of fighting: inſomuch as many of the
higher Orders thought it requiſite to continue
in the place, and refer the cauſe to a battel.
But contrariwiſe, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was not aſſured of the
terrified ſouldiers, and thought it expedient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
to interpoſe ſome time for the ſettling of
their minds; fearing likewiſe leaſt he ſhould be
ſtraightned through ſcarcity of Corn, upon the
leaving of his fortifications. And therefore
without any farther delay, giving order for ſuch
as were wounded and ſick, aſſoon as it was
night, he conveighed all the carriages ſecretly
out of the Camp, and ſent them before towards

came to their lodging; and ſent one legion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to convoy them.</p>
                     <p>That being done, he retained two Legions
within the Camp: and the reſt, being led out
at divers ports, about the fourth watch of the
night he ſent the ſame way. And after a little
pauſe (for the obſerving of Military order, and
to the end his ſpeedy departure might not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered)
he commanded them to take up the
cry of truſſing up their baggage; and preſently

his Army, and ſent his horſemen before to ſtay

                        <p>THe ſecond thing which cometh to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
is the manner of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s retreat; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as exquiſite a pattern in this kind, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in any ſtory: and is the rather to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
foraſmuch as it is one of the principall
points of Military Art, and worthieſt the
knowledge of a Generall, to be able, upon all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51174:197"/>
occaſions, to make a ſafe and ſure retreat. For
thoſe that can do nothing elſe, can eaſily put
themſelves into a war: but to return them home
again in ſafety, is that which concerneth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a Leader.</p>
                        <p>Many are the cauſes that may move a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
to diſlodge himſelf, and to leave his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie
for a time: but the means to do it
ſafety depend ſpecially upon theſe two points.
The one is, To advance himſelf onward at firſt,
as far as poſſibly he can, to the end he may get
the ſtart, before the enemy be ready to follow
him: and is taught by <hi>Xenophon;</hi> who, after the
death of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in the battell againſt King
<hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> brought back a thouſand men into
<hi>Greece,</hi> from an Army of two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
horſe, that preſſed hard upon them, for five
hundred leagues together. Which retreat is
exactly ſtoried by the ſaid Author, in ſeven
books, containing all the difficulties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this point: amongſt which, we find
this paſſage.</p>
                        <p>It much imported us, ſaith he, to go as far at
firſt as poſſible we could;<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> to the end we might
have ſome advantage of ſpace before the Enemy,
that preſſed ſo near behind. For, if we once
got before, and could out-ſtrip them for a daies
journey or two, it was not poſſible for them to
overtake us; foraſmuch as they durſt not follow
us with a ſmall troup, and with great forces they
could never reach us: beſides the ſcarcity and
want of victuall they fell into by following us,
that conſumed all before them.</p>
                        <p>Thus far goeth <hi>Xenophon.</hi> And according to
this rule, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ordered his retreat: for he got the
ſtart of <hi>Pompey</hi> ſo far the firſt day, by that eight
miles he gained in the afternoon, as it followeth
in the next Chapter, that he was never able to
overtake him.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing for the aſſuring of a retreat
is, So to provide againſt the incumberances of an
Enemy, that he may not find it eaſie to attack
him that would be gone. Of all retreats which
may any way be taken from example of Beaſts,
that of the Wolf is moſt commended: who never
flies, but with his head turned back upon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries;
and ſhews ſuch teeth, as are not to be
truſted.</p>
                        <p>After the Wolfs manner marched <hi>Caeſar:</hi> for
howſoever the body of his Army retreated one
way, yet they turned ſo terrible a countenance
towards the Enemy, as was not to be endured.
And upon theſe two hinges, is turned the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of a skilfull retreat.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit, for the better furtherance hereof, it
ſhall not be impertinent to adde hereunto ſome
inventions, practiſed by great Commanders,
which may ſerve to amuſe an Enemy, while a
Generall doth prepare himſelf to obſerve the
former points.</p>

night, and was got far on his way before the

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51174:198"/>
out far off to get wood, and to ſeek forrage:
others, riſing haſtily, had left a great part of
their luggage behind them; and induced by
the nearneſs of the laſt nights lodging, left their
Armes, and went back to fetch thoſe things
that were behind. Inſomuch as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſeeing
them thus ſcattered (as before he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

gave warning to depart, and ſo led out his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and doubling that daies journey, he went
from that place about eight mile: which <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
could not do, by reaſon of the abſence of his

                     <p>The next day, <hi>Caeſar</hi> having in like manner
ſent his carriages before, in the beginning of

in his paſſage over great Rivers, and by diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult

people, a few daies before, had of
their own accord ſent Embaſſadours to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
offering all their means and abilities to be
diſpoſed at his pleaſure; requiring alſo a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of ſouldiers from him. But now they had
heard of the overthrow at <hi>Dyrrachiuml;</hi> which
was made ſo great, and ſo prevailed with them,
that <hi>Androſthenes,</hi> Praetor of <hi>Theſſalia</hi> (chuſing
rather to be a partaker of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s victory,
then a companion with <hi>Caeſar</hi> in adverſity)
had drawn all the multitude of ſervants and
children out of the Country into the Town; and
ſhutting up the Gates, diſpatched Meſſengers
to <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> for ſuccour to be ſent
unto him, in that he was not able to hold out a
long ſiege. <hi>Scipio</hi> understanding of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Armies from <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> had
brought the legions to <hi>Lariſſa:</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> did
not as yet approach near unto <hi>Theſſalia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> having fortified his Camp, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mantelets, Ladders, and Hurdles to be
made ready for a ſurprize. Which being fitted
and prepared, he exhorted the ſouldiers, and
ſhewed them what need there was (for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of their wants, and ſupplying of all
neceſſaries) to poſſeſſe themſelves of an opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and full town; as alſo by their example,
to terrifie the other Cities: and what they
did, to do ſpeedily, before it could be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured.
Whereupon, by the ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie
of the ſouldiers, the ſame day he
came thither, giving the aſſault after the
ninth houre (notwithſtanding the exceeding
height of the walls) he took the Town before
ſun-ſetting,<note place="margin">After three of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</note> and gave it to the ſouldiers to
be rifled: and preſently removing from
thence, came to <hi>Metropolis,</hi> in ſuch ſort, as
he outwent as well Meſſengers, as news of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Town.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Metropolitanes,</hi> induced with the ſame
reſpects, at firſt ſhut up their gates, and
filled their walls with armed men: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
underſtanding by the Captives (whom
<hi>Caeſar</hi> cauſed to be brought forth) what had
happened to them of <hi>Gomphi,</hi> they preſently
opened their gates; and by that means were
all preſerved in ſafety. Which happineſſe of
theirs being compared with the deſolation of
<hi>Gomphi,</hi> there was no one State of all <hi>Theſſalia</hi>
(excepting them of <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> which were kept in
with great forces by <hi>Scipio)</hi> but yielded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and did what he commanded.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> having now got a place plenteous of
Corn, which was now almoſt ripe, he reſolved
to attend <hi>Pompey</hi>'s coming, and there to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

removed from <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Camp: but every
day following, he went further off his own tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and brought his Army under the hills
whereon the Enemy lay incamped. This made
his Army daily the more bold and aſſured. He
kept continually his former courſe with his
horſemen; who becauſe they were leſſe in
number by many degrees then thoſe of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s

men, choſen out of them that ſtood before the

by reaſon of their daily practiſe, had learned
the uſe of that kind of fight. So that one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of our Cavalry, in open and champain

charge of ſeven thouſand of theirs, and were
not much terrified with the multitude of
them. For at that time they made a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

                        <hi>Pompey</hi> having his Camp upon a hill, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelled

ſee if he could get <hi>Caeſar</hi> to thruſt himſelf into
an unequall and diſadvantageous place. <hi>Caeſar</hi>
thinking that <hi>Pompey</hi> would by no means be

might upon a march find ſome occaſion to

the ſigne of diſlodging.</p>
                     <p>But as the Tents were taken down, it was a

was advanced ſomewhat further from their

when his troups were already in the gates

our removing for the preſent, and bethink
our ſelves of fighting, as we have alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired;
for we ſhall not eaſily hereafter find the

<hi>Pompey</hi> alſo, as it was afterwards known,
was reſolved (at the inſtance of all that were

of Senate taken from <hi>Caeſar;</hi> whereof one
was called the first, and the other the third:

<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cohorts, which <hi>Afranius</hi> brought with
him, made the right Cornet. Theſe <hi>Pompey</hi>
held to be very ſtrong. The reſt of the troups
were interlaced between the middle Squadron
and the Cornets. All made one hundred and
ten Cohorts, which amounted to fifty five
thouſand men: beſides two thouſand old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and men of note, whom he had called out
to that war, and diſperſed them over all the
Army. The reſt of the Cohorts, which were
ſeven, he had left in the Camp, or dispoſed
about the forts near adjoyning. The right Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was flanked with a River, that had high
and cumberſome banks: and thereupon he put
all his Cavalry, together with the Archers &amp;
Slingers, in the left Cornet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar,</hi> obſerving his former cuſtome, placed
the tenth legion in the right Cornet, and the
ninth in the left; albeit they were very much
weakened in the fights at <hi>Dyrrachium:</hi> but to
this he ſo joyned the eighth, that he ſeemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to make one of two, and commanded them
to ſuccour each other. He had in all about
eighty cohorts, which made twenty two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men: two cohorts he left to keep the Camp.
He gave the left Cornet to <hi>Antonius,</hi> the right
to <hi>Pub. Sylla,</hi> and the middle Squadron to <hi>Cn.

ſpeedily drew ſix cohorts out of the third bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,

the horſemen, and ſhewed them what he would
have done; admoniſhing withall, that the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of that day conſisted in the valour of thoſe
cohorts: commanding the third battell, and
likewiſe the whole Army, not to joyn battell
without order from him; which when he
thought fit, he would give them notice of by an

according to the uſe of war,<note place="margin">In manibus veſtris quantus ſit Caeſar ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betis.</note> he put them in

And ſo of theſe ſix Legions, which were the

his battell into a middle Squadron, and two

                           <hi>Caeſar</hi> had not hall ſo many men, and yet
made a triple battell; but not ſo thick or deep
with Legions: for in the right Cornet he put
the tenth Legion, and in the left the ninth and
the eighth; being both weak and far ſpent, by
the former overthrows. Of the other Legions he
maketh no mention: but it ſeemeth they filled
up the diſtances between the Cornets and the
body of the Army; and were as fleſh to thoſe
ſinews and bones, which out of the prerogative
of their valour, took the place of the Cornets,
and the middle bulk of the battell. And fearing
leaſt his right Cornet ſhould be encumvented
by the multitude of their Cavalry, he drew ſix
Cohorts out of his third or laſt battell, to make a
fourth battell to oppoſe the Cavalry: which got

do that endeavour to your Emperour, which
you have alwaies been willing to perform. This

<hi>Caeſar,</hi> I will, ſaith he, O Emperour, ſo
carry my ſelf this day, that thou ſhalt give me

followed voluntarily after him.</p>
                     <p>There was ſo much ſpace left between both

that the firſt running out and violence of the

they that ſtood perfect in their Orders, might
ſet upon them that were ſcattered and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
hoping the piles would not fall ſo forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

advanced forward to meet them; and that it
would fall out withall, that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſouldiers,

                     <p>Which, in my opinion, was againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
for there is a certain incitation and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity

the ſame, but rather increaſe it, and ſet
it forward.</p>
                     <p>Nor was it in vain of ancient time ordained,
that the Trumpets ſhould every where ſound,
and every man take up a ſhout but that they
thought theſe things did both terrifie the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

                     <p>But our ſouldiers, upon the ſigne of Battell,
running out with their Piles ready to be

thrown, and perceiving that <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
did not make out to meet them (as men
taught with long uſe, and exerciſed in former

and almoſt in the mid-way ſtood ſtill; that
they might not come to blows upon the spending
of their ſtrength: and after a little respite of
time, running on again, threw: their piles, and
preſently drew their ſwords, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> had
commanded them. Neither were <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
ſouldiers wanting in this buſineſs; for they
received the piles which were cast at them,
took the ſhock of the Legions, kept their ranks,
cast their piles, and betook them to their

                     <p>At the ſame time, the Cavalry, according as

Which <hi>Caeſar</hi> perceiving, gave the ſigne of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing

he had made up of ſix Cohorts; who came with

turning their backs, did not onely give place,
but fled all as faſt as they could to the highest
Hills: whereby the Archers and Slingers
being left naked without ſuccour, were all put
to the ſword. And with the ſame violence, thoſe
Cohorts incompaſſed about the left Cornet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
any reſiſtance that could be made
by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s party, and charged them behind
upon their backs.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time <hi>Caeſar</hi> commanded the

                     <p>Neither was <hi>Caeſar</hi> deceived in his opinion,
that the beginning of the victory would grow
from thoſe Cohorts which he placed in the
fourth Battell, againſt the horſemen: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he himſelf had openly spoken, in
his incouragement to the ſouldiers. For by
them firſt the Cavalry was beaten, by them
the Archers and Slingers were ſlain, by them
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Battell was circumvented on the
left Cornet, and by their means they began to
flie.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Pompey</hi> ſaw his Cavalry beaten,
and perceived the part wherein he moſt
truſted, to be amuſed and affrighted, and
diſtruſting the reſt, he forthwith left the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
and conveighed himſelf on horſeback into
the Camp. And ſpeaking to the Centurions
that had the watch at the Praetorian gate with
a loud voice, as all the ſouldiers might hear,
he ſaid, Keep the Camp, &amp; defend it diligently,
to prevent any hard caſualty that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
In the mean while, I will go about to the
other Ports, to ſettle the Guards of the Camp.</p>
                     <p>And having thus ſaid, he went into the
Praetorium, diſtruſting the main point, and yet
expecting the event.</p>

The Camp was induſtriouſly defended
by the Cohorts that had the guard thereof; but
much more ſtoutly by the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and other
ſuccours of Barbarous people. For ſuch ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
as were fled thither out of the battel, were
ſo terrified in mind and ſpent with wearineſſe,
that moſt of them (having laid aſide their
Arms and Military Enſigns) did rather
think how they might beſt eſcape, then to defend
the Camp. Neither could they which ſtood

forſook the place, and preſently fled into the

led thither by the Centurions and Tribunes
of the ſouldiers.</p>
                     <p>In the Camp were found tables ready laid
and prepared with linen, together with cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bords
of plate furniſhed and ſet out, and their
Tents ſtrewed with freſh herbs and ruſhes; and
that of <hi>Lentulus</hi> and divers others with Ivie,
and many other ſuperfluities, diſcovering their
extreme luxury and aſſurance of victory.
Whereby it was eaſily to be conceived, that they
nothing feared the event of that day, being
ſo carefull of ſuch unneceſſary delights. And
yet for all this, they upbraided <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

that all the youth of that Province, as
well <hi>Greeks</hi> as Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould come

went about by new levies to keep <hi>Macedonia,</hi> if

                     <p>Howſoever, he himſelf lay at Anchour there

them as would defray his neceſſary charges:

daies with foul weather; and there renforcing

into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Cyprus.</hi> There
he underſtood, that by the generall conſent of
the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> and ſuch Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> as
were there reſiding, the Citadell was already
taken to keep him out: and that Meſſengers
were ſent about, to thoſe that were fled from
his Party into the bordering Cities, forbidding
them to come to <hi>Antioch;</hi> for if they did, they
ſhould hazard it with the danger of their
heads. The like happened to <hi>L. Lentulus,</hi> who
the year before was Conſul, and to <hi>Pub. Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
of Conſular dignity, and to ſome other at

them, to depart from thence, and forced to

making war againſt his ſiſter, he went thither,
and ſent a Meſſenger before unto the king, to
advertiſe him of his arrivall, and to intreat him
to receive him. King <hi>Ptolemy</hi> was then but
a young man, inſomuch that one <hi>Photinus</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
all the whole Realm under him. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
a Councell of the chiefeſt and wiſeſt
men of the Court, who had ſuch credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as it pleaſed him to give them. They
being aſſembled, he commanded every man in
the Kings name to ſay his mind, touching the
receiving of <hi>Pompey,</hi> whether the king ſhould
receive him or not. It was a miſerable thing to
ſee <hi>Photinus,</hi> an Eunuch of the Kings, and
<hi>Theodotus</hi> of <hi>Chio,</hi> an hired Schoolmaſter to
teach the young king Rhetorick, and <hi>Achillas</hi>
an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> to conſult among themſelves
what they ſhould do with <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great.
Theſe were the chiefeſt Councellours of all his
Eunuchs, and of thoſe that had brought him up.</p>
                        <p>Now did <hi>Pompey</hi> ride at anchour upon the
ſhore ſide, expecting the reſolution of this
Councell: in the which the opinions were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
for ſome would not have him received, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
conſented that he ſhould be received. But
the Rhetorician <hi>Theodotus,</hi> to ſhew his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
perſwaded them that neither the one
nor the other was to be accepted. For, quoth he,
if we receive him, we ſhall have <hi>Caeſar</hi> our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and <hi>Pompey</hi> our Lord; and if we do
deny him on the other ſide, <hi>Pompey</hi> will blame
us for refuſing him, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> for not keeping
of him: therefore this would be the beſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he told them, to ſend to kill him, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they ſhould win the good will of the one,
and not fear the diſpleaſure of the other. And
ſome ſay moreover that he added this mock
withall, A dead man bites not. They being
determined of this among themſelves, gave <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chillas</hi>
commiſſion to do it. He taking with
him <hi>Septimius</hi> (who had charge aforetime un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Pompey)</hi> and <hi>Salvius,</hi> another Centurion
alſo, with three or four ſouldiers beſides, they
made towards <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Gallies, about whom
were at that time the chiefeſt of his train, to ſee
what would become of this matter. But when
they ſaw the likelihood of their entertainment,
and that it was not in Princely ſhew nor man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
nor nothing anſwerable to the hope which
<hi>Theophanes</hi> had put them in, ſeeing ſo
few men come to them in a fiſher-boat; they
began then to miſtruſt the ſmall account that
was made of them, and counſelled <hi>Pompey</hi> to
return back, and to launch again into the ſea,
being out of the danger of the hurling of a Dart.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the fiſher-boat drew near,
and <hi>Septimius</hi> roſe, and ſaluted <hi>Pompey</hi> in the
<hi>Roman</hi> tongue, by the name of <hi>Imperator,</hi> as
much as ſovereign Captain: and <hi>Achillas</hi> alſo
ſpake to him in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, and bade
him come into his boat; becauſe that by the
ſhore ſide there was a great deal of mud and ſand
banks, ſo that his Galley ſhould have no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to bring him in. At the very ſame time they
ſaw afar off divers of the Kings Gallies, which
were arming with all ſpeed poſſible, and all the
ſhore beſides full of ſouldiers. Thus, though
<hi>Pompey</hi> and his company would have altered
their minds, they could not have told how to
have eſcaped: and furthermore, ſhewing that
they had miſtruſted them, then they had given
the murderer occaſion to have executed his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
So taking his leave of his wife <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
who lamented his death before his end, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
two Centurions to go down before
him into the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> boat, and <hi>Philip,</hi> one of
his ſlaves infranchiſed, with another ſlaves, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Scynes.</hi> When <hi>Achillas</hi> reached out his
hand to receive him into his boat, he turned him
to his wife and ſon, and ſaid theſe verſes of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles</hi>
unto them;
<q>
                              <l>The man that into Court comes free,</l>
                              <l>Muſt there in ſtate of bondage be.</l>
                           </q>
Theſe were the laſt words he ſpake unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when he left his own Gally and went into
the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> boat, the land being a great way
off from his Gally. When he ſaw never a man
in the boat ſpeak friendly unto him, beholding
<hi>Septimius,</hi> he ſaid unto him; Me thinks, my
friend, I ſhould know thee, for that thou haſt
ſerved with me heretofore. The other nodded
with his head; that it was true, but gave him no
anſwer, nor ſhewed him any courteſy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pompey</hi> ſeeing that no man ſpake to him,
took a little book he had in his hand, in which
he had written an Oration that he meant to
make unto King <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> and began to read
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51174:209"/>
it. When they came near to the ſhore, <hi>Cornelia</hi>
with her ſervants and friends about her, ſtood
up in her ſhip, in great fear, to ſee what ſhould
become of <hi>Pompey.</hi> So ſhe hoped well, when ſhe
ſaw many of the Kings people on the ſhore,
coming towards <hi>Pompey</hi> at his landing, as it
were to receive and honour him. But even as
<hi>Pompey</hi> took <hi>Philip</hi> his hand to ariſe more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Septimius</hi> came firſt behind him, and thruſt
him through with his ſword: next unto him alſo
<hi>Salvius</hi> and <hi>Achillas</hi> drew out their ſwords in
like manner. <hi>Pompey</hi> then did no more but took
up his gown with his hands, and hid his face, &amp;
manly abode the wounds they gave him, onely
ſighing a little. Thus, being 59 years old, he
ended his life the next day after the day of his
birth.</p>
                        <p>They that rode at anchour in their ſhips, when
they ſaw him murthered, gave ſuch a fearfull
cry, that it was heard to the ſhore: then weighing
up their anchours with ſpeed, they hoiſed ſail and
departed their way, having wind at will that
blew a luſty gale. As ſoon as they had gotten
the main Sea, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> which prepared to
row after them, when they ſaw they were paſt
their reach, and unpoſſible to be overtaken, they
let them go. Then having ſtricken off <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
head, they threw his body over-board, for a
miſerable ſpectacle to all thoſe that were deſirous
to ſee him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Philip,</hi> his enfranchiſed bond-man, remained
ever by it, untill ſuch time as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had
ſeen it their bellies full. Then, having waſhed his
body with ſalt water, &amp; wrapped it up in an old
ſhirt of his, becauſe he had no other ſhift to lay it
in, he ſought upon the ſands, &amp; found at length
a piece of an old fiſhers boat, enough to ſerve
to burn his naked body with, but not all fully
out. As he was buſie gathering the broken pieces
of this boat together, thither came unto him an
old <hi>Roman,</hi> who in his youth had ſerved under
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and ſaid unto him; O friend, what art
thou that prepareſt the funeralls of <hi>Pompey</hi> the
Great? <hi>Philip</hi> anſwered that he was a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of his, infranchiſed. Well, ſaid he, thou ſhalt
not have all this honour alone: I pray thee yet
let me accompany thee in ſo devout a deed, that
I may not altogether repent me to have dwelt ſo
long in a ſtrange Country, where I have abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſuch miſery and trouble; but that to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
me withall, I may have this good hap,
with mine own hands to touch <hi>Pompey</hi>'s body,
and to help to burie the onely and moſt famous
Captain of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next day after, <hi>Lucius Lentulus</hi> (not
knowing what had paſſed) coming out of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi>
ſailed by the ſhore ſide, and perceived a
fire made for funeralls, &amp; <hi>Philip</hi> ſtanding by it;
whom he knew not at the firſt. So he asked him,
What is he that is dead, and buried there? But
ſtraight fetching a great ſigh, Alas, ſaid he, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it is <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great. Then he landed a
little, and was ſtraight taken and ſlain. This
was the end of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great. Not long
after <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo came into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that was in
great wars; where <hi>Pompey</hi>'s head was preſented
unto him: but he turned his head aſide and
would not ſee it, and abhorred him that brought
it as a deteſtable murtherer. Then taking his
Ring wherewith he ſealed his Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
was graven a Lyon holding a ſword, he
burſt out a weeping. <hi>Achillas</hi> and <hi>Photinus</hi> he
put to death. King <hi>Ptolemy</hi> himſelf alſo being
overthrown in battell by the River of <hi>Nilus,</hi>
vaniſhed away, and was never heard of after.
<hi>Theodotus</hi> the Rhetorician eſcaped <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
hands, and wandered up and down <hi>Aegypt</hi> in
great miſery, deſpiſed of every man. Afterwards
<hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> (who ſlew <hi>Caeſar)</hi> conquering
<hi>Aſia,</hi> met with him by chance, and putting him
to all the torments he could poſſibly deviſe, at

Howſoever, he commanded all the ſouldiers to

and having forgot the name and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> had there married

were added ſuch as were gathered from the
thieves and robbers of <hi>Syria,</hi> the Province of
<hi>Cilicia,</hi> and other finitimate Regions: beſides
many baniſhed men, and others condemned to
die, that fled thither. And for all our fugitives,
there was ever a ſure and certain receipt at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
and a certain condition of life: for
upon giving up of his name, he was preſently
inrolled a ſouldier. And if one chanced to be
taken and apprehended by his Maſter, he was
preſently reſcued by the concourſe of ſouldiers;
who being all in the ſame condition, did ſtrive
for him as for themſelves. Theſe required the
Kings friends to be ſlain; theſe were accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to rob rich men of their goods to better their
pay, to beſiege the Kings houſe, to expell ſome
out of the kingdome, and to ſend for others
home, according to an old cuſtome and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Army.</p>
                     <p>There were beſides two thouſand horſe, that
had been of ancient continuance in many of
the wars held at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and had brought
back <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the father, and reſtored him to
his kingdome; had ſlain <hi>Bibulus</hi> two ſons, and
had made war with the <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> and this
uſe and knowledge they had of war. <hi>Achillas</hi>
truſting to theſe forces, and contemning the
ſmall number of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s troups, did take and
poſſeſſe <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and further, aſſaulting that
part of the town which <hi>Caeſar</hi> held with his
men, did firſt of all endeavour to break into his
houſe. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> having dispoſed the cohorts
in the ſtreets and waies, did bear out the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.
At the ſame time they ſought likewiſe at
the Port, and it came at length to a very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
incounter: for having drawn out their
troups, the fight began to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ot in divers
ſtreets and lanes; and the Enemy (in great
troups) went about to poſſeſſe themſelves of the
Gallies, of which there were 50. found there,
that were ſent to ſerve <hi>Pompey,</hi> and returned
home again after the battell in <hi>Theſſalia.</hi> Theſe
were all Triremes and Quinqueremes, rigged,
and ready to go to ſea.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, there were twenty two, which
were alwaies accuſtomed to be the beſt, for the
defence of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and were all furniſhed
with decks: which if they had taken, together
with <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſhipping, they would have had the
Haven and the Sea at their command; and by
that means, hindered <hi>Caeſar</hi> from ſuccours
and proviſion of victuall. In regard whereof
they fought hard on both ſides; <hi>Achillas</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
victory, and our men for their ſafety.
But <hi>Caeſar</hi> obtained his purpoſe: and becauſe
he was not able to keep ſo many ſeverall things
with ſo ſmall forces, he ſet them all on fire, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with thoſe that were in the Road, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
landed ſome ſouldiers at <hi>Pharus;</hi> which
is a tower in an Iland, of a great height, &amp; built
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51174:210"/>
with ſtrange workmanſhip, taking that name
from the Iland. This Iland lieth over againſt
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſo maketh it a Haven. But
former Kings had inlarged it nine hundred
paces in length, by raiſing great mounts in the
Sea: and by that means had brought it ſo near
to the town, that they joyned them both together
with a bridge.</p>
                     <p>In this Iland dwelt divers <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and
made a Village of the bigneſſe of a Town: and
what ſhips ſoever had fallen off their courſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by tempeſt or errour, were there robbed by
thoſe <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> For by reaſon of the narrow
entrance, no ſhips can come into the Haven, but
by the favour and leave of them that hold
<hi>Pharus. Caeſar</hi> being afraid of this, while the
Enemy was buſie in fight, landed his ſouldiers,
took the place, and there put a garriſon. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he brought it to paſſe, that both corn and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
might ſafely come by ſea to ſupply him:
for he had ſent to all the confining Regions for
aide. In other places of the town they ſo fought,
that they gave over at length upon equall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
(which happened by reaſon of the
narrowneſs of the paſſages) and a few of each
ſide being ſlain, <hi>Caeſar</hi> took in ſuch places as
were moſt convenient for him, &amp; fortified them
in the night. In this quarter of the Town was
contained a little part of the Kings houſe
(wherein he himſelf, at his firſt arrivall, was
appointed to lodge) and a Theatre joyned to
the houſe, which was in ſtead of a Caſtle, and
had a paſſage to the Port, and to other parts of
Road. The daies following he increaſed theſe
fortifications, to the end he might have them
as a wall againſt the enemy, and thereby need
not fight againſt his will.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the younger daughter of
King <hi>Ptolemey</hi> hoping to obtain the Crown now
in queſtion, found means to conveigh herſelf
out of the Kings houſe to <hi>Achillas;</hi> and both
joyntly together undertook the managing of
that war. But preſently there grew a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
between them, who ſhould command in
Chief; which was the cauſe of great largeſs
and rewards to the ſouldiers, either of them
being at great charges and expences to gain
their good wills.</p>
                     <p>While the Enemy was buſied in theſe things,
<hi>Photinus,</hi> the Governour of the young King, &amp;
Superintendent of the kingdome on <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Achillas,</hi> exhorting him
not to deſiſt in the buſineſs, or to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
Upon the diſcovering and apprehenſion of
which Meſſengers, <hi>Caeſar</hi> cauſed him to be
ſlain. And theſe were the beginnings of the

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that all <hi>Gallia</hi> was ſubdued,
foraſmuch as <hi>Caeſar</hi> had reſted no
part of the former Summer from
warre, he was deſirous to refieſh
his Souldiers after ſo great pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the reſt of the winter ſeaſon; when news
was brought him that many States at the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
time, did lay their heads together again
about warre, and make conſpiracies. Whereof
there was reported a very likely cauſe; in
that it was known to all the <hi>Galles,</hi> that there
could not any power ſo great be aſſembled into
one place, as ſhould be able to withſtand the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
neither if many States at once made war
in divers places at one inſtant, could the army of
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſufficient, either of aid,
or of time, or of men of warre to purſue all at
once: and there ought not any State to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the lot of their misfortune, if by the reſpite
thereof, the reſt might ſet themſelves at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p>The which opinion to the intent it ſhould not
ſettle in the minds of the <hi>Galles, Caeſar</hi> leaving
<hi>M. Antonius</hi> the Quaeſtor with charge of
his winter garriſons, went with a ſtrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of horſemen the laſt day of <hi>December</hi>
from <hi>Bibracte</hi> to his twelfth Legion, which he
had placed not farre from the borders of the
<hi>Hedui,</hi> in the countrey of the <hi>Bituriges,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
thereunto the eleventh Legion which was
next unto it. Leaving two Cohorts to defend
his ſtuff and carriages, he led the reſt of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
into the moſt plentifull fields of the <hi>Bituri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:</hi>
the which being a large countrey and full
of towns, could not be kept in aw with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoning
of one Legion amongſt them, but
that they prepared for warre and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies.</p>
                     <p>By the ſudden coming of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> it came to
paſſe (which muſt needs happen to ſuch as are
unprovided and ſcattered abroad) that ſuch as
were tilling the ground without fear, were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in the fields by our horſemen, before they
could get them into the Towns. For at that time,
the common token of invaſion which is wont
to be perceived by burning of houſes, was by
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s commandment forborn, leſt they
ſhould either want forrage and corn if they were
minded to make any further rode into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
or elſe, that their enemies for fear of the
fires, ſhould convey themſelves out of the way.</p>
                     <p>After that many thouſands of men had been
taken, the <hi>Bituriges</hi> being ſore afraid, ſuch
of them as could eſcape out of the <hi>Romans</hi> hands
at their firſt coming, upon confidence either of
the old acquaintance and familiarity that had
been privately between them, by reaſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting
as gueſts one to another, or of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
agreement and partaking in the ſame devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
fled into the next cities: but all was in vain.
For <hi>Caeſar</hi> by great journeys came ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon all places, that he gave not any city lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to think of the ſafeguard of other folks ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then of themſelves. Through the which
ſpeed, he both kept his friends faithfull unto
him, and put the wavering ſort in ſuch fear, that
he compelled them to be glad to receive peace.</p>
                     <p>The matter ſtanding in this caſe, when the
<hi>Bituriges</hi> ſaw that through <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s gentleneſſe
there was yet a way for them to return into his
favour again, and that the next States had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him hoſtages, and were thereupon recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to mercy, without further puniſhment: they
themſelves did in like wiſe. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> becauſe his
men had patiently endured ſo great travell in the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51174:213"/>
winter dayes, through moſt cumberſome wayes,
in intolerable cold weather, and continued moſt
reſolutely in the ſame to the uttermoſt, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to give to his ſouldiers two hundred ſeſterces
apiece, and to the Captains 2000 apiece, in the
name of a prey: &amp; ſo ſending his Legions again
into their wintering places, he himſelf returned
to <hi>Bibracte</hi> the fourtieth day after his ſetting
forth. There as he was miniſtring of Juſtice,
the <hi>Bituriges</hi> ſent meſſengers unto him, deſiring
help againſt the <hi>Carnutes,</hi> whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to make warre upon them.</p>
                     <p>Upon the receit of this news, when he had
not lain in garriſon paſt eighteen dayes, he
draweth the fourteenth and ſixteenth Legions
out of garriſon from the river <hi>Arar,</hi> where he
had placed them for the ſpeedy purveiance of
corn and victuall, as was ſhewed you in the laſt
book: and with thoſe two Legions went to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
the <hi>Carnutes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When our enemies heard of the coming of
our army, the <hi>Carnutes</hi> moved with the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of others, left their towns and villages that
they dwelt in, which they had made upon the
ſudden with little cottages for neceſſities ſake to
keep off the winter; (for ſince they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
of late, they had lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> many of their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
towns:) and fled ſcattering abroad. <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
foraſmuch as he would not put his ſouldiers to
the abiding of the unſeaſonable ſharp ſtorms
which chiefly at that time fell, encamped himſelf
within <hi>Genabum,</hi> a town of the <hi>Carnutes,</hi> and
houſed his ſouldiers partly in the buildings of
the <hi>Galles,</hi> and partly in ſuch buildings as being
unfiniſhed they thatched in haſte with the ſtraw
that was brought in to cover their tents and
cabines. Nevertheleſſe he ſendeth abroad his
horſemen and auxiliary footmen into all parts
whither he heard his enemies reſorted: and that
was not in vain; for commonly our men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
ever with a great booty.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carnutes</hi> being put to it with the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the winter, and the terrour of the danger,
being driven out of houſe and home, and not
daring to ſtay any where any long time, the
woods being not able to defend them from the
bitterneſſe of the ſtorms, were ſcattered abroad,
and with the loſſe of a great part of them, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
into the next cities.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Aeſar</hi> at that hard time of the year,
thinking it enough to diſperſe the
powers that were aſſembling, to
the intent no beginning of warre
might ſpring up, and weighing how
much it concerned him, to prevent any open
warre from breaking out the beginning of the
next ſummer; he placed <hi>G. Trebonius</hi> in garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at <hi>Genabum</hi> with thoſe two Legions that
he had there about him: and foraſmuch as he
was by often meſſages certified from the men of
<hi>Rhemes,</hi> that the <hi>Bellovaci</hi> (who excelled all
<hi>Galles</hi> and the <hi>Belgae</hi> alſo in military fame) and
the States adjoyning unto them, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Corbeus</hi> of <hi>Beanvoys</hi> and <hi>Comius</hi> of
<hi>Arras,</hi> levied men of warre, and aſſembled
them into one place, to the intent with their
whole power to invade the borders of the <hi>Sueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones,</hi>
which were appertaining to the men of
<hi>Rhemes;</hi> thinking it ſtood not only upon his
honour, but alſo tended to his own ſecurity for
the future, to ſave his allies, which had deſerved
well of the Commonweal, from diſpleaſure and
damage, he called the eleventh legion again
out of garriſon. Moreover he wrote to <hi>C. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
to bring the two legions that he had, into
the confines of the <hi>Sueſſiones;</hi> and ſent for one
of thoſe two legions that were with <hi>T. Labi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus.</hi>
So according as his garriſons lay for the
purpoſe, and as the ſlate of the warre required,
to his own continuall trouble, he put ſometimes
one of his legions and ſometimes another, to
march from their quarters.</p>
                     <p>With this power that he had aſſembled he
went againſt the <hi>Bellovaci:</hi> and encamping
himſelf in their countrey, ſent abroad his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
into all quarters to glean up ſome of them,
by whoſe means he might learn what his enemies
purpoſed to do. His horſemen doing their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
brought word how few were found in the
houſes, and thoſe not ſuch as had ſtayed behind
to till the ground, (for they were purpoſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
out of all places) but ſuch as had been
ſent back again to ſpie. Of whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
in what place the forces of the <hi>Bellova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci</hi>
were, and what was their intent; found that
all the <hi>Bellovaci</hi> were gathered together into
one place: and that the <hi>Ambiani, Aulerci,
Caletes, Velocaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Attrebates</hi> had choſen
a very high ground to encamp in, encloſed with
a troubleſome mariſh, and had conveyed all
their ſtuff into woods that were farther off:
Of the which warre there were many Noblemen
that were ringleaders, but the multitude obeyed
<hi>Corbeus</hi> chiefly, becauſe they underſtood that he
hated moſt the name of the people of <hi>Rome:</hi>
And that <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras</hi> was a few dayes
before gone to fetch aid of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who
were their next neighbours, and ſwarmed in
multitude of people. He learned moreover at
their hands, that the <hi>Bellovaci</hi> by the conſent
of all the Noblemen, at the earneſt inſtance of
the Commons, were determined, if <hi>Caeſar</hi> came
(as it was ſaid he would) but with three legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to offer him battell, leſt afterward to more
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51174:213"/>
diſadvantage and hinderance they ſhould be
compelled to encounter with his whole hoſt:
And if he brought a greater power with him,
then to keep themſelves ſtill in the ſame ground
that they had choſen, and by ambuſhes to keep
the <hi>Romans</hi> from forrage (which by reaſon of
the time of the year was ſcarce, and alſo lay
ſcattering) and from corn, and other victuals
and things neceſſary for their army.</p>
                     <p>The which things when <hi>Caeſar</hi> underſtood
by the concurring report of many, conſidering
how ſtill of wiſdome this project was, and how
farre from the raſhneſſe that the barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are wont to uſe, he determined to make the
beſt advantage of all things, to the intent his
enemies diſdaining his ſmall company, ſhould
make the more haſte to come into the field. For
he had three old practiſed legions, the ſeventh,
eighth, and ninth, of ſingular valour and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe;
and the eleventh, which was of choſen
young men of great hope and towardneſſe,
which having at that time received eight yeares
wages, was notwithſtanding look'd upon as
not comparable to the other three either for
ſtanding, or for valour and courage.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore ſummoning an aſſembly, and
there declaring all things that had been reported
unto him, he confirmed the hearts of the common
ſouldiers, if peradventure with the number of
three legions he might draw out his enemies to
fight with him in the field. He ſet his battel in
this order: the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
went before the carriages, and the eleventh
cloſed in the rere thereof; the which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
was but ſmall, as it is wont to be in
ſuch expeditions: and this he did, leſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſhould find a greater number then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
By this means, in a ſquare battel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
he brought his hoſt in ſight of his enemies
ſooner then they looked for him.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Galles</hi> beheld theſe legions, ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſet in order, marching toward them apace,
as it had been in a pitched field (whereas it was
reported to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that they intended to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on their buſineſſe with confident boldneſſe,)
whether it were for the perill of the encounter, or
the ſuddenneſſe of our coming, or that they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee what we intended to do, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in order of battel before their camp, and
would not deſcend from the higher ground.
Albeit that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was deſirous to have fought
with them, yet wondering at the great number
of his enemies, he pitched his camp directly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
againſt theirs, on the other ſide of a valley,
which was more in deepneſſe downward, then
in wideneſſe any way at the bottom. This
camp he commanded to be fortified with a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
of twelve foot, and an open gallery to be
builded upon it according to the meaſure of the
ſame height, and a double ditch to be made of
fifteen foot apiece, with ſides plumme down,
and many turrets to be reared of three ſtories
high, and to be joyned together with draw-Bridges
to let down at pleaſure, the fronts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were fenced with grates of wicker; to the
intent the enemy might be repulſed with double
rows of defendants: of which the one from
the Bridges, the more out of danger they were by
reaſon of the height, ſo much the boldlier and
the farther off might they ſend their darts; the
other the nearer they were placed to their enemy
upon the Rampier, ſo much the better ſhould
they be covered from the artillery that might fall
down upon them: and over the gates he made
high towers. This kind of fortification was to
two good purpoſes: for by the greatneſſe of his
works and his pretence of fear, he hoped to put
the barbarous <hi>Galles</hi> into a great confidence;
and whenſoever he ſhould have occaſion to ſend
out farre for forrage or victuals, he ſaw that the
camp might be defended with a ſmall power,
the ſtrength of the fortifications was ſo great. In
the mean while, parties on both ſides would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times go out and skirmiſh in the mariſh
that was between our two camps: the which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
either the <hi>Galles</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> that
were of our hoſt would paſſe, and eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
their enemies; or elſe in like manner our
enemies paſſing over it, did ſend our men far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off.</p>
                     <p>It happened in our daily forraging (as there
was no other ſhift, foraſmuch as we were fain
to fetch forrage at houſes that ſtood ſcattering
farre a ſunder) that our forrages being diſſevered
in diſadvantageous places, were entrapped. The
which thing as it was ſome loſſe to us of our
beaſts of carriage, and ſlaves, ſo it heightened
the fooliſh courages of the barbarous <hi>Galles:</hi>
and that ſo much the more, becauſe <hi>Comius</hi> of
<hi>Arras</hi> (who we ſaid before was gone to fetch
aid of the <hi>Germans)</hi> was returned with ſome
horſe; of whom although there was not above the
number of five hundred, yet the <hi>Galles</hi> were
puffed up at the coming of the <hi>Germans.</hi>

where they were with any fortifications, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

ſend for the thirteenth legion which wintered
amongſt the <hi>Bituriges,</hi> under <hi>T. Sextius</hi> the

he had called forth a great number, to ſafe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

                     <p>This being done day by day, and our men ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
now leſſe heed, becauſe it was an ordinary
matter with them, (which thing for the moſt part
cometh to paſſe by daily cuſtome) the <hi>Bellova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci</hi>
with a band of choſen footmen, knowing the
places where our horſemen daily kept their
ſtandings, laid ambuſhes in woody places: and
the next day they ſent thither their horſemen,
firſt to draw cut our men into the danger of their
ambuſhments, and then to aſſail them as they
were encloſed. The lot of this ill luck lighted
upon the men of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> whoſe turn it was to
perform the duty that day. For they, when
they had eſpied the horſemen of their enemies
upon the ſuddain, deſpiſing them becauſe they
wereleſſe in number, followed them over-gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and were encloſed by the footmen. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
being diſordered, they retired more haſtily
then horſemen are accuſtomed to do in battell,
with the loſſe of <hi>Vertiſco</hi> the Prince of their
State, and Captain of their horſemen. Who
being ſcarce able to ſit upon a horſe by reaſon

to the cuſtome of the <hi>Galles)</hi> neither ſeek to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden
himſelf of the Captainſhip by excuſe of
his age, nor ſuffer the encounter to be fought
without him. With this lucky battell, wherein
they ſlew the Prince and Captain of the men of

heightened and raiſed: and our men were taught
by their own harm, to ſearch the places better
where they ſhould keep their ſtandings, and to
follow their enemy more adviſedly when he
fled. In the mean while ceaſed not the daily
skirmiſhes in the ſight of both our Camps, which

did for very ſhame) fled farther off. With

made bridges over the mariſh, and paſſing over
his army, got quickly into the plain of the ſaid
ridge, the which on two ſides was fortified with
a ſteep deſcent. There embattelling his men, he
came to the fartheſt end of the ridge: and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his battels in ſuch a place, from whence
with an engine artillery might be ſhot amongſt
the thickeſt of the enemies.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Galles</hi> truſting to the advantage of the
place, when they would neither have refuſed the
encounter, if perchance the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould
have adventured up the hill againſt them, nor
yet durſt by little and little diminiſh their battel
by ſevering themſelves, leſt when they had been
out of array, they might hap to have been ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

kept themſelves in order of battel. Whoſe
wilfulneſſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> perceiving, kept twenty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
in a readineſſe, and pitching his tents in
the ſame place, commanded his camp ſhould be
fortified. As ſoon as the works were finiſhed,
he ſet his Legions in array before the Rampier,
and appointed the horſemen to their ſtandings
with their horſes ready bridled.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Bellovaci</hi> ſaw the <hi>Romans</hi> in a
readineſſe to purſue them, and that themſelves
could not without perill either lodge that night,
or continue any longer in the ſame place where
they were, they deviſed this ſhift to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
In the place where they were ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(for it is declared in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
how the <hi>Galles</hi> are wont to ſit down
in the battel) they received from hand to hand
one of another bundles of ſtraw and fagots,
whereof there was great ſtore in their camp, and
caſt it all on a heap before their battell, and in
the later end of the day, at a watch-word that
was given, they ſet it on fire all at one inſtant:
by means whereof the continuall flame ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took away the ſight of all their army from
the <hi>Romans:</hi> and therewithall the ſavage
<hi>Galles</hi> fled away as faſt as their legs could bear
them.</p>
                     <p>Albeit that <hi>Caeſar</hi> could not perceive the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
of his enemies, by reaſon of the flame
that was betwixt them; yet notwithſtanding,
foraſmuch as he ſuſpected it to be a deceit practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by them, that they might the ſafelier fly away;
he marched his footmen forward, and ſent his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orſemen to purſue them. Howbeit for fear of
treachery in the buſineſſe, leaſt perhaps his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſhould abide ſtill in the ſame place, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
draw us forth into a ground of diſadvantage,
he went the ſlower pace. His horſemen fearing
to venture into the ſmoke and thick flame (and
if any were ſo reſolute as to enter it, they could
ſcarce ſee the fore-parts of their own horſes) leſt
they ſhould be intrapped, gave the <hi>Bellovaci</hi>
free liberty to recover themſelves whither they
would. Thus our enemies by their flight,
which was mixt with fear and ſubtilty, eſcaping
without any loſſe, went but ten miles off, and
encamped themſelves in a very advantageous
ground. From whence by laying ambuſhes
both of horſe and foot in divers places, they did
the <hi>Romans</hi> great diſpleaſure as they went a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging.</p>
                     <p>After this had happened many and ſundry
times, <hi>Caeſar</hi> learned of a captive, that <hi>Corbeus,</hi>
Captain of the <hi>Bellovaci,</hi> had choſen out of his
whole hoſt, ſix thouſand of the valianteſt foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and a thouſand horſemen, which he
had laid in ambuſh in the ſame place whether
(for the plenty of proviſion and corn that was
there) he judged the <hi>Romans</hi> would ſend to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
                     <p>This being known, <hi>Caeſar</hi> bringeth forth
more legions then uſuall, and ſendeth his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
before as he was wont to do, to ſafe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
his forragers. Among them he mingleth
for their aſſiſtance many light-armed footmen,
and himſelf with his legions followeth as near as
poſſibly he might. The enemies that were laid
in ambuſh, having choſen a field for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
not above a mile over every way, environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
round about, either with cumberſome woods,
or elſe a very deep river, beſet it with their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhment,
as it had been with a toil.</p>
                     <p>Our men, foraſmuch as they were privy to the
deſign of their enemies beforehand, being ready
both with heart and hand to fight, ſeeing their
legions followed hard after them, would refuſe
no encounters but went rank by rank down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſaid place. At whoſe coming, <hi>Corbeus</hi>
thinking an occaſion of doing ſome good to be
fallen into his hands, firſt diſcovereth himſelf
with a ſmall number, and giveth charge upon the
next troups. Our men ſtoutly withſtand the
brunt, &amp; flock not many into one place at once;
which in skirmiſhes of horſe is wont commonly
to happen through fear, and their cluſtering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
turneth to their own loſſe. They being
thus engaged in ſmall parties, and having a care
ſtill that their fellows ſhould not be circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the reſt brake out of the woods while <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus</hi>
was fighting. Then was the encounter
hot and doubtfull. After it had continued indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
a good ſpace, by little and little came their
footmen in array out of the woods, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
our horſemen to give back. But they
were quickly relieved again by the light-armed
footmen, which as was ſaid were ſent before our
legions, who being intermixed among the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
fought ſtoutly.</p>
                     <p>The encounter continued a good while doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
But as the courſe of warre requires, they
that had withſtood the firſt brunt of them that
lay in ambuſh for them, had thus much the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that they received not unawares any
foil at their hands. In the mean while our legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
drew nearer, and divers meſſengers brought
word both to our men and to our enemies at one
and the ſame time, that the Generall was at hand
with his army in battel array. Which thing
being known, our horſemen truſting to the help
of the Cohorts, lay about them very eagerly, leſt
if they ſhould have delayed the matter, they
might have given the footmen part of the honour
of the victory. Upon this our enemies hearts
began to fail; and they ſought to fly by ſeverall
wayes: but all was in vain. For by the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the ſame places in which they would
have incloſed the <hi>Romans,</hi> were they themſelves
taken tardy and could not get out. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
being vanquiſhed and altogether out

<hi>Corbeus,</hi> whoſe heart could by no misfortune

could by the entreaty of our men be perſwaded

would not be reduced to obedience by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

the commander of the horſe, a man of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
courage and wiſdome, having encouraged
his men and overtaken the body of his enemies,
diſpoſed certain of his troups in places conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
and with the reſt of his horſemen gave
charge upon his enemies. The cavalry of the
enemy fought ſo much the more boldly, becauſe
their foot were ready to aſſiſt them, who being
mingled through the whole army, as often as
occaſion was, did ſuccour them againſt our men.
The encounter was very ſharp. For our men
deſpiſing them whom they had vanquiſhed the
day before, and remembring that the legions
followed at their heels, aſhamed to give ground,
and deſirous to get the day before their coming,
fought very valiantly againſt the footmen. On
the other ſide, our enemies believing that no
greater forces of ours were behind, according as
they had ſeen the day before, thought a fair
opportunity offered them to deſtroy our caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
utterly.</p>
                     <p>When they had fought a good while very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly,
<hi>Dumnacus</hi> made a battel to relieve his
Cavalry, when occaſion ſhould be. But on the
ſuddain our enemies eſpied our legions coming
up cloſe together: at the ſight of whom their
horſe were ſtricken into ſuch a fear, and the foot
ſo amazed, that breaking through their carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
with great clamour and confuſion they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themſelves every where to flight. Then our
Cavalry, who a little before had their hands
full, being heartened with joy of the victory,
raiſed a great ſhout on all ſides, and caſting
themſelves amongſt them as they fled, made
ſlaughter of them as farre as their horſes breaths
would ſerve to purſue them, and their arms were
able to ſtrike them. Inſomuch that having ſlain
above twelve thouſand men, armed, and ſuch as
for fear had caſt away their arms, they took all
their carriages, none eſcaping.</p>

were great, which if they ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to carry privily away, they could not eſcape
either our horſemen or footmen: he divided his
Cohorts into three parts, and made three Camps
upon a very high ground; from which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
as his army was able, he determined to
draw a Rampier and trench round about the
town.</p>
                     <p>The townſmen perceiving that, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the miſerable condition of <hi>Alexia,</hi> feared
the like ſiege. <hi>Luterius</hi> eſpecially, who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
the ſmart of that misfortune, adviſed them
to lay for corn beforehand: whereupon they
determined by generall conſent, that leaving a
part of the army for the defence of the town,
<hi>Luterius</hi> and <hi>Drapes</hi> with the beſt-provided,
ſhould go forth to fetch in corn. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
being approved of, the next night <hi>Drapes</hi>
and <hi>Luterius,</hi> leaving two thouſand armed
men behind them, drew the reſt out of the town.
After a few dayes being abroad, they brought
in a great quantity of grain out of the countrey
of the <hi>Cadurci,</hi> who partly were willing to help
them therewith, and partly durſt not withſtand
their taking it, as not being able to make their
part good againſt them. Oftentimes alſo they
would fly out in the night, and aſſault the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
of our camp. Upon which conſideration
C. <hi>Caninius</hi> ſtayed the making of fortifications
round about the town, leſt he ſhould not be able
to defend the circumvallation when it was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
or elſe ſhould be forced to ſet but weak
watches in ſo many places at once.</p>
                     <p>When they had gotten together a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of grain, <hi>Drapes</hi> and <hi>Luterius</hi> took up
their ſtandings not above ten miles from the
town, the better at times to convey it in; and
they parted the charge between them. <hi>Drapes</hi>
tarried behind with part of the army to keep
the Camp: <hi>Luterius</hi> drave the beaſts with their
carriages toward the town: and ſetting guards
there for his defence, about ten of the clock in
the night purpoſed by narrow wayes through the
woods, to convey the corn into the town. The
watchmen of our Camp hearing the noiſe of
their feet, and the ſcouts which were ſent out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
what was a doing, <hi>Caninius</hi> cauſed his
Cohorts to arm themſelves quickly, and about
break of day made attempt out of the next ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
upon the forragers. Who being frighted
with the ſuddenneſſe of the miſchief, fled to their
guards. Which as ſoon as our men perceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they flew more fiercely upon them, and ſuffered
none to be taken alive. <hi>Luterius</hi> fled from
thence with a few, but returned not to his
Camp.</p>
                     <p>After this good ſucceſſe, <hi>Caninius</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by his priſoners, that part of the army was
behind in the Camp with <hi>Drapes,</hi> not above
twelve miles off. Which when he had learned
by many to be truth, believing that one of the
Generals already put to flight, the remnant of
the army being terrified, might eaſily be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown;
he thought it a great piece of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that none eſcaped from the ſlaughter into
the Camp, to carry tidings of the mishap to
<hi>Drapes.</hi> And foraſmuch as he ſaw there was
no danger in putting the matter to triall, he ſent
all his horſemen and the <hi>German</hi> footmen, ſwift
and nimble fellows, before, to the Camp of his
enemies. One of his legions he left in his
Camp, and the other eaſed of all carriages, he
took with him.</p>
                     <p>When he came near his enemies, his ſcouts that
he had ſent before, brought word that (as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of the barbarous nations commonly is) they
had abandoned the higher ground, &amp; encamped
themſelves by the River ſide; &amp; that our horſe and
the <hi>Germans</hi> had flown upon them ſuddenly
ere they were aware, and charged them. Upon
the receit of this news, he haſted forward with
his legion well armed and well appointed: and
ſo the ſign being given ſuddenly on all ſides, the
higher places were taken by our men. At the
doing whereof, the <hi>Germans</hi> and our Cavalry
ſeeing the Enſigns of our Legion, fought very
ſtoutly: and by and by all our Cohorts charged
upon them round; ſo that in the concluſion,
they were all either ſlain, or priſoners, and a

And therefore leaving <hi>Q. Calenus</hi> the Legate

was come to <hi>Uxellodunum,</hi> and ſaw the
town environed with fortifications, perceiving
that it was not for him to break up his ſiege on
any condition, and learning moreover by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes
that the town had great abundance of
victuals: he aſſaied to cut of the water from his
enemies.</p>
                     <p>There was a river that ran through the bottom
of the valley, which environed well-near all
the hill whereon the town ſtood, from whence
the deſcent was rough and ſteep on all ſides.
The nature of the place would not ſuffer this
ſtream to be turned any other way. For it ran
in ſuch ſort at the very foot of the hill, that there
could be no ditch cut low enough to drain it.
The townſmen had hard and very ſteep coming
down to it, inſomuch that if our men withſtood
them, they could not without wounds or danger
of their lives, either come down to the river, or
get up the ſteep hill again. Which diſtreſſe of
theirs <hi>Caeſar</hi> well knowing, placed archers and
ſlingers, and other artillery alſo, againſt ſuch
places where the eaſieſt coming down was, to
keep the townſmen from the water of the river:
who afterward came for water all to one place.
For under the very walles of the town there
guſhed out a great ſpring of water, on that ſide
where there was a ſpace almoſt of three hundred
foot not encompaſſed with the river.</p>
                     <p>Now whilſt all the reſt wiſhed, and only <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
perceived, that this ſpring might be taken
from the town, though not, without great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
he began to raiſe Vines directly againſt it
toward the hill, and to make mounts, with great
labour and continuall fighting. For the townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
came running down from the higher
ground, and fought with our men at a diſtance
without danger, wounding many of them that
preſſed up too forwardly. Notwithſtanding
our men were nothing deterred from bringing
forward their Vines, endeavouring to overcome
the crabbedneſſe of the place, with their labour
and works. At the ſame time they drew privy
mines to the head of the ſpring, which kind of
work they might do without any danger or
miſtruſt of their enemies. A mount was caſt up
ſix foot high, and thereupon was raiſed a
tower of ten ſtories; not ſuch a one as might
equall the height of the walles, (for that was
not poſſible to be done any way) but ſuch a one
as might exceed the top of the ſpring. From
which conveying darts with engines to the brim
of the ſpring, ſo that the townſmen could not
fetch water without danger, not only all ſorts
of cattel, but alſo a great number of men died
for thirſt.</p>
                     <p>The townſmen greatly aſtoniſhed hereat, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
barrels with greaſe, pitch, and ſhingles, and
ſetting them on fire rolled them down upon our
works, and at the ſame time alſo fought very
deſperately, with the perill of fighting to keep
the <hi>Romans</hi> from quenching the fire. Suddenly
there was a great flame in our works. For
whatſoever was thrown down from that ſteep
place, the ſame ſtaying againſt the Vines and
rampier, took hold upon the things that ſtayed
them. On the other ſide, our Souldiers, albeit
they were hindred both with the dangerouſneſſe
of the encounter, and with the diſadvantage of
the place, yet they bare out all things with a
ſtout courage. For the thing was done both in
an eminent place, and alſo in the ſight of our
army: and a great cry was raiſed on both ſides.
So that every man as farre as he could, eſpecially
the moſt daring, (to the intent his valour might
the better be known and teſtified) ventured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon the fire, &amp; the weapons of his enemies.</p>

                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> when he ſaw many of his men wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
commanded his Cohorts to climbe up the hill
on all ſides of the town, and to raiſe a ſhout as
if they purpoſed to ſcale the walles. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the townſmen being frighted, foraſmuch
as they knew not what was doing in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
called back their men from aſſaulting our

though they had loſt a great part of their men

at length the veins of the ſpring were
cut off within the ground by mines, and turned
another way: by means whereof the fountain
of running water was preſently dried up. Which
ſo daunted the hearts of the defendants, who
believed it could not be done by the wit of man,

when they ſaw there was no other remedy, they
yielded themſelves.</p>

he needed not to fear that it would be imputed to

unpuniſhed, others ſhould be encouraged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
in divers places: he thought it requiſite to
hold the reſt in aw by the puniſhment of theſe.
And therefore he cut off the hands of as many
of them as were able to bear arms, and let them

men might be more manifeſt to the world.</p>

ſought to diſparage <hi>Caeſar</hi> now going out

                     <p>Albeit he had tidings by the way before he

yet he thought he had as good reaſon as before,
to viſit the municipall towns and colonies, both
to give them thanks for appearing in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and for their civility ſhewed in the behalf
of <hi>Antony;</hi> as alſo to commend unto them his

becauſe his adverſaries proudly made their brag,
that <hi>L. Lentulus</hi> and C. <hi>Marcellus</hi> were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Conſuls, to deprive <hi>Caeſar</hi> of all honour and

                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> at his coming among the municipall

and reſpect: that being his firſt coming
from the warres in <hi>Gallia.</hi> Nothing was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51174:218"/>
that could be deviſed for the decking and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning
of their gates, wayes, and places where
<hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould paſſe. All the people came forth
with their children to meet him by the way; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
were every where offered; the temples
and market-places were hanged with clothes of
tapeſtrie: ſo that a man would have thought by
the expreſſions of joy, there had been ſome great
triumph expected and provided for. So great coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
was among the richer ſort, and ſuch hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
expreſſion among the meaner ſort.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Caeſar</hi> had lightly paſſed through all
the countreys of <hi>Gallia Togata,</hi> he returned with
all ſpeed to his army at <hi>Nemetocenna,</hi> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all his legions out of their winter-quarters
into the countrey of the <hi>Treviri,</hi> he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and there muſtered them. <hi>T. Labienus</hi> he
made governour of <hi>Gallia Togata,</hi> thereby to
get himſelf the more favour and furtherance in
his ſuit for the Conſulſhip. He himſelf removed
from one place to another, according as he found
it neceſſary for health. And albeit he heard
oftentimes that <hi>Labienus</hi> was ſolicited ſtrongly
by his enemies, and was alſo advertiſed how it
was carried on by a ſmall faction at <hi>Rome,</hi> to
take away part of his army from him by a decree
of the Senate: yet notwithſtanding he neither
gave credit to any thing that was reported of
<hi>Labienus,</hi> nor would be drawn to do any thing
contrary to the authority of the Senate. For he
believed that if the Senatours might give their
voices freely, he ſhould eaſily obtain his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>C. Curio</hi> Tribune of the people, who had
taken upon him the defence of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s cauſe
and dignity, had oftentimes propounded to the
Senate, that if the fear of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s army preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
any man, and ſeeing that the authority
and power of <hi>Pompey</hi> did not a little keep the
Courts in aw; that both of them might lay down
their arms and diſmiſſe their armies: and ſo
ſhould the City be at liberty to uſe her own right
as ſhe pleaſed. This he not only propounded,
but began to divide the Senat about it: which the
Conſuls and the friends of <hi>Pompey</hi> commanded
ſhould not be done: and ſo ruling the matter as
they liſted, they departed. This was a great te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of the whole Senate, and agreeable to
their former act.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Marcellus</hi> the year before, oppoſing <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s
dignity, contrary to the law of <hi>Pompey</hi> and
<hi>Craſſus,</hi> and having put up a bill to the Senate
for the diſcharge of <hi>Caeſar</hi> before the time of
his commiſſion was expired; when they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
their voices, <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who ſought all
his honour by working ſpight againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
departed aſide, and the Senate fell all of them
quite upon other matters.</p>
                     <p>This did not at all daunt the ſpirits of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s
enemies, but rather ſtirred them up to
ſtrengthen their party, and thereby to compell
the Senate to approve of that which they had
determined. Hereupon a decree was made, that
<hi>Cneius Pompeius</hi> ſhould ſend one legion, and
<hi>Caeſar</hi> another, to the warre againſt the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi>
But it was eaſily diſcerned that both
theſe legions were taken from <hi>Caeſar.</hi> For the
firſt legion, which <hi>Cneius Pompeius</hi> had ſent
unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> levied in the <hi>Province,</hi> he gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Caeſar</hi> as one of his own number. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
albeit that no man need doubt but that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
was ſpoiled at the pleaſure of his enemies,
yet he ſent <hi>Pompey</hi> his legion again: and of his
own forces, he ordered the fifteenth legion which
he had in the hither <hi>Gallia,</hi> to be delivered to
him according to the decree of the Senate. In the
room whereof he ſent the thirteenth legion into
<hi>Italy,</hi> to ly in garriſon in the ſame place from
whence the fifteenth was drawn.</p>
                     <p>Then he diſtributed his army into winter-quarters.
C. <hi>Trebonius</hi> with four legions he
placed in <hi>Belgium:</hi> C. <hi>Fabius</hi> with as many
amongſt the <hi>Hedui.</hi> For this he thought would
be the beſt way to keep <hi>Gallia</hi> in moſt ſafety
and quiet, if the <hi>Belgae,</hi> who were the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourous,
and the <hi>Hedui,</hi> who were of moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
had forces quartered among them to
keep them in obedience. This done, he took his
journey into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When he came thither, he underſtood that the
two legions which he had diſmiſſed, which by
the decree of the Senate ſhould have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the <hi>Parthian</hi> warre, were by C. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
the Conſul delivered to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and kept
ſtill in <hi>Italy.</hi> Although by this dealing it was
evident to all the world, what was intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> determined to take all
things patiently, as long as he had any hope
left to decide the controverſy rather by the law
then by the ſword.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome attribute the ſo frequent revolts
of the <hi>Galles</hi> to their changeable
and impatient humour, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure to be lorded over by
ſtrangers: and others, to the too great clemency
of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> I grant that clemency apt to pardon
emboldens to revolt; for that we eaſily forget all
benefits which do not intirely eſtabliſh our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
but if cruelty cauſeth them leſſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
yet it renders them more dangerous; for
that when deſpair driveth men thereunto, and
that the hope of ſafety reſteth onely in voctory,
the revolted become all valiant, obſtinate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and faithfull to the end; which never
falleth out where there is hope of the enemies
clemency. We have here plentifull examples
thereof. <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the greater part of the revolts
of the <hi>Galles</hi> hath often found great facilities
to reduce them to his obedience, by reaſon of his
clemency; which hath been a powerfull means
for him to make diviſions amongſt themſelves,
and to prevent obſtinacy in their revolts: and
if ſometimes it hath ſo happened that he hath
uſed ſeverity, it hath been occaſioned by fowl
and unworthy acts; as when the <hi>Veneti</hi> under
publick faith impriſoned the <hi>Roman</hi> officers,
which came to them to buy corn for the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the army. But I cannot excuſe that
of <hi>Uxellodunum.</hi> On the contrary, the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> executed by the Duke
of <hi>Alva,</hi> drove poor fiſhermen ſo into deſpair,
that they have ſhaken off his inſupportable yoke;
and with an admirable conſtancy have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and enriched themſelves, and are grown
ſo potent, as that they are able to reſiſt him by
land, and by ſea take from him his treaſure in
the <hi>Indies.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſheweth us alſo by his care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
to get intelligence of the enemies proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
(whether by taking priſoners in the field,
or by having good ſpies) the advantage which
may be made thereof; many of his ſucceſsfull
deſigns having been founded thereupon, there
being great advantage in the attempting them;
for that he which aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the aſſailant to be the ſtronger, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what part he will aſſail, and ever jealous
that he hath ſome ſecret intelligence. Briefly,
all that a well-exerciſed and well-diſciplined
army is able to do in ſuch a caſe, is to defend
it ſelf; but where are new-levied ſouldiers, fall
out great diſorders: which was the reaſon he
took ſo much care to fortify his camp very
ſtrongly, to the end he might defend it and all
his baggage with a few men, and might without
danger execute many brave deſignes, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
aſſured of his retreat. Let us farther
take view of the ſiege of <hi>Uxellodunum:</hi> which
<hi>Caeſar</hi> judging to be impregnable by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

knowing it to be well provided of corn, underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by a great &amp; dangerous labour to keep them
from water, which was from a fountain without
the town, from whence they were only ſupplied:
which the beſieged perceiving, having ſet fire
on <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s works, by a ſally they hindred him
from quenching it. <hi>Caeſar</hi> not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
them by reaſon of the advantage of the

By CLEMENT EDMONDS, Remembrancer of the
City of LONDON.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as my purpoſe was to make this task of Obſervations
as a parallel to our modern Diſcipline, I did not think it fit to
mingle the Tactick Practiſe of theſe times with the uſe of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
ages, but rather to ſhut up theſe Diſcourſes therewith, as
the ſecond line of this warlike parallel, which is thus drawn in
the beſt faſhion of modern Art.</p>
                  <p>In the knowledge of marſhalling an Army, there is nothing more eſpecially
to be regarded, then that from a confuſed company of men, having choſen the
fitteſt for the wars, we ſhould ſo place and digeſt a convenient number of them,
that in marches, in incamping, in battels we may be able with a few well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to incounter a farre greater army in confuſion, and to overthrow them.
From hence <hi>Aeneas</hi> did define the Art of war, to be the knowledge of warlike
motions.</p>
                  <p>Before this unexpert army ſhall be able to be moved in ſuch faſhion, it ſhall
not be amiſſe to acquaint it with the moſt uſuall terms, wherewith they ſhall be
often commanded into diverſe poſtures, as occaſion ſhall be offered. For as in
the art of Fencing, no man ſhall be able to turn and wind his body for his beſt
advantage to offend his enemy, or defend himſelf, unleſſe firſt his maſter ſhall
inſtruct him in the ſeverall parts and poſtures thereof: ſo every ſouldier, or the
whole troup as one body, or one ſouldier, ſhall never be readily inſtructed to
transform or turn it ſelf by divers motions into different forms, unleſſe they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51174:220"/>
firſt underſtand what is meant by Fronts and Flanks, by Files and Ranks, what
by Leaders and Followers, by Middlemen and Bringers up. By this means
each ſouldier underſtanding what the terme doth ſignifie, ſhall readily both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and execute ſuch commandments as the Captain or Officer ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
him.</p>
                  <p>A File is a certain number of men following ſingly one Leader unto the
depth of 8 or 10,<note place="margin">A File.</note> as they ſhall be commanded. The ancients have called this
File <hi>Seriem, ordinationem,</hi> or <hi>decuriam.</hi> It conſiſteth of Leaders and Followers,
placed according to their worth and valour: and eſpecially there ought to be
regarded, the Leader or <hi>Decurio,</hi> the fifth, ſixth, or Middlemen, and the tenth and
laſt called the Bringer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up or <hi>Tergiductor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, every ſouldier being aptly fitted unto his ſeverall armes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his worth,<note place="margin">The Leader.</note> age and ſtature, they are to be diſpoſed into ſeverall files,
wherein every one is eſpecially to acknowledge his leader or foremoſt man to
be the authour of all his motions: &amp; therefore duely attending what directions
ſhall be commanded, each follower ſhall according to the motions of his leader
or foremoſt man, order his own; and is to be excuſed, if he attend the motions
of his leader before he move himſelf.</p>
                  <p>When many files are thus diſpoſed together, all the leaders making one and
the ſame front, and their followers obſerving likewiſe one and the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of diſtance before, and after, and on each ſide; theſe Files thus joyned
make one Battallion,<note place="margin">Battallion.</note> the front whereof is called a Rank, and ſo likewiſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third in depth,<note place="margin">A Rank or Front.</note> according to the number of men in each file. The firſt,
ſecond and third,<note place="margin">Sidemen.</note> and ſo forward in each file, are called Sidemen, in reſpect of
the ſame numbers in the next file. Neither muſt every ſouldier onely regard
the motions of his Leader, but he muſt alſo diligently reſpect his ſidemen,
and ſuch as ſhall be placed on his right and left hand, called his ranks: ſo that
both in files and ranks he may alwaies be found in the ſame diſtance wherein he
is commanded.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould be impertinent to the purpoſe to preſcribe a certain number of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
unto theſe Battallions,<note place="margin">The number of ſouldiers in a Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

never to exceed ſo much, but that it may eaſily upon any occaſion be changed
into ſuch a form or faſhion to fight, as may be thought fitteſt for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>The length of this Battallion is diverſly tearmed amongſt the Latines,<note place="margin">The length.</note> as

the diſtance between all the followers, is ſaid to be the length or depth of one
file or flank.</p>
                  <p>In the diſpoſing of ſouldiers into files and ranks, beſides their obſerving a
right line in their places and ſtanding,<note place="margin">Dignities in places to be obſerved.</note> we muſt likewiſe eſpecially reſpect the
different worth and quality of the ſouldiers; that every one according to his
worth may be ſuted unto his proper place, and accordingly receive advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the death of his Leaders, and true value of his deſert by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
ſhall give occaſion.</p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51174:220"/>
Firſt therefore there muſt be eſpeciall choice made of the leaders of each file,<note place="margin">The firſt rank.</note>
or firſt front or ranks of the Battallion, of the moſt expert, ableſt, and beſt-armed
men: becauſe that as from them the reſt are to receive directions of their
after-motions; ſo in them the greateſt hope of the day doth conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Next unto the firſt it muſt be provided, that the bringers up or laſt rank, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Tergiductores,</hi>

may both know when to reprehend their former Ranks, and urge them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
if they ſee them declining or yielding upon falſe occaſions; as alſo to
be able upon any ſudden alarm given in the rere, to turn faces about and make
themſelves a Front for the beſt reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Neither muſt it be neglected concerning the ſecond and ninth ranks,<note place="margin">The ſecond and ninth ranks.</note> that
they alſo may be furniſhed with the next moſt ſufficient men; both becauſe of
their nearneſſe unto danger, as alſo that if their leaders or bringers up ſhall either
be ſlain, or diſabled by wounds, they may preſently ſucceed in their places and
make them good.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a good decorum to be obſerved in the middlemen,<note place="margin">The fifth and ſixth ranks.</note> or fifth and
ſixth ranks, both for the men themſelves and their armes: that in our marches,
when the middlemen or ſixth ranks ſhall be called up to front with their leaders,
they may in ſome ſort and proportion anſwer their places; as alſo when
we double our front, by calling up middlemen to fight in a greater breadth,
they may not be unſutable: but eſpecially in marches, that they may be able
to make the beſt reſiſtance, when they ſhall become the flanks of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions.</p>
                  <p>As theſe reſpects ought to be obſerved in ranks, ſo the files alſo are not
without their different degrees of dignity.<note place="margin">Files.</note> As the leader of the right-hand file
is accounted to have the firſt place of honour in the Battallion:<note place="margin">The right-hand file.</note> for he doth not
onely lead the reſt in his own file, but he is the author and beginner of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the whole Battallion.</p>
                  <p>The leader of the left-hand file hath the next place,<note place="margin">The left-hand file.</note> becauſe that he with the
leader of the right-hand file do alwaies in their marching and imbattelling
rectifie or rank the whole front of the battallion: and ſo conſequently all the
next of their files as they ſtand in order, even untill the middle, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the laſt in dignity.</p>
                  <p>The Battallion being thus diſpoſed into files and ranks,<note place="margin">Diſtances between files and ranks.</note> and each file and
rank according to his worth and experience rightly advanced: it followeth
that there ſhould be a juſt diſtance proportioned between either, that at all
times upon all occaſions, they might be found ready, and in comelieſt faſhion,
either to offend their enemy, or defend themſelves. Theſe diſtances which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
follower muſt obſerve in reſpect of his leader, and every leader and follower
in reſpect of the ſidemen, may be reduced unto three ſeverall Orders, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is called open Order;<note place="margin">Open order.</note> the diſtance whereof is twelve foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
every follower and his leader, or between every rank; and ſix
foot between them and the ſidemen, or between every file. This order is
commonly uſed upon marches when the enemy is known to be farre off,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51174:221"/>
as alſo in private exerciſing of ſouldiers for their ſeverall managing of their
armes. It differeth ſomewhat from the <hi>Ordinatus Miles</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi>
who alwayes obſerved but four cubits in files and ranks.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond diſtance is called Order,<note place="margin">Order.</note> when we contract the battallion both
in length and breadth, and gather the ſouldiers within a nearer ſcantling both
in files and ranks, that is, by obſerving ſix feet in their files between the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
and leader, and three feet between the ranks or ſidemen. This diſtance is
uſed when we march toward an enemy near at hand, or in marches by reaſon of
the opportunity of the place ſuſpiciouſly dangerous. This is alſo near unto
<hi>Denſatus ordo,</hi> but onely that that was but two cubits in both files and ranks.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt order,<note place="margin">Cloſe orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, pouldron to pouldron.</note> is when either we attend the enemy his preſent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
or that we intend to charge him upon our ſecureſt and beſt diſtance; when
every follower ſtandeth three feet, or his rapier length behind his leader, and
a foot and a half from the ſidemen or files; or when every ſouldier occupieth
but one foot and a half for his own ſtation, joyning pouldron to pouldron, or
target to target. This differeth from <hi>Conſtipatus ordo,</hi> becauſe that alloweth but
one cubit for files and ranks, and this cloſe order alloweth one cubit in the file,
but two in the ranks.</p>
                  <p>This diſtance doth agree alſo beſt with the length of our piles of 15 or 16
feet long.<note place="margin">The manner of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arging with five ranks.</note> For it is thought fit oftentimes that the battallion conſiſting of ten
ranks, there ſhould not charge more at one time then the 5 formoſt, ſo that the
pikes of the fifth rank might be three foot over the formoſt ſhoulder; and the
other five ranks ſhould in this cloſe order, or nearer if it be poſſible, follow the
other charging, with their pikes advanced, untill ſome occaſion ſhould require
their charge. In the mean time they ſhould perform their dutie, in keeping the
five formoſt ranks from retiring, and beſides adde ſtrength unto the charge or
ſhock.</p>

                     <head>The manner of exerciſing of compoſed Battallions, with their

                     <p>THe files and ranks being thus underſtood, diſpoſed and ordered, and all
parts and members of the battallion being joyned in their juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diſtance, able and fit to be altered upon any ſodain occaſion
(as if it were but one entire body) into ſeverall and divers poſtures, and to make
reſiſtance unto what forces ſoever ſhall oppugne the ſame: it might be
thought needleſſe to have made the diſpoſition of the members ſo exact,
unleſſe by continuall practiſe and exerciſe they might be made nimble and
ready, not onely to defend themſelves and their whole body on all ſides, but
alſo to be able to offend whenſoever they ſhall eſpie the leaſt occaſion of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p>The terms of direction or command, which are commonly uſed in this
modern diſcipline of martiall exerciſe, as they are not many, onely anſwering
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51174:221"/>
to the different poſtures which are required in the Battallion; ſo they are and
muſt be ſhort and perſpicuouſly plain, that by this means being ſodainly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
eaſily apprehended and underſtood, they may as ſpeedily be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
by thoſe which ſhall be commanded.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, that the Battallion may be commanded into ſome one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
or poſture,<note place="margin">Stand in front.</note> from whence it ſhall be fit to convert it ſelf into all other, the
Captain or Officer ſhall bid them ſtand in front.<note place="margin">In arrecto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtate.</note> When every particular ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier

                     <p>In this and all other directions whatſoever, it ſhall be eſpecially obſerved,
that every follower attending what is commanded, mark his next leader, and

                     <p>The Battallion therefore thus fronting,<note place="margin">Faces to the right or left hand.</note> if the enemy ſhould ſuddenly either
aſſault the right or left flank,<note place="margin">Declinate in haſtam vel in ſcutum.</note> it ſhall be commanded to turn faces to the right or

his flank his front according to the direction.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a doubled motion or declination to the right or left hand,<note place="margin">Faces about to the right or left hand Duplicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when every ſouldier obſerving his leader ſhall turn their bodies twice to the
right or left hand, and by that means become turned with their faces where
their backs were, as if they expected an enemy in the rere, or being to perform
ſome other motion that may be offered: beginning this alteration from the
right or left hand as ſhall be commanded.</p>
                     <p>As every particular ſouldier in the troup is thus commanded at ſometimes
to turn his face to the right or left hand, or about, the Battallion ſtanding in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">Wheel to the right or left hand.</note>
that is, according to the diſtance before named; ſo the whole Battallion
being reduced into their cloſe order, is commanded to turn as one body to the
right or left hand.<note place="margin">Converſio in haſtam vel ſcutum.</note> It is performed thus: Imagine the Battallion ſtand firſt in
order, it ſhall be commanded that they cloſe their files to the right hand; when
the right file ſtanding ſtill, the reſt turning their faces to the right hand, march
into their cloſe order and return as they were: next that they cloſe their ranks
from behind, when every follower marcheth forward to his leader unto his
rapiers point as is ſaid before. This done, (the leader of the right file ſtanding
immoveable) all the reſt (as the body of a ſhip or a great gate) turn about that
leader, as about the hinge or center, every one keeping the ſame diſtance and
order wherein they were firſt placed, as if they were but one entire body.</p>

as you were, and you are reſtored.</p>
                     <p>When the whole Battallion being in their cloſe order ſhould turn about
and make the Rere the Front,<note place="margin">Wheel about.</note> it is done by a double turning or declination,<note place="margin">Inflexio militum.</note> and
commanded to wheel about, which is anſwerable to the former faces about or

                     <p>

ſafe or ſecure, becauſe it doth ſomewhat reſemble a flying or running away
from the enemy, which might give him no ſmall incouragement, and therefore
it is not much in practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Only at ſome times, the bringers up marching throughout beyond the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

wont to countermarch the front to the right or left hand: and being come unto
the depth of the bringers up, to ſtand ſtill untill the other half file had likewiſe
marched forth, and fallen upon their leaders in every file. In all theſe it is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

prevent confuſion, which (eſpecially the enemy at hand) muſt needs be moſt
dangerous, and therefore carefully to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>In like ſort the ranks may countermarch, when either the right wing would
be ſtrengthened by the left,<note place="margin">Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marching of ranks.</note> or the left by the right, alwayes marching by whole
files towards the right or left hand, according as they ſhall have the direction,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51174:222"/>
either changing the ground, or upon the ſame ground, as in the former counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marches.</p>
                     <p>There is uſed alſo another kind of ſtrengthening both the front and flank
when occaſion ſhall be offered, viz: by doubling either files or ranks. And
this, either by doubling the number of ſouldiers in the ſame files or ranks,
keeping ſtill the ſame breadth and depth of ground;<note place="margin">The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of files to the right or left hand.</note> or elſe by doubling the
ground, keeping the ſame number of ſouldiers. The files are doubled, when
the ſecond file ſhall inſert it ſelf into the firſt, the leader thereof putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a follower unto the leader of the firſt,<note place="margin">By men.</note> and the next follower follower to
the next in the firſt file, and ſo forwards. And likewiſe the fourth file inſerting
it ſelf into the third, and the ſixth into the fifth. And this is to be performed
when the Battallion ſtandeth in his order.</p>
                     <p>To double the place or depth,<note place="margin">Duplicare altitudinem.</note> is when the ſame number of men ſhall put

ſhall diligently hearken to ſuch directions as ſhall be given. The Captain in the
front ſhall ſpeak, and the Sergeants in each flank ſhall give the word unto the
Lieutenant or Enſigne in the rere: who as in his proper place, ſeeth all things
executed accordingly as the Captain ſhall command. It ſhall be unpoſſible to
performe any thing herein, unleſſe firſt every one do exactly obſerve his leader

                     <p>In charging with musketiers, it is obſerved no way convenient that there

firſt rank is commanded to advance ten paces before the ſecond, and then to

for there being five or ten files led in the induction, that file which flanketh

it ſtandeth firm untill the laſt rank be paſſed, and then ſleeveth it ſelf on the
