         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O make known what ever we hold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Church-government,</hi> as wee have had publique teſtimony in this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſo we have manifold inſtances and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of it; Witneſſe that conſtant, free, and open expreſſing our ſelves upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in all queſtions propounded to the debate, with offers to give an open Account at any time, in what ever ſhould be asked us by any Brother. Our proffering divers times to bring in Propoſitions, ſtated to our ſenſe for the diſpute, and when we were made a Committee to that purpoſe, in the point of <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and did bring our Iudgements concerning it for a diſpute, It was laid aſide. And at another time, when we our ſelves brought in Papers, giving the ſtate of the queſtion, about that <hi>extraordinary way of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> which were read, and returned back unto us, it being publiquely profeſſed that <hi>that was not an allowed way and courſe of this Aſsembly, for any of the Brethren to bring in papers, unleſse they were made a Committee by the Aſſembly it ſelfe.</hi> And ſo we were prevented of doing the like for time to come.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe our frequent complainings of the ſtating of queſtions, ſo that we could not fully argue for our Iudgements, wee being bound up to the queſtions as ſtated by you. The uſuall anſwer to our Complaints herein being, <hi>That the Aſsembly ſate not to argue the<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114358:3"/>
opinions of a few men, but if wee had any thing to ſay to the aſſertion brought in, we might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As alſo our earneſt contending to have ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (<hi>which you all know are the greateſt and moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points</hi>) fairly diſputed and debated, is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimony of this our willingneſſe. As in the entrance into the diſpute of <hi>Government,</hi> the firſt day, we preſſed the handling of this, <hi>That there is a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Government for the Churches, under the Goſpel, laid down in the Scripture,</hi> and deſired to have diſcuſſed, <hi>what are the ſure and certain wayes, whereby wee may judge what of Government is held forth</hi> Iure Divino <hi>therein,</hi> which ſhould have been fundamentall to all the diſputes that were to follow: and this was profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly laid aſide by you, which therefore in none of the ſubſequent debates, we could renew, and thus Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were cut off, It being that great and neceſſary <hi>Medium,</hi> by which the patticulars ſhould be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and in a manner the whole controverſie decided; the greateſt difference that were likely to grow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, being this, <hi>That the forms of Government, you pretend to, and we deny, are aſſerted to be</hi> Iure divino.</p>
            <p>In like manner, that other next great queſtion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>the intire power in Congregations, that have a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Presbytery for all Cenſures,</hi> which as it is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt that preſents it ſelfe for diſcuſſion (as was urged) ſo alſo it is one of the greateſt points in di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fference betwixt us &amp; you: Yet the debate of this was not only denyed the firſt place in the diſpute, but was to this day declined by you; Although to have it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was contended for by us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not by us only, but by many of thoſe, that are for a ſubordinate government thereof to Synods. And though earneſt deſires and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114358:3"/>
motions for it were renewed and inculcated, yet were they as often laid aſide. Yea and this, although it was once expreſly commended by the grand Committee of the Hon. Members of both Houſes, joyned with twelve Divines of the Aſſembly, to be next diſputed, as the beſt means, both of expedition, and of ending the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
            <p>And over and above all this, to argue this our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to diſpute our way, In the aforeſaid Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Committeee appointed by an Order of the Honourable Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> to find out wayes, of accommodating different Iudgements in the Aſſembly, the Sub-Committee of Divines, conſiſting of two of us, and foure others, appointed by that Honourable Committee to prepare wayes and Propoſitions of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, brought in the main and moſt of what practically we deſired, and we therein added, <hi>That if ſuch a liberty ſhall ſeem in the wiſdome of this Honorable Committee, to be ſo prejudicical to the peace of the Church as not to be permitted, we humbly deſire, the doctrinall principles wherein we differ about Church-Government, may be taken into ſerious conſideration, and ſome other way of accommodation in practiſe thought upon, as ſhall ſeem fit to this honourable Committee:</hi> and this was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to that honorable Committee and thoſe twelve of the Aſſembly, to be tranſmitted, whether to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Houſes, or the Aſſembly as they ſhould think meet.</p>
            <p>After this, when upon occaſion of ſomething brought in by one Brother, and entertained, we took hold of that example, and one of us, with conſent of the reſt, brought in 7 Propoſitions, which contained matter of difference betwixt us, profeſſing, <hi>That if this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114358:4"/>
Aſſembly would debate them, or any one of them, we would bring in more, untill we had brought in all the Frame, and the Aſsembly themſelves ſhould pick and chuſe what they would debate, &amp; what not.</hi>
 But theſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were rejected with a refuſall to debate any one of them.</p>
            <p>And after all this, though the main parts of a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been then voted by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and ſent up to the honorable Houſes (as, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that about <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>the Presbyteriall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over many Congregations,</hi> as alſo concerning <hi>the Subordination of Nationall, Provinciall and Claſſicall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi>) and there was not much remaining about Church-government, to be concluded in this Aſſembly: yet this Reverend Aſſembly requiring, (by occaſion of a book publiſhed, that reflected on theſe proceedings, that we had no hand in nor knowledge of) <hi>a whole Frame of Government, with the grounds and reaſons thereof, to be brought in by us,</hi> and voted us hereto to be a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, we yeilded our ſelves to be a Committee to bring in part by part, in like manner as the Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was brought into the Aſſembly, and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but that was not accepted. And then it being ſaid, that there was ſomething in Church-government, remaining undiſcuſſed, and unreſolved; and it being further alledged that the Aſſembly had not ſent up all that which they had concluded, but meant to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an entire Frame and Body to the Honourable Houſes: And that we might take away all occaſions of any ſuch jealouſies that we were unwilling to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what we held (which were commonly in mens mouths abroad) we yeilded to be a Committee, to bring in the whole to this Aſſembly, though upon all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114358:4"/>
the fore-mentioned diſadvantages, &amp; were purpoſed &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved amongſt our ſelves ſo to do, and that in as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent a time as a work of ſuch a compaſſe could, (in ſuch a manner as was propoſed by you) be diſpatched by us. And as in the debate about making us a Committee, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly would not declare (though preſſed by us) what they would do with that Modell, and thoſe Reaſons we ſhould bring in; ſo the voting of what yet remained in <hi>Church-government,</hi> was haſtened by you.</p>
            <p>And when not long after, upon occaſion of the debate of one particular point, in which we differed from this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, we moved it might be deferred, becauſe we ſhould preſent our Judgements and Reaſons about it, with the reſt, (for therein lay that which we accounted the favour of being made a Committee by you) it was publiquely anſwered, <hi>that therefore the Aſſembly ſhould the rather go on to the concluding of it, becauſe we intended to bring it in;</hi> and before we could diſpatch that <hi>Body</hi> we intended, ſo as to report it unto you according to your order; (the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the materials whereof, ſpent us two or three months, and we could not obtain the liberty to bring in any thing but the whole) this Aſſembly had preſented to the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſes, as well what had been ſent up by peeces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as what was ſince concluded, in one intire Frame. By all which we perceived, that that which was the main end and uſe of preſenting ſuch a Modell to this Aſſembly, would be fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, we having given in (as this Aſſembly knows) but <hi>two heads of diſſenting reaſons:</hi> The one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>the Presbyteriall government over many Congregations:</hi> The other againſt <hi>the ſubordination of Synods.</hi> By the ſucceſſe of the latter we ſee, that this Aſſembly can aſſume the liberty (if it ſo pleaſe) to reſerve thoſe we ſhall now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114358:5"/>
preſent, unanſwered, as they have done thoſe our diſſenting Reaſons againſt ſubordination of Synods, <hi>although it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a great and main part of that wherein we differ, as alſo is of all other, the greateſt moment, both to this Church and State,</hi> and hath been given in to this Aſſembly ten months ſince, and their votes concerning theſe Subordinations, as long ſince preſented to the honourable Houſes, but have not been anſwered by any reply brought into this Aſſembly, and ſo not ready to have been ſent up to the Hon. Houſes.</p>
            <p>And if Theſe we might now bring in, ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to be anſwered by this Aſſembly, yet we ſtill retain the ſenſe of ſo much remedileſſe prejudice, <hi>by being bound from replying again,</hi> as doth make us juſtly wary: we may for ever lie under whatever miſ-interpretations may happen, (ſuppoſe but through miſtake of yours, or imperfection of our expreſſion) without clearing our meaning, and wee may be bound up from further urging or driving home that wherein the ſtrength of any argumenr lies, if the dint thereof ſhould be avoided by ſome ſpecious diverſion. And although our former Reaſons given in after diſpute to both the honourable Houſes, according to their Order, were therefore not our own, but to be diſpoſed of according to their appointment; yet what we ſhould now give in, we conceive to be in our own power.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe conſiderations we think that this Aſſembly, hath no cauſe now to require a <hi>Report</hi> of us, nor will that our <hi>Report</hi> be of any uſe, ſeeing that <hi>Reports</hi> are for <hi>Debates,</hi> and <hi>Debates</hi> are for <hi>Reſults</hi> to be ſent up to the Honorable Houſes, <hi>who have already voted another forme of Government then what we ſhall preſent.</hi> However it may be of more uſe ſome other way, which by this courſe may be prevented, And therefore we are reſolved to wait for ſome further op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to improve what we have prepared.</p>
