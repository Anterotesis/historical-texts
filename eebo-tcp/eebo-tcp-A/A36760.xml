            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>To rest my drowzy sense I sought</l>
               <l>The softest, sweetest, grassie plot,</l>
               <l>But as I wand'red here and there,</l>

               <l>Drawn thither by my greedy Eyes.</l>
               <l>Two loving Rogues within it lay,</l>
               <l>And thus I heard the Puppets play.</l>
               <l>Long did I muse but all in vain,</l>
               <l>What wanton stars that day did reign.</l>
               <l>But as my steps did homewards stray</l>
               <l>I met my <hi>Phoebe</hi> by the way,</l>
               <l>My <hi>Phoebe,</hi> whose commanding Eyes,</l>
               <l>Had made my heart her Sacrifice;</l>
               <l>To her fair hand I paid a kiss,</l>
               <l>But she return'd a greater bliss,</l>
               <l>Presenting Violets to me,</l>
               <l>Good morrow Valentine, said she.</l>

                  <l>Most useful are in our ingenious times,</l>

                  <l>For they the judgment cheat, as that the sight.</l>
                  <l>Now Poets like the worst Mechanicks grown,</l>
                  <l>Do rail at others ware to sell their own.</l>
                  <l>The last new Play still th' other house does huff,</l>
                  <l>To set some newer mess of folly off.</l>

                  <l>Poor harmless Punck they fiercely do abuse,</l>
                  <l>Because she did Heroick love refuse,</l>
                  <l>Or made the running Nag out-strip the Muse.</l>
                  <l>Finding that Gallants now do Spaniel like,</l>
                  <l>Fawn most on those whose Satyrs deepest strike.</l>

                  <l>With dropping follyes of their own they drive them in,</l>

                  <l>Who rakes up dirt and lays it by his door,</l>

               <l>POor barren Art, how vainly dost thou strive,</l>
               <l>To Rival Natures greater excellence!</l>
               <l>While the admir'd <hi>Marina</hi> does survive,</l>
               <l>Whose Beauty dazles the most daring sense.</l>
               <l>See how the captiv'd Painters trembling hand</l>
               <l>Wanders at large, while his amazed eyes</l>
               <l>Dart looks of envy that he can't command</l>
               <l>Colours so fair as on her cheeks arise.</l>
               <l>Lay by thy Pencil, <hi>Ned,</hi> and think with me,</l>
               <l>If in her face such glorious things we find,</l>
               <l>Who can resist those charms thou dost not see;</l>
               <l>The brighter Beauties of her heav'nly mind?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:51998:63"/>There's sacred Virtue, and each pow'rful grace,</l>
               <l>Which cannot be surpris'd by feeble Art:</l>
               <l>When creeping Age drives Lovers from the face,</l>
               <l>Those will for ever hold the conquer'd heart.</l>
               <l>Thou Tyrant, Love, that hast my Soul possest,</l>
               <l>Give me this treasure or my heart again:</l>
               <l>Were I with wealth and mighty Empire blest,</l>
               <l>Without <hi>Marina,</hi> all the rest were vain.</l>

                  <l>To see and hear her speak alone.</l>
                  <l>What if I snatch one kiss or more?</l>
                  <l>Were Heaven gives a wealthy store,</l>

                  <l>My hope like Fairy treasure's gone,</l>
                  <l>Although I never made it known.</l>
