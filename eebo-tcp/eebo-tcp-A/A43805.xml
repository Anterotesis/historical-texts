            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now if ſuch be the Complexion, Genius, and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of all Hereſies; if their Extraction be ſo apparently from, and their tendency leads unto Hell, how falls the Church under a Neceſſity of them? Why ſhould St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay there muſt be Hereſies?

            </p>
            <p>Except therefore only violent Force, All Neceſſity is either Natural, or Moral: Natural, conſiſting in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tendencies of operative Cauſes to their ſuitable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: Moral, in the reaſonable propoſals of Wiſdom or Equity. And both theſe kinds of Neceſſity are either Primary, Simple, and Abſolute: or Secondary only, and Conſequential, with reſpect to antecedent Cauſes, voluntary, or unneceſſitated. Thus in Naturals: That I am, is to me of abſolute neceſſity; but that, under the folly of too much Wine, I talk and act idly, is from no primary and abſolute Neceſſity, irreſiſtible from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; but conſequential only on my Intemperance. That I can ſee, is from a natural Neceſſity abſolute and primary: but that I actually muſt ſee, is conſequential to the opening of mine Eyes. Thus likewiſe in Morals: That a Man love the Lord his God with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, is primarily, ſimply, and eternally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: but the moral Neceſſity of my Repentance is conſequential only on my Sin. That I do exact Juſtice to every Son of Man, is of neceſſity abſolutely moral: but the moral Neceſſity of repairing Injuries is ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, and introduced by my former Wrongs. Upon which preliminary diſtinction of the kinds and forms of Neceſſity, we are now to examine, Firſt, what Natural, and Secondly, what Moral Neceſſities there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94095:6"/>are for the admiſſion of Hereſies in the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, The Truth and Sanctity of God require us to reſolve, that there is no natural neceſſity of Hereſies primitive, and abſolute, by the operation of him, that <hi>made not Death, nor hath any delight in the deſtruction of the Living.</hi> For from the beginning, the original ſtate of Man needed no kind of evil to corrupt it. But all the natural neceſſity of them is ſecondary, ſuppoſitive, and conſequential to precedent Sins, and thoſe actual too, and moſt times habitual. For though other Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties begin to break out in the very firſt eſſays of our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Underſtandings, yet the inculcations of Hereſie have no ſuch early influence on our Fancies, but require ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently a longer ſenſe and experience of Good and Evil: To which, when a Man is arrived, he cannot be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated into the guilt of Hereſie, without want either of Piety or Care. For though a Soul aſpiring with all care to a great devotion, may in the infancy of that piety be ignorant of many excellent Doctrines, yet by this care he will eſpouſe no Principle abſolutely as funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, either in heart or proſeſſion, which neither the Voice of Nature, nor the Rules of Faith have clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to his Underſtanding: nor oppoſe thoſe Points that, either by the Light of Nature, or of God's holy Word, have ever been received by the Univerſal Church as Fundamentals. And he that doth otherwiſe, lets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf looſe by his own fault: and if thereby he neceſſarily falls into Hereſie, it is a fatal miſchief conſequential to his inconſiderate negligence. <hi>What man is he then that feareth the Lord? him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chooſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then ſufficiently proves the Negative, that no Hereſies can be incurred without foregoing faults: but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94095:6"/>we are here further to enquire what poſitive influence there is in Sins to determine the Sinner to a conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Hereſie. For though it is plain, that every Heretick is a Sinner; yet not that every, no nor the fouleſt Sinners are always Hereticks. So that upon the ſuppoſition of Evil, it yet appears not that there is a natural neceſſity thence conſequent, that there muſt be Hereſies.</p>
            <p>To the elucidation whereof, it is to be obſerved, That though every Sinner is not a profeſſed Heretick, yet in every Apoſtate Conſcience there are Seeds of Hereſie, that ſuggeſt thereunto falſe and impoſturous Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus the Voluptuous heretically thinks his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures innocent, and the boons of Nature: The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, in like manner, thinks his Diſeaſe prudence, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and piety to his Off-ſpring: The Proud and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious fancies his Airs to be magnanimous: The Severe, conceits his Cruelty to be Juſtice: The Hypocrite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that God is contented with the outſide, or ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the heart: The Violent thinks there is no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or Judgment to come: And the moſt Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Sinners have too eaſie thoughts of the Divine Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as if it could, or would connive at mens Iniquities. Thus Error is fatally interwoven with our Vices; and the Oyl that feeds the Lamp of God enkindled in our Souls, is precipitated by the violence of our Luſts; and being thus extinguiſhed, leaves us in night and folly, and the ſhadow of death, in which we muſt needs plainly follow every <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> every twinkling Fancy or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, that occurs in all our aims and appetites of Good and Evil. So that when ſo much matter for Hereſie is preparatively collected in a vicious Soul, it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neceſſary and conſequent, that it break out into an actual flame, when our Vices are grown up into Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and Oſtentation, and are ſolicited to Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94095:7"/>by incidental and ſuitable Motives and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>For we muſt obſerve, That the natural neceſſity of actual and avowed Hereſies reſults not purely from a meer internal Vice, but alſo from the appoſite concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of external Allurements; upon which, if the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul be abſolutely intent, and a profeſſion of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie be the only way in proſpect to attain them; there 'tis naturally neceſſary that the uncorrected Appetite fall into Hereſie. Thus <hi>Thebutes</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem, Novatian</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Arius</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reports him) and many others elſewhere, through the eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of an Epiſcopal Character, denied them by the Church, fell into revengeful Paſſions alſo, and thence into Hereſie by a natural conſequence. Thus <hi>Liberius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> after he had witneſſed a good Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and for that went into Exile; yet impatience of the preſſure, and an appetite to the Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair being too predominant, hurried him into <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> and a ſubſcription to the <hi>Arimin</hi> Confeſſion. Now here was no primary Neceſſity that theſe Men ſhould be ambitious, and from thence heretical: but being under the impotency of Ambition, againſt which they had not duly watched; and a profeſſion of Hereſie being a ready way to attain it, they were naturally driven by the blaſts thereof into Acts heretical by a ſecondary and conſequential Neceſſity. For when Men are once ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to their Luſts, they are paſſively hurried away to all the precipices of Evil, to which the ſtings of Paſſion or Appetite ſhall at ranndom drive them. And as this gives a clear account of that natural Neceſſity, by which the Vices of particular Men diſpoſe them to Hereſie: ſo if we take a proſpect of the general diffuſion and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Vice in the Affections of Men, in order to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94095:7"/>their ſecular Intereſts or Pleaſures, by the love of which the Powers of Darkneſs ſupport their tyranny over the Souls of Men; to deſtroy all which, Chriſtianity was inſtituted from above; the general reaſons of things will conclude it neceſſary, that the Faith in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ever find many prejudiced Adverſaries, animated by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical Artifices and Sollicitations to oppoſe and deſeat it: to compaſs which, no way is ſo effectual as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch its Purity by perverſe interpretations, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its Truth dubious by litigious diviſions: And Man being extremely prone to theſe ever ſince the diſperſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> it is natural to preſage, that through ſo great enmity as Chriſtianity muſt needs meet with, by natural conſequence Hereſies and Diviſions muſt be framed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. According to which <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> upon the general proſpect and tendency of things, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fermentation of Paſſions upon the introduction and proceſs of Chriſtianity, our Saviour foretold, that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, conſequential to the Prejudices and Luſts of Men, there muſt be Offences, and that the event, tho not the intent of his coming, <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> would certainly determine in inevitable variances between the neareſt Relations, and blow up an unquenchable flame in the very bowels and vitals of both Kingdoms and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
            <p>But, beſide this natural Neceſſity of Hereſies conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential to the ſinful ſtate of Man, I told you that the words of the Apoſtle ſeem to import a moral Neceſſity for the propagation of them.<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp;c. <hi>There ought to be, there is need there ſhould be Hereſies.</hi> A Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſtrange complexion at the firſt glance, and at which the weak and prejudicate may be eaſily offended. For there have been Opinioniſts, that have thought it unbecoming the Divinity to permit a meer poſſibility of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94095:8"/>moral Evil in the World, which it had been congruous to the Supreme Wiſdom and Goodneſs to have made a Syſtem of immaculate and unchangeable Holineſs to the Lord; not conſidering that ſuch a model would preclude the Sovereign <hi>Regalia</hi> of God's Government, and put his Creatures out of a condition of Religious Obedience, in that whatſoever Acts and Operations of the Creatures are not voluntary, but the paſſive productions of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Influence, are not reducible to the formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and <hi>Scheſis</hi> of a Legiſlative Empire and Government. But our queſtion here is of a greater difficulty. For though a poſſibility of Evil be fundamentally ſuppoſed in the inſtitution of Laws, yet what moral Neceſſity is there of it in any healthy or juſt State of Government, eſpecially in the State of Religion? Is it not enough, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo pure a Theocracy, to admit a poſſibility of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as the<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the Need nots, and vain Excreſcencies of Man's Life? but muſt they be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated to the Neceſſaries, and adapted among the mighty Importances of God's Providence in the Conduct of Religion?

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledg of God! How unſearchable are his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince all Scriptures are written for the inſtruction of Devout and Religious Souls, which God Almighty communicates to all, according to their meaſures, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and benefits; I will with all ſobriety offer to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, what ſeems to be the ſair and clear account of the Divine Wiſdom in this particular. In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, we are to examine three things. Firſt, What that is which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here calls Hereſies, and of which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts and moral Neceſſity. Secondly, What God does to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the production or propagation of them. And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94095:8"/>thirdly, What kind and degree of moral Neceſſity there is to induce God to ſuch a form of concurrence as we ſhall diſcover in this Enquiry.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There muſt be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> he intends no internal Principles or Paſſions hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, of theſe he aſſerts no moral Neceſſity in this place: but only on preſuppoſition of theſe, he makes the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eruptions of them in heretical profeſſions to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſeful and neceſſary. This appears from the End in proſpect, <hi>That they that are approved, may be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</hi> Now external Acts only can give us a diſtinctive ſenſe of Mens Qualifications, and ſo are only neceſſary to that uſe. So that the ſenſe is to be thus reſolved: <hi>Since there among you men of corrupt and heretical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples againſt the Peace and Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, with latent Vices, whence theſe Errors ſpring, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and convenient that they ſhould break out into open and actual Hereſies and Diviſions, in order to a detection of them, and a manifeſtation of the ſincere.</hi> Which is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not of habitual merely, but of actual and profeſſed Hereſies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is to be conſidered what God does, how far he concurs to the production or increaſe of theſe actual Hereſies. Firſt then, As God inſtils not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Principles or Vices heretical, ſo neither doth he promote them into outward Acts by any influential force upon their Wills, at leaſt not ordinarily, nor in a manner obſtructing their preſent power or liberty of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or ſuggeſting greater animoſity to their former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices. Though otherwiſe, if were not unjuſt in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to compel an inward Heretick, againſt his deſigns of concealment and ſecreſie, to diſcover his ulcer even by immediate impulſes on his Soul, when elſe the ſecrecy would be more injurious to others, or more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94095:9"/>to himſelf, than an open detection. For ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that an undiſcerned Heretick may tranſmit an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerned venom into many Members of the Church by the advantage of an outſide Communion, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may not in an open ſtate of Separation; according to that wicked Maxim in Politicks, <hi>Of making ones ſelf of that Party which he deſigneth to deſtroy.</hi> And many times an open diſcovery expoſeth the Heretick to ſuch ſhame, condemnation, and means of conviction too, as may end in his Converſion, which he might have no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of under a covert privacy. Secondly, God, not reſtraining the Heretick from a liberty to return, may put him into ſuch occurrences of Objects, Acquaintance, or Examples, by attending unto which he may give vent to his Thoughts and Principles, in order to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome flattering Hopes. And in this God doth no evil, becauſe they are no inevitable Stumbling-blocks to him, he being at liberty to recall himſelf, and not yield up his Soul to the unlawful Appetites and Temptations that preſent themſelves before him. Thirdly, When a man hath devoted himſelf to all Impiety, God may juſtly deliver him up to the power of lying and Apoſtate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as he did <hi>Ahab</hi>'s wicked Prophets, to act him to all thoſe kinds and degrees of actual Sins and Hereſies from which the hand of God ſhall not reſtrain them. Fourthly, When Impiety is rampant, God may permit it a greater or leſs latitude of acting, according as to his Infinite Wiſdom ſhall ſeem expedient in the general iſſue of things: by which greater or ſtraiter limitation the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall not be forced to any actual Crime, but only confined within ſuch a compaſs, without which he ſhall not be able to exert his Malice: Even as the Envy of the Devil at <hi>Job</hi> was permitted Exerciſe, but with a precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to touch his Life. In all which methods of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94095:9"/>God's poſitive, permiſſive, or reſtrictive Concurrence, there is no tincture of the leaſt Iniquity, not only from the juſt Cauſes, and laudable Ends thereof; but becauſe God infuſes no evil Intention into either the actual or habitual Wills of wicked Men, but only either infatuates, permits, or encloſes them, and their operations, as he ſeeth requiſite. For that, which theſe Ways and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God are concerned in, is not the inner Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Impious Mind to the love or choice of Evil, in which alone conſiſts the guilt before God; but only at the moſt, the reſtriction of it in its outward Actions, which conſidered ſeparately in themſelves, from all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Will that acts them, may be indeed occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally hurtful, but involve not in them the intrinſick guilt, which is purely ſeated in the Malice of the Mind. For a Falſhood unwittingly uttered, is no Lye: and in Man-ſlaughter 'tis not Chance, but Intention makes the Murther. So that theſe Divine Concurrences, touching only the bare external Acts of Hereſie ſeparately from their Fountains, affect not the malice, nor the radical guilt of Evil, but only the reſults and conſequences of it (which are on this ſide the Mind, wherein the guilt only lodges) with no other deſign, but to convert them to a great and noble good. And if God, having domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the life and fate of Man, may permit a violent Man to murther the Innocent, though the Murther be an inevitable oppreſſion of the Murthered, while God inſtills no malice into the Mind of the Murtherer; much more is the Almighty innocent in his Providential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of actual Hereſies. 'Tis true indeed, that Hereſie is the murther of the Soul, whereas Homicide is only the deſtruction of the Body: but to this I anſwer, That the murtherous tendency of Acts Heretical, is neither inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, nor inſuperable, nor irrecoverable. For the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94095:10"/>of the Proſelyte is voluntary, and ſo he is <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> his own Murtherer, though at the temptation of a Seducer, and ſo cannot charge his murther wholly upon the very Tempter, much leſs upon God, who did not force him to imbibe, but by his Word, and the good motions of his Holy Spirit, forewarned to beware of the Deluſion; and in mercy to him offers him time, and means of recovery, e're the poyſon determine in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death. And when to theſe Conſiderations we ſhall add, That all theſe Procedures of Almighty God are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the impulſive provocations of monſtrous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, and diffuſive Corruptions, we cannot condemn our Heavenly Father of Injuſtice, if he had no other end herein, but only<note n="(m)" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>To deliver up the ungodly unto ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie; to the end, they might all be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> But ſince this is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but the event only of theſe Divine Methods upon the finally Incorrigible; and there are many gracious ends to the good of all Men in God's permiſſion of actual Hereſies, in which conſiſts this moral Neceſſity of them mentioned by the Apoſtle: We are now ſmoothly brought to the third Conſideration; What is the Moral Neceſſity for their being in the World.</p>
            <p>That therefore is Morally neceſſary, which either the Rules of Duty, or Dictates of Wiſdom recommend; and this either ſtrictly, ſo that the omiſſion will be either a fault, or a damage: or elſe more freely in ſuch a latitude, that though the omiſſion be not injurious, yet the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will be expedient: in which latter degree and ſenſe, Moral Neceſſity is no more than Rational Convenience, and amounts not to the force of a rigorous Obligation. And both theſe kinds of Moral Neceſſity may be either abſolute in the nature and reaſon of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94095:10"/>or relative to antecedent Cauſes, of which they are conſequential; or to final Iſſues, to which they are miniſterial by a Moral influence and motion on the Mind. Which being thus premiſed, it is natural to reſolve, that the Moral Neceſſity of actual Hereſies deſcends not from any Laws of Duty, but from the Reaſons of Wiſdom: which, upon an antecedent Suppoſition of wicked Men, and ſecret Hereticks in the Church, propoſes the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them, in a manifeſtation of their Principles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely beneficial and convenient. Firſt, To the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks themſelves, in order to their converſion. Secondly, To the Wavering, in order to their probation and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. And thirdly, To the Approved and Faithful, in order to their glory.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, The permiſſion of actual Hereſies is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God to the good of Hereticks many ways. For firſt, While Men kept their Hereſies cloſe within their ſecret Cells, the Catholick Doctors, not diſcerning the Hearts, make no direct applications to them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and cleanſe them. So that detection is neceſſary in order to their better inſtruction. And ſecondly, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſecrecy of Hereſies within the Breaſts of Men, they fondly imagine, that upon a diſcovery they will take mightily in the World, and charm great multitudes of Men into rapture and admiration, and that no Man will be able to gainſay them. But ſo it always happens, that, tho Fools and Wretches may be impoſed upon, yet the Wiſe and beſt part of Mankind will deſpiſe and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate what the Hereticks thought would raviſh them: And thus collecting all their force of Truth and Wiſdom, will baffle and confound them, and hiſs them off the Stage, and expoſe them to the publick Senſe of Men as the Peſts of Religion, and Agents of the wicked One. Which Iſſues ſo defeating the falſe Hopes and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94095:11"/>of the Heretick, together with the convictions of Truth to be found in the Labours of thoſe that refute him, the general contempt and abomination paſt upon him, the reverberations of his Conſcience, deſerted by the Spirit of God, and ſcourged by the Spirits of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whom he ſerved, are proper and forcible motives to Humiliation and Repentance, which nought but an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual and obdurate Stupor can reſiſt. And yet if theſe prove ineffectual, the Lenity of God uſes other means to tire them out of their own Follies. For when men have once forſaken the way of Truth, they travel into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing and endleſs mazes, from one Error to another, either ſucceſſive and conſequential, or elſe caſual and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral.

               <hi>They went aſtray in the Wilderneſs out of the way, and found no City to dwell in: Hungry and thirſty, their Soul fainted in them.</hi> And being in ſuch a deſert ſtate, they will (if at all, or ever) be apt to relent, <hi>And to cry unto the Lord in their trouble, to deliver them out of their diſtreſs, to lead them forth by the right way, that they may go, and dwell in the City that is refreſhed with the ſtreams and fountains of living waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The diffuſion of open Hereſies contributes to the probation and ſettlement of wavering, indifferent, and ungrounded Souls. For in times of Ignorance, or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity, many Men attend not to the force or deſign of Religious Inſtitutions, but ſleep on ſupinely in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith of the faſhionable Religion. In which caſe and ſtate of drowſineſs, no moral or external Good is ſo apt to excite men to a ſevere enquiry and ſtudy of True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as the outrage of Hereſies, which ſtartle Men out of their heavy Lethargy, yea, even out of their Graves, by a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94095:11"/>quick and forcible Reſurrection, crying, as it were, aloud with the voice of a Trumpet (and that a Trumpet of War too) in the ears of every ſuch dull and doating Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi> To this end God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time permitted falſe Prophets to ariſe, and to tempt his People to Idolatry, that he might try and confirm them. Thus <hi>Moſes:</hi> 
               <note n="(p)" place="margin">Deut. 13.1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a ſign, or a wonder: And the ſign or wonder come to paſs, whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſaying, Let us go ſerve other Gods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet, or that Dreamer of dreams, for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your ſoul:</hi> viz. Permitting ſuch Temptations to ariſe, not to be of equal force with the Miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> and Prophets, but only ſtrange enough to ſtartle the Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and the Improvident, and to try them by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, and to provoke them to compare it with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonial Fortifications of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and thus finally to inſtruct and confirm them in the Laws and Ordinances of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thus at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Chriſtianity, our Lord foretold,<note n="(q)" place="margin">Matt. 24.11, 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>That many falſe Prophets, and falſe Chriſts ſhould ariſe, and ſhew great ſigns and wonders, and deceive many: Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have told you before;</hi>
               <note n="(t)" place="margin">1 John 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>That we might not believe every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God, when many-falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Divine Permiſſion of Hereſies is uſeful to the manifeſt juſtification of the Faithful, and the Faith. For while the truth of our Faith meets with no oppoſition, Men are generally content with the ſimplicity of its Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in Creeds, and ſummary Abſtracts of Chriſtian Doctrine, and with the plain ſenſe of the obvious and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94095:12"/>eaſie Scriptures. But when it's attacked by Hereſies, and falſe Principles, pretendedly deduced from Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, this puts the Zeal of the Faithful into a mighty fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to trace the Sacred Oracles, through all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and Myſteries interſperſed both in the Old and New Teſtament; and by a Canonical Interpretation from the concurrent harmony of them, to deduce a firm <hi>Catena</hi> of all the Catholick Principles of Chriſtian Piety, and to chaſe away into ſhame and confuſion every Impoſture that exalts it ſelf againſt the healing Truth and Wiſdom of God. Thus as ſoon as Hereticks were crept into the Church, St. <hi>Jude</hi> 
               <note n="(s)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Jud.</hi> Epiſt.</note> 
               <hi>gave all diligence to write to them of the common Salvation, and to exhort them to contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for the Faith that was once delivered unto the Saints, viz.</hi> by diſcuſſing the Scriptures, <hi>which are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Thus Catechiſm makes us Babes in Chriſt, but even He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie it ſelf makes the<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Approved and Faithful perfectly mature in the Wiſdom that is of God: by which he hath, and will <hi>deſtroy the wiſdom of the Wiſe, and bring to nought the underſtanding of the Prudent.</hi> Hereſie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which <hi>Celſus,</hi> and other Enemies of Chriſtianity, deride as the blemiſh of our Religion, proves the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it in the Original, and the glory of it in the End. For it was a ſagacious hint of <hi>Origen,</hi> 
               <note n="(t)" place="margin">Orig. <hi>contra</hi> Celſum, 1.3.—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>That all different Hereſies in all Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſecular or ſacred, ſpring from ſome good and noble Original.</hi> Which, while it can be preſerved virgin and inviolate, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no reproach from the laſcivient follies of vain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent <hi>Scioliſts.</hi> And as to the Majeſtick glory of our Religion, it ſits in the Firmament of Heaven on high, clothed with the Sun, and the beams of Eſſential Light, which all the filthy Exhalations of Spiritual Wizards and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94095:12"/>Impoſtors will never be able to darken or vilify: Since Chriſtianity ever improved by oppoſitions, emerged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Hereſies, and lives the more ſtrongly by continual Perſecutions; and by its immovable perpetuity againſt all poſſible force and fraud, becomes a Symbol and a Pledge of that Eternity, which it promiſeth, and to which it leads us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Having thus diſcovered both the natural and moral Neceſſity of Hereſies in the World, Let us in the laſt place conſider, what ſeaſonable Uſes, (beſides thoſe, which are already touched on) Humane Prudence, under the conduct of the Divine Wiſdom, will ſuggeſt unto us. Upon which, being to ſpeak to an Auditory of a double Character, it is fit I ſhould offer ſome Conſiderations proper to each Order.</p>
            <p>And here indeed, were there time to expatiate, lies a large Plain before me, relating to the Diſcipline, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Sanctity of the Prieſthood; and the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Humility, and Morals of the People. But a regard to your uneaſineſs, the narrowneſs of the time, and the Laws of Modeſty, muſt, and ſhall confine me.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, The Adminiſtration of Diſcipline, being in the hands of my Superior, requires from him a Leſſon of Prudence and Wiſdom to me, and to us all, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enjoins me ſilence in this particular. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the preſent State and Circumſtances of the Church require no ſuch accurate enforcements of it in this jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: The Counſel of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> being ſeaſonable, <note n="(u)" place="margin">Aug. <hi>de Fid. &amp; Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib. cap.</hi> 5.</note>

And here, my

            <p>And you, Good People, remember carefully, that you are in the Station of Diſciples, and are as much bound to learn, as we to teach: and in order thereunto, to be humble, diligent, and tractable, without which no Scholar thrives under the beſt Tutors.
