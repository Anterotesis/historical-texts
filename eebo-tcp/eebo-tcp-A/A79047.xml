            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <item>

or upon neglect thereof, to undergo his
Majeſties ſevereſt cenſure.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And that if he refuſed to performe theſe their
honourable demands, they vowed to make him
the Subject of their that dayes fury.</p>
            <p>Theſe threats ſo farre incenſed my Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi>
that he was about to leave them without reply,
but after a litle conſideration he wheeld about,
and boldly marcht up to them, ſpeaking as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I much wonder that men of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in whoſe breaſts true honour ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
ſhould ſo much derogate from their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
and noble Predeceſſors, as to ſeeke (for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ends) the ruine of that Kingdom they ſhould
endeavour to ſupport. Doth fond ambition, or
your ſelfe-will'd pride ſo much bewitch you,
that you cannot ſee the crown of all your actions?
When the great Councel of the Parliament was
firſt aſſembled, you then were Members; why
did you not continue? Was it becauſe your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were ſo bad, you were aſhamed to own them?
Had you done evill in ſome petty kind, Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124045:4"/>
might have quitted you from that, and you
have been ſtill honoured, loved, and feared; but
by theſe actions (which tend both to the ruine of
King and Kingdome, and your ſelves too) you
cannot make amends for former evils.</p>
            <p>As for theſe Propoſitions, take this in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:</p>
            <p>When that His Majeſty, His poſterity, and the peace
of the Kingdome ſhall be ſecured from you that ſeeke the
ruine of them all, I gladly ſhall lay downe my Armes
and Power.</p>
            <p>As for the Caſtle, it was delivered to my truſt by the
High Court of Parliament, who reſerve it for the Kings
uſe; and dare boldly ſay will ſo imploy it, and not like
you imploy it againſt the King.</p>
            <p>As for the Commiſsion of Array, you know it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
and like your actions, deſtructive both to the
Laws and Religion of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>For the Magazine of the County, it was delivered
to him both by the Parliament, and the Countrey; and
although he was not an Earle, yet he dares be a truer
Subject to his King, and a faithfuller ſervant to his
Countrey; and being ſo, he was reſolved to keep it till
<hi>Northampton</hi> could ſhew him greater authority for
his delivery of the ſame.</p>
            <p>As touching His Majeſties Pardon, as he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that he had not given any occaſion of offence to His
Majeſty, ſo he needed not pardon; that being a duty
belonging to offenders, ſuch as themſelves; and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
them to ſue out a pardon with ſpeed, for feare
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124045:5"/>
that their offences being once knowne, they prove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable;
for he doubted not but that in a ſhort time
His Majeſty would finde who are his beſt friends. As
for their fury, he bade them ſpit their venome; for
he hoped that <hi>Northampton</hi> ſhould be tranſlated to
<hi>Warwick,</hi> and ſtand centry upon <hi>Warwick-caſtle,</hi>
to fright crowes, kites, and buzzards.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken, they turned their horſes,
and rode up to their Troops: my Lord <hi>Books</hi>
thinking that they had intended to have done
ſomething, but they very fairely wheeled about,
and marched away, not once ſo much as taking
their leave; which my Lord <hi>Brooks</hi> ſeeing, did
the like, and marched with his men to <hi>Warwick:</hi>
Where after many thanks he read part of the
Reſolution of the Lords and Commons to them,
animating them on to the ſame Reſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We the Lords and Commons doe declare, that this is
the true cauſe for which we raiſe Armes, in the defence
whereof we are reſolved to live and die.</hi>
