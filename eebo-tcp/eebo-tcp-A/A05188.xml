            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you cleannesse of teethe in all your Cities, and scarcenesse of bread in all your places, yet haue you not returned vnto me, sayth the Lord.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that God sendeth the scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all things necessarie for mans life, and that he openeth and shutteth the clouds at his pleasure. And if God should not send it, his seruaunts the Prophets could not by his instinct set downe the time so exactly (as in both the Testaments they doe) when it should come, howe long it shoulde last, when it should cease, and other thinges of lesse account then these, which the wisdome of man can of it selfe neither foresee, nor conceiue. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph.

plentifull, and so manie barren yeares. <hi>Elizeus</hi> prophesied of the like number yeares of famine. 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 8..</p>
            <p>In the new Testament, <hi>Agabus</hi> the Prophet by the breath of Gods spirit, foretold of an vniuersall famine ouer the whole world. <hi>Acts.</hi> 11.28. which fell out true in the raigne of <hi>Claudius Caesar.</hi> These things it pleased God to reueale to his faithfull seruants, that in due time they might prouide for themselues, least afterward to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the name of Christians, they should be forced to seek for sustina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from the Paganish infidell. True it is that wee reade of some <hi>Astrologers,</hi> which haue foretold both of plenty, and scarcitie to come: among the rest <hi>Thales,</hi> as <hi>Diogenes Laettius</hi> recordeth, was accused that through giuing him selfe wholly to the studie of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, hee neglected his familie and priuate gaine, wherevppon hauing by naturall causes foreseen that there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8825:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should be the next yeare following a great scarcitie of oile, he ingrossed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands for that present yeare all the Oliue Gardens, so that in the dearth he sold Oile at what price hee list himselfe. Whereby hee shewed that Philosophie will serue for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of a man, if he will so employ it. Notwithstanding this, and the like predictions of starre-gasing diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, howsoeuer they argue a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, yet no necessitie of truth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing oft times beene taken tardie. For God is not bound to these second cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but eftsoones bringeth to passe many things besides, and contrarie to the course of nature, so that there is much difference betweene the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellings of the holy Prophets, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures of these <hi>VVelkin VVisards,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Almanacke makers.</note> whose Prognostications of euerie yeares warres, diseases, heate, colde, drought, moysture, grounded vpon no certaintie, proue either manifest
<pb facs="tcp:8825:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vntruthes, or coniecturall ghesses, most vncertaine conclusions, most certaine collusions. (So that one of their owne late Prophets, as beeing guiltie of their mockeries, hath very fitlie prefixed before his yearely false oracles, I would say Almanacks, that speech of <hi>Dauid,</hi> for the front verse of his calculations: <hi>Let God be true, and euerie man a liar.</hi>) No doubt there is otherwise good vse of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides</hi> or Almanackes, by them to knowe the motion of the Moone, with set feastes, and other things of like kinde: as for the rest of the contentes, they are like vnto them that make them, alwayes certaine in their vncertaintie. Husbandmen also haue their kind of obseruations, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of tempests, &amp; winds through the whole yeare, the assurance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is (as wee commonly speake) but <hi>Hit I misse I:</hi> sometimes true, verie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten false. For God being the Lord of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8825:12"/>
nature, ruleth as himselfe pleaseth, without, yea, and against the rules of nature. To which power <hi>Salomon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting, requesteth of God, that if in time of <hi>Famin,</hi> the people being assem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled, should pray for plentie, it wold please him so to crosse or order those second causes, that the present plague might be remoued. Which, if it shuld come rather by casuall accidents, then by diuine ordinance, should not need the vse of praiers, were it neuer so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame. And what else meant God himselfe, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.10. commaunding his people of <hi>Israel,</hi> that the day after the <hi>Inning of the corne,</hi> they shoulde bring a shease for an offering to the Lord, and shake it before him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, it was lawful for them to eat bread of new wheate? And againe in the feast of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> two loaues of their new corne, for a first fruits vnto the Lord. vers. 17. In the <hi>Autumne</hi> also, the like vse in the feast of <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:</hi>

verse 39. then by all these cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to teach them, that plentie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth not by mans labour, sweate, or industrie, but of Gods blessing onely, and therefore he alone to be thanked, both for <hi>Haruest,</hi> and <hi>Vintage,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to bee praied vnto, to preserue the corne, both on the ground, and in the barn, and withal to know how to vse those blissings to Gods glorie, and their owne good. For this is the right vse, saith Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. of Gods creatures, to sanctifie them by praier and thankes-giuing.

Hence is that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 4. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> he calleth things that are not, as though they were: such is the power of God. It hath beene found by experience, that both Sommer and Haruest haue answered our desires, both through the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full encrease vppon the ground, and through the commodious housing into the barne, insomuch that there hath been great hope of abundance,

The great encrease of people, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all sortes of Artificers, the diuers cosonages, and conny-cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching deceits, may cause a scarcitie.

First, that God which now giueth vs bread for sustenance, may if it please him feed vs otherwise. Secondly, not to attribute the vertue of norishment to the creature of bread, but to his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret grace wherby he blesseth it to our stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth.

Yea the Pagans and Gentiles, beleeued that God defended both cattle and corn, and guided the seasons, &amp; ruled the stormes, only herein they sinned, in attributing to other inferiour and supposed Gods, this great power of the true God, in worshipping <hi>Ceres</hi> for corne, <hi>Bacchus</hi> for wine, <hi>Flora</hi> for flowers, <hi>Robigo</hi> against blasting &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, &amp; <hi>Apollo Nomius,</hi> or <hi>Pastorall</hi> for their pasturs &amp; medows: to all which and more then these, they dedicated certaine feasts, on which they made their praiers according to their seueral powers: they had also their sacrifices called <hi>Amber talia,</hi> as <hi>Festus</hi> deriues the word, because they went in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about their arable grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Latins, Arua.</hi> But we thogh we vse in good policy, and in a godly acknowledgement fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue these blessings,<note place="margin">Perambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians.</note> the like <hi>Perambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>

which for the extremitie thereof is come into a prouerbe.

In the <hi>Holy warre</hi> which the Christians
<pb facs="tcp:8825:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had in <hi>Syria,</hi> in all places of the world there was a great <hi>Famine,</hi> especially in the Christian armie, as in an example or two you shall see. When <hi>Antiochia</hi> was besieged by the <hi>Sarracenes,</hi> such an intollerable <hi>Famine</hi> followed their plentie, that hardly they abstained from mans flesh. <hi>Otho Frising. li.</hi> 7. <hi>ca.</hi> 4 let them note this by the way, which thinke that the meane to auoide a dearth, is to presse Souldiours out of the land. About <hi>Prage</hi> in <hi>Bohemia. An.</hi> 284. many died through extreame hunger: and <hi>Anno.</hi> 1313. through <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme</hi> and <hi>Polonia,</hi> as <hi>Vrspergensis</hi> out of the 4. Booke of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles describeth, Cap. 8. A <hi>Famine</hi> more cruell then any warre, raged in those two Countries, and dayly increased, lasting three full yeares, absuming many men, parents slaying their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they their parents, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue their hunger: some did not stick to take the flesh of them that were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8825:34"/>
executed on the gallowes, to stay the rage thereof, Wolues set vpon those they met, &amp; deuoured them, though they carried Gunns and Bowes for their defence. Oftentimes it falleth out, that prisoners condemned to die, with <hi>Famine,</hi> haue eaten of their own flesh so farre as they could reach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could die: many also haue had no other remedie to preuent it, but by slaying themselues. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which maketh this plague more dreadfull, it seldome or neuer commeth without a pestilence. And so much of the horror of this fearfull punishment. Now why God doth punish men with this so terrible a iudgement, we will shew in the next Sermon. <hi>God of his mercie turne our hearts to him, that he may turn this plague from vs.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N any publike cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, wherto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is subiect, two things are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be considered. First, from whom. Secondly, for what cause it comes, wherin the iudgment of the world respecting the second causes, rather then the first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, is so fouly corrupted, that men know not well, either where to aske cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, or how to behaue themselues beeing surprised with any miserie. Among all other, <hi>Famin</hi> &amp; <hi>Dearth</hi> of vittails is not the least, of which wee now intreat, hauing in our first sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proued both by testimonies &amp; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of scripture, the true, first, &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause to bee God. <hi>I am he,</hi> (saith God of himself) by <hi>Esay.</hi> 45.7. which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8825:35"/>
               <hi>make peace, and create euill,</hi> of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not of sinning. Naturall cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and mens malice beeing no cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but outward meanes which God vseth, stirring vp the wicked to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice vs (not by inspiring their malice into them, but vsing the malice which is in them for his iudgement, and our chastisement.) Secondly, we haue there described the miseries and mischiefes of that dreadfull plague. Now in the third place it followeth, to enquire what should mooue so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and mercifull a God to afflict men, good and bad, olde and young, Countries and Nations, with this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible scourge. All men indeede feele this heauy hand of Gods wrath, and the complaint is generall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: but wanting a right iudgement beeing more blockish then the bruit beast, neither feele nor vnderstand, either in the motiues that prouoke it, or the meanes howe to bee freed
<pb facs="tcp:8825:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from it: taking the wrong cause for the right, and the second for the first. The common multitude with one consent laie all the fault vpon the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Landlordes enhauncing their rentes, the mallice of Farmers grudging without cause, vnmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Vsurers grinding without pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the intollerable licenses of <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> and <hi>Solesales,</hi> ingrossing without measure, the couetousnesse of hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders keeping vp their graine without mercie: (all which no doubt, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal outward meanes whereby God doth bring it to effect) but of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in maners, of vices and vilenesse of life, of the <hi>Immunitie</hi> and <hi>Impunitie</hi> of sinning, without shame, without restraint not one word. Therefore as the <hi>Phisitian</hi> hitting vppon the right humour and cause of the disease, doth with better iudgement and happier successe, applie his phisicke: so wee iumping vpon the true causes of this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8825:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so great a malladie, shall more easilie know both what to do in this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and how to auoyd it. First ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs lift vp our eyes to God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishyng, and then enquire what mooues him to it, so shall we come to know our selues the better. But here also wee must take heed of iudging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, entertaining false causes for the true. For in this and the like calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the whole fault for the most part is laide vpon Religion. Certaine Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants and Varlets, crying out of the Pulpit, in the open Market, at their publike Feasts, that the new Religion (for so they entitle the preaching of the Gospell) is the onely cause of this <hi>Dearth.</hi> Since there hath bene a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the Saintes departed, haue not their <hi>Due honor,</hi> and the <hi>Olde manner of worshipping God</hi> (for so they call their <hi>Romish superstition</hi>) is aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, the world hath bene still in a <hi>Deluge of Calamitie:</hi> from which, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8825:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we should be freed, if we had kept the professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our forefathers. Thus they speake, to the ende they may make the world to despise &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite vs: but if they list, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is not long since their Professours haue tasted of this smart whip, as well as we: some examples you haue in the former Sermon. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this quarrell straunge or fresh. For in the raigne of <hi>Ahab,</hi> there was a long <hi>Famine</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi> at which the King beeing mooued, in his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meeting <hi>Eliiah</hi> the Prophet, hee tolde him that it was he which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>Israel,</hi> meaning by his speech, that hee caused the <hi>Dearth</hi> which so troubled the lande (in which sense, <hi>Ionathan</hi> saide, his Father <hi>Saul</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the people, when hee willed them to abstaine from meate) but <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah</hi> answered boldly, <hi>It is not I, but thou &amp; thy fathers house, because you haue left the Commandement of the Lord, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8825:37"/>
haue followed Baall.</hi> So afterward <hi>Ioram</hi> the King laide the cause of the <hi>Famine</hi> vpon <hi>Elizeus,</hi> which was so great that mothers eate their owne children, the King in a rage sent his seruaunt to kill the Prophet, but being forewarned of God, hee let him alone. The same was the vsuall obiection wherewith the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were vpbraided, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Cyprian, Arnobius,</hi> and other which wrote <hi>Apologies</hi> for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians witnesse. For as oft as God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the world with Frost, Hayle, Famine, Warre, Pestilence, Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or any other generall and open calamitie, presently they cried out, <hi>Away with these Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s from the earth, to the beastes with them, that they may be deuoured, cast them to the Lyons,</hi> these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious wretches, for they are not woorthie to liue. <hi>Euse. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth the edict and proclamation, <hi>Maximinus</hi> set vp against them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee declareth, that all the miseries
<pb facs="tcp:8825:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which the world hitherto had suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, came vppon the earth onlie for that pernicious and detestable errour of these vile caitifs, (so he called the Christians) and withall boasted, that therfore in his time there was neither Pestilence nor Warre, because hee continued the worship of his Gods, and put the Christians to tortures and punishment. Albeit not long after, all those mischiefes at once ouertooke and ouerwhelmed him, quelling and confuting that his impudent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious blasphemie against the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God. So that no man must maruel that prophane &amp; wicked hel-hounds which hate the truth and the light of the Gospell, should belch out such blasphemie, since that Christ himselfe foretold his Apostles of these things to come. The holie scripture doth in plaine tearmes set downe, that the <hi>Dearth of Victualls</hi> is the scourge of God, for the manifold and enormous

In the 14. Chapter, which is his Sermon hee made in that time of <hi>Famine,</hi> hee setteth downe the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8825:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cause thereof briefly: <hi>Psalme.</hi> 7. <hi>Their sinnes, iniquities, and rebellions.</hi> The false prophets in the time of <hi>Famine,</hi> promiseth them fruitfull and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full yeares, and when there was plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they bid them not to feare anie <hi>Dearth</hi> in that so great abundance, and the Iewes beleeued them, for such is the nature of man quickly to harken, and easily to beleeue them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise prosperitie. Wherupon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet telles them that they shal be sure to perish both with <hi>Famine</hi> and <hi>Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> say the other what they will, in these words: <hi>By Sword and Famin, shall those Prophets be consumed. And the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whome these prophets doo prophecie, shall be cast out in the streets of Ierusalem, because of the Famine and the Sworde.</hi> The verie same doctrine did <hi>Ezechiel</hi> preach in <hi>Babilon,</hi> which <hi>Ieremy</hi> did in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that for their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and greeuous sinnes, manie of them should be giuen ouer by God
<pb facs="tcp:8825:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Famine,</hi> both they which were alreadie, and they also which shuld return home afterward. In the 4. Chapt. he is more vehement and plaine, where God willeth him to pourtray the Cittie of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a brick, to besiege it, &amp; the whole time of the siege to eate bread made of wheate, barley, beanes, lentiles, millet &amp; fetches, and that by weight, and drinke water by measure, and in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>steede of coales to bake his breade with, to take mans, or bullockes dung. By all which, as himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it, Verse. 16, it was meant that the force of nourishing should be taken from the bread, and that their bread shuld be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them by weight, and their water by measure, and that they should want fuell necessarie in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> For whiles Cities are besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and in defensed places by Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons kept, if <hi>Famin</hi> or <hi>Dearth</hi> be feared, all the corne is vsually carried to the

Generall and Captaines, which serue it out to euerie man by weight and measure: and so water also in drie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for in many vplands the souldiers haue bene constrained to fetch their water by force and armes, as in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem: the cause of all this he yeeldeth in the ende of the Chapter, <hi>Bread and water shall faile them, and they shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume away because of their iniquitie.</hi> The same hee repeateth almost word for word in the 12. Chapter, he said, <hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi>: Verse 7. <hi>Because you haue not walked in my statutes, nor kept my iudgements,</hi> Verse 10. <hi>The fathers shall eate their sonnes, and the sonnes shall eate their fathers, &amp;c.</hi> This was a iust iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, they contrarie to God his expresse commaundement, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their sonnes to <hi>Moloch,</hi> (that is he whom the Gentiles call <hi>Saturnus</hi>) so that this was a punishment by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation, a like plague, for the like offence. And a litle after, ver. 16. <hi>I wil
<pb facs="tcp:8825:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
send vpon you the euil Arrowes of Famin, which shall be for your destruction, and I will increase the Famine vppon you, and will breake the staffe of bread.</hi> By the Arrowes of <hi>Famine,</hi> he meaneth the Canker and Palmer wormes, the gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers &amp; vermin, immoderate heat, vnseasonable weather, and showres: as also those walking Vermin, &amp; those Tempests of a common wealth, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolists, Ingrossers, Cornhoorders,</hi> who had rather the corne should waxe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie in their garners, then to sell it out at a reasonable rate. And chap. 6. verse 11. <hi>Thus saith the Lorde, smite the earth with thy hand, and stretch foorth with thy foote and say, Alas, for al the wicked abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the house of Israel, for they shal fall by the sword, by the Famine, and by the pestilence.</hi> And in the 7. chap. he againe foretelleth of a great afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ensue for the abhominable wickednes of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: <hi>VVithout the sword, &amp; within plague &amp; Famin.</hi> And a litle after he speaketh
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8825:41"/>
vnto <hi>Richmen,</hi> to whom also he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth the like punishment, who (like vnto the wealthy Cormullions of our time) increase their wealth by others want, some of them abusing the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennesse of the earth, and the <hi>Dearth</hi> of graine, to their owne gaine: other feeding &amp; faring most riotously, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the poore did starue most rufully: <hi>Their siluer and their golde cannot deliuer them in the day of the wrath of the Lorde God, they shall not satisfie their soules, neither fill their bowels: for this ruine is for their iniquitie.</hi> Rich men of all others, thinke themselues best armed against all daungers that may happen either to soule or bodie, <hi>Prouer.</hi> 10.15. <hi>The rich mans goods are his strong cittie:</hi> that is, as souldiers trust to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, so doo they to their wealth, which often failes them: for the time may come wherein they may feele the like want which the poore distressed doo, whome they so litle
<pb facs="tcp:8825:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
regard: for in the siege and expug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Citties, the Rich vsually fare worse then the poore, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon souldier forcing them by torture of paine, or terror of death, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse where their wealth lyeth. In the fourth Chapter, hee threateneth to the hard hearted and impenitent sinners, soure plagues, Sword, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, <hi>Famine,</hi> noysome beastes. Of <hi>Famine</hi> thus he speaketh: vers. 13. <hi>Sonne of man, if the land sinne against me by committing a trespasse</hi> (the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word signifieth a lie) <hi>I will stretch out my hand vpon it, and will breake the staffe of the bread thereof, and will send Famine vpon it</hi>: and though these three men <hi>Noah, Daniel, Iob,</hi> were among them, they should deliuer but their owne soules by their righteousnesse, saith the Lord God. The cause, why this Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> vrgeth the people with the threats of this plague, more vehemently and hotly then the other
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8825:42"/>
Prophets, is because the state of the Iewes was then most daungerous, no threatenings, no warnings woulde mooue them, rebellious they were alway and stifnecked, therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth the oftner this Blow, to make it the more to enter into and pearce them: and in a fewe words hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth much matter. First that <hi>God is the efficient cause of Famine:</hi> the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue or forcing causes, <hi>their sinnes:</hi> the maner, <hi>The bread shall not nourish them:</hi> the effects, <hi>Man and beast, rich and poore, pelly melly shall die.</hi> Now go we on to the smaller Prophet. <hi>Hos. cap.</hi> 4: makes a long catalogue or beadroule of sinnes, for which God chasteneth his people with this affliction. Thus hee speaketh: <hi>The Lorde hath a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie with the Inhabitaunts of the lande, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the lande, by swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and lying, and killing, and stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and whoring, they breake out, and
<pb facs="tcp:8825:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bloud toucheth bloud. Therefore shall the lande mourne, the foules of the heauen, the beastes of the fielde, and the fishes of the sea shall be taken away.</hi> And in his ninth Chapter, verse 1. <hi>Reioyce not</hi> ô Israel <hi>for ioy, as other people, for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loued a rewarde vppon euerie corne floore. The floore, and the VVinepresse shall not feede them, and the new VVine shall faile in her, &amp;c. Amos cap.</hi> 4, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braydeth the people, who for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sake went on pilgrimage to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> and yet defiled themselues with <hi>Idolatry &amp; false whorsip,</hi> &amp; telleth them that therfore he will giue them <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of teeth:</hi> that is, they shal not need any <hi>Toothpikes</hi> to cleanse their teethe for any meat sticking in them, because hardly they shuld haue brown bread to chew on. By all which places it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appears, that <hi>Famin</hi> &amp; <hi>Dearth</hi> is sent for the punishment of sinnes, especially <hi>Atheisme, and false worship.</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:8825:43"/>
And so much generally, or as we say, in the whole lumpe of all the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious sinnes which are causes of this iudgement, now we will single some of them out, and examine them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell meale: namely, how God hath punished euen some speciall sinnes this way. For many thinke that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their sinnes are not notorious and written in their foreheades, not grosse sinnes, as Idolatry, and such like, that therefore they deserue not to be in this kinde afflicted: But they must know, that being subiect natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to sinne, they must also lie open to the common punishment of sinne. Let vs see then some particulars, for which GOD expresly threateneth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this plague by name. First, <hi>Iere. cap.</hi> II: declareth how his countrey men in <hi>Anathoth,</hi> had forbidden him to preach vpon paine of his life,<note place="margin">Contempt of Gods word.</note> this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency of theirs, God threatneth to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge by <hi>Famin</hi>: ver. 21.22.

of <hi>Anathots</hi> that say, <hi>Prophecie no more in the name of the Lord, that thou die not by our hands. Behold, saith the Lord, I will visit them, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine, &amp;c.</hi> Surely, this is nothing else but iustice, if men set light by the worde of God, the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foode of their soules, that hee should keepe from them the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sustenaunce of their bodies. See <hi>Amos. cap.</hi> 8. And whereas many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to heare the worde, to conferre with Preachers, and to reade Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but will not obey what they heare, this contempt doth God this way punish. <hi>Iere.</hi> 42. When the Citie was sacked by <hi>Nabuchodonozor,</hi> the remnant left behind came to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> to aske of him whether they should go downe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> or no? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, perswading them the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, notwithstanding they woulde needes goe: for this <hi>dissembling dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight</hi> hee threatneth this plague of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8825:44"/>
               <hi>Famine</hi> to pursue them in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The like course do we take, daily hearing, but stil refusing to obey, so that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie are wee when wee call for our daily bread, not be heard by God in that petition.</p>

punishment allotted for sinne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then are the godlie therewith plagued? as we see by the examples of <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and others of whom we spake before. In the dayes of <hi>Ahab,</hi> many godly in <hi>Israel</hi> this way afflicted: God himselfe confessing that there were seuen thousande which neuer bowed knee to <hi>Baal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">VVhy the godly are thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed.</note> yet they thus distressed, and fed priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Obadias</hi> in caues. <hi>Paule</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. felt this scarcitie. Many of the Saintes killed with <hi>Famine</hi>: in the 11. to the <hi>Hebrewes, VVandring about in Desarts, in dennes, in holes, on hilles,</hi> where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is no great plentie? Wee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that euen the most faithful are sinners, their corruption naturall wil sticke by them to the death, although it brake not out into manifest blaines and grosse sinnes: and yet sometimes it doth, as when they are slacke in punishing offenders, or backwarde in preferring men of good qualitie
<pb facs="tcp:8825:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and desert: so that it is good for them that God punisheth them in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for if in his exact iudgement hee should deale with them, they should be in daunger of <hi>eternall perdition.</hi> But this happily will not satisfie you, for if <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>notorious crimes,</hi> are to be punished with <hi>Dearth</hi> and <hi>Famine,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should they bee most subiect to this plague, which are more wicked then any other. For thogh the godly haue their slips and straines, yet it greeueth them that their standing is so slippery, and their knees so weake, they wish that they might shake off those occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to sinning, but the Infidels and impudent sinners little regard anie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, which think it not inogh to offende God themselues, but are readie to drawe other into the same pitfals, yea and are angrie, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh, if others will not goe on with them in that excesse of riot: and yet these are no more, nay not so much

punished as the other, hauing in such times of <hi>Famine</hi> their arts and shiftes, by which they not onely scape the brunt of this heauie iudgement, but inrich themselues therby. Rather had the godlie starue for hunger, then to vse these sleightes to preserue their life, and yet is their condition no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then theirs. This tentation hath in all ages much distracted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the mindes of the verie best men: &amp; hath forced them to doubt of gods prouidence, as though hee regarded not the actions of men, whether good or ill. <hi>Malachy</hi> in his third &amp; fourth Chapter saith, that many haue burst out into these blasphemies, <hi>It is in vain to serue the Lorde, and it is all one to doo well or ill, for neither is the iust rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor the ill man punished.</hi> But we must know, there is a great difference betweene the wicked and godly in the like punishment: as also that (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit sinne is the principall and chiefe
<pb facs="tcp:8825:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cause of all mischiefe) for other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses God dooth afflict men with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Swoord,</hi> or <hi>Pestilence.</hi> The two Theeues on the Crosse died the like death, yet great was the difference betweene them, the one patiently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his death, and acknowledging Christ to be the <hi>Messias</hi>: the other storming at his punishment, and scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Sauiour to his face. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny causes there are which moue God to punish his children more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as we shall in briefe see for our comfort.</p>
            <p>First God by <hi>Famin</hi> &amp; such like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> stirreth vp his chosen to a more earnest repentance: for presently vpon the infliction of any punishment, the godly search out the cause thereof. When <hi>Dauid</hi> saw the dearth of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ceased not, he inquired of the Lord wherefore hee was so angry with his people. Answer was made him as you heard before. Ofttimes the faithful fal
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8825:53"/>
into many errors and sinnes, neither can they bee recalled into the right way, vnlesse God by punishment do fetch them in. <hi>Amos cap.</hi> 1, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, that although he had puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his people with scarcitie of bread and drinke, yet they returned not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Whereout we gather, that God therefore sendeth <hi>Famine</hi> vppon the earth, that <hi>Men may bee turned to him.</hi> As we plucke backe and stay our horses if either they gallop too fast, or goe any thing out of the way, so doth God reduce vs into a right path with such chastisements. If a boy that is put to learning, either runne away, or play the treuant, presently we send for him to fetch him to schoole, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with a rodde at his backe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God by these trieth our faith in him, and our loue towardes our neighbours, as also our patience in our selues. Wee many times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade our selues that we haue a sound
<pb facs="tcp:8825:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faith, yet if wee bee any long time pincht with anie distresse, then wee feele how necessary it is to crie with the Apostle, <hi>Lord increase our faith.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter walked vpon the lake when Christ bid him, but feeling the winde so fierce, and his ground so slipperie, in dismay of minde hee began to sinke, that by his maisters hand he might be supported. <hi>Math.</hi> 14. God will trie our behauior toward our neighbors, either in the paiment of our debts, or in lending to the needie, or giuing freely, and such like: againe howe patiently we can endure the crosse, whereof, we glorie much before miseries come, but when they light vpon vs in some weight and number, then we grow discontented and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, feeling our owne infirmities how weake and fraile we are. The soldier which neuer saw a pight field, promiseth himself much courage, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he seeth the armies ioyne, hears
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8825:54"/>
the thundring of the Cannons, and spies a tempest of bullettes whirling, beholdes riuers of mens bloud flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and heapes of his fellowes lying some dead, some wounded, then hee trembleth and quaketh, wishing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at home. God knowes our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before he chasten vs, yet lest we should thinke better of our selues then we ought, he will make vs feele his hand, that we may confesse it our selues. Some will not stick to say, I wil rather die then rob: (alas not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gripes of hunger and Famine, which wil, as we say, breake through stone walles,) who afterwarde bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in want, are driuen to fall into suche leaude practises, for life is sweete.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, hee will in a manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent these afflictions, that is, keep vs from falling into more greeuous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities, like a skilfull Phisitian that giueth his patient phisicke to preuent
<pb facs="tcp:8825:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a disease to which he is inclining: so dealeth God with vs, that we might say to our selues as our Sauiour to the woman. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8, <hi>Goe thy wayes, sinne no more, lest a worse thing happen vnto thee.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> haue a prouerbe (which we in Englande vse) <hi>The burnt childe dreads the fire.</hi> So if any haue bene once distressed, hee will beware lest hee fall into the same or some greater danger.</p>
            <p>There is also another cause why god thus exerciseth his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they may pray earnestly, for such is our nature, that if he afflict vs not, we are more slack in praying. For <hi>Plentie makes wantonnesse: and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, dissolute.</hi> Which mischiefes <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> and calamities preuent, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs more instaunte in prayer. They that are full fedde prooue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, who if they be but toucht with want, then flie they vnto him, whome before they forgatte, and not for themselues onelie, but for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8825:55"/>
others also that are in like sort distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And if it please God to deliuer them for that once, they after proue more thankfull to God, more carefull in their duties, and more pitiful to the needie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Again, this and other such miseries humble vs vnder the mightie hand of God. Our flesh swelleth, and like <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyrions</hi> pelles or skinnes (which as they write, will not lie still in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of a presse or chest though kept downe with cloathes, but will swell and rise vp) we are of vnquiet &amp; rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse minds, houen &amp; lifted vp, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither our selues, nor GOD. Wherefore he cuts our combes, and tames our flesh with these wants, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs what we lacke, and how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie his grace is for vs. The whole race of mankind, if all their forces and witts were vnited, is not able to bring forth a stalke from out the earth, or to create a grape, and yet they bear them
<pb facs="tcp:8825:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
selues so loftily, as if they could liue without gods blessing and help: who if he withdraw his hand, they are like those whome wee teach first to go or swim, let goe our hold, the one falles, the other sinkes: all which in our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse we consider not.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, God by these &amp; such other, kindleth in the godly an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire of the other life to come, with the contempt of this <hi>Disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> world. For if we should here liue at harts ease without any crossing, we would loue this life too well, and not regard that at al: yea much adoo haue we (euen for all these sorts and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of plagues, iniuries, malice &amp; vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies of men) to weane our selues from the loue of this worlde: much more hardly would wee bee drawne from it, if none of these should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to vs. Still we hope that our state will be bettered, but all in vaine, for experience shewes, that it is like daily
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8825:56"/>
to bee worse. They therefore who wish for a longer life in hope of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter state here, may as well think that a garment will be the better the longer and oftener it is worne. Our whole life, saith the prouerbe, is but a vale of miserie. Art thou a single man? thou hast no care but for thy self: hast thou a wife? that is a double care: will she not be ruled by thee? that is a miserie: an vntamed wife? Is her alliaunce rich? they will disdaine thy kindred: they will be thy maisters. Are they poore? they will be thy boorders, and lie vppon thy charge: hast thou chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? thy cares are the more, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they wax, the greater is thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But if thou wantest for thy selfe and them things necessarie, now art thou wearie of this life, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to be dissolued and to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where there is no want of food or raiment, but a life <hi>Angelicall,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care or trouble, and the sooner the
<pb facs="tcp:8825:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
better thou thinkest, because there is a more speedy riddance from these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</p>
            <p>Lastly, God by punishing his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> makes them an example of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to all others. The godly see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in these afflictions so pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, so constant, so faithfull, so thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, reape much comfort therby, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for the like helpe from God, in their like distresse: For thus they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son within themselues: God doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them by his holie spirit, to take all things patiently, so wil he also be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with mee, arming mee with the same minde against all suche calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And the wicked thereby may conclude, that if God thus punish his owne children, they must looke for a more greeuous chastisement. If it fare so with the greene and frutefull tree, what shall become of the withered branch? In brief, all sorts may obserue by this his correction of his owne
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8825:57"/>
chosen, thus fearefully the heauie iudgement, and direfull wrath of the iust God against mens sinnes, that si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence hee chasteneth small sinnes in them, much more will hee scourge them that sinne with an hie hand: and that offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with a presumptuous foot. But, to conclude: you hauing heard for the most part the causes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues that prouoke God to sende this plague of <hi>Famine,</hi> with other publike and priuate afflictions vpon men, not sparing his owne elect and faithfull, let vs desire of God patience in such distresses, and repentance from sinne, the causes principall of such distresses. <hi>To him be glorie and praise, &amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S an expert Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an first sheweth the causes and danger of the disease, and after that, prescribeth to his patient both phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick to cure him, and the order of his diet: the same course must a spirituall Phisitian take in any publike plague of <hi>Famine</hi> and <hi>Dearth:</hi> namely, to make men both feele the greeuousnesse of the calamitie, &amp; also to teach them their dutie of demeanor in this publike or priuate affliction. And this course haue wee hitherto obserued in the two former Sermons, setting foorth God to be the authour of plentie and want, with the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of <hi>Famin,</hi> and that our sinnes are the only motiues which prouoke
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8825:58"/>
God thereto: and lastly, the end why God doth punish in this sort, as well his chosen children, as the wicked Atheist. Nowe it remaineth that I prescribe the <hi>Diet,</hi> that is, the maner of our behauiour in such afflictions. And herein that we may more order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed, we will first shewe what duerie belongeth to the Church of Christ in these cases, afterward what concerneth Magistrates, Preachers, Housholders, rich &amp; poore of all sorts to do herein: particularly adding this as the preparatiue to our diet, that wee aduertise the Faithfull not so to dispaire in these punishments, as if God had reserued to them no hope of mercie and assistance, though their sinnes be great and many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salomon</hi> in this his prayer, among other thinges, warneth the godlie, that in the time of <hi>Dearth</hi> and <hi>Penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> they doo confesse theyr sinnes, bewayle them, and amende theyr
<pb facs="tcp:8825:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
liues, not onelie in ceassing to doo ill, but in dooing good. For by these miseries it pleaseth GOD to call vs into the way of godlinesse. After, hee willeth vs to praise the name of God, by acknowledging both his iudgement, and his mercie, that in punishing our sinnes thus, in that he vtterly ouerthroweth vs not. <hi>For it is his mercies that wee are not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.</hi> For if hee should marke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely what is done amisse and punish vs accordingly, both in this life miserably, and in the other we should bee eternally afflicted. It is the nature of man from <hi>Adam,</hi> saith <hi>Iob,</hi> to conceale his owne fault and to laie it vppon another: and so in the time of <hi>Famine,</hi> manie crie out vppon Cornhoorders, Vsurers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossers, Witches and Coniurers, as if they were the onelie procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Scarcitie, (and sometimes perhappes not amisse) but this is the

more Christian and nearest course to haue recourse to our selues, euerie man to say of himselfe herein, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> spake in a like punishment, <hi>It is I that haue sinned,</hi> and haue brought on this iudgement. Furthermore, he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs desire God for Christ his sake to turn away these greeuous stormes, rains or tempests, as also vnseasonable droughts, which are secundary causes of this plague. The temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> was a type &amp; representation of Christ and his Church, so that he requesting the Almightie to heare his people praying in that Temple, it is all one as if he had desired the Father to heare them for, and in the name of his sonne Christ. From whence also it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that, because God only knoweth the hearts of men, <hi>Salomon</hi> is of this minde, that God onely is to be prayed vnto.

Moreouer, <hi>Daniel</hi> whom <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiell</hi> nameth, was then aliue: so that to argue from this place for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Saints departed, is as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh, <hi>from the liuing to the dead.</hi> It is rather an argument of the possibilitie of God his attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who so euer should pray vnto him. And let the Papists answere me, <hi>VVhether were the fathers before Christ in heauen or no? No</hi>: say they, but in <hi>Limbo Patrum:</hi> how could they then pray in heauen? Let vs therfore make this our conclusion: with our heartie praiers to God alone, to ioyne the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of our liues: he is readie, and this will moue him to attention. In which case I must exhort euerie state and degree particularly. First, the godly Magistrate ought to put to
<pb facs="tcp:8825:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his helping hand, by remouing those causes which doe draw vpon the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect these great plagues: for the cause being remoued, the effect ceasseth. <hi>Dauid</hi> faithfully discharged his dutie herein, inquiring into the cause of that <hi>Famine,</hi> as you haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and knowing it, he remoued it, and the <hi>Famine</hi> ceased. In this behalfe many Princes are faultie, who liue as they list, pampering themselues in their owne pleasures, neither regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the neede of the distressed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, nor searching into the cause of the iudgement, nor seeking the meanes how to pacifie Gods wrath: whereas good Magistrates ought to suppresse those vices, which are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally outwarde causes (much lesse to licence them) as <hi>Monopoles, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossing, Hoording, Dycing, VVhoring: Excesse in meate, drinke, and apparell,</hi> especially in young men squandring their goodes, whome it is good
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8825:64"/>
in time to keepe short, least they runne ryot. For it is too late, (as wee in prouerbes speake) <hi>VVhen steede is stolne to make the stable holde. VVhen flocke is fledde, to seeke to pinne the folde.</hi> Our auncestours were woont to haue lawes, which they called <hi>Leges sumptuariae,</hi> to restraine excessiue expenses: which were not amisse in our time to bee executed, as verie necessarie for the preuention of beggerie: as also to bridle the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionable and lewde practises of those <hi>VVealth-deuouring vermine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named, which inhaunce the price of thinges at their pleasures, and grinde the faces of the poore, of which you haue an excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the fifth Chapter of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi> The <hi>Famine</hi> waxing very great among the people, the poorer sort complayned grieuouslie, that the mightie and wealthie men lent vpon sore Vsurie, and tooke to pledge their

Hee summoned an assemblie, where both Creditor and Debtor, both Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Borrower, should appeare, and arguing in the presence of them all, by reasons <hi>Politique</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,</hi> that the rich were extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie too blame therein, first, sayeth hee, we (meaning <hi>Ezra, Zerubbabel,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:8825:65"/>
and himselfe) haue brought the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from bondage, and therefore it is not for you to lay new yokes and burthens vpon your brethren. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly what would the <hi>Heathen</hi> say, and howe would they reioyce to see this exaction? so that if you feared God, or regarded man, you woulde not doe it. Lastly, he mooueth them by his owne example, to restore to them their pledges and morgages of landes and houses, and their pawnes of what kinde soeuer: and thus in the ende hee brought his purpose to passe. Which example I wish the Princes, and Magistrates of our time, woulde in these hard yeares immitate and follow. The <hi>Romanes</hi> and other Countreyes had theyr <hi>Garner-wardeins,</hi> who to preuent an imminent <hi>Dearth,</hi> or <hi>Famine,</hi> sent abroade their Purueyours for corne, to buie it into the land: such had <hi>Salomon.</hi> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 4.

bee verie profitable to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, if in plentifull yeares the Magistrates woulde lay vp Corne in their Garners publique, eyther to lende, or vpon a reasonable price to sell to the Husband-men Seede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne, and to the poore Breadcorne. That was <hi>Iosephs</hi> policie in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> lande, which if hee had not done, the <hi>Famine</hi> had prooued farre more daungerous. <hi>Eusebius Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast.

Our chronicles of <hi>Heluetia</hi> haue a memorable example of liberalitie to the poore.

the Poet faignes <hi>Euclio</hi> that famous Cormullion) for in the yeares. 1343. and 1344. there fell a great <hi>Famin</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole vpper Countrey of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> in both which yeares he so wel vsed his gathered goods, that thrise in a weeke he fed and nourished some tymes three, and some times foure thousande, with bread and broath, and oft times 4500. which came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in flockes from the neighbour and bordering Countreys. He ending his life presently vpon the ceassing of this <hi>Dearth,</hi> all the poore of the Countrey, in remembraunce of their good Benefactour, followed his corps from the House where hee dyed (beeing a Castle belonging to the See) into the Mother Citie <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> where hee was interred.

Pro.</hi> 6. by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Ants, teacheth vs how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and prouidently we should laie vp against the time to come. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Zurick</hi> is heerein much to bee commended,<note place="margin">Zurick.</note> in that not onely they giue things necessarie both for backe and belly to manie poore daily, vpon the Citie charge: but in time of <hi>Dearth</hi> they sel vpon a reasonable rate al kind of grain, as well to the reliefe of their citizens distresses, as also the foreiners comming to their markets may store themselues at a lesse price. And the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Strasborough,</hi> famous in it selfe, but more renowmed, for that in the yeares of <hi>Dearth,</hi> the yeares 1517. and 1529. and other such times, they gaue out of their publike granaries, both to Citizens and straungers, corne at an

easie reckoning, besides the reliefe which their poore citizens and others receiued from them in mony and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals. Besides this, it is the Magistrates dutie to see that Almes be disposed to the right vse.

The Ministers of the word are also to teach the people out of the holie scripture, that plentie is <hi>Gods blessing,</hi> and withall, that sinne is the cause of scarcitie: they must stirre them vp to repentaunce, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte the distressed and poore, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the rich to enlarge their hands, and to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hands more liberally

and fully in this hard time, yea [and themselues not to soiourne (like our Gentlemen) out of their Countrey, but lie vppon their benefices for the greater reliefe of the poore, and for the better example to all.] And also to ioyne their praiers in earnest maner to Almightie God, that he would looke downe with his fauourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and deale mercifully with his people: so did <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Amos, cap.</hi> 7. and both were heard. <hi>Iames ca.</hi> 5. saith, <hi>That the prayer of a iust man preuayleth much.</hi> For example whereof, he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in the storie of <hi>Eliah, Opening and shutting the heauens with his prayers.</hi> So that in anie case the Ministers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie they which haue the Poore mens stock committed to them, must not at such times faile.

Rich men aboue all, in the time of <hi>Famin,</hi> must haue especiall regard to the poore, for which cause, God hath endowed them with that great wealth. If thou haue Farmers whose corn and increase yeeldeth not proportionably to their labours nor their charge, vrge them not too ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to the paiment of their debts and rents.

Not many yeares since, Idols of gold and siluer were set vp, and shrines ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for sacrifices and gifts to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there, as if heereby God had bene well pleased: but this we know out of Gods booke, that if these liuely Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God, that is, the poore and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die be cloathed, fed and relieued, it is a sacrifice more acceptable to him. But you will say, your charge is great, &amp; so you cannot spare it them so well.

selleth it out, blessing shalbe vpon his head.</hi> Some againe are contriuing, how in the times of want, they, hauing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent money, may buy at an easie peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, the lands, houses, &amp; wood, of Banckrupts, and such as are in neede: whereas in Charitie they should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them then most of all, lest they should be driuen to sell all. Surely ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thus gotten will not be blessed, nor long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue. The wealth which is most iustly gathered, ofttimes slips away, no man knowes how: much greater vncertaintie is there in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of deceit and oppression. The Auditour will one day come for an account thereof. Heare what God himselfe speaketh concerning this, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.35, <hi>If thy brother be impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, and fallen in decaie with thee, thou shall relieue him, as a straunger and a soiourner. Thou shalt take no v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie of him, nor vauntage, but thou shalt feare thy God, that thy brother may
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8825:72"/>
liue with thee. Thou shalt not giue him thy money to vsurie, nor lende him thy victualls for increase, &amp;c Amos</hi> the Prophet, chapter 8. crieth out against those which abuse the want and scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of things, to the vndoing of the poore, verse 4, <hi>Heare this, O yee that swallow vp the poore, that ye may make the needie of the land to faile, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when will the new Moone be gone that wee may sell corne? and the Sabaoth, that we may set foorth wheate, and make the Epha small, and the shekle great, and falsifie the weights by deceit. That wee may buy the poore for siluer, and the needie for shooes: yea and sell the refuse of the wheate. The Lorde hath sworne by the excellencie of</hi> Iacob, <hi>Surely I will neuer forget their woorkes. Shall not the lande tremble for this? and euerie one mourne that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise vp as a flood, and be drowned as by the flood of Egipt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, as <hi>Munster</hi> expoundeth
<pb facs="tcp:8825:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, as <hi>Nilus</hi> by his inundation casteth vp all things which swimme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, vppon the ground: so shall these deuouring beastes bee cast off from the earth that beares them. It were easie for mee to rehearse many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of mercilesse rich men, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by GOD greeuously. But letting all passe, let vs heare rather the last sentence of Christ himselfe in that his great day, after his sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made of the sheepe from the Goates: <hi>Come yee blessed of my Father, inherite you the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world, for I was an hungred and yee gaue me meate, I thirsted and yee gaue mee drinke, I was a straunger, and yee lodged mee: Naked, and yee cloathed mee: Sicke, and yee visited mee: in prison, and ye came vnto mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What thinke you wil then become of Vsurers, Monopolists, Ingrossers, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8825:73"/>
all that vile generation, which haue not done the leaste woorke of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? who haue beene so farre from feeding the hungrie, that they haue rather deuoured them, by high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, like hungrie dogges: and so farre from entertaining straungers and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hospitalitie, that they haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forced their neighbour and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens, to leaue their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for extreame beggery, wrought by their crueltie. The naked they haue not clad, but their poore deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being not able to paie, haue they stript of house and home, and taken their pillows from vnder their heads. The sicke they haue not visited nor comforted, but by ingrossing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities into their hands, and selling them as they list, they haue made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being not able to reach their price, to pine &amp; starue for hunger. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners haue they not relieued, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, rather cast in more vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:8825:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for no great weight: nor vppon any great want. To you I speake, you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull and cruell rich men of the world: ponder with your selues tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, and laie to your harts this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of our Sauiour, which you shal finde true to your owne destruction: and remember that which <hi>Salomon</hi> hath said, <hi>It is better to haue a little with the feare of the Lorde, then to haue great treasures otherwaies. Achan</hi> his example <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7, is memorable, for the euent of ill gotten goods: when the Cittie of <hi>Iericho</hi> was taken, hee priuily tooke a Babilonish garment, 2000. shekles of siluer, and a wedge of gold, thinking that no bodie should haue knowne thereof, that so himselfe and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might thereby be inriched: but, as it is wel knowne, it cost him the life of himselfe and all that belonged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. In which, there, by the way, ariseth a doubt, why God should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the children being guiltlesse, for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8825:74"/>
the fathers faulte? this may serue for a short solution. Ill gotten goods are a bane to the posteritie, as well as to the parentes. Many things there are which prouoke a man to gather wealth by ill meanes, for some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing of anie good way to come by them, vse all the badde shifts in the world to compasse them. Others againe not content with things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, must forsooth haue wealth to spende riotously, and to maintaine their wiues and children excessiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, howe euer they compasse it, whether by hooke or crooke, they regard not. It is good, doubtlesse, to be carefull for them, so the care be moderate, neither distrustfull in God, nor offensiue to him. No doubt <hi>Achan</hi> had a respect that way, but the euent prooued it to be vnlawfull; and suche will bee the lot of those, which by vngodly meanes, as <hi>Thefts, Robberies, Pillage, raising of rents, ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8825:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wares,</hi> and such like waies indeuor to fil their coffers: the only meanes to make their children watch for their death, as the Egles for a carkasse, who hauing once got that which their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents haue thus raked togither, out it goes merily til the bottom be bare, for it melts like snowe before the Sunne. <hi>Crates</hi> the <hi>Tbeba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> wondred at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous care of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, regarding to leaue their children rich, but neither wise nor honest: for what should he do with wealth that knows not how to vse it? or what should a mad man do with a sword? Many by-words haue beene taken vp against ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goods, and the euent hath made them as true as common. Among the rest, <hi>Ill gotten, Ill spent.</hi> And, <hi>The goods gotten by anothers annoy, The third heire shall not enioy. Mich. Cap.</hi> 6 compares the wealth that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed by guile and villanie, vnto a fire that shall consume the owners
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8825:75"/>
thereof. Many sentences in <hi>Salomons</hi> prouerbes, tending to this point: <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being a poore man with honestie, then a rich man by extremitie.</hi> The best care for childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is, to bring them vp in the feare and nurture of the Lord, and by good example to direct them: the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to vndo them, is to leaue them the inheritaunce of such bad purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And so much for Rich men. The poore also which are pinched and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed for want of victualls, with their wiues and children, must know there is a dutie for them to God and man. First therefore let them thinke, that this crosse is laide vpon them by God, and so with patience beare it. An easie matter to say so, you will aunswere, but not to doo it. I doo confesse, that our fleshe can hardly be brought to endure hunger, nor patiently brooke in that time to bee tolde of our dutie. <hi>The belly,</hi> as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> said, <hi>hath no eares.</hi> Rather giue the
<pb facs="tcp:8825:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hungrie meate, then preach to them of patience: they wish more to see what to eate, then to heare what to doo. Yet if they will but consider that this is sent vnto them by Gods will, not comming by chaunce or ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they will bee more patient. Secondlie, they must knowe, that God will heare their prayers if they call vnto him faithfully. <hi>The Lions roaring after their pray, doe seeke their meat at God, and he giues it them: He fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the young Rauens that call vppon him:</hi> much more men. Hee is our Father, as both in the <hi>Lordes Prayer,</hi> and in the <hi>Creede Apostolicall,</hi> wee daylie confesse, therefore perswade wee our selues that hee chasteneth vs for our amendement, not for our ouerthrowe: but of this before. Againe, let them remember, that they are not the first, nor shall bee the last this way to bee afflicted. Christ himselfe indured it for our
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8825:76"/>
sakes. <hi>Paule</hi> and other the Saints of God haue felt this want: and in brief, GOD hath promised, that neither this, nor anie other way hee will tempt vs aboue our strength. There is no father so hard hearted, that will lay any burthen vppon his childe, more heauie then hee can beare, or will suffer him to starue when hee may succour him: much lesse God, who hath more then a fatherly care ouer vs, will suffer vs to perish, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all thinges at his commaund, and many wayes to ridde vs from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie miserie, euen in the middest of all calamities to assist vs. So that let the poore sort in such distresse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane themselues well and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, both to GOD and men: to God, by carefully auoyding those thinges whereby his wrath is prouoked, and by dayly requesting his fauourable aid and comfort: towarde men, those especially which haue relieued them,
<pb facs="tcp:8825:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
let them bee thankefull, and if they bee not able to pay their debts, let them intreate their Creditors to bee good vnto them till God make them able: for there are verily many good men, which by lending, giuing, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship, almes-deeds, forbearing and forgiuing debts, haue got themselues a good report, and haue comforted the poore afflicted: mary if once thou promise at a day to returne it, keepe thy day: for herein many debters are to blame, pretending charge of wife and children, and indeede spending that at drinking and gaming, which would both pay their debts, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their family. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also vse good and honest meanes to rid themselues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Famine,</hi> laboring with their hands for their liuing, and rather beg their bread fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> door to door, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by wicked shifts to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their pouerty. For this is one of Satan his occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which he takes to prick men forward to all kind
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8825:77"/>
lewdnesse. <hi>Vprores, Mutinies, Thefts, Bawderie,</hi> and other such filthie gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning occupations: all which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier sort will carefully eschew. An ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest matrone, if her modesty be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by shameles &amp; impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teachers, she casts them off, and defies them: so should we doe with these sleights of the diuell, following the example of Christ, who hauing fasted 40. dayes in the desart, and then being hungry, the diuell tempted him, but he gaue him the auaunt, with the sworde of the spirit: and of <hi>Paul</hi> whom neither <hi>Famine</hi> nor death could separate from the loue God in Christ. We should be more faithfull then the <hi>Saguntines:</hi> they had rather die for hunger, then not to keepe their promise with their Confederates the <hi>Romanes.</hi> The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks,</hi> as you heard, being vexed this way, chose rather to chaunge their country, then their Religion. A good document for these times, wherin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:8825:77"/>
is charged, as a cause of dearth. But if one sort of poore bee cruell to another, that is a mischiefe. Againe, let the poore be prouident in a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull haruest, to lay vp against a deare yeare, not to bee so wastfully giuen to spending, as before, but eeke it out to the vtmost. It is true which is common, <hi>Sparing is the best husbandrie, but if it be at the bottome, that thrift is too late.</hi> Manie deceiue themselues by thus reasoning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and Spittles built for the poore: thus to be relieued is a miserable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which to want, would be more credite and hearts ease: and hee that spendes himselfe out of house and home, in hope of an <hi>Hospitall,</hi> is more fitte for a Prison then for a <hi>Spittle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this which hath beene spoken, we vnderstand what euery man in his seuerall place and dutie, and all sortes iointly, ought to do in any publike or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8825:78"/>
priuate <hi>Famine,</hi> or <hi>Dearth.</hi> If there bee anie godly men which hope of no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of mens liues, yet let not them bee wearie of well doing, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of the wicked. For if <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and other iust men had corrupted themselues with the worlde, they had also perished with the world. Now in the last place by the way of comfort, let vs heare the most pleasaunt promises of God, wherin he offereth aid and assistance to his children in these afflictions: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouching, if wee heare his worde, and walke in his wayes, that he will nourish vs in the time of <hi>Famine</hi>: and as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. to the despisers of his law and will, hee threatneth hunger: so on the contrarie, to the obedient and faithfull, hee promiseth to open the treasures of his goodnesse, to giue raine and faire weather in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to blesse the labour of their handes. And <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. that the earth
<pb facs="tcp:8825:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shall bring forth increase, and they shall bee satisfied with bread: and in this Chapter, God at the request of <hi>Salomon.</hi> promiseth to heare the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the people thus afflicted, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto him in that holie Temple. <hi>Eliphas</hi> in the booke of <hi>Iob.</hi> sayeth, That the Lord preserueth from death in <hi>Famine,</hi> and from the Sword in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. <hi>Prou.</hi> 10.3. <hi>The Lord will not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish the soule of the righteous.</hi> A sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of sweete comforte agaynst this grieuous temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then which scarce can bee a greater. For wee are euer in feare least wee pine for hunger, and the nearer wee are to death, the more wee doo feare this want, and therefore a sentence to bee fullie weighed, and regarded.</p>
            <p>Nowe him dooth <hi>Salomon</hi> call a <hi>Righteous man,</hi> which putteth his trust in the Lord, and followeth his vocation carefullie, and honestly, still preferring the kingdome of God,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8825:79"/>
and his righteousnesse. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. The kingly prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith. <hi>In the peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous time, they shal not be confounded, and in the daies of dearth they shall haue inogh.</hi> And presently after. <hi>I haue beene yong, and now am olde, yet neuer saw I the iust man forsaken, nor his seede begging bread. Although the iust bee mercifull and len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, yet his posteritie shall not want.</hi> Againe: <hi>Psalme.</hi> 33. <hi>Beholde the eye of the Lorde is vppon them that feare him, to deliuer theyr soules from death, and to feede them in the time of dearth.</hi> Againe, <hi>Psalme</hi> 34. <hi>The Lions lacke and suffer hunger, but they that feare the Lorde shall want no manner of thing that is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Manie are the testimonies of the Prophetes, wherein God sheweth that if his people turne vnto him with heartie repentaunce, hee will giue them plentie: As <hi>O see the second, Ioel the first and second, Amos the second. Zacharie the eight, Malachie the third.</hi> In
<pb facs="tcp:8825:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which places God sheweth that hee will relieue vs if we do repent. <hi>Zach.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Aske yee of the Lorde raine, and it shall bee giuen you. Matth.</hi> 6. Christ though he forbid all anxietie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull care for the things of this worlde, yet hee promiseth all vnto them that first seeke his kingdome. Neither are they bare promises, but armed for our comfort with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold examples, shewing how God hath fed manie, and freed more in the time of such distresse. Hee preserued <hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> without either meate or drinke fortie dayes togither. He fed <hi>Eliah</hi> at the brooke <hi>Cherith,</hi> in the Wildernesse, and sent him foode by Rauens, relieuing an hungrie man by the helpe of deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring foules. So dealt hee with the Widowe of <hi>Sarept<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> for giuing the Prophet that one loafe of bread which she had left, albeit she looked for no other but death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8825:80"/>
gone, neither the meal in her barrell, nor the oile in her cruse fayling, till the <hi>Famine</hi> ceased. Which example for the excellencie thereof our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour repeateth, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. And againe, the same Prophet beeing persecuted by <hi>Iezabel,</hi> was fedde by an Angell in the desart, in the strength of which meate, he trauailed fortie dayes and 40. nights, to the Mount <hi>Horeb.</hi> God when hee brought his people out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (that you may see more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall examples of his prouidence) fedde and preserued them in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse straungely fortie yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, insomuch that their Garments were not all that while worne; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them <hi>Manna</hi> from Heauen, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting them their daylie stint and portion. When they wanted fresh water, hee willed <hi>Moses</hi> to strike the Rocke, so that the verie Cattle drunke their fill, and beeing wearie of <hi>Manna,</hi> and longing for flesh, he
<pb facs="tcp:8825:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gaue it them in aboundaunce, and verie plentifullie. For the Scripture sayth, <hi>There went a winde foorth from the Lord, and brought Quailes from the Sea, and let them fall vpon the Campe, a dayes iourney on this side, and a dayes iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on the other side, round about the host, and they lay the thickenesse of two cubites vppon the earth, and the people gathered them night and day, and he that gathered least, gathered ten Homers full.</hi> In the time of <hi>Elizeus</hi> he rid the Samaritans from an extreame <hi>Famine,</hi> agaynst all hope: where you haue an excellent example of a great <hi>Duke,</hi> that would not beleeue the Prophet, foretelling of this straunge plentie, who for his distrust, sawe it, as the Prophet had said, but inioyed it not. 2. Reg. 7. Howe miraculouslie did Christ feed thousandes with little fiue loaues, and two fishes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. seuen loaues and a fewe fishes. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. and yet baskets of fragments remaining: a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8825:81"/>
miracle often repeated for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our faith. But you will say, Christ now adayes worketh no such wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders. He doth, but we careles of them, do not obserue them. Cast an account of your dayly expence for things necessary, &amp; lay it to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings in, and see if God do not blesse you much with a little. I am sure that many haue wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred how they should be able to defray so many charges laid vpon them, as nowe adaies they are put to, hauing so small takings, but by the blessing of God. It is recorded in the Chronicles of <hi>Austria,</hi> that <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke</hi> the Emperour hauing surnmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at <hi>Collen,</hi> to which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted an huge multitude of all sorts, he fearing that all the bread in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie would not suffice them, and so the Parliament to be broke of, willed that account should bee taken of all the prouision of bread, and compare the loaues with the men, and they found
<pb facs="tcp:8825:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the number of loaues to be by many fewer then the persons: &amp; yet the next day euerie man hauing eate his belly full, there was much bread stil remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. In the <hi>Annales</hi> of <hi>Stumpsius,</hi> there is a memorable example of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent assistance in extreame <hi>Famine.</hi> In the yeare 849. in <hi>Germany,</hi> among the Citizens of <hi>Turing,</hi> one was purposed to flie with his wife and children, and to trauaile abroad for succour of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and them: as hee passed through a wood being euen mad for hunger, he prouides himselfe to kill and eate his sonne, and being now at his childs throate with his knife, on the sodain, as God would haue it, he spies two wolues praying vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Stag, presently he leapes to them, driues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, &amp; refresheth himselfe and his, with the new killed venison. <hi>Sigebertus</hi> records it too, only differing in one yeare. In <hi>Anno.</hi> 1570. In <hi>Bauaria</hi> it rained corne, of which much bread was baked: A
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8825:82"/>
singular testimonie of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent presence. The like was done in <hi>Naples, Anno.</hi> 722. And in <hi>Vasconia, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</hi> 828. But albeit these promises be true and iust, yet are they not so to be vnderstood, as though we should vtterly bee without the crosse: since that euen the Prophets and Apostles haue felt the smart of hunger. For in these as in other things, God dealeth as he pleaseth. He maketh vs hunger, that we may be the more feruent in prayer: and againe, though he keepe vs short of these earthly things, yet he giueth vs greater gifts, <hi>Faith, Hope, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:</hi> this being one of our comforts, which shall be the conclusion of this discourse, which was our Sauiour his Prophecie, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. <hi>Luc.</hi> 21, that <hi>Famine</hi> is one of the forerunners to the last day of iudgement, whereby wee haue good cause to lift vp our heads and reioyce, because that day draweth neare. Wherein beeing
<pb facs="tcp:8825:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deliuered from this and all other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series and calamities whatsoeuer, we shall there be euerlastingly crowned in his eternall kingdome. To which he bring vs, who hath bought it dearly for vs.</p>
