         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>PSALM. 135.6.</bibl>
                  <p>Whatsoever the Lord pleased that did he in Heaven and in Earth, in the sea and all deepe places.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE externall outward workes of God which follow in the next place after his internall workes, are indeed nothing but his actuall execution of his eternall counsell, purpose and decree. For the unfolding of which workes in generall, and laying open of the nature, use and severall kindes of them, I have made choise of this Text. From the wordes and circumstances whereof, we may easily gather all points of instruction neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be knowne concerning the generall nature, use and kindes of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106441:4"/>First, here the words of the Psalmist shew that he speakes of Gods outward workes, because he limits them to places and times, to Heaven, Earth, Sea and all deep places.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he speakes of them all in generall none excepted, so the Hebrew word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which signifies all in generall what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, doth plainly shew, and also the perfect enumeration of all places which are in the world, and wherin any outward sensible and visible work can be done, to wit: the Heaven, the Earth, the Seas and all deepe places.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he sheweth that God is the author of these works, as he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that one eternall God in whom there are three persons, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, for he saith <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> the Lord doth or hath done.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he sheweth that the Lord doth <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll these workes of himselfe according to his owne will and pleasure, and none of them all by com<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulsion, unwittingly and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but even as hee pleased, and after the counsell of his will and pleasure <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> whatsoever the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, he intimates that all these workes of God come necessarily, infallibly, inevitably and irresistably to passe, and that none of them all can faile which God hath beene pleased to doe, but so come to passe as he pleaseth in every respect, even in the same time and place. This hee intimates in that he saith every thing whatsoever the Lord pleased, he hath done.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, he sheweth that these outward workes tend to make God knowne, and are of use to bring us to the knowledge of the true God, and in and by them God is knowne aright and his greatnesse also. This is manifest by the dependance of this <hi>ver.</hi> on the former. For having said, <hi>I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods,</hi> he brings in this text as an argument and proofe saying, <hi>whatsoever the Lord pleased</hi> that he h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th done, which is in eff<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t all one as if he had said, I know this by his doing of all his outward works, for whatsoever the Lord pleased <hi>that he hath done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly and lastly, he shewes the severall kinds of Gods out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workes that they are not only creation but also actuall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106441:4"/>
providence which concludes in it the government of the world, the fall of man, and the restauration of man-kind by the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</p>
            <p>Workes of creation he expresseth, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. and workes of his actuall providence, as ordering, governing and saving of his people by Christ, which was signified in the deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> he reckons up in the rest of the Psalme both before and after my text, So then it is manifest that this text considered with the circumstances thereof, serves abundantly for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the nature, use and kind of Gods outward works.</p>
            <p>In the unfolding whereof, First let us note the order, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence and scope of it. Secondly, let us take a view of the wordes and sift out the true sence of them. Thirdly let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve out of them by way of doctrine, a perfect description of Gods outward workes in generall, and lastly apply for some use the doctrine to our s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lves.</p>
            <p>The order and coherence is this, First the Prophet in the 3. first <hi>verses,</hi> exhorts all to praise the Lord and to laud his name, more specially the Lords servants who are continuall professors in his Church. Secondly in the 3, 4, 5. <hi>verses</hi> he gives some reasons drawne from the Attributes of God and the consideration of his nature, to wit, because the Lord is good and his name pleasant, and because of his owne free grace he hath chosen <hi>Israel,</hi> that is, his elect and faithfull Church to be his owne peculiar people, and because the Lord is great and is a <hi>God above all gods.</hi> In testifying and affirming the Lords goodnesse and being above all gods, he brings for proofe his owne knowledge and experience. I know (saith he) <hi>that the Lord is great, vers.</hi> 5. Thirdly he doth proove God to be such a one, even so good, gracious and great by his outward workes, and sheweth that by them he knowes God to be so, for he saith here in this text, <hi>whatsoever the Lord pleased that he hath done, in Heaven and in earth, in the Sea and all deepe places.</hi> So that it is plaine by the order, dependance and scope of the text, That here <hi>David</hi> extolls Gods outward workes in generall, as things proceeding from his owne good pleasure, and serving to proove him to be good and gracious, and to make us know him so great and glorious a God as he is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106441:5"/>In the second place, for the wordes themselves, they are plaine and easie to be understood at the first hearing without any laborious interpretation. They run thus in the Hebrew, <hi>All which the Lord pleaseth he hath done, in Heaven, Earth, Sea and all deepe places.</hi> This word (all) <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hewes that he speakes not of some particular workes, but of all in that kind. The word <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the proper name of God considered in the unity of his essence with all his ess<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntiall Attributes, and every one of the 3. Persons is called by this name, as they are of the same essence and all one God. The enumeration of all the notable places in the world wherein these workes are done discovers the workes which he here speakes off, to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workes which doe not abide in Gods essence and there onely subsist as his eternall counsell, decrees and inward operations do, but are done in time and place and have their subsistance in and among the creatures, such as are creating, ruling, ordering, upholding of all things, and also redeeming and restoring of all man-kinde. The word [<hi>pleaseth</hi>] limits the generall note or particle (<hi>all</hi>) unto all workes which in themselves are good, or else serve for good use, and so are pleasing to the Lord for the use sake. Hee doth not say that the Lord doth all things which are done, but all things which he pleaseth, that is, he doth not make men sinnefull and wicked, neither doth he worke rebellion in men, which is displeasing unto him, but he doth whatsoever is pleasing, that is, all things which are agreeable to his nature. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is according to his will and good pleasure, that he doth, none can hinder it. This is the true sense and meaning of the wordes. Now from the text thus opened and the circumstances observed, wee may gather a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of them in generall shewing the nature and use of them.</p>

of his will, work, and bring to passe, not within, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himselfe in all the world and upon all creatures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that certainely and irresistably in due time and place to the communicating and making of himself known to men and Angels in his infinite and eternall nature and in his goodnesse, grace, glory, power and all other essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall properties, for the salvation and eternall blessednes of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in Christ.</p>
               <p>This description truely gathered from this Text, and the scope and order of it and discovering plainely the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and use of Gods outwa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d workes in generall, I will proove in every part and branch orderly and will conclude with some application.</p>
               <p>The first thing in it is the generall matter of Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall workes, <hi>they are things done</hi>; that is, not onely act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions working and operations, such as Creation, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the like; but also things or works made, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cted and done by those actions, as Heaven, Earth, Angels and other things created. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or all these are things done and wrought by God. This Branch is plainly expressed in this word of my Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>(hath done</hi>) or doth or hath made, for the Hebrew word signifies all these. And that Gods outward works consist in doing and are things not spoken or promised but done and wrought, Divers testimonies of Scripture doe shew, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.1. <hi>David</hi> cals them workes which he <hi>hath done</hi>: And <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.21. The Prophet saith, that the <hi>Lord doth his worke, his s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>range worke.</hi> And not to stand in repeating many Scriptures in a point so plaine; This in one word is sufficient that the two Hebrew words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which are used in the Scriptures to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Gods outward works are both derived of verbs which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie doing.</p>
               <p>The second branch in this description comprehends in it the Authour of these works, to wit, the Lord <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that one infinite, eternall God and three Persons, Father, Sonne and Holy Ghost: This Branch doth distinguish these workes. First, from the workes of creatur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s which are proper to them. Secondly, from the personall operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106441:6"/>
of God as the eternall begetting of the Sonne which is proper to the Father and is his worke onely. That God considered in the unity of his essence as he comprehends all the three Persons, is the Authour of these workes, and that they are common to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and every one of them hath an hand in every work of this kind; though one more immediately than another: The word <hi>Jehovah</hi> here used in the Text doth plainly shew, where it is said, <hi>Whatsoever Jehovah pleased</hi> or was willing to do, <hi>that he hath done</hi>: which word is so proper to God, and signifies <hi>One God,</hi> that it also agrees to every person in that one God. And this is also confirmed by divers other testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Gods word, which shew that in divers of these outward actions or workes, the Father workes by the Sonne and the Sonne by the Father with and by the Spirit. The first great work of this kind, even the work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which sometimes is attributed to the Father as more peculiar to him, because <hi>terminatur in Patre,</hi> as the Schoole-men speak, that is, it is bounded and termined in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he is <hi>principium &amp; summus terminus creationis,</hi> the first beginning and utmost bound of creation, from whom it first proceeded, even this is attributed to the Sonne and Spirit also, as being common to all the Persons, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.6. <hi>By the word of the Lord</hi> (that is the Sonne) <hi>were the Heavens made and all the host of them by the Spirit of his mouth.</hi> To which adde, <hi>Job</hi> 33.4. <hi>The Spirit of God made me,</hi> &amp; <hi>John</hi> 1.2, 10. &amp; <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.16. where it is said, that by the eternall word the Sonne all things were made both in <hi>Heaven and Earth, visible and invisible, and without him was made nothing of all that was made.</hi> So likewise in that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worke of Judgement executed on <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Gen.</hi> 19.24. <hi>Jehovah</hi> is said to <hi>raine downe from Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah out of Heaven fire and brimstone,</hi> that is <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son from <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Father, who are both one and the same God <hi>Jehovah</hi>; yea that these externall workes of God are not divided some to one Person and some to another in the Trinity, but are common to all the Persons and proceed from that one common essence, according to that saying of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106441:6"/>
the School-men, <hi>opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa.</hi> Our Saviour sheweth most plainly, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.19, 22. where he saith, that as the Sonne cannot worke of himselfe alone without the Father, but he must have and see the Father working with him, so the Father doth not judge any, that is by his owne proper act of judgement, but hath committed all judgement to the Sonne, that he may have a hand in all judgements toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with himselfe, and <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13, 14. speaking of that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall illumination of mens hearts and inward teaching which seemes most proper to the Spirit, he saith it is not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe alone, but it is what he hath heard and received from the Father and the Sonne. And therefore the second Branch is manifest that the doer of the outward workes of God is <hi>Jehovah</hi> our God, and all the three Persons in God.</p>
               <p>The third Branch comprehends in it the outward moving cause of all these outward workes: namely, Gods owne will and pleasure, for he is said to do them according to his eternall purpose, and after the counsell of his owne will. This is expressed in the description and in the words of the Text <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Whatsoever the Lord pleased,</hi> that is, whatsoever is according to the Lords will and pleasure that he hath done, and this is testified in other Scriptures, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.3. where it is said, that <hi>the Lord doth whatsoever pleaseth him,</hi> and <hi>Isa.</hi> 46.10. where the Lord saith I will do all my pleasure, and <hi>Ionah</hi> 1.14. All which places shew that first the Lord hath a mind and pleasure to doe such things, and therupon he doth them. Also, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.11. It is said he doth worke all things after the counsell of his will. And <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. &amp; 4.28. the worke of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ, and all that he did and suffered is said to be done by the <hi>determinate counsell of God.</hi> Therfore this Branch is manifest, namely, That Gods will and pleasure is the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mooving cause of all his outward works, and that they are nothing but the execution of his eternall will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
               <p>The fourth Branch by which these outward works are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially distinguished from his inward operation, comprehends
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106441:7"/>
in it the subject wherein these workes do subsist and the circumstance of time and place wherein they are done. For these workes are not done within God himselfe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they subsist in his Essence, as his inward operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do, but they are, <hi>Extra Dei essentiam,</hi> without Gods es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, they are done in all the world, and upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, some in Heaven and some in Earth, others in the Sea and all deepe places (as my Text saith) and they have their circumstances of time and place, as God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all eternity. The Creation was in the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of time in the first six dayes of the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. The Redemption wrought by Christ in the midst of yeares betweene the Law and the Gospell, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.2. and upon the mountaine where <hi>Hierusalem</hi> stood, <hi>Isa.</hi> 25.6, 7. The great execution shall be at the end of the world in the last day of Judgement, and the works of Gods governement and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall providence as they are divers, so they are done at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, and in divers places of the world, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth, on the very day which the Lord appointed did the flood come upon the old world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11. In the same day which God had fore-told was <hi>Israel</hi> delivered out of <hi>Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 21.41. And howsoever the words of the Apostle, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.18. intimate that in God (and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him) <hi>We live, moove and have our being,</hi> yet we are not thus to understand that these things are, and that we subsist in Gods Essence, and that we are so in God as his inward operations and eternall decrees are: But that we all are compassed about with Gods presence and essentiall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which are every where, and by him as by the chiefe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause and authour of life, motion and being are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained and upheld in life, being and motion continually. For to be in God, that is, to subsist in his essence, doth necessarily imply coeternity and consubstantiality with God. <hi>Quicquid est in Deo Deus est,</hi> nothing can be within his Essence, but it must be coeternall with God and of the same Substance with him. Hee who denies this must needes deny God to be immutable and most simple, free from all composition. Therfore this Branch also is most
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106441:7"/>
manifest and doth containe in it nothing but solid Truth.</p>
               <p>The fifth Branch containes in it the manner of Gods outward works, to wit; that in respect of God himselfe, they are done with such power as cannot be resisted, and in respect of the event, they are certaine, infallible and cannot faile. This is truely collected from the Text: For it is said that all <hi>Whatsoever the Lord pleaseth hee doth,</hi> or hath done, which shewes that not one jot of his will and pleasure failes but comes to passe. If his will or pleasure could be resisted or any thing prevented which he willeth to worke, surely the Divell who is so cunning, watchfull and malitious would in some things have defeated God, or this either by himselfe or some of his instruments: But this Text affirmes the contrary, that whatsoever the Lord pleased he hath done in all the world. Therfore in r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od they are all unresistable, and in respect of the event infallible. And this <hi>David</hi> testifieth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5.3. saying, <hi>The Lord doth whatsoever pleaseth him.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 46.10. <hi>my counsell shall stand,</hi> and I will performe all my pleasure, yea because these are voluntary workes of God and are willed and decreed in his secret counsell from all eternity (as I have noted before) therefore they must needs be unresistable, for <hi>Who can resist his will, Rom.</hi> 9.19.</p>
               <p>The sixth Branch containes the principall use and effects of Gods outward workes: namely, the making of himselfe knowne in his nature and essentiall attributes and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating himselfe to his elect. That Gods externall workes doe all serve for this use and doe worke this effect we may gather from the dependance and inference of this Text. For the Psalmist having professed that he knows the Lord to be great and that he is the onely true God above all gods, that is, who hath all the essentiall properties of the true God, he proves it by and from his workes, and sheweth that by meanes of them he knoweth it. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures and experience confirme the same, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.1. It is said, <hi>that the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy worke, day unto day uttereth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106441:8"/>
speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>The visible things of God are seene from the creation of the world, clearly being understood by the things which were made: Even his divine Power and God-head.</hi> So the works of Gods actual providence in governing and upholding the world, and in mooving the Heavens and the starres in order, doe shew his infinite wisdome and supercelestia<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.1. His overthrowing of his enemies and the persecutors of his Church, as in the flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> and in the drowning of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his host do shew his power. His giving of Christ his Son for a Redeemer aboundantly testifieth his infinite goodnesse and bounty; his punishing our sins in Christ to the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ull, shews his infinite Justice, and his pardoning of beleevers by Christs satisfaction, freely given and communicated to them, shewes his infinite mercy and free grace, as the Scriptures often testifie, and our own consciences within us do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and our daily sense and experience do proove. And in our Redemption and application of it we see discovered the Trinity of Persons in one God. And while wee in these things, as in a glasse behold the glory of God with open face (the vaile of ignorance being remooved) we are changed into the same Image from glory to glory, and so come to have communion with God, and the fruition of him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>The seventh and last Branch sets before us the utmost end of all Gods outward works, to wit the eternall blessednesse of the elect, by the communion, vision and fruition of God in all his glorious attributes, as wisedome, power, goodnesse, mercy, justice, and the rest. The Text it selfe intimates this Truth to us; saying, that all these workes of God proceed from his good will and pleasure. For the good pleasure and will of God consists chiefly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in willing that his elect shall be brought to perfect communion of himselfe and of his glory for their eternall happinesse. And what God willeth according to his owne good pleasure, and doth because he is pleased so to do, it must needs aime at the blessednesse of his elect by the sight and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him and his glory. Now therfore all Gods outward
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106441:8"/>
workes proceeding from Gods pleasure must needs tend to this end, and this is confirmed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. where we read that all things worke together for good to them that <hi>love God and are the called according to his purpose,</hi> and that all things <hi>are the elects,</hi> the world, life and death, <hi>things present, and things to come, and they are Christs and Christ is Gods,</hi> also <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>all things visible and invisible</hi> were created as by Christ so for him, that they might serve him for the salvation of his elect, and for this end and purpose Angells, principalities and powers are said to be made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. And their office and ministery and the great wonders which God doth by them are said to be for them, <hi>who shall be heires of salvation, Heb.</hi> 1.14. To these testimonies many reasons might be added, I will onely call to mind that which I have else where abundantly declared and prooved, to wit, that for this end the world is upheld by Christ, and for his sake and through his mediation ever since mans fall, and for this end the wicked live, even the barbarous and savage nations, either that they may serve for some use to Gods people, or for the elects sake whom God will raise up out of them, or that God may shew his justice and power on them being fitted for destruction, to the greater glory of his elect, even the judgements of God on the wicked, and their damnation serve for this end, to increase the blessednesse of the <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrine of this description serves for to stirre us up in imitation of God our Creator,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> not to content our selves with saying, purposing and promising, or with making a shew of doing good workes, but to be reall, true, constant and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in performance of them. For so doth God, whatsoever he promiseth or purposeth or is pleased to doe, that he doth in Heaven and Earth. Sluggards who delight in idlenesse doing nothing, and Hypocrites who say and promise and make great shew of doing, but are barren of the fruites of good workes, as they are most unlike to God and contrary to him, so they are hatefull and abhominable in the sight of God, and they onely are accepted of God who are active Christians, <hi>alwayes doing good and abounding in the worke of the Lord,</hi> their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106441:9"/>
labour shall not be in vaine, but every one shall receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to his workes which are evidences of his communion with Christ, and of his faith, justification and sanctification; wherefore seeing God is alwayes reaching forth his mighty hand to worke in Heaven, in Earth, in the Sea and all deep places for our profit: let us be alwayes doing and study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do good for his glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly it serves to move and direct us in and through the outward workes of God to see and behold the infinite,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and omnipotent God, and his divine power and God-head, and in the unity of Gods essence, the sacred Trinity of persons, because all the persons have a hand in every worke, and that one God who is three persons is the author and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of every divine outward worke, as this doctrine teacheth. It is a common custome among men when they see and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the handy worke of any person, to remember the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to bee put in minde of him by the worke, especially if he have knowne the person before, and beare the love and affection to him of a friend and a beloved one. So let it be with us, so often as we see and behold the visible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workes of God, let us in them behold the face of God, and remember his glorious attributes. Let us in the great workes of Creation behold the wisedome and power of God the Creator, in the worke of Redemption the mercy, bounty and love of God, in our Sanctification, the love and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of God, and in them all let us behold the three glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Persons in that one God who worketh all things after the counsell of his owne will. The Father by his eternall Word and Spirit creating all things. The Sonne sent forth by the Father in our nature, and sanctified by the Spirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming us and paying our ransome. The Holy Ghost shed on us by God the Father through the Sonne Christ in our regeneration. And all three conspiring together to purge, sanctifie and justifie us, and to make us eternally blessed in our communion with them, and in our fruition of God in grace and glory. And let us take heed and beware of idle and vaine speculation of Gods great workes which shew his glory and proclaime his glorious Attributes, Wisdome,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106441:9"/>
Power and Goodnesse, lest by such idle negligence wee become guilty of taking the name of the Lord our God in vaine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly from this description we may easily gather and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> that sinnefull actions as they are evill and sinnefull are not Gods workes; for God is pleased with those things which he doth, and his workes are according to his pleasure, but God is not pleased with sinnefull actions and evill workes, he hath no pleasure in iniquity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.4. If any aske, How then can it be done if he will not and be not pleased? I answer, That in them there is to be considered, 1. A naturall motion or action proceeding from some created power, and so from God the Creator, and this is good and of God and according to his will as it willeth things properly. 2. There is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, perversenesse and crookednesse of the action, this is of the Divell and mans corruption: this God hateth; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause actions thus corrupted and stayned make way for God and give him occasion to shew his wisedome and power in ouer-ruling them and disposing them by his hand to a good end and his justice in punishing them; therefore God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to continue that naturall power to the wicked which they pervert and abuse, and to over-rule such wicked workes and to raise light out of that darkenesse. And therefore let us not impute any evill and sinfull workes to God, as they are evill and sinfull, nor wickedly imagine that he is the author of sin. His hand is never in any sinfull work, otherwise then to over-rule, order and dispose the sinfulnesse and evill thereof to some good end and purpose.</p>
               <p>Fourthly we are hereby admonished not to impute any worke done in the world to fortune or chance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> as worldly Epicures do, but to ascribe all workes and every thing which comes to passe to the certaine will, purpose and determinate counsell of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od. It is true that in respect of second causes and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of men, many things come to passe accidentally and by chance, no man purposing or intending any such thing, but in respect of God they are certaine and infallible, they all happen according to his will, and without it not an haire can fall from our heads nor a Sparrow fall to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106441:10"/>
earth, all power and motion is of him, and the abuse of the power and motion which is from the Divell and mans corruption he willingly permitted, and doth over-rule and dispose by his wisedome and providence to a good end. And therefore in all casualties and accidents let us comfort our selves and rest content and bee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient knowing that they come not but by his will and pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 5.</note>Lastly let us rejoyce in all the great workes which we see done in the world, and honour them as meanes tending to our salvation, if we be Gods faithfull people, and with care and conscience walke before him according to his word, and let the sight of them put us in mind for our comfort, that our God in whom we trust doth not lie idle, nor slumber or sleep, but by a mighty hand and stretched out arme hath done all these great things, and is continually doing and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for us, to bring us at length out of all troubles and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and to set us and establish us for ever in eternall rest, glory and blessednesse.</p>
               <p>The next thing which in order followeth after the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods outward workes in generall, is the unfolding and distinct handling of the severall sorts and kindes of them. And because the right dividing of them into heads, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of all the particulars unto their proper and naturall heads, is a maine ground of light, and a sure way to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct handling and understanding of them, I will therefore (before I proceed any further) labour to divide them aright into their naturall heads according to the ru<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es of reason and truth, and so will proceed to that which is the first in time, and by the course and order of nature, namely the creation of the world and all things in it. The learned though they all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge every kind of Gods outward workes, and doe not differ in the kindes and numbers of them: yet they are at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance about the true division of them into their first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall heads.</p>
               <p>Some divide the works of God into the works of Creation and the works of Redemption. But this is no perfect division, the two members of it do not containe all the outward works
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106441:10"/>
of God, for over and besides them there are works of preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of judgement and revenge.</p>
               <p>Others divide all Gods outward workes into the works of nature and the workes of grace. The workes of nature they divide into two sortes, 1. The workes which concerne the first beginning of nature, that is, the workes of creation, 2. The workes, which concerne the preservation, which they call the works of Gods providence. The works of grace they hold to be the works of Redemption and restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of man-kind, by which God brings supernaturall blessings to men: But this division failes in divers respects. First, It makes a difference betweene works of nature and works of grace, wheras indeed creation and preservation, which they account works of nature, are in some sense, works of grace. For God of his owne free grace created man in his own Image: And now and ever since the first sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which brought death and destruction into the world, all works of preservation by which God preserveth men in being and life, are works of free grace, and the preserving of his Elect unto his heavenly Kingdome is a worke of supernaturall grace in Christ. Second<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, they erre in distinguishing between the works of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the works of Redemption and rest<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uration, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Redemption and restauration are principall works of Gods providence, by which God provides for his elect in Christ, such things as neither eye hath seen, nor eare heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p>A third sort there are who divide all Gods outward works into these two heads only; namely, the works of Creation, and the works of actuall providence. This I take to be the best and most perfect division. First, because under these heads are all Gods outward works contained, and there is not any one which may not be reduced under one of these two. For whatsoever God doth, or hath done, or can doe for the giving of the first being to all things may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Creation. And whatsoever God doth, or can do for the ordering, preserving and disposing of things created, and of their being and wel-being, may be brought under
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106441:11"/>
the works of his actuall providence. Secondly, there is a perfect distinction and difference between the works of creation and the works of actuall providence: So far as mans substance differs from mans misery and mans feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, so farre doth every proper worke of Creation differ from the works of Gods actuall providence in their objects. And although God in the creating of things in order did shew his providence for man, in that he first made a place of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him, and all things which may serve for his use, as plants, trees, fruits, light and other necessaries before he created him, yet this breeds no confusion between the works of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the works of preservation, for two things may go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in time and place, and may be in the same subject (as we see, sense and understanding, hearing and seeing in one man at the same time, and heat and light in fire) and yet they may be different in themselvs.</p>
               <p>This order therfore I do purpose to follow hereafter by Gods assistance in prosecuting the body of Divinity. First, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Creation, and will labour to unfold the nature of it in generall. And then I will proceed to the handling of all the speciall works therof, every one distinctly by it self in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will passe from thence to the works of Gods act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall providence, under which comes the government and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the world, and of al things created, and the ordering and disposing of every thing to the proper end of it. More espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the fall of man into sin, misery, and guilt of damnation. And the Redemption of man from misery and his Restauration to grace and glory by the application and fruition of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by true spirituall union and communion with Christ the Redeemer, and with God the Father in him by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the generall Doctrin of Gods outward works laid down in this Text, and for the division of them in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall heads and kinds, unto which all the particular outward works may be reduced.</p>
