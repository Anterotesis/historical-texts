         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOr underſtanding this piece of <hi>Mr. Cartwrights,</hi> thou art to
conſider, that it is an extract out of a booke of his written for a
reply to the then Biſhop of Canterbury <hi>Dr. Whitgift.</hi> And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he unfolds many truths for the ſetling of mens judgments
in theſe times, as concerning the force of the Judiciall Lawes of
<hi>Moſes</hi> given to the Jewes, concerning the puniſhment of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
adultery, &amp;c. it was judged likely to prove uſefull to the
Church of Chriſt if it were made more publike, the old Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neer worn out of print.</p>
            <p>The extent and continuance of the Law Morall, Ceremoniall,
and Judiciall, with their ſeverall uſes, not being well conſidered,
hath been the cauſe that many errors of late times have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for. Somthing of the Law was abrogated by the coming of
Chriſt: this being hinted and taken hold of by the ignorant and
unſtable, they underſtand it of the abrogation of all, both Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall,
Judiciall and Morall, and ſo open a gap to licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Thus by confounding what ſhould be diſtinguiſht, many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
have their riſe. There is ſomthing Morall among the
Iudicialls, which will ſtand againſt all oppoſition. There is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in the Morall which is abrogate to the believer, as the curſe,
the condemning power, the irritating nature, &amp;c. <hi>Qui bene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguit,
bene docet.</hi> I leave the clearing of ſome of theſe things
to this enſuing extract: The Lord grant us diſcerning ſpirits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with hearts to walk in the light of his truth, when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
it.</p>

            <p>MY former Aſſertion was, <hi>That we have a word of
God for our direction in all things which we have to
doe.</hi> My reaſon illuſtrating this truth was this, That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
our eſtate ſhould be worſe then the ſtate of the Jews,
who had direction (as is on all hands confeſt) out of the Law,
even for the leaſt things; And whereat it is the vertue of a
good Law, to leave as little undetermined, and without the
compaſſe of the Law, as can be, my adverſary <hi>D. W.</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that we have no word for divers things, wherein the
Jews had particular direction, ſuppoſeth a greater perfection

               </gap>n the Law given to the Jewes, then in that which is left to us.</p>
            <p>That this is a principall vertue of the Law, may be ſeen

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd evidenced thus; Firſt, becauſe conſcience that is well

               </gap>nſtructed and touched with the feare of God, will ſeek di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Ariſt. ad Theod.</hi>
viz. <hi>It greatly behoveth thoſe Lawes which are well made, as
much as can be to determine of all things, and to leave as few
things as may be to the diſcretion of the Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I added, That the new Teſtament is a noble addition to
the old, that it maketh the old more manifeſt, and bringeth
greater light; which expreſſion (though <hi>D. W.</hi> wrangleth
withall) is no other then Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> uſeth on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. where
he calls the Goſpel an addition to the Law: Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now conſider, whether in the matter of the Judiciall
Law, that which I have ſet downe be ſtrange and dangerous,
as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> ſurmiſeth.</p>
            <p>I doe not affirm, that the Magiſtrate is ſimply bound to
the Judiciall Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but that he is bound to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
which I alſo call the ſubſtance and marrow of them,
in regard of which equity, I affirm that, <note place="margin">☜</note>
               <hi>There are certaine
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116235:3"/>
Lawes among the judicialls, which cannot be changed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereof I gave example in the Laws which command, that
a ſtubborn Idolater, Blaſphemer, Murtherer, Inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and ſuch like ſhould be put to death.</p>
            <p>For the firſt point, That the equity of the judicialls doth
remain, and therefore ought to be a rule to direct all Laws
by:<note place="margin">Calv. Inſtit. l. 4 c. 20. Sect. 15.</note> To let paſſe the authority of Mr <hi>Calvin,</hi> Mr <hi>Beza,</hi> and
other writers of our time, who have written with any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this matter,<note place="margin">Beza de com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burendis Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis.</note> (who doe in plain words affirm, that
there is a perpetuall equity in them, and that our Laws,
though they differ in forme, yet ought to retaine the reaſon
or ground of them) I ſay to let that paſſe, I aſſert, <hi>That all
theſe Laws, Morall, Ceremoniall, and Judiciall, being the Laws
of God, and by his revealed will eſtabliſhed, must ſo farre forth
remaine, as it appeareth not by his will that they are revoked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To boult out therefore this truth, ſeeing the altering or
revoking of any Law muſt be by our Saviours comming on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Let us inquire what thoſe Laws are which he put an end
unto.</p>
            <p>This thing may be conſidered in that diviſion which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
uſeth,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note> where he ſaith that our Saviour Chriſt came to make
peace, firſt between God and men, and then between men
and men; that is to ſay between the Jews and Gentiles. 1. The
Ceremoniall Law therefore being a Law of enmity (which
as a wall held out the Gentiles from joyning themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Jews) was neceſſary, among other cauſes, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to be taken away. Secondly, the curſe of the Law, for
the breach of any of the Lawes of God, either pertaining
to the Jews in times paſt, or unto us now (being that which
maketh the wall between the Lord and us) was, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with his Majeſty, neceſſarily to be removed:
whereupon it followeth, Firſt, That the Morall Law (as
that which hindereth not our reconciliation with God, nor
our good agreement with men) is in as full ſtrength as ever
it was before the comming of our Saviour Chriſt: For the
curſe of the Law beſides that, it is in regard of the Elect, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fulfilled and executed in the perſon of our Saviour Chriſt,
then abrogated. 2. Beſides that alſo, it hath a neceſſary uſe
as yet towards the Elect, not only to drive them to the faith
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116235:3"/>
which is in Chriſt Jeſus, but alſo to keep under the remnants
of rebellion, even of them which have already believed. And
3. Beſides that, the force thereof is dayly, and ſhall be for
ever executed upon the wicked. 4. Beſides all this, ſeeing
this curſe was annexed not only to the breach of the Morall
Law, but alſo of the Ceremoniall and Judiciall, there is no
juſt cauſe, why the Morall Law ſhould be ſaid to be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
            <p>Secondly it followeth hereupon, That thoſe Judiciall
Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which are meerly Politck, and without all
mixture of Ceremonies, muſt remain, as thoſe which hinder
not the Attonement of Jews and Gentiles with God, or of
one of them with another. Beſides this, It being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that our Saviour Chriſt came not to diſſolve any good
Government of Common-wealth, he can leaſt of all be
thought to come to deſtroy that which himſelfe had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
            <p>Of this Point Dr. <hi>W.</hi> hath two contrary ſentences, one of
<hi>Muſculus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pa. 97.</note> which ſaith that the Judiciall Law is abrogate, the
other of <hi>Beza,</hi> which is, That the Judiciall Law being given
to the Jewes, is not yet abrogate, ſo that if they had any eſtate
of Common-wealth in the Land of Canaan, they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to uſe that forme of Government, which was given
to them by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now albeit thoſe Lawes given unto the Jews for that
Land, doe not bind the Gentiles in other Lands, forſomuch
as the diverſity of the diſpoſitions of the people, and ſtate
of that Country, gave occaſion of ſome Laws there, which
would not have been in other places, yet foraſmuch as there is
in thoſe Laws a conſtant and everlaſting Equity whereupon
they were grounded, 2. And the ſame perfecter and further
from errour then the forge of mans reaſon (which is even in
this behalfe ſhrewdly wounded,) is able to deviſe; It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that even in making Politick Laws for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
Chriſtian Magiſtrates ought to propound unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
thoſe Laws, and in light of their Equity by a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of circumſtances, of perſon, place, &amp;c. to frame them.</p>
            <p>Now to prove this truth, That the equitie of the Iudiciall
Law remaineth, (not as a counſail which men may follow if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116235:4"/>
               <note place="margin">☞</note>they liſt, and leave at their pleaſure, but) as a Law whereto
they be bound,<note place="margin">1. Argument.</note> I ſhall prove by an Argument taken from that
of the Apoſtle in 1 Cor 9. where after he had alleaged divers
ſimilitudes, fetcht from the common uſe of men, to prove
that a Miniſter of the Goſpel ought to be maintained upon
the Churches charge;<note place="margin">Pag. 98.</note> leaſt it might be objected that theſe
were but humane reaſons, he citeth one of the Judiciall Laws,
as the eternall Law of God, Deut. 25. 4. Thou ſhalt not
muzzell the mouth &amp;c. Where it is manifeſt, that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to bind the Conſcience of the Corinths unto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of that Law which was Judiciall, and ſo urgeth it ver. 10.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe of the finding of the Prieſts in the ſervice of the
Altar, commanded in the Law, he concludeth, That thoſe
which preach the Goſpel ſhould live of it. And this main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Prieſt, albeit in the manner of the proviſion
it was meerly Ceremoniall, yet as it was a reward of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
due by men (as the puniſhments alſo, if they had failed
in their duties,) was meer Judiciall. Whereupon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that in thoſe Judicialls, to all the circumſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we are not bound, we are yet bound to the Equity of
them.</p>
            <p>It remaineth to ſhew, that there are certain Judiciall Lawes
which cannot be changed, as that a Blaſphemer, contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and ſtubborn Idolater, &amp;c. ought to be put to death. They
which would have this left at liberty, have nothing to alledge
to colour their looſeneſſe, but the coming of Chriſt and his
paſſion: but they do not ſee how this their arguing faultreth
divers wayes. For,</p>
            <p>1. It is a childiſh error to think, that our Saviour Chriſt
came to exempt men from corporall death, which the Law
caſteth upon evill doers, when as he came not to deliver from
death, which is the parting of the body from the ſoule, but
from that which is the ſeparation both of body and ſoul from
the gracious preſence of the Lord. And if it were ſo, that our
Saviour Chriſt had born in his Body this civill puniſhment of
publike offenders, it muſt thereupon follow, not that it is in
the liberty of the Magiſtrate to put them to de<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, but that he
muſt, will he, nill he, if they repent, keep them alive. For if
our Saviour hath anſwered that juſtice of God in his Law,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116235:4"/>
whereby he hath commanded that ſuch malefactors ſhould be
put to death,<note place="margin">Pag. 99.</note> it ſhould be great injuſtice to require that again
in the life of the offender.</p>
            <p>2. Againe, this opinion is injurious to the death of Chriſt;
for if he were for this cauſe made manifeſt in the ſleſh, that he
might deſtroy ſin, which is the work of the Devill, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8.
this imagination of a liberty left to the Magiſtrate, whether he
will put them to death or not, doth make Chriſt build againe
that kingdome of ſin which he hath deſtroyed: For, when
both in common reaſon, and by the manifeſt word of God,
the Lord giveth this bleſſing unto the puniſhment of ſuch
grievous offenders by death,<note place="margin">Deut. 19.</note> that others (not only which ſee,
but alſo) which heare of them, have the bridle of feare put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, whereby they are with-holden from the like crimes,
it muſt needs follow, that whoſoever maketh our Saviour
Chriſt author of this looſeneſſe, in not puniſhing ſuch offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
maketh him forthwith to looſe the bridle whereby others
are ſtayed from throwing themſelves down the hill of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
which was before committed: And what is, if this
be not, to make our Saviour Chriſt a troubler of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths?</p>
            <p>Moreover, if our Saviour Chriſt by his coming looſed
theſe civill puniſhments, and purchaſed this grace of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for blaſphemers, &amp;c. that if they could find favour in
the eyes of the Magiſtrate, they might eſcape the hands of
death,<note place="margin">2 Argument, to prove the Judiciall Law ſtill in force.</note> which the Law of God adjudgeth them unto: How
commeth it to paſſe, that the Apoſtles, to whom the Lord
committed the publiſhing of all that pardon which he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for us, did never make mention of the ſlaking of theſe
puniſhments? If our Saviour Chriſt had obtained this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it was worthy the preaching; and therefore unleſſe D. <hi>W.</hi>
can ſhew ſomething out of the writings of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Ioe.</note> to
warrant this Sanctuary, which he would ſo faine build to the
ſupport of blaſphemers, murderers, &amp;c. it followeth, that
the Apoſtles, by his ſaying, have not anſwered the truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them; But if all godly minds doe abhorre theſe
abſurdities, there is no cauſe why they ſhould like of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the Doctor, whereupon all theſe depend. Nay in
that the Apoſtle putteth a ſword in the hand of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116235:5"/>
and in the uſe of it maketh him a Miniſter and ſervant of
the vengeance and juſtice of the Lord againſt ſinne:<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> He ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
through this opinion, which imagineth that our Saviour
Chriſt came to hang the ſword of the Lords juſtice upon the
pleaſure and will of man. For the Magiſtrate being the Lords
Officer, as the Sheriffe is the Magiſtrates: It is no more in his
choice to with-hold the Sword which the Lord hath put in his
hand to <hi>draw,</hi> then in the power of the Sheriffe, to ſtay the
execution of that judgement, which the Magiſtrate himſelfe
hath lawfully commanded,</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing there is a ſword in the Magiſtrates hand, by
the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and that alſo which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
muſt of duty draw; I would gladly know where that
neceſſity of drawing this ſword can be found, if it be not in
theſe crimes of Blaſphemy, &amp;c. which I have ſet downe?</p>
            <p>And if he ſay that <hi>Paul,</hi> by the ſword underſtandeth all
manner of civill puniſhments, as well by the purſe, as by
other bodily chaſtiſements which ſpare the life; I grant
it, but by an uſuall manner of ſpeech which is figurative, and
noteth the whole by the part, he rather choſe to utter thoſe
puniſhments by the <hi>Sword,</hi> then either by the whip or purſe:
whereby he did not only not exclude this neceſſity of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
malefactors with death, but laid rather a ſtraiter bond up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Magiſtrate to execute thoſe which commit things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of death.</p>
            <p>Hitherto generally of putting thoſe to death, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
things againſt the Laws remaining ſtill in force, as they
were in times paſt eſtabliſhed by the bloud of the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors:
Now I will come to the particular crimes ſet downe,
and firſt for the crime of <hi>Adultery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be conſidered that the crime of Adultery is a breach
of the holy and ancient, both inſtitution and ſolemn Covenant
of the Lord, then that it is an injury done unto the innocent
party in the moſt precious poſſeſſion that can be,<note place="margin">pag. 101.</note> in things
pertaining to this preſent life, joyned with diſhonour caſt not
only upon the perſon, but upon all his Children, and in a
manner on all thoſe that belong unto him. Thirdly that this
fire doth not only waſt the family where it is, but maketh a
breach into the Common-wealth, whilſt the right of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116235:5"/>
either of Lands or Offices is oftentimes thus tranſlated
from the true Inheritors, while the children which are ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
having oft times leſſe care and coſt beſtowed on them
in their education, become hurtfull Members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walth;
whereby all may clearely ſee the perpetuall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Law of God in the revengement of this ſinne
by death.</p>
            <p>And when the Lord addeth this for a reaſon of putting
the Adulterer to death,<note place="margin">Lev. 19.</note> that the evill may be taken out of
Iſrael, unto the heap of diſcommodities before rehearſed for
fault of executing this Judgement of death, he threatneth
the whole Common-wealth with miſchiefe to fall upon it;
and the equity of this puniſhment by death hath ſo lightſome
colours upon it, that it hath upholden it ſelfe againſt the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and injuſtice of all which have not willingly put
out that ſparkle which ſtandeth in the diſcretion of honeſty;
For even before this candle light of the Law of God was ſet
up,<note place="margin">Iob. 31. 11.</note> not onely the godly (as <hi>Job)</hi> which were in ſome part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the generall blindneſſe, but even thoſe that were
not of the Church of God, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> the King of Gerar,
and the very Canaanite (as long as there was any ſtep of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
among them) did ſee that the filth of this ſinne was
ſuch,<note place="margin">Gen. 26. 11.</note> as ought to be waſhed away with the bloud of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.
For whereas <hi>Iſaac</hi> feared the aſſault, both of his life
and of the chaſtity of <hi>Rebecka,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 38. 24.</note> the King ordained that
whoſoever either laid violent hands on him, or had to doe
with his wife, ſhould die; and in that <hi>Judah</hi> called for <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
to be led forth to death in the Land of Canaan, where
himſelfe was but a private man, for that ſhe being made ſure
unto an husband, plaid the Harlot: he gave to underſtand,
that the Canaanites, who had even then filled a good part
of that meaſure of ſin unto the brinke, whereof they came
afterward did notwithſtanding purſue Adulterers unto
death.</p>
            <p>And when the Lord did afterward give teſtimony to this
puniſhment by the expreſſe words of his Law, it is manifeſt,
that the Law which God hath written in the table of the
hearts of all men, pronounceth the ſentence of death againſt
Adulterers: So that unleſſe men will like Gyants fight againſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116235:6"/>
the light of nature, or ſay, that our Saviour Chriſt came to
aboliſh that which in all times and with all Nations (not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſpoiled of the diſcretion of honeſty and diſhoneſty)
was obſerved, it followeth, that the puniſhment of Adultery
by death, and conſequently much more the puniſhment of
inceſtuous meetings by death, ſtandeth in as full force now as
ever it did before the coming of our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The exceptions againſt this Doctrine are of no value, for
if this be the truth of God there can be no prerogative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, unleſſe he can ſhew ſome higher Court then heaven,
and ſome chief Juſtice above the Lord.</p>
            <p>It is not denied, but the puniſhments by death whereby
men have eſtabliſhed Lawes which themſelves have for their
better commodity deviſed, may be either mitigated or taken
away by thoſe to whom it appertained; neither is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
by any thing which I have ſet downe bound to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the puniſhment of Theeves. For, their puniſhment may
grow by the circumſtance of place, as in Scithia where all
things lying open to the ſpoile, had need to be locked up by
the ſtraighter puniſhment, and ſometimes by the diſpoſition
of the people lighter handed then others, as if one had to do
with the Lacedemonians, or ſome Nation in whom that ſinne
had taken deeper root. And I will not deny, but even theſe
crimes of Murther and Adultery may vary by divers circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and therefore the Magiſtrate may according to the
quantity of the fault appoint the <hi>manner</hi> of death ſharper or
milder. <hi>But that there is any place, time, or other circumſtance,
which can leſſen theſe crimes that they ſhould not be worthy of
death, upon the reaſons before alledged, I utterly deny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">An objection anſwered.</note>It may be objected, that the Law of our Saviour Chriſt
touching divorcement for Adultery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 32. had been to
no purpoſe, if the Adulterer ought of neceſſity to be put to
death.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Anſwer.</note>Firſt, he that urgeth this may be juſtly charged with a
miſtake in bringing in our Saviour Chriſt there as a maker of
Lawes under the Goſpell, whereas he made none in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but expounded the Law of God, which he had made
from the beginning; the other refuſalls made by the Jewes
of their wives, were never any Lawes but Permiſſions only:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116235:6"/>
and therefore in their aboliſhment there was no Law of God
abrogated.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Anſwer.</note> it was neceſſary to uſe that expoſition, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the puniſhment of the Law by death remained;<note place="margin">Joh. 18. 31.</note>
for beſides that the Jewes being under the Government of the
Romanes had thoſe civill puniſhments by death ſuſpended
upon the pleaſure of their Officers, who were often corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
our Saviour Chriſt fore-ſeeing all things did fore-ſee
what looſeneſſe would follow in this behalfe, and therefore
as the office of a good Teacher required, he inſtructed the
conſcience, and taught that albeit the Magiſtrate faile in the
execution of the Law, yet that the former yoke being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
men were at their liberty to enter into a new contract
of Marriage with other; whereby he met with the corrupt
opinion of thoſe which dreame that the knot of Marriage is
not cut aſunder by Adultery during the life of the parties
married.</p>
            <p>Now for the opinion of <hi>Muſculus</hi> before quoted, at pa. 3.
although his manner of ſpeech (in ſaying that all <hi>Moſes</hi> is
abrogated) be hard, yet it will appeare that <hi>D. W.</hi> hath
wreſted this learned mans words from his meaning, and that
he is but a ſnatcher at ſyllables; for the meaning of that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man <hi>Muſculus</hi> was, that theſe Lawes are abrogate, <hi>as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by Moſs,</hi> and doe notwithſtanding remaine <hi>as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a perpetuall equity;</hi> and that this is his meaning may be
proved by comparing him with himſelfe, for in the ſame title
of Lawes he writeth thus, <hi>There are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that think that
Chriſt did abrogate the puniſhment preſcribed by the Law againſt
Adulterers, when he ſaith, Neither doe I condemne thee, goe and
ſinne no more; theſe be gay fellowes, they thinke not of this, that
our Saviour Chriſt came into the world, not to judge or puniſh,
but to ſave ſinners: and yet in the meane ſeaſon not to take away
the puniſhments of the Law, given of God his Father by Moſes;
whereupon he ſaid not ſimply, thon thoughteſt not to be condemned,
&amp;c.</hi> and ſo ſheweth, that if ſhe had been condemned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſentence of the Law, that the Lord would not
have ſpoke againſt it. This our Saviours refuſall to condemn
this woman taken in Adultery, doth no more ceaſe the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to Adultery,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.</note> then his refuſing to judge in the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116235:7"/>
of an inheritance when he was requeſted, doth countenance
Anabaptiſticall community, or doth prove, that Inheritances
ſhould not be divided, in both theſe he refuſeth to meddle, as
impertinent to that ſpirituall work he intended] <hi>Calvin</hi> in
his Comment on John, calleth it <hi>Popiſh divinity,</hi> that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of our Saviour Chriſt, Jo. 8. ſhould bring any favour to
Adulterers,<note place="margin">pag. 107.</note> as touching the civill puniſhment.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> it is known that he proveth that Hereticks
ought by the Law of God to be put to death,<note place="margin">See alſo <hi>Bezae</hi> confeſſio Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianae fidei, ca. 5. de Eccleſia ſect. 44.</note> whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that he beleeves thoſe Judicialls which give ſentence of
death againſt the crimes here ſet down to be ſtill in as full
force as ever they were. Unto which I could add <hi>Peter Martir,</hi>
who hath a long diſpute of the neceſſary obſervation of this
Law againſt Adulterers, and as I have ſhewed there is none of
theſe crimes but even the Law of nature will teach us, that
they ought to receive the reward af death.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>VV.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Dr. proceeds, and ſeeks to make</hi> one difference between the
Law and Goſpel, to ly in relation to the ſeverity of the Law and
lenity of the Goſpel, in reſpect of temporall puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Anſwer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">T. C.</note> I ſay that in this very point, a great part of
the errour of the <hi>Manichees</hi> doth conſiſt, for they were led
to condemne the Juſtice of God under the old Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the outward puniſhments which were exerciſed part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the hand of God by judgements from Heaven, and partly
by the Miniſtery of men at the commandment of the Law;
therefore the favour of <hi>Manichiſm</hi> is ſtill hot as ever it was.</p>
            <p>But ſince I am entred into the mention of this, the <hi>Truth</hi>
is, that even in theſe outward puniſhments, the diſpenſaton
of God under the Law, is divers from that under the Goſpel;
For under the Paedagogy of the Law, as he crowned the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of it for the moſt part with greater abundance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bleſſings, then he doth the obedience of his Saints under
the Goſpel: ſo did he with more terrible, more often, and
more manifeſt judgements, revenge the breach of it in that
time, then he doth now. And herein indeed is the difference
which the Dr. is groping after but cannot hit on it; But that
this ſhould bring any diverſity in the ſet and ordinary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
preſcribed by the Law, I for my part cannot underſtand.
The contrary rather I can gather; for even as although the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116235:7"/>
Lord doth not now by outward bleſſings give ſo plentifull
teſtimony to the obedience of the Goſpell, as then of the Law:
yet the Magiſtrate ought to be as diligent to procure the
good of the Church as ever he was in the time of the Law:
Even ſo although the Lord by bodily puniſhments doth not
ſo ſeverely revenge as he did then, yet the Magiſtrate may
not remit any thing therfore of that ſeverity which he was
wont to uſe. Nay more, even as the Magiſtrate ought ſo much
the more carefully to procure the outward welfare of the
Church now, as the Lord withdraweth his hand that way,
more now then he did then, even ſo ought he to keep by ſo
much an harder hand over the puniſhment of ſinne now, then
he did then, as the Lord more rarely thundereth by his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from Heaven, now, then he did in time of the Law.</p>
            <p>And ſruely, if ever there had been any time wherein the
Magiſtrates ſword might have reſted and ruſted in the ſheath,
the time of the Law of all had been moſt fitteſt: when the
Lord did ſo viſibly ſit in judgement, and himſelfe in proper
perſon hold the Aſſize.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of this diverſity between the Law and Goſpell
may be ſeen in thoſe learned men mentioned, which handle
the Point.</p>
            <p>It is enough for me, ſo to helpe the Dr. out, with what
he travelled with, that I have ſhewed, that what is by me
here laid downe is nothing hindered, but greatly helped
by this difference which he bringeth betweene the Law, and
the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ob.</note>Next, the Dr. finds fault with my interpretation of that
place of <hi>Zachary,</hi> concerning putting to death him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied

therefore (ſaith the Dr.) there muſt be ſome other ſence ſought

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The anſwer of <hi>T. C.</hi>
               </note>Whereunto I anſwer, That <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewing what ought to

to withdraw from the true worſhip of God, ſaith, Deu. 13. 6, 9.
that though it be his Brother, his Sonne, his Daughter, or his
Wife, he ſhall not ſpare but kill them: tell me now I pray
you, doth not <hi>Moſes</hi> mean there truly, and as his words
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116235:8"/>
ſound, that the falſe Teacher ſhall die? If you cannot deny it,
then you ſee that your reaſon which you here aſſigne is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth, for there alſo it is commanded to the Father to
kill his Sonne.</p>
            <p>But if you liſt to learne,<note place="margin">Pag. 112.</note> you may perceive that by theſe
words underſtood ſimply, there is no power given to one
private man to kill another, nor for the parent (as a private
man) to kill his children: but this manner of ſpeech is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 7. whereby it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
that the witneſſe which had accuſed ſhould throw the

as both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> after <hi>Moſes,</hi> will have the Father

to Idolatry remaine with him alone, therefore alſo they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
the killing of the guilty perſon unto them, as a thing
belonging to the duty of the Accuſer.</p>
            <p>Oh! but your words ſeem to give ſuſpition of a difference
between the Jewes and us, what is that? why that Chriſtian
Parents ſhould rather put their children to death, then to be
with-drawne by them: ſo that the Jewes have an abſolute
Commandement to put them to death, but the Chriſtians
have it under condition, if they cannot otherwiſe keep ſtill the
true Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>But where and in what ſhop is this difference quoined? For
how ſhall they be ſure they ſhall not be with-drawne by him,
unleſſe they procure him to be put to death?</p>
            <p>And although they were out of the perill of being with-drawn,
how are others provided for, whom he may corrupt? And if
it were poſſible that poiſon which he hath, could not hurt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, where is the revenge of Gods glory which hath been
diſhonoured by ſuch falſe teaching? and in the maintenance
whereof the zeale of Gods children as well under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

            <p>I conclude therefore that place of <hi>Zachary</hi> (againſt your
fond diſtinction) that the ſame ſeverity of puniſhment which
was uſed againſt falſe Prophets then, ought to be uſed now
under the Goſpell againſt falſe Teachers, comparing one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

be extreme, I am content to be ſo counted with the holy

the Law, as of open and horrible blaſphemy of the Name of

taketh away the life of the ſoule ſhould die: and if it be meet
to maintaine the life of man by the puniſhment of death,<note place="margin">Pag. 117.</note>
how ſhould the honour of God, which is more precious then
all mens lives, be with ſmaller puniſhment eſtabliſhed?</p>
            <p>Therefore to cloſe up this queſtion, I will adde this; That
the Magiſtrates which puniſh Murtherers and Thiefes, and
Treaſons, with other tranſgreſſors of the ſecond Table ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and are looſe in puniſhing the breaches of the firſt Table,
begin at the wrong end, and do all one with thoſe, who to
drie up many rivers continually fed by one fountain, begin at
the channells where it divideth and parteth it ſelfe into many
armes: which as it is an endleſſe labour, ſo is this alſo which
they go about;<note place="margin">Arg.</note> for whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. that God
for revenge of the diſhonour of his Name, giveth men over
to wicked minds, to the committing all kind of ſilthineſſe, and
of all kind of ſins againſt the ſecond Table, be they never ſo
horrible; and ſo maketh the breach of the firſt Table the cauſe
of the breach of the ſecond: It cannot be (let the Magiſtrate
lay as good watch as he can, and aggravate puniſhments as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116235:9"/>
much as he can,) I ſay it cannot be but where either the firſt
table is broken, or the breach not duly revenged, but ſwarms
of Treaſons, Thefts, Murthers, Adulteries, Perjuries and ſuch
like, muſt needs breake out in thoſe Governments.</p>
            <p>And therefore as the ſhort and eaſie way to dry up the
Channells and Rivers is to ſtop up the head and fountaine of
all, ſo the only remedy of purging the Common-wealth
of theſe miſchiefes, is to bend the force of ſharp and ſevere
puniſhments eſpecially againſt Idolaters, Blaſphemers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners
of true Religion, and of the Service of God.</p>
            <p>And therefore I conclude,<note place="margin">pag. 118.</note> that thoſe which would have the
ſeverity of the Law againſt Idolaters, &amp;c. abated, doe at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
not onely thereby utter the ſmall price which they ſet
either of Gods glory, or of the ſalvation of their Brethren,
but withall declare themſelves enemies to Common-wealths,
and of all both civill and godly honeſtie of life.</p>
