            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34880:2"/>
End never ſo good,) all the Blood that is ſhed, is no better than Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Therefore though the <hi>Subjects</hi> in ſuch a War ſhould prevail againſt their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> yet neither is he hereby diveſted of his juſt Right, nor they inveſted therewith, becauſe the War was wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt on their part, for want of Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore if that Party whoſe Cauſe is Unjuſt, ſhall yet prevail, and prove ſucceſsfull, then in anſwer to the ſecond Branch, I ſay, that there is no Right acquired by this: For, 'tis a miſtake to think that this is the meaning of <hi>Jus Victoriae, the Right of Victory,</hi> which the <hi>Civil Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> ſpeak of, as if <hi>God</hi> had by this <hi>lottery</hi> teſtified his Judgment of the Right, and pronounced that Juſt now, which was Unjuſt before; or that the preſent Force is always to be looked on as the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and allowed the Obedience required by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as due to them, which is the miſtaking of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Authority,</hi> and agrees with that ſpeech of the <hi>Atheiſts, Wiſ. 2. Our ſtrength is the Law of Juſtice, and that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.</hi> And we know 'tis Gods ordinary diſpenſation now under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to permit Violence to oppreſs the Godly, which ſure is no Argument that thoſe proſperous Ungodly, have the ſole Right to the Poſſeſſions of the World, or that the oppreſt Godly Man, ſhall no longer be thought to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, when the proſperous Oppreſſour, is arrived at the height of his oppreſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Queſtion then being removed from the Title of <hi>Force,</hi> (which being itſelf unjuſt, cannot confer Right on any,) It muſt next be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, what <hi>Dedition</hi> (that is, <hi>yielding or reſigning up of one's Right)</hi> can doe. That will be of two ſorts; either of the <hi>Prince,</hi> or the <hi>People;</hi> and again, either <hi>Voluntary</hi> or <hi>Involuntary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Voluntary Dedition,</hi> or <hi>yielding up,</hi> of the rightfull Poſſeſſor, if he be a private Man, transfers a Right: But a <hi>Prince,</hi> being a publick Perſon, and having an obligation of Protection to his Subjects, cannot without ſome breach of that Obligation, abdicate his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> nor conſequently voluntarily yield up his Power; or if he do, he cannot transfer the Right to any, (ſave to the lawful Heir or Succeſſor,) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the tacit or expreſs Conſent of the People alſo.</p>
               <p>But in caſe they conſent alſo, then will his Right <hi>(in Kingdoms Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive)</hi> be transferred by the joint yielding of the King and his Subjects. As for Kingdoms hereditary, the Subjects Conſent is not neceſſary; but the King's yielding up of his Right alone, is ſufficient to transfer the Right to the next Heir. Neither can the joint Act both of King
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34880:2"/>
and People, transfer this Right, from the next Heir, to any other. The King's yielding is an Abſolution of the Subjects from the Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance formerly due to him by them, and ſo makes it lawfull for them to yield the ſame to another; and when 'tis thus free and lawfull to them, the Intervention of their own Act alſo becomes Obligation on them to ſubmit to that Perſon ſo yielded to. And when this is done (in <hi>Kingdoms Elective)</hi> and withall when no Heir is left to make Claim, or the Claim is relinquiſh'd by the right Heir, <hi>(in Kingdoms hereditary,)</hi> then is the Kingdom removed, (and given by God, who now rules not immediately among us, as he did in the time of the <hi>Theocracy</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but is then ſaid to remove a Kingdom, when his Providence ſo diſpoſes, that by the Laws, and Right among Men, it is removed,) to another.</p>
               <p>But till this be done, <hi>i. e.</hi> till <hi>He,</hi> or <hi>They,</hi> in whom the Right both of <hi>preſent Poſſeſſion,</hi> and <hi>future Claim by Inheritance,</hi> is truly veſted, do voluntarily yield up that Right, and when that is done, till they which by their yielding, are freed from their former Bands, do now by their own Act enter, into new, what Force ſoever there be, and how ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull ſoever the Force be, there is not thereby any ſuch Victory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, as ſhall be able to confer Right on the Victor, nor remove it from him that hath, and ſtill proteſts his <hi>Right,</hi> though as yet he be not ſtrong enough to vindicate it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But then in the next place, if there be a Dedition, or yielding up by the King, and that Dedition involuntary; that is, ſuch as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the preſent Succeſs of the Force hath inclined him to, then certainly doth it not ſo diveſt him of his <hi>Right,</hi> as that it ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for him when he can, to make Claim, and recover it again. As he that by a violent Invader is made to ſwear to pay ſuch a Summ of Money, it is acknowledged lawfull for him to implead that Thief, and recover from him, what in performance of that involuntary Oath he hath paid him.</p>
               <p>In this caſe the difficulty is, What Condition thoſe <hi>Subjects</hi> are leſt in for that time, betwixt the <hi>involuntary Dedition</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing</hi> of his <hi>Claim;</hi> and the Solution muſt be, That a Proportion be obſerved between the Act of the King, and the Subjects conſequent Act: The Act of the King is but a <hi>preſent Dedition,</hi> and doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him never to make any farther Claim again; and conſequently this gives not any ſuch Abſolution to the <hi>Subjects,</hi> as that they may doe any thing which ſhall prejudice that After-Claim, or blemiſh his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:34880:3"/>
ſuch as are taking new Oaths of <hi>Allegiance, Abjurations</hi> of him and his Iſſue, <hi>Engagements</hi> to the <hi>Uſurped Power,</hi> &amp;c. All that it can doe, is to make it free for them to ſubmit to ſuch other things, of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour nature, (which includes not any ſuch blemiſhment of <hi>Rights</hi> of the lawfull Prince,) provided that they acknowledge not the lawfulneſs of the preſent uſurped Power, nor act as Miniſters or Inſtruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This is the utmoſt that ſeems poſſible to determine in this matter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As for that Power which <hi>Tract of Time</hi> may be thought to have in this buſineſs, that is not conſiderable, where the Claim is continued, (for that argues the Dedition involuntary,) and much leſs, when there is no Dedition at all; for there 'twas before ſuppoſed, that Force can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſer Right.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And if by this ſtating of the Caſe it follow, that the Lot of the faithfull Subjects muſt be very unhappy at this time, and that great Diſorder muſt neceſſarily continue in ſuch a broken Kingdom, as long as the Contention between the violent <hi>Uſurper</hi> and the juſt <hi>Owner</hi> thus remains undecided. I anſwer: That this is oft the Lot of the moſt pious Men under the Goſpel, <hi>who have their good things here mixt with Tribulations,</hi> and muſt content themſelves in the ſolaces of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, in performing thoſe Duties which coſt them deareſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their full payment of joys without hardſhips, to be paid them in another World.</p>
