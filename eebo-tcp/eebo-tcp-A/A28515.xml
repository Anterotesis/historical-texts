            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Books of this Author, that are <hi>already</hi> publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
declare sufficiently the high worth of his deepe
writings: But of all the benefits that doe accrue thereby,
it is one inestimable Excellencie of them, that they helpe the
Mindes of all sorts of people, that will take paines to reade
and to consider them; in the understanding of the Holy
<hi>Scriptures:</hi> and that satisfactorily and convincingly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
neede of having any reference to the vast Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Authours, either in the Learned or Moderne
Tongues: and they will help Men to be able to discerne the
truth in the various Expositions and Opinions of all Parties,
also to still the differences debates controversies disputes
and contests; that all may be satisfied in a Loving friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way, and so agree in one and the same Truth together.</p>
            <p>And among many differences in Opinion that Spring up,
there is one weighty and remarkable, arisen, since the Light
within, and <hi>Christ within,</hi> hath been pressed more then Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary;
one sort being judged to deny, a Christ without,
and the other, a Christ within; whereas it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Christ is not divided,</hi> though he be every
where in all places, and in all things, and yet but once ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
in<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the likenesse of sinfull Flesh:</hi> Suffering,
Dying, Rising from the dead, Ascending into Glory; yet he
that is not partaker of the same Christ within, or is not
made conformable in his soul and spirit to him in his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Death and Resurrection, in this Life, in some measure,
shall never be partaker with him in his glory in the Life
to come; But if wee<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Suffer with him,</hi> we shall also be
glorifyed with him, at his appearing: <hi>Pauls</hi> desire to

know nothing but<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Christ and him crucified</hi> among the
Corinthians; was not to know them to crucifie Christ, but
the vertue and Power of Christ crucified in them: and if the
same Christ that suffered at Jerusalem were not in every
one, the wickedest Man in the World could not<note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note> 
               <hi>crucifie
to himselfe the Lord of glory:</hi> And what Christ did
in the Flesh once, alwaies had and hath its powerfull effect
in the Spirit of every Soul that is united to him within it
selfe, and not otherwise: Therefore we should learne to
understand, how, it is Christ, that was<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 13. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the Lamb slain
from the beginning of the World,</hi> and then also in
<hi>Abel</hi> when he was slain by <hi>Cain:</hi> also in his own Body
when <hi>Jesus</hi> himselfe was nailed on the Crosse and gave up
the Ghost: and still suffers and is slain<note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 5. 30.</note> 
               <hi>in his Members;</hi>
and as he will say at the Judgment, when all shall appeare,
from Adam to the last Man that is borne of a Woman,<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 25. 40. 45:</note>
               <hi>whatsoever is done to the Least of those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him,</hi> it is done to Christ himselfe, in them; and
not that he will, only, take it as done to him, as his words
are commonly expounded; but it is really done to him:
<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 6. 55.</note> 
               <hi>His Flesh is meat indeed, &amp; his Blood is drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
and they that <hi>did not eate and drink it,</hi> though it
were within them (otherwise they could not doefo) <hi>had

                  </gap>o part in him:</hi> and this be said when himselfe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
with his Disciples before his Suffering and Death;
Therfore there cannot be a Christ, within, in Christ without,
but one and the same Christ within and without, now and
then, and alwaies, from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
            <p>There is another great difference, concerning <hi>Perfection</hi>
and the attaining to it <hi>in this Life:</hi> one sort condemning
the otherf, or speaking that which they understand to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the Scripture; but they doe not endeavour to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the meaning of those Texts, which seeme so extreamely
to differ. For perfection;<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 5. 48. Luk. 6. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye perfect as your
heavenly Father is perfect,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Job. 1. 1. &amp; 2. 3.</note> Job <hi>was a perfect and</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61095:6"/>
upright Man.<note n="*" place="margin">James. 3. 2.</note> If any Man sin not in word he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Man. And there is mention made of the</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">James 1. 25</note> perfect Law
of Liberty: <hi>also,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9.</note> he that is borne of God sinneth not,
neither can he, because the seed of God remaineth in
him.<note n="†" place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> As many as be perfect, let them be thus
minded, <hi>viz:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3. 14.</note> to presse for the Prize of the high call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God in Christ Jesus. <hi>On the other side:</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 3. 10.</note> There
is none righteous, no not one,<note n="*" place="margin">1 King 8. 46. 2 Chron. 6. 36. Prov. 20. 9. Eccles. 7. 22.</note> there is not a Man
that sinneth not,<note n="†" place="margin">James 3. 2.</note> in many things WEE <hi>sin</hi> all. <hi>And
the Apostle</hi> John, <hi>who no doubt was then borne of God,
saith:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 8.</note> If WEE say we have no sinne we deceive
our selves, and there is no truth in us; <hi>if [wee] say, not
if he or they say, or whosoever saith: And while he was in
the instant of high Revelations,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 19. 10.</note> he fell <hi>down</hi> before the
Angel to worship him, <hi>thinking it had been God, but
the Angel said to him, See thou doe it not, for I am thy
fellow servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And these great differences</hi> cannot <hi>be reconciled by the
distinction of a time or condition of Men unconverted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have attained Perfection, before they are righteous
or before they are sanctified: but they</hi> may <hi>be decided by the
understanding, what it is that sinneth in Man; and
what it is in Man that is perfect and cannot sinne: For
as the Soul in this Life entereth into the one or the other
through obedience to it; that Soul is either righteous and
perfect, or wicked and imperfect, as the Scriptures testifie:
And</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Col. 1. 28.</note> ever <hi>one that shall</hi> be presented perfect, <hi>is to
be presented perfect</hi> in Christ Jesus, <hi>so that our perfection
consisteth in him not in Selfe: and so the</hi> Gifts <hi>of God are</hi>
perfect, <hi>or else we could not be</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 2. 8.</note> saved by Faith, <hi>for that
is</hi> not of our selves, but is the gift of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it may well be said by the Apostle Paul, after his high
Revelation:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note> I know that in me, that is in my Flesh
dwelleth no good thing; <hi>dwelleth, not did or hath
<pb facs="tcp:61095:6"/>
dwelt, before his conversion or at the beginning of the
writing that Epistle: but at that instant dwelleth in him
no good thing in his Flesh: also, saies he,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> I doe find a
Law in my Members rebelling against the Law of
my mind, and leading me into captivity to the Law
of sinne: <hi>So that</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7. 19.</note> the good which he would doe,
that he did not, but the evil which he would not doe,
that he did.<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 7. 18</note> To will was present with him, but
how to performe it, that he did not know: <hi>and then
saies,</hi> So in my mind I serve the Law of God, <hi>which is
perfect,</hi> but in my Flesh I serve the Law of sin, <hi>Also
the Apostle John saith,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 7.</note> Let no man deceive you, he
that doth righteousnesse, is righteous: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Paul</hi> again saith,<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8. 14</note> as many as are led by the spirit
of God they are the Sons of God: <hi>and</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6. 16,</note> his servants
ye are to whom ye obey; whether of obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
righteousnesse or of sin unto Death. <hi>Also it is said,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 20.</note> The Soul that sinneth it shall die.<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 24. 26.</note> If a righteous
Man <hi>(which is indeed a perfect Man so long as he is a
servant to righteousnesse)</hi> departeth from his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and doth that which is wicked; in the
wickednesse which he doth he shall die: <hi>and yet that
which is perfect cannot die. And on the other side;</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Ezek: 18. 21 22. 27. 28.</note> If a
wicked Man turne from his wickednesse and doth
the thing which is good and righteous, in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
which he doth, he shall live, saith the
Lord: <hi>Thus, a righteous Man can sin, and a wicked Man
can doe that which is righteous: yet it is the Soul in the
wicked Man that turneth and doth righteousnesse in the
minde, and the will, and the Spirit, and the heart, and
the Life, through Christ in the Soul: And it is the Soul in
the Righteous Man that doth that which is wicked, in the
minde and will, and spirit and heart and life, through the
Power of Sin, corruption, and imperfection, also of the Flesh
<pb facs="tcp:61095:7"/>
or the</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>body of Death, which is this mortal flesh and bloud:
therefore we should</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> not let sinne Reigne in our Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Bodies, that we should obey it in the Lusts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<hi>But we should</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Col. 1. 29.</note> strive after perfection; <hi>that</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note> Christ may be formed <hi>in us: we should</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 23. 26.</note> give God our
Hearts, <hi>and he will clense them for us, &amp; make us</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 14.</note> after his
own heart, <hi>and will make our Hearts desires and minds
pure, and then they are</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cron. 28. 9.</note> perfect; <hi>for nothing that is</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 21. 27</note> Impure, <hi>and so, imperfect,</hi> can enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God. <hi>Thus, in our Minds,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 7. 17.</note> if we do the will
of our Father which is in Heaven, we shall know of
the words of Christ, whether they be of God or no:
<hi>which they that heard them from his owne mouth and did
not so, could not know. But we are not to condemne those
that have not attained to our mesure of Light, Grace, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or Perfection: but to let our</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 5. 16</note> Light so shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Men, that they may see our good works, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
our Father which is in Heaven: <hi>and then they
will say,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 25</note> God is in us of a Truth: <hi>they will be able to
understand it. If we be</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 15. 1,</note> strong, <hi>we should</hi> help those that
are weak <hi>in Light or understanding, and should declare</hi>
the<note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 1. 79.</note> Gospel to those that sit <hi>most</hi> in Darknesse and in
the shadow of Death, and guide one anothers feete
into the way of Peace, <hi>and then we shall be like him who
is in our hearts,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 11. 29.</note> meeke and lowly, and so wee shall

                  </gap>ay though
sinne dwell in our flesh, yet if we let it</hi> not raigne <hi>in our
Mortall or imperfect Bodies, so that we</hi> obey <hi>it</hi> not <hi>in the
Lusts thereof; then the Holy Spirit dwelleth in our minds,
and in our bodies, which are the Temples of the Holy Ghost:
but if we let sin raigne, then our Souls and Bodies are
Denns of Theeves and Murtherers, and the habitations of
all Devills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This for the present is my understanding, which I pray
may be enlightened and helped by the Father of Lights,
from whom is every perfect Gift to my selfe and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
my brethren: who have severall measures of the same
Light, and divers Gifts by the same Spirit: of which I desire
to be made partaker from themselves, and shall highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
my selfe therein, with them.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Ground</hi> to the understanding the things here
mentioned, and of all things contained in the Scriptures,
is exactly described in this Authors writings.</p>
            <p>For, they discover both where the <hi>Things</hi> themselves are
to be found, in which are hidden all Divine and Naturall
Mysteries, and likewise shew, as with the finger, how those
secret things have proceeded to their Being and manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from the infinite <hi>Incomprehensibility,</hi> wherein <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
can be perceived, and yet <hi>All things</hi> have proceeded
from thence; and how they have come to be as they Are; to
the discerning what the Effable Manifested Revealed <hi>God</hi>
is, and all <hi>Creatures</hi> whatsoever: and amongst the rest,
what we <hi>our selves</hi> are, and how we may <hi>attain</hi> the true on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and eternal happiness and blessednesse of <hi>Life everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with and in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61095:8"/>
And can there be anything more usefull beneficiall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and worthy then this?</p>
            <p>Also further by his writings we may come to understand,
how <hi>Christ is the Saviour of</hi> All <hi>Men:</hi> and yet all
will <hi>not</hi> attaine salvation. Though it be confessed, and must
be granted, that Eternal Salvation is attained by some <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi>
also by some innocent ignorant <hi>Persons of yeares,</hi>
that have been born of Hethenish, Jewish, and Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
being such as have served God according to the Law
of their fore-fathers with an upright Conscience: as <hi>Paul</hi>
who was a Jew: and so the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> Servant to <hi>Candace</hi>
Queen of Aethiopia, a stranger; and <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,
and <hi>all others</hi> fearing God, and working Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
<hi>in every Nation,</hi> are accepted of him, though
they know nothing of the Great, and Common Salvation
that hath appeared to all Men; as the Apostles knew it.</p>
            <p>For, if any be cleansed from his Sinnes, it is done by the
blood of JESUS CHRIST
<hi>which clenseth us from all Sinne,</hi> and this is effected
in us and for us, when we knew not, and though we know
not of it, nor <hi>how</hi> it is done, in the least,
to satisfie a Soul that it may undoubtedly be convinced
thereof.</p>
            <p>And indeed, had not the Holy Scripture mentioned this
thing concerning the <hi>Blood of Christ;</hi> it had not been
possible for any Man but such as the Prophets and Apostles
were, to have procured any that are now called Christians
to Believe and Confesse it.</p>
            <p>Neither can any understand this though he <hi>reade</hi> of it
in the Scriptures; but by the Holy Spirit within himselfe,
which proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne <hi>in the
Soul of every one,</hi> and by the word in the Heart, the word
<pb facs="tcp:61095:8"/>
of Faith, which is God and Christ, even that true <hi>[Divine]</hi>
Light which lighteth every one that cometh into the world.</p>
            <p>The same also may be said concerning all those that have
been, are, or shall be saved, though they attain not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the mysteryes <hi>of Salvation,</hi> in <hi>this Life,</hi> as
those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> who wrote the Holy Scriptures, neither can any
understand them as they did, but by the Same Gifts of the
Holy Spirit in the Soul.</p>
            <p>Therefore let <hi>none boast</hi> that he is not born among
those, that are called Heathens, but among those, that were
outwardly called Jewes of old, or Christians now, or of the
Church of Rome, or Protestants or of the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>groape</hi> after

yet he will <hi>certainly</hi> give them unto us at that Day, which
himselfe hath appointed, which will also assuredly come,
though no man knoweth when nor what that day will be or

            <p>Aud indeed such Person's Writings, whose unsterstandings

            <p>And though it be an exceeding happinesse and joy to us
that God hath bestowed so <hi>large understanding</hi> to those
that have written the Scriptures, and therefore we ought

<hi>might have Hope;</hi> And yet but darkly, of purpose that
<hi>some things</hi> should be kept secret from the beginning of
the world, and not revealed till the due time and season in
every Age, and <hi>some not</hi> till this last age which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the manifesting of all mysteries.</p>
            <p>And because this Author could not so deepely and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally
disclose these mysteries, but in such significant
though <hi>hard</hi> Termes of expression as he<note n="*" place="margin">See the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Behmes</hi> clavis, vers. 10. 11.</note> useth; he wrote

Tables, and a Clavis, which are already printed
in English: yet still for all that, they are accompted very
difficult to be understood.</p>
            <p>And I also, who have much and studiously traced his
writings over, have found them difficult, but far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in recompence, the utmost paines that I could possibly
bestow upon them; I find also that the understanding of
them cometh by <hi>Degrees,</hi> and frequent Loving conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
in all the parts and pieces he hath written; and yet
also I must say that this book Aurora hath condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
more to open my mind to the <hi>understanding</hi> of all <hi>his
writings,</hi> and of <hi>all Mysteries,</hi> both Naturall and
Divine, and so consequently of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi>
then any other helps and books which I could ever meete

            <p>Which the Reader will also perceive, by the diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>300. Sheetes</hi> of Paper, which containe all Mysteries in

succinct Termes very <hi>deeply</hi> expressed: but in this, the
<hi>Ground</hi> of those Termes are largely and plainly described
after the manner of the <hi>Infancy</hi> of his high Manifestation
in a Childish way, so that it is a large and most cleere A
B C, being the fitter and plainer for Beginners, with
which his other books may the easier be understood, and is
a summary contents of all his Mysteries, and may serve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a Manuduction, introduction, and key to unlock
all the difficult expressions, in his other Books.</p>
            <p>And that because it explaines the first Ground concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Seaven Properties</hi> of the Eternall Nature,
which here he calleth the <hi>Seaven Qualifying, or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

of God,</hi> in and from and to All Eternity, with Notes
of <hi>Reference</hi> to the Book of the three Principles, and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Life of Man; which are the supply to the want of finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Book, and which he wrote down with his own
hand, in their severall proper places by way of exposition
in a manuscript of <hi>Michael von Enderns,</hi> his own written
Copy being kept from him, by <hi>Gregory Rickter</hi> the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent
at <hi>Gerlitz,</hi> and Published in Print with many
<hi>whole verses Lines</hi> and words left out, printed in high
Dutch, 1634. But these Notes were added by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
in the yeare 1620. and are here inserted, with
Alphabetical marks, in this translation into English,
which is made from a Copy taken from that of his <hi>own
hand</hi> writing, which was kept laid up for 27 yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            </p>
            <p>But the Author was resolved to leave it unfinished to
remaine as an <hi>Eternall remembrance</hi> of the endeavour
to suppresse and quash this Revelation in its first downing:
which will also be manifested at the Last Day, when all
things shall appeare, to be judged whether they be Good or

            <p>These Errata are so many, because, after the Book
was Printed in English, there came over from beyond
Sea a New Copie of the Aurora in High-Dutch print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and compared with that of the Authors own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing:
And so also it was compared here with this
printed Copie in English, wherein most of these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
were found.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Reader is desired to mend his
Book before he reads it, for it will render many of the
Obscure places cleer to be understood.</p>

            <head>J. B. Preface for the Aurora. To the Courteous Reader.</head>
            <p>1.
<hi>COurteous Reader,</hi> I compare the whole <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
Astrologie</hi> and <hi>Theologie,</hi> together with
their Mother; to a goodly Tree, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in a fair Garden of pleasure.</p>
            <p>2. Now the Earth, in which the Tree standeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
sap continually to the tree, whereby the tree hath
its living <hi>Quality:</hi> but the tree in it self groweth from
the <hi>Sap</hi> of the earth, becomes Large, and spreadeth it
self abroad with its branches: And then as the Earth
worketh with its power upon the tree, to make it grow
and encrease; so the Tree also worketh continually with
its <hi>branches</hi> with all its strength, that it might still bear
good fruit abundantly.</p>
            <p>3. But when the Tree beareth few fruit, and those
but small ones neither, shrivelled <hi>rotten</hi> and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten,
the fault doth not lye in the will of the tree, as
if it desired <hi>purposely</hi> to bear evill fruit, because it is a
goodly Tree of good <hi>Quality;</hi> but here lyeth the fault,
because there is often great cold, great heat, mildew,
caterpillars and other worms happen to it: for the
<hi>Quality</hi> in the Deep, from the influence of the Stars,
spoileth it, and that maketh it bear but few good
fruit.</p>
            <p>4. Now the Tree is of this condition, that the bigger
and older it is, the sweeter fruit it beareth: in its youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
years it beareth few fruit, which the crude and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61095:17"/>
wild nature of the ground or earth causeth, and the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous</hi>
moisture in the tree: and though it beareth
many and fair blossoms, yet the most of its Apples fall
off whilest they are growing, which is not so, when it
standeth in a very good soyl or mould. Now this tree
also hath a good sweet quality, but there are <hi>three</hi>
other which are contrary unto it, namely, the bitter,
sowre, and astringent.</p>
            <p>5. And as the Tree is, so will its fruit be, till the
Sun worketh on them and maketh them sweet, so that
they become of a sweet taste, and its fruit must also
<hi>hold out</hi> in rain, wind and tempest.</p>
            <p>6. But when the tree groweth old, that its branches
wither, and the sapp ascendeth <hi>no more,</hi> then below the
stemm or stock there grow many suckers, at last from
the root also twiggs grow, and make the old tree flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
shewing that <hi>it</hi> also was once a green twigg and
young tree, and is now become old. For Nature, or
the sapp, struggleth so long till the Stock groweth
quite dry, and then is to be cut down and burnt in the
fire.</p>
            <p>7. Now observe, what I have signified by this <hi>simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude:</hi>
the Garden of this tree signifieth the <hi>World;</hi> the
soyl or mould signifieth <hi>Nature,</hi> the Stock of the tree
sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifies the <hi>Starres,</hi> by the <hi>Branches</hi> are meant the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
the fruit which grow on this tree signifie <hi>Men,</hi>
the sapp in the tree resembles the pure <hi>Deitie.</hi> Now
Men were made out of Nature the <hi>Starrs</hi> and <hi>Elements,</hi>
but God the Creator raigneth in all: even as the <hi>sapp</hi>
doth in the whole tree.</p>
            <p>8. But there are <hi>two Qualities in Nature,</hi> even untill
the <hi>Judgment</hi> of God: the One is pleasant, heavenly
and holy, the other is fierce, wrathfull, hellish and
thirsty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61095:17"/>
9. Now the good one qualifieth and worketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
with all industry, to bring forth <hi>good</hi> fruit,
and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> raigneth therein, and affords there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
sapp and life: the bad one Springeth and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
with all its endeavour to bring forth <hi>bad</hi> fruit
continually, to which the devil affordeth sap and <hi>hellish</hi>
flame. Now both are in the tree of Nature, and <hi>Men</hi>
are made out of <hi>that</hi> tree, and live in this world, in
this garden, <hi>betwixt</hi> both, in great danger; suddenly
the Sun shineth on them; by and by, winds, rain and
snow, fall on them</p>
            <p>10. That is, if man elevateth his Spirit into the <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
then the Holy Ghost moveth springeth and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
in him: but if he permit his spirit to sink into the
world, in lust towards <hi>evil,</hi> then the Devil and hellish
sapp stirreth and raigneth in him.</p>
            <p>11. Even as the Apple on the tree becometh corrupt
rotten and worm-eaten, when frost, heat, and mill-dew
fall on it, and easily falls off and perisheth: so doth
Man also when he suffers the Devill to rule in him
with his <hi>poyson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. Now as in Nature there is, springeth, and
raigneth, good and bad; even so in Man: but Man, is
the <hi>Child of God,</hi> whom he hath made out of the best
Kernel of Nature, to raign in the good, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the bad: though evill sticketh unto him, even as
in <hi>Nature</hi> the evill hangeth on the good, yet he can
overcome the evil, if he elevateth his spirit in God; for
then the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> stirs and moveth in him, and helps
him to overcome.</p>
            <p>13. As the good quality in Nature is potent, to
overcome the evill, for it is and cometh from God, and
the Holy Ghost is the <hi>Ruler</hi> therein: even so is the fierce
wrathful Quality, powerful to overcome in a <hi>malicious</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61095:18"/>
wicked soul: for the Devil is a potent <hi>Ruler</hi> in the
wrath or fierceness, and is an eternal Prince of the same.</p>
            <p>14. But Man hath cast himself into fierce wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
through the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> so that the
evill hangeth on him; otherwise, his moving and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
would be <hi>only</hi> to the good. But now it is in <hi>both,</hi>
and it is as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>know ye not, that to whom
you yield your selves servants in obedience, his servants ye
are, to whom ye obey, either to sinne unto death, or to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of God unto righteousness,</hi> Rom. 6. 16.</p>
            <p>15. But because man hath an <hi>impulse</hi> or inclination
to both, he may lay hold on which he pleaseth; for
he liveth in this World betwixt <hi>both,</hi> and both <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
the good and the bad are in him, in which soever
man moveth, with that he is indued, either with a
Holy or a Hellish Power. For Christ saith, <hi>My Father
will give the Holy Ghost to those that ask him,</hi> Luk. 11.
13.</p>
            <p>16. Besides, God commanded man to do good, and
did forbid him to do evill; and now doth daily call
and preach, and exhort man unto good; Whereby we
see, well enough, that God <hi>willeth not evil,</hi> but his
Will is, That <hi>His Kingdom</hi> should <hi>come,</hi> and <hi>his Will be
done, on earth as it is in heaven.</hi> Now since man is poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
through sinne, that the fierce wrathful quality,
as well as the good, reigneth in him, and is now <hi>half</hi>
dead, and in his grosse ignorance can no more know
God his Creator, nor Nature and its operation; yet
hath Nature done its <hi>best</hi> endeavour from the beginning
till now, to which God hath given his Holy Ghost, so
that it hath at all times generated wise, sholy and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
men, which did learn to know Nature and
their Creator, who alwayes in their Writings and
Teachings have been <hi>a Light</hi> to the World, whereby
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61095:18"/>
God hath raised his Church on Earth, to his eternal
praise. Against which the Devil hath <hi>raged,</hi> and spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
many a noble Twigg, through the wrathfull fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Nature, whose <hi>Prince</hi> and God he is.</p>
            <p>17. For Nature hath many times prepared and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a learned judicious man with good gifts, and
then the Devil hath done his utmost to seduce that
man, and bring him into <hi>carnal pleasures,</hi> to pride, to a
desire to be rich, and to be in authority and power.
Thereby the Devil hath ruled in him, and the fierce
wrathfull <hi>Quality</hi> hath overcome the good; his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
his Knowledge and Wisdome hath been
turn'd into <hi>Heresie</hi> and Errour, who hath made a mock
of the Truth, and been the Author of great Errours on
earth, and a good Leader of the Devils Host.</p>
            <p>18. For the bad quality in Nature hath wrestled,
and doth still wrestle with the good, ever since the
beginning, and hath elevated it self, and spoiled many
a noble fruit even in the mothers <hi>Womb,</hi> as it plainly
appeareth, first by <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> which came from
one womb. <hi>Cain</hi> was from his mothers womb a despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of God, and proud; but <hi>Abel,</hi> on the contrary, was
an humble man, and one that feared God.</p>
            <p>19. The same is seen also in the <hi>three</hi> sons of <hi>Noah;</hi>
as also by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s sons <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ismael,</hi> especially
by <hi>Isaac's</hi> in <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which struggled and
wrestled even in the mothers womb: therefore said
God, <hi>Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated,</hi> Gen. 25.
which is nothing else, but that both qualities in Nature
have vehemently wrestled one with another.</p>
            <p>20. For when God at that time moved in Nature,
and would <hi>reveal</hi> himself unto the world through righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<hi>Abraham Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and would raise a
Church to himself on earth for his glory, then in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61095:19"/>
Malice also moved, and its Prince <hi>Lucifer.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g
there was good and bad in man, therefore both
<hi>Qualities</hi> could raign in him, and therefore there was
born at <hi>once</hi> in one womb an evill and a good Man.</p>
            <p>21. Also it is cleerly seen by the <hi>first</hi> world, as also
by the <hi>second,</hi> even unto the end of our time, how the
Heavenly and Hellish Kingdom in Nature hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
wrestled one with another, and stood in great
travel, even as a woman in the birth. This doth most
cleerly appear by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> For there grew up
a tree in Paradise of both <hi>Qualities</hi> of good and bad,
wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were to be tempted, to try
whether they would hold out in the <hi>good Quality</hi> in
the Angelicall nature and form. For the <hi>Creator did
forbid</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>to eat of the fruit:</hi> but the evill
quality in Nature did wrestle with the good, and
brought <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> into a lust and longing to eat
of both. Thereupon they presently became of a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
form and nature, and did eat of good and bad, and
must increase and live in a <hi>beastial</hi> manner, and so many
a noble twigg begotten or born of them perished.</p>
            <p>22. Afterward it is seen, how God did work in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when the Holy Fathers in the first world were
born: as <hi>Abel, Seth, Enos, Kenan, Mahaleel, Jared, Henoch,
Methusalah, Lamech,</hi> and Holy <hi>Noah.</hi> These made the
Name of the Lord known to the world, and preached
<hi>Repentance:</hi> for the Holy Ghost wrought <hi>in</hi> them</p>
            <p>23. On the contrary, the Hellish God also wrought
against it, <hi>in</hi> Nature, and begot Mockers and Despisers,
first <hi>Cain</hi> and his Posterity: and it was with the first
world as with a young tree, which groweth, is green,
blossometh fairly, but bringeth little good fruit, by
reason of its <hi>wild</hi> Nature. So Nature in the first world
brought forth but little good fruit, though it blossomed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61095:19"/>
fair in <hi>wordly</hi> knowledge and luxury or wantonesse,
<hi>which</hi> could not apprehend the Holy Spirit, who
wrought in Nature then, as well as now.</p>
            <p>24. Therefore said God, <hi>It repents me, that I have
made man,</hi> Gen. 6. 6. and he stirred up Nature so, that
all flesh dyed, which lived on dry Land, excepting the
root and stock, that remained in vertue: and so he
hath hereby <hi>Dung'd</hi> the wild Tree, and manured it,
that it should bear <hi>better</hi> fruit. But when the same
sprung up again, it brought forth also good and bad
fruit again; Among the sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> there were found
again Mockers and Despisers of God, and there <hi>hardly</hi>
grew any good branch on the tree, which brought forth
any <hi>holy</hi> and good fruit: the other branches were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
also, and brought forth wild Heathens.</p>
            <p>25. But when God saw, that man was thus dead in
his Knowledge, He moved Nature again, and <hi>shewed</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>man,</hi> how there was <hi>good and bad</hi> therein, that they
should <hi>avoid evill,</hi> and <hi>live unto the good;</hi> and he caused
fire to fall down out of Nature, and fired <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morah,</hi>
for a terrible example to the world. But when the
blindnesse of men grew predominant, and refused to be
taught by the Spirit of God, he gave <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi>
unto them, shewing how they should behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and confirmed them with <hi>wonders</hi> and Signs, lest
the knowledge of the true God should be quite extinct.
But for all this, the light did <hi>not</hi> manifest it self, for the
darkness and wrathful fierceness in Nature struggled
against it, and the Prince thereof ruled powerfully.</p>
            <p>26. But when the Tree of Nature came to its middle
age, then it began to bear some <hi>mild</hi> and sweet fruit,
to shew, that it would henceforth bear pleasant
fruit. Then were born, the <hi>Holy Prophets,</hi> out of the
sweet branch of the tree, which taught and preached
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61095:20"/>
of the <hi>light,</hi> which hereafter should overcome the
wrathful fierceness in Nature. And then there arose a
light in Nature among the Heathens, so that they knew
Nature, &amp; her operation, although this was <hi>only a</hi> light
in the <hi>wild</hi> Nature, and was not yet the <hi>holy</hi> light.</p>
            <p>27. For the wild Nature was not yet overcome, and
light and darknesse wrestled so long one with another,
till the <hi>Sun</hi> arose, &amp; forced this tree with its heat, so that
it did bear pleasant sweet fruit: that is, till there came
the Prince of Light out of the heart of God, and <hi>became
Man</hi> in Nature, and wrestled in his humane body in the
power of the Divine light in the wild Nature. That
same Prince and <hi>Royal</hi> twigg grew up in Nature, and
became a tree in Nature, and spread its branches abroad
from the East to the West, and encompassed the whole
Nature, and wrestled and fought with the fierce wrath
which was in Nature, and with the Prince thereof, till
he overcame and triumphed as a King in Nature, and
took the <hi>Prince of wrath</hi> or fiercenesse, <hi>Captive</hi> in his
own house, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.</p>
            <p>28. This being done, there grew out of the Royal
Tree, which was grown in Nature many thousand <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi>
of precious sweet twigs, all which had the scent
and taste of that precious Tree. Though there fell
upon them, rain, snow, hayl and tempestuous storms,
so that many a twigg was <hi>torn</hi> and beaten off from the
tree, yet still others grew in their places. For the
Wrath or fiercenesse in Nature, and the Prince thereof,
raised great <hi>tempests,</hi> with hayl, thundring, lightning
and rain, so that many glorious twiggs were torn from
the sweet and good Tree.</p>
            <p>29. But these twiggs were of such a pleasant sweet
and curious taste, that no humane nor Angelical tongue
is able to expresse it: for there was great <hi>power</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61095:20"/>
vertue in them, they were good to <hi>heal</hi> the wild Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.
Whatever Heathen did eat of the twigg of
this tree, he was <hi>delivered</hi> from his wild nature, in
which he was born, and became a sweet tree in this
pretious Tree, and sprung up in that tree, and did bear
pretious fruit, like the Royal tree. Therefore many
Heathens <hi>resorted</hi> to the pretious tree, where the
pretious twiggs lay, which the Prince of darknesse by
his storms and tempestuous winds had torn off; and
whatever Heathen did smell to the twigg so torn off,
he was healed of his wild wrath or fiercenesse, which
he had brought from his Mother into the world.</p>
            <p>30. But when the Prince of darknesse did see, that
the Heathens <hi>strove</hi> and contended about these <hi>twiggs,</hi>
and not about the <hi>Tree,</hi> therein he found great losse and
dammage, and then he ceased with his storms toward
the East and South, and placed a Merchant under the
tree, who gathered up the twiggs, which were fallen
from the pretious tree: and then when the Heathens
came, and enquired after the good and vertuous twigs,
then the Merchant presented and offered them, for
money, to make gain of the pretious <hi>Tree.</hi> For, this,
the Prince of wrath or fierceness required at the hands
of his Merchant, because the tree was grown upon his
ground and land, and spoyled his soyl.</p>
            <p>31. And so when the <hi>Heathens</hi> did see, that the fruit
of the pretious tree was put to <hi>sale,</hi> they flock'd to the
Merchant, and bought of the <hi>fruit</hi> of the tree, and they
came also from forraign Islands to buy, even from the
Ends of the world. Now when the Merchant saw,
that his Wares were in request and esteem, he plotted,
how he might gather a great treasure to his <hi>Master,</hi> and
so sent <hi>Factors</hi> abroad, every where, to offer his Wares
to sell, praising them highly: but he <hi>sophisticated</hi> the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61095:21"/>
wares, and sold other fruit instead of the good, which
were not grown on the good Tree; this he did to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his Masters treasure.</p>
            <p>32. But the Heathens and all the Islands and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which dwelt on the earth, were all grown on the
<hi>wild</hi> tree, which was good and bad: and therefore were
half blind, and did not discern the good tree, (which
however did spread its branches from the East to the
West,) else they would <hi>not</hi> have bought of the <hi>false</hi>
wares.</p>
            <p>33. But because they knew not the pretious Tree,
which spread its branches over them all; <hi>all of them
ran after, and to, the Factors,</hi> and bought of them <hi>mix'd</hi>
false wares instead of good; and supposed they served
for health: but because <hi>all</hi> of them did <hi>long</hi> after the
good tree, which however moved over them all, many
of them were healed, because of their great desire they
had to the Tree. For the fragrancy of the tree, which
moved over them, healed them of their wrath or fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and <hi>wild</hi> nature, and not, the false wares, of the
Factors: this continued a long time.</p>
            <p>34. Now when the Prince in the darknesse, who is
the Source of wrath or fierceness, malice and perdition,
<hi>perceived,</hi> that men were healed of their poison and
wild nature by the fragrancy of the pretious Tree, he
was enraged, and planted a wild tree toward the North,
which sprung up and grew in the fiercenesse or wrath
of Nature, and made proclamation, saying: <hi>This is the
Tree of Life, he that eateth of it, shall be healed and live
eternally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>35. For in that place, where the wild tree grew,
was a wild place, and the people there had the true
light of God from the beginning even unto that time,
and to this day, though unknown: and the tree grew
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61095:21"/>
on the Mount <hi>Hagar</hi> in the house of <hi>Ismael</hi> the mocker.
But when Proclamation was made of the tree, <hi>Behold
this is the tree of life!</hi> then the wild people <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ocked</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the tree, which were <hi>not</hi> born of God, but of the
wild Nature, and <hi>loved</hi> the wild tree, and did eat of
its fruit.</p>
            <p>36. And the tree grew to a mighty bignesse, by the
sap of <hi>wrath</hi> or fiercenesse in Nature, and spread abroad
its branches, from the North to the East and West:
but the tree had its source and Root from the wild
Nature, which was good and bad, and as the tree was,
so were its fruits. But though the men of this place
were grown out of the wild Nature, yet the tree grew
over them all, and grew so huge, that it reach't with
its branches even unto the Esteemed <hi>pretious Land</hi> or
Country under the Holy Tree.</p>
            <p>37. But the cause, that the wild tree grew to such a
huge bignesse, was, because the Nations under the
good Tree ran all after the <hi>Factors,</hi> which sold the
<hi>false</hi> Wares, and did eat of the false fruits, which
were good and bad, and supposed they were healed
thereby, and medled <hi>not</hi> with the holy good effectuall
Tree.</p>
            <p>38. In the mean while they grew more blind, weak
and faint, and were <hi>disabled</hi> to suppresse the growing
of the wild tree toward the North: for they were too
weak and faint, and they saw well enough, that the
tree was wild and naught, but they wanted strength,
and could not suppresse the growing of the tree.</p>
            <p>39. Yet if they had not run after the false Wares
those Factors <hi>sold,</hi> and had not eaten of the <hi>false</hi> fruits,
but rather eaten of the pretious tree, then they might
have gotten strength to oppose the wild tree. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they ran a whoring after the wild Nature in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61095:22"/>
Humane <hi>conceits</hi> and opinions, in the lusts of their
hearts, in a hypocritical way, therefore the wild Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did predominate over them, and the wild tree
grew high and large over them, and spoiled them with
its wild <hi>ranknesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40. For, the Prince of Wrath or fierceness, in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
gave his power to the tree, to spoil men, which
did eat of the wild fruits of the Factors: Because they
forsook the Tree of life, and sought after their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
as Mother <hi>Eve</hi> did in Paradise, therefore their own
<hi>innate quality</hi> predominated in them, <hi>and brought them
into strong delusions,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>2 Thes.</hi> 2. 11. And
the Prince of Wrath or fiercenesse, did raise <hi>Warrs</hi> and
tempests from the wild tree toward the North against
the people and Nations, which were <hi>not</hi> born of the
wild tree, and the tempest which came from the wild
tree overthrew them in their weaknesse and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>41. And the <hi>Merchant</hi> under the good Tree dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the Nations of the South and West, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the North, and commended his Wares hugely,
and deceived cunningly the simple ones; and those that
were witty, he made them his Factors, that they also
might have their <hi>livelihood</hi> or livings out of it, and he
brought it so far, that no body did see or know the holy
tree any more, and so he got all the Land to himself,
and then made Proclamation, <hi>2 Thess. 2. I am the stock
of the good tree, and stand on the root of the good tree, and
am ingrafted into the Tree of Life, buy my Wares which I
sell:</hi> and then you shall be <hi>healed</hi> of your wild birth,
and live for ever.</p>
            <p>42. I am grown out of the root of the good Tree,
and the fruit of the holy tree is in my power, and I sit
on the <hi>Throne</hi> of the divine power, I have power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61095:22"/>
and on earth, <hi>Come unto me,</hi> and buy for money, the
fruit of life.</p>
            <p>43. Whereupon all Nations flocked unto him, and
did buy and eat, even till they fainted: all the Kings
of the South, West, and toward the North did eat the
fruits of the <hi>Factor,</hi> and lived under a great faintnesse;
for the wild tree of the North grew more and more over
them, and made <hi>waste</hi> of them a long time. And there
was a miserable time upon earth, such as never was,
since the world stood, but men thought that time to be
<hi>good;</hi> so terribly the Merchant under the good tree, had
<hi>blinded</hi> them.</p>
            <p>44. But in the <hi>Evening</hi> God in his mercy took <hi>pity</hi> on
mans misery and blindnesse, and stirr'd up the good tree
again, even that glorious <hi>Divine</hi> Tree, which did bear
the fruit of life; then there grew a twigg <hi>nigh</hi> unto the
root, out of that pretious tree, and was green, and to it
was given the <hi>sap</hi> and spirit of the tree, and it spoke with
the tongue of Man, and <hi>shewed</hi> to every one the pretious
tree, and its voice was heard in many Countreys.</p>
            <p>45. And then men resorted thither to see and to hear
what the matter was, and there was shewed unto them
the pretious and vigorous Tree of Life, of which men
had eaten at the beginning, and were <hi>delivered</hi> of their
wild nature, and they were mightily rejoyced, and did
eat of the Tree of life with great joy, and refreshing,
and so got new strength from the Tree of life, and sung
a new song concerning the <hi>true real Tree of Life,</hi> and so
were delivered from their wild birth, and then hated
the Merchant and his Factors, as also their false
Wares.</p>
            <p>46. But all those came, which did hunger and thirst
after the Tree of life, and those that sate in the <hi>Dust,</hi> and
they did eat of the holy Tree, and were healed of their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61095:23"/>
               <hi>impure</hi> birth and wrath or fierceness of Nature, in which
they lived, and so were <hi>ingrafted</hi> into the Tree of life.
But onely the Factors of the Merchant, and his and
their Dissemblers, and those that made their gains
with false wares, and had gathered Treasure together,
<hi>came not,</hi> for they were drown'd and quite dead in the
gain of the Merchants whoredom, and lived in the
wild nature, and so their anguish and shame, which was
discovered, <hi>kept</hi> them back, because they went a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
so long with the Merchant, and seduced the soules
of men, notwithstanding they gloried, that they were
ingrafted into the tree of life, and lived in sanctity by
a divine power, and set to sale the fruit of life.</p>
            <p>47. Now because their shame, deceit, covetousness,
knavery and wickednesse was discovered, they waxed
dumb, and stayed behind, they were ashamed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of their abominations and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and so went
with the hungry and thirsty to the Fountain of Eternal
life; and therefore they grew faint also in their thirst,
and their plague riseth up from eternity to eternity, and
they are gnawed in their conscience.</p>
            <p>48. Now the Merchant seeing that the deceit of his
false Wares was <hi>discovered,</hi> he grew very worth, and
despaired; and bent his Bow against the holy people,
which would buy no more of his Wares, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
many of the <hi>holy</hi> people, and blasphemed the
<hi>Green-twigg, which was grown up out of the Tree of life.</hi>
But the <hi>Great Prince MICHAEL</hi> which <hi>standeth before
God,</hi> came and fought for the Holy people, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came.</p>
            <p>49. But the prince of darknesse perceiving, that his
Merchant had a Fall, and that his deceit was discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he raised a <hi>tempest</hi> from the North out of the wild
Tree against the holy people, and the Merchant of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61095:23"/>
South made an assault upon <hi>them:</hi> then the Holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
grew hugely in their Blossom, even as it was in the
beginning, when the holy and pretious tree grew, and
that overcame the wrath or fiercenesse in Nature and
its Prince; thus it was at that time.</p>
            <p>50. Now, when the noble and holy Tree was revealed
to <hi>all</hi> Nations, so that they saw how it moved over them,
and spread its fragrancy over all people, and that any
one that pleased, might eat of it; then the people grew
weary of eating its <hi>fruit,</hi> which grew on the tree, and
long'd to eat of the <hi>Root</hi> of the Tree; and the cunning
and wise people sought after the <hi>Root,</hi> and contended
about the same: so the strife was great about the root
of the tree, insomuch, that they <hi>forgot</hi> to eat of the
fruit of the sweet tree, by reason of the <hi>controversie</hi> about
the root of the tree.</p>
            <p>51. And now they minded <hi>neither</hi> the Root nor the
Tree, but the prince of darknesse had another design,
intending something else: when he saw, that they
would eat no more of the good Tree, but contended
about the Root, he perceived, that they were grown
<hi>very weak</hi> and faint, and that the wild Nature predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in them again;</p>
            <p>52. And therefore he stirred them up to pride, so that
every one supposed, he had the Root at hand, every one
must look after and hear him, and reverence him:
Whereby they built their Palaces and great Houses,
and served in secrecie their Idol <hi>Mammon,</hi> whereby
the Lay people were troubled and caused to offend, and
so lived in carnal pleasures, in the desire of the <hi>wild</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and served their belly in wantonnesse, confiding
in the fruit of the tree, which moved over them all,
though they fell into misery, that <hi>thereby</hi> they might be
<hi>healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61095:24"/>
53. And in the mean while they served the prince
of darknesse according to the impulse of the wild na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the pretious tree stood there onely for a May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game
or mocking stock, and many lived like <hi>wild beasts,</hi>
and did lead a wicked life, in Pride, Pomp, Stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and Lasciviousnesse, the rich consuming the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and sweat of the poor, forcing them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>54. All evill actions were approved of for Bribery:
the <hi>Lawes</hi> issued forth out of the <hi>evill</hi> in Nature, and
every one strove after <hi>riches</hi> and goods, after pride,
pomp and statelinesse, there was <hi>no</hi> deliverer for the
poor; scolding, railing, cursing, and swearing were <hi>not</hi>
disapproved nor held vitious, and so they defiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the wrathful or fierce <hi>Quality,</hi> even as a swine
tumbleth in the dirt and Mire.</p>
            <p>55. This did the Shepherds with the sheep, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
no more but the bare <hi>name</hi> of the noble tree, its
fruit, vertue and life was only a cover to their <hi>Sins.</hi> Thus
the world lived at that time, saving a small remnant or
number, which were generated in the midst among the
Thorns in great <hi>tribulation</hi> and contempt, out of all
Nations upon the Earth, from the East to the West.</p>
            <p>56. There was no difference, they all lived upon
the impulse of the wild nature in <hi>faintnesse,</hi> even unto
a little number, which were delivered out of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as it was before the <hi>Deluge,</hi> and before the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the noble tree in Nature; and thus it was also
at that time.</p>
            <p>57. But why men in the end, did long so eagerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Root</hi> of the tree, is a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and hitherto it
was concealed from the wise and prudent; neither
will it rise up to the height, but in the Deep, in great
simplicity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61095:24"/>
58. As indeed the noble tree with its kernel and
heart, hath <hi>alwayes</hi> been concealed from the worldly
wise: though they supposed they stood some at the root,
and some at the very Top of the tree, yet this was no
more then a shining Mist before their eyes.</p>
            <p>59. But the noble tree from the beginning till now
strove in Nature to its utmost, that it might be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to <hi>all people</hi> Tongues and Languages, against which
the Devil in the wild nature raged, and fought like a
fierce Lyon.</p>
            <p>60. But the noble tree bore the more and the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fruit, and revealed it self more and more against
all the fury and madnesse of the Devill, even unto the
end; and <hi>then it was light. For there grew a green twigg at
the Root of the noble Tree,</hi> which gat the sap and life of the
root, to which was given the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Tree; so it
encreased and multiplyed the noble tree in its glorious
vertue and power, and nature also, in which it
grew.</p>
            <p>61. Now when this was done, then <hi>both the Gates</hi>
of Nature were opened, the knowledge of the <hi>two
Qualities</hi> of good and bad, and so the <hi>Heavenly Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
was manifested, and the <hi>Kingdom of Hell</hi> also, to
all men upon Earth. And the Light and voice was
heard in the <hi>four Winds,</hi> and the false Merchant in the
South was quite revealed, and his <hi>own</hi> hated him, and
rooted him out from the whole earth.</p>
            <p>62. This being done, the wild tree toward the
North <hi>withered,</hi> and all people beheld the holy tree,
even in <hi>forraign</hi> Islands, with admiration. And the
Prince in the darknesse was revealed, and his Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were discovered, and his shame, ignominy and
perdition, the men upon earth did <hi>see</hi> and <hi>know,</hi> for it
was <hi>Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61095:25"/>
63. And this lasted but a little time, for men forsook
that light, and lived in carnal pleasures to their own
perdition: for as the gate of light had opened it self,
so did also the gate of darknesse, and from them both
went forth all manner of powers and Arts, that were
therein.</p>
            <p>64. For as men had lived from the beginning in the
growth of the wild nature, and hunted only after earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things; so in the end, things were not mended but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worse.</p>
            <p>65. In the middle of this time were raised many
great stormy winds from the West toward the East
and North: but from the North there went forth a
great <hi>stream of water</hi> toward the holy tree, and in the
<hi>midst</hi> of the stream it was light, and so the wild tree
toward the North withered.</p>
            <p>66. And then the Prince in the darknesse was enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the great motion of Nature. For the <hi>Holy Tree</hi>
moved in Nature, as one that would by and by be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,
and kindled, in the <hi>glorification</hi> of the holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Majestie,</hi> and cast the wrath or fiercenesse from it,
which had so long stood against it, and had wrestled
with it.</p>
            <p>67. In like manner, the tree of darknesse wrath
fiercenesse and perdition, moved furiously, as one that
would be kindled by and by, and therein the Prince
with his <hi>Legions</hi> went forth to spoyl the noble fruit of
the good tree.</p>
            <p>68. And it stood horribly in Nature in the fierce
quality, in that quality, wherein the prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
dwelt, to speak after the manner of men; even as
when men see terrible weather coming on, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a horrible appearance with lightening and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous
winds, at which men stand amazed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61095:25"/>
69. On the other side in the good quality, in which
the <hi>holy tree of life</hi> stood, all was pleasant sweet and
delightful; like an heavenly joyfulness. These two
moved furiously one against another, till the whole
nature was kindled of both qualities in one moment.</p>
            <p>70. And the tree of life was kindled in its own qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
by the fire of the <hi>Holy</hi> Ghost, and its quality burnt
in the fire of heavenly joyfulness, in an unsearchable
light and glory.</p>
            <p>71. All <hi>voyces,</hi> of the heavenly joyfulnesse qualified
mixed or harmonized in this fire, which have been
from eternitie in the good qualitie; and the Light of
the holy Trinity <hi>shined</hi> into the tree of life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
or filled the whole quality, in which it
stood.</p>
            <p>72. And the tree of the fierce quality which is the
other part in Nature, was kindled also and burnt in the
fire of <hi>Gods wrath</hi> in a hellish flame, and the fierce
source rose up into eternity, and the Prince of darknesse
with his Legions did abide in the fierce wrathfull qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as in his own Kingdom.</p>
            <p>73. In this fire were consumed, the <hi>Earth, Starres</hi>
and <hi>Elements,</hi> for all were on fire at once, each in the
fire of its own quality, and all was separable. For the
Ancient of Dayes moved himself in it, wherein every
power and all the Creatures, and whatsoever can be
<hi>named,</hi> even the powers of Heaven, of the Stars and
of the Elements, became thin again, and fashioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that form, which they were in from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Creation.</p>
            <p>74. Only the <hi>two qualities,</hi> good and bad, which have
been in Nature one in another, were separated, and
the bad one, was given to the prince of malice and
wrath or fiercenesse for an eternal habitation; and that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61095:26"/>
is called <hi>Hell,</hi> or a <hi>Rejection,</hi> which in eternity, no more
apprehends or toucheth the good quality; but is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion
of all good, and that unto its eternity.</p>
            <p>75. In the other quality stood the Tree of eternal
Life, and its source and off-spring descended from the
holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the Holy Ghost did shine into the
same. And all men came forth which descended from
the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the first man, Each in its
vertue, and in that quality, in which each did grow
on earth.</p>
            <p>76. Those that on earth had eaten of the good Tree,
which is called <hi>JESUS CHRIST, in them</hi> did dwell the
<hi>Mercy</hi> of God unto eternal joy; they had in them the
power of the good quality, they were received into the
good and holy quality, and they sung the Song of their
<hi>Bridegroom,</hi> each in his voyce according to his own
Holinesse.</p>
            <p>77. But those that were born in the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi>
and of the Holy Ghost, and on earth never <hi>fully</hi> knew
the Tree of Life, but were grown in its power, which
overshadowed all men upon earth, as very many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Heathens and Babes, which were also received
into the same power wherein they were grown, and
wherewith their spirit was cloathed, and they sung
the song according to their power and measure in the
noble tree of eternal life, for every one was glorified
according to his power vertue measure and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>78. And the Holy Nature Generated joyfull hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
fruit, even as on earth it had generated fruit in
both the Qualities, which were both good and bad,
so now it did generate heavenly fulnesse of Joy.</p>
            <p>79. And those men, that were now like Angels did
each eat the fruit of his <hi>Quality,</hi> and they sung the song
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61095:26"/>
of God, and the song of <hi>the Tree</hi> of eternal <hi>life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>80. And that was in the Father as a holy Sceane, a
triumphing joy; for to that end all things at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
were made out of the Father, and now they
abide so to all eternity.</p>
            <p>81. But those that were grown on earth in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>the tree of wrath,</hi> that is, which the fierce quality
had overcome, and were withered in the wickednesse
of their spirit, in their <hi>Sins,</hi> all those came forth also
each in his power or faculty, and were received into
<hi>the Kingdom of Darknesse,</hi> and each was indued in that
power, in which he was grown up, and their King is
call'd <hi>Lucifer,</hi> viz. one expell'd or driven forth from
the Light.</p>
            <p>82. And the hellish quality brought forth fruit also,
as it had done upon earth, onely the good was severed
or parted from it, and therefore it brought forth fruit
now in its <hi>own</hi> quality. And these Men also, which
were now like the spirits, did each eat the fruit of his
quality, and so did the Devils also.</p>
            <p>83. For as there is a difference in men upon earth in
their qualities, and all are not of one Quality Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Disposition, even so among the rejected repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
spirits, and so in the heavenly pomp in Angels
and Men, and that lasteth unto its eternity. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>84.
<hi>Courteous Reader,</hi> This is a short information concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>two Qualities</hi> in Nature from the beginning to
the end, how there arose from thence <hi>two Kingdoms,</hi> a
heavenly and a hellish, and how they stirre in this
time and strive one against another, and what the issue
of it will be in the time to come.</p>

The Supream Title is,</p>
               <q>AVRORA.</q>
               <p>That is,
The Dawning of the Day in the East:
or
Morning-Rednesse in the Rising
of the
SVN.</p>
               <p>And is a secret Mystery concealed from the wise and
prudent of this world, which themselves shall shortly
be sensible of: but to those, which read this book in <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenesse</hi>
of heart, with a desire after the holy Spirit, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61095:29"/>
place their hope <hi>onely</hi> in God, it will <hi>not</hi> be a hidden se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
but a manifest knowledge.</p>
               <p>7. I will not explain this Title, but commit it to
the judgment of the <hi>impartial</hi> Reader, who wrestleth
in the good quality of this world.</p>
               <p>8. Now if Mr. Critick, which qualifieth or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with his wit in the fierce quality, gets <hi>this book</hi> into
his hand, he will oppose it, as there is alwayes stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and Opposition between the Kingdom of Heaven
and the Kingdom of Hell.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. First he will say, that I ascend <hi>too high</hi> into
the Deity, which is not a meet thing for
me to do.</item>
                  <item>II. Then Secondly, he will say, that I boast of
the Holy Spirit: I had more need to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
and make demonstration of it by
wondrous Works or Miracles.</item>
                  <item>III. Thirdly he will say; that I am not learned
<hi>enough.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IIII. Fourthly he will say; that I do it in a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
way.</item>
                  <item>V. Fifthly he will be much offended at the <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi>
of the Author: as it is usual in the
world, to gaze onely upon <hi>high</hi> things, and
simplenesse is a scandal and offence unto it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>9.
To these partial worldly Criticks, I set in opposition
the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the first world, which were mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
Men, against whom the world and the Devil ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as in the time of <hi>Henoch,</hi> when the holy Fathers
preached powerfully of the name of the Lord, they did
not ascend with their Bodies into Heaven, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
all with their <hi>Eyes,</hi> Only the Holy Ghost revealed
himself in <hi>their Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61095:29"/>
10. Afterward it is seen in the next world among
the holy Patriarchs and <hi>Prophets,</hi> all which were mean
simple Men, and some of them were <hi>Herds-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. Also when the <hi>MESSIAS CHRIST</hi> the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
in the Battle in Nature, assumed the humanity,
though hee was the King and Prince of Men, yet he
kept himselfe in this world in a low estate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and was a <hi>Stranger</hi> to the world. And all his
<hi>Apostles</hi> were poor despised Fisher-men.</p>
               <p>12. <hi>Nay Christ himselfe returneth</hi> thanks to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father, that he hath concealed it from the worldly wise
men, and revealed the same to Babes. Math. 11.</p>
               <p>13. Besides it is seen, how they also were <hi>poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
having both the impulses of good and of bad, in
Nature. And yet they reproved and preached against
the Sinnes of the world, yea against their own Sins,
which they did by the impulse of the holy Spirit, and
not in vain glory.</p>
               <p>14. Neither had they any Ability from their own
strength and power, to teach of Gods Mysteries in that
kind, but all was by the impulse of God.</p>
               <p>15. So I can say nothing of my self neither, nor
boast or write of any thing, save this, that I am a <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
man, and besides a <hi>poore sinner,</hi> and have need to
pray daily; <hi>Lord, forgive us our sins,</hi> and say with the
Apostle: <hi>O Lord, thou hast redeemed us with thy Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. Neither did I ascend into heaven, and behold
all the works and creatures of God; but the same hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is <hi>revealed</hi> in my spirit, so that I know in the spirit
the works and creatures of God.</p>
               <p>17. And besides, the will to that, is not my natural
will, but it is the <hi>impulse</hi> of the Spirit: and I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
many an assault of the Devil for it.</p>
               <p>18. But the spirit of man is descended not only
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61095:30"/>
from the Starrs and Elements, but there is hid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
a spark of the light and power of God.</p>
               <p>19. It is <hi>not</hi> an empty Word, which is set
down in <hi>Genesis, the 1. ch. v. 27. God created man in his
own Image, in the Image of God created hee him.</hi> First it
hath this sence and meaning <hi>viz.</hi> that he is created
out of the <hi>whole Being</hi> of the Deitie.</p>
               <p>20. The <hi>Body</hi> is from the Elements, therefore it
must have Elemental food.</p>
               <p>21. The <hi>Soule</hi> hath its Original, not only from
the Body, though it be in the Body, and hath irs first
beginning in the Body; yet it hath its source also from
without in it, by and from the Ayr, and so the Holy
Ghost ruleth in it, in that maner, as he replenisheth
and filleth all things, and as all things are in God, and
so God himself is all.</p>
               <p>22. Seeing then the Holy Spirit in the Soule is
creaturely, <hi>viz.</hi> the proprietie or Portion of the Soul,
therefore it searcheth even into the <hi>Deitie,</hi> and also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Nature,</hi> for it hath its Source and descent from the
<hi>Being</hi> of the whole Deitie.</p>
               <p>23. When it is kindled or enlightened by the Holy
Ghost: then it beholdeth what God its Father doth, as a
son beholdeth what his Father doth at home in his house.</p>
               <p>24. It is a <hi>Member</hi> or child in the house of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father.</p>
               <p>25. And as the Eye of man seeth even unto the
Stars, from whence it hath a <hi>finite</hi> original and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
So the soul also seeth even <hi>into</hi> the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
wherein it liveth.</p>
               <p>26. But the Soul having its source also out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that in Nature there is good and bad; also, in
that man hath cast himself, through Sin, into the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or wrath of Nature, so that the soul is daily and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61095:30"/>
hourly defiled with <hi>Sins,</hi> therefore it knoweth but in
part.</p>
               <p>27. For the wrath or fiercenesse in Nature <hi>raigneth</hi>
now also in the soul. But the Holy Ghost doth not go
into the wrath or fiercenesse, but raigneth in the <hi>source</hi>
of the soul which <hi>is</hi> in the light of God, and fighteth
against the wrath or fiercenesse in the Soul.</p>
               <p>28. And therefore the soul <hi>cannot</hi> attain unto any
<hi>perfect</hi> knowledge in this life, till at the end, when
light and darknesse are separated, and wrath or fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is, with the Body, consumed in the Earth, and then
the soul seeth clearly and perfectly in God its Father.</p>
               <p>29. But when the soul is kindled or enlightened by
the Holy Ghost, then it <hi>triumpheth</hi> in the Body, like a
huge fire, which maketh the heart and reins tremble
for Joy.</p>
               <p>30. But there is not presently a great and deep
knowledge in God its Father, but its love towards God
its Father, triumpheth thus in the fire of the Holy
Spirit.</p>
               <p>31. But the knowledge of God is sowen in the fire
of the Holy Ghost, and at first is as small <hi>as a Grain of
Mustard seed,</hi> as Christ makes the comparison, <hi>Matth.
13. afterward it groweth large, like a tree, and spreadeth it
self abroad</hi> in God its Creator.</p>
               <p>32. Just as a Drop of water in the Ocean cannot
avail much; but if a great River runneth into it, that
maketh a greater commotion.</p>
               <p>33. But the time past, present, and to come, as also
depth and heighth, near and afar off, is all <hi>one</hi> in God,
one comprehensibility.</p>
               <p>34. And the holy Soul of man seeth the same also;
But in this world in part only: it happeneth <hi>some times,</hi>
that it seeth nothing at all: for the Devil doth assault it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61095:31"/>
furiously in the fierce wrathful source which is in the
soul, and oftentimes covereth the noble Mustard seed,
and therefore Man must alwayes be in fight and war.</p>
               <p>35. In this manner, and in this knowledge of the
Spirit, I will write in this book, concerning God our
Father, in whom are all things, and who himself is all:
And will handle, how all is become <hi>distinct</hi> and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely,
and how all driveth and moveth in the <hi>whole</hi>
tree of life.</p>
               <p>36. Here you shall see the 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> true ground of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> how all was <hi>One</hi> Being before the Time of the
world; 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> how the <hi>holy Angels</hi> were created also; and
out of what: 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Also how the terrible Fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi>
together with his <hi>Legions</hi> hapned: 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi> How Heaven,
Earth, Stars, and the Elements, were made: 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi> how me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
stones and other creatures in the earth are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
7<hi rend="sup">o</hi> How the birth of life is, and the corporeity of all
things; 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Also what the true <hi>heaven</hi> is, in which God
and his Saints do dwell: 9<hi rend="sup">o</hi> And what the <hi>wrath</hi> of God
is, and the <hi>Hellish</hi> fire. 10<hi rend="sup">o</hi> And how all is become
kindled and enflamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In brief,
How, and what, the Being of all
Beings is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>37.
The <hi>First Seven</hi> Chapters treat
very plainly and comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Being of God and of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61095:31"/>
Angels, by <hi>similitudes,</hi> that the
Reader may from one step to the
other at last come to the <hi>deep sense</hi>
and true ground.</p>
               <p>38. In the <hi>Eighth</hi> Chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
the depth in the Divine
Being, and so on, the further,
the deeper.</p>
               <p>39. One thing is often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and still more deeply descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
for the Readers sake, and
by reason of my slow and dull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.</p>
               <p>40. That which you do not
find sufficiently explained in <hi>this</hi>

Now here a man must
consider, What the word

               <p>A Quality is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
boyling springing

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61095:33"/>
               <head>Of Heat.</head>
               <p>5. As, for Example, <hi>Heat,</hi> which burneth, <hi>consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth</hi>
and driveth forth all, whatsoever cometh into
it which is not of the same property: and again it
<hi>enlightneth</hi> and warmeth all cold, wet, and dark
things, it compacteth and hardneth soft things.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Light and Fiercenesse.</head>
               <p>6.
It containeth likewise two other kinds in it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Light, and 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Fiercenesse: of which take notice
in this manner. The light or the heart of the heat is in
it self a pleasant joyfull Glance or Lustre, a power
of <hi>life,</hi> an inlightening and glance of a thing which
is afar off, and is a piece or source of the heavenly
Kingdom of Joy.</p>
               <p>7. For it maketh all things in this world <hi>living</hi>
and moving; all flesh, trees, leaves, and grasse, grow
in this world in the power of the light and have their
life therein, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Good.</p>
               <p>8. Again it containeth, also a fiercenesse or
<hi>wrath</hi> which burneth, consumeth, and spoileth: this
wrath or fiercenesse springeth, driveth, and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it self in the Light, and maketh the light move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>9. It wrestleth and fighteth together in its two-fold
source, as one thing: It is also one thing, but it hath
a double source: The <hi>light</hi> subsisteth in God without
heat, but it doth not subsist so in Nature.</p>
               <p>10. For all Qualities in nature are one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as one <hi>Qualitie,</hi> in that maner, as God is all: and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61095:34"/>
as all things descend and come forth from him: For
God is the <hi>Heart</hi> or fountain of Nature, from him
cometh all.</p>
               <p>11. Now the <hi>Heat</hi> reigneth and predominateth in
all powers in Nature, and warmeth all, and is <hi>one</hi>
source or spring in <hi>all;</hi> for if it were not so, the water
would be too cold: and the Earth would be congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and there would be no Ayr.</p>
               <p>12. The Heat is <hi>predominant</hi> in all, in trees,
herbs and grasse, and maketh the water moveable,
so that, through the waters Springing out of the
earth, there groweth herbs and grasse, and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called a Quality, because it operateth moveth
and boyleth in all, and elevateth all.</p>
               <p>13. But the <hi>Light</hi> in the Heat giveth power to
all qualities, so that all groweth <hi>pleasant</hi> and joyful.
Heat without Light availeth not the other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but is a <hi>perdition</hi> to the Good, an evil source or
Spring: for all is spoiled in the fiercenesse or wrath
of the Heat. Thus the light in the heat is a quick
Spring or living fountain; into which the Holy
Ghost entreth, but not into the fiercenesse or wrath.</p>
               <p>14. Yet the heat maketh the light moveable, so
that it springeth and driveth forth, as is seen in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
when the Light of the Sun is <hi>likewise</hi> upon the
earth, but the <hi>hot</hi> Rayes of the Sun cannot reach into
the earth, and that is the reason why no fruit grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61095:34"/>
               <head>Of the qualification of the
Cold Quality.</head>
               <p>15.
<hi>Cold</hi> is a Quality also, as well as <hi>Heat,</hi> it qualifieth
or operateth in all creatures, whatsoever come forth,
in <hi>Nature,</hi> and in all whatsoever doth move therein,
in Men, Beasts, Fowles, Fishes, Worms, Leaves, and
Grasse.</p>
               <p>16. And Heat is set in <hi>opposition</hi> unto it, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth
therein as if it were one and the same thing,
but it opposeth the fiercenesse or rage of the Heat,
and <hi>allayeth</hi> the Heat.</p>
               <p>17. It containeth also two sorts or Species in it, which
is to be Observed, <hi>viz.</hi> It <hi>mitigateth</hi> the heat, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
all things pleasant, and is in all creatures, a
quality of life; for no creature can subsist without
<hi>cold,</hi> for it is a springing driving Mobility in every
thing.</p>
               <p>18. The other kind or Species is <hi>Fiercenesse:</hi> for
where it getteth power, it suppresseth all, and spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all, even as the Heat doth; no life can subsist in
it, if the Heat did not hinder that. The fiercenesse of
Cold is a destruction to every life, and the house of
Death, even as the Hot fiercenesse also is.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the qualification of the Ayr
and the Water.</head>
               <p>19.
<hi>Ayr</hi> hath its original from Heat and Cold; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61095:35"/>
Heat and Cold work powerfully, and replenish all,
whereby is caused a lively and <hi>stirring</hi> motion; but
when cold allayeth or <hi>mitigateth</hi> the Heat, then both
their qualities are rarified and made thin; and the
<hi>Bitter</hi> quality drawes them together, so that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Dewey.</p>
               <p>20. But the Ayr hath its original and greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from <hi>Heat,</hi> and the water hath it from <hi>cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. Now these Two Qualities wrestle continually
one with another, the Heat <hi>consumeth</hi> the water, and
the Cold condenseth or crowdeth the Ayr. Now ayr is
a cause and the spirit of every <hi>life</hi> and motion in the
world, be it in flesh, or in any of the vegetables; all
whatever is, hath its <hi>life</hi> from the Ayr, and nothing
can subsist without ayr, whatsoever moveth and is
in this world.</p>
               <p>22. <hi>Water</hi> also Springeth in every living and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creature in this World; in the water consisteth
the Body of every thing, as the Spirit consisteth in the
Ayr: be it<note n="*" place="margin">or in Flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> in animals, or vegetables.</p>
               <p>23. And these two are caused by heat and cold,
and qualify or mix and operate together as one
thing.</p>
               <p>24. Now in these two qualitis two other Species
or kinds are to be observ'd, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>living</hi> and a <hi>dead</hi>
operation. The Ayr is a living quality, if it be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
or moderate in a thing, and the Holy Ghost
reigneth in the Calmnesse or <hi>Meeknesse</hi> of the Ayr,
and all the creatures rejoyce therein.</p>
               <p>25. But there is a <hi>fierceness</hi> or wrath also in it, so that
it killeth &amp; destroyeth by its terrible disturbance. But
the qualification taketh its original from the fierce
disturbauce or elevation, so that it moveth and driveth
in every creature, from whenee <hi>life</hi> hath its originals
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61095:35"/>
and doth exist: and therefore both of them must be
in this life.</p>
               <p>26. The Water also hath a fierce <hi>deadly</hi> Spring,
for it killeth &amp; consumeth: and so, all things that have
a life and Being, must <hi>Rot</hi> and perish in the water.</p>
               <p>27. Thus is the Heat and the Cold a cause and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the Water and of the Ayr, in which every
thing <hi>acteth</hi> and <hi>standeth,</hi> every life and mobility stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
therein. Of which I shall write plainly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Creation of the Stars.</p>

                  <p>28.
The <hi>Bitter</hi> quality is the heart in every life: for, as
it draweth together the Water in the Ayr, and also
dissipateth the same, so that it becometh <hi>separable;</hi> so
also in other Creatures, as in vegetables of the Earth.
For Leaves and Grasse have their <hi>green colour</hi> from
the Bitter quality.</p>
                  <p>29. Now if the Bitter quality dwelleth meekly and
Gently in any Creature, then it is the <hi>Heart</hi> or joy
therein: for it dissipateth all other Evil Influences,
and is the beginning or cause of joy or of <hi>Laughing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. For, being moved, it causeth the Creature to
tremble and be joyful, and raiseth it up in its whole
Body: for it is as it were a glimpse or Ray of the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
joyfulnesse, an elevation of the spirit, a spirit
and power or vertue in all vegetables of the Earth,
and a mother of the life.</p>
                  <p>31. The Holy Ghost springeth moveth and driveth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61095:36"/>
vehemently in this quality, for it is a part of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>joyfulnesse,</hi> as I shall demonstrate afterward.</p>
                  <p>32. But it hath also in it another Species or kind,
namely, the fiercenesse or wrath, which is the very
House of Death, a <hi>Corruption</hi> of all Good, a perdition
and destruction of the Life in the Flesh.</p>
                  <p>33. For if it be elevated too much in any creature
and be inflamed in the Heat, then Flesh and Spirit se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth,
and the Creature loseth its Life and must
Die: for it move to and kindleth the Element of <hi>Fire,</hi>
for in the great Heat and Bitternesse no Flesh can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>

The <hi>Sweet</hi> Quality is set opposite to the <hi>Bitter,</hi> and is
a <hi>gracious</hi> amiable blessed and pleasant quality, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
of the Life, an allaying of the Fiercenesse, it
maketh all pleasant and <hi>friendly</hi> in every Creature, it
maketh the Vegetables of the Earth fragrant and of

<hi>Colours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. It is a glimpse and source of meeknesse, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Habitation of heavenly joyfulnesse, a House
or Mansion of the Holy Ghost, a qualification of
Love and <hi>Mercy,</hi> a joy of the Life.</p>
                  <p>36. But on the other side, it hath also a fierce or
wrathful source, a source of Death &amp; Corruption: For
if it be <hi>kindled</hi> in the Bitter Quality in the Element of
Water, then it breedeth diseases, and the botchey
Plague or Pestilence, and corruption of the Flesh.</p>
                  <p>37. But if it be kindled in the Heat and Bitterness,
then it infecteth the Element of Ayr, whereby is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred

            <argument>
               <p>An Introduction, shewing how men may come to apprehend
The Divine, and Naturall, Beeing. And further, of the
two Qualities.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1.
ALl whatsoever hath been above mentioned
is <hi>therefore</hi> called <hi>Quality,</hi> because it qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
operateth or frameth all in the Deepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the earth, also upon the earth, and in the earth,
in one another, as <hi>ONE</hi> thing, and yet hath severall
distinct vertues and operations, and but one mother,
from whence descend and Spring all things.</p>
            <p>2. And all the creatures are made and descended
from <hi>these qualities,</hi> and live therein as in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and the earth and Stones descend or proceed
from thence also; and all that groweth out of the
earth, liveth and Springeth forth out of the vertue
of these qualities; no <hi>rational man</hi> can deny it.</p>
            <p>3. Now This two-fold Source, Good and Evil in
every thing, is caused by the Stars: for as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the Earth are in their Qualities, so also are
the Stars.</p>
            <p>4. For from the two-fold Fource, every thing
hath its great Mobility, running, Springing, driving
and growing. For meeknesse in nature is a Still
<hi>Rest,</hi> but the fiercenesse in every power, maketh all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61095:37"/>
things moveable, running, and Generative.</p>
            <p>5. For the driving qualities cause a lust in all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
unto evil and good, so that every thing is <hi>desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>
one of the other, to copulate and encrease, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
grow fair, perish, love, and hate.</p>
            <p>6. In every Creature in this World is a <hi>Good</hi> and
<hi>Evil</hi> will and source; in Men, Beasts, Fowles, Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Wormes, and in all that which is upon the earth;
in Gold, Silver, Copper, Tinn, Iron, Steel, Wood,
Herbs, Leaves, and Grasse; As also in the earth, in
stones, in the water, and all whatsoever can be thought
upon.</p>
            <p>7. There is nothing in Nature, wherein there is
not Good and Evil: every thing moveth and liveth
in this double impulse working or operation; be it
what it will.</p>
            <p>8. But the holy Angels and the fierce Wrathful
Devils are here to be excepted, for these are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
apart: Each of these liveth, qualifieth and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in his own peculiar quality.</p>
            <p>9. The holy Angels live and qualifie in the <hi>light</hi>
in the <hi>good</hi> quality wherein the Holy Ghost raigneth.
But the Devils live and raign in the <hi>fierce</hi> wrathful
quality, in the Quality of fiercenesse and wrath, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
or perdition.</p>
            <p>10. Yet both of these the good and the evil Angels
were made out of the qualities of Nature, from
whence all things existed, only they differ in their
qualifying or Condition.</p>
            <p>11. The Holy <hi>Angels</hi> live in the power of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
of the Light and joyfulnesse, and the <hi>Devils</hi>
live in the power of the rising or elevating quality of
fiercenesse, terrour and Darknesse, and cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the light; into which condition, they preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61095:38"/>
and cast themselves through their pride and
elevating of themselves, as I shall shew afterward,
when I shall write of the Creation.</p>
            <p>12. But if thou wilt not believe, that in this world
all descendeth or cometh from the Stars, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
it to thee: if thou art not a Sot or Stock,
but hast some little Reason and understanding left,
therefore take notice of that which followeth.</p>
            <p>13. First behold the <hi>Sun;</hi> It is the Heart or <hi>King</hi> of
all Stars, and giveth <hi>light</hi> to all stars from the East
to the West, it enlightneth and warmeth all, all
liveth and groweth by its power; besides, the joy of
all creatures standeth in its power.</p>
            <p>14. If that should be taken away or Extinct, then
all would be dark and cold, neither would there
grow any fruit, and neither man nor beast could <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate</hi>
and increase, because their heat would be
extinguisht, and their <hi>Seed</hi> would be cold and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Quality of the Sun.</head>
               <p>15.
If thou wilt be a Philosopher, and <hi>Naturalist,</hi> and
search into <hi>Gods Being in Nature,</hi> and discern how all
is come to passe, then pray to God for the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to enlighten thee with the same.</p>
               <p>16. For in thy Flesh and Blood thou art not able
to apprehend it, and though thou dost read it, yet
it is but as a Fume or Mist before thine Eyes.</p>
               <p>17. In the Holy Ghost alone, who is in God and
also in the whole Nature out of which all things
were made; in him alone thou canst search into the
whole Body or Corporeity of God, which is <hi>Nature,</hi>
as also into the holy Trinity it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61095:38"/>
18. For the Holy Ghost goeth forth from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Trinity, and reigneth and ruleth in the <hi>whole Body</hi>
or <hi>Corpus</hi> of God; that is, in the whole Nature.</p>
               <p>19. Even as the spirit of Man ruleth and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the whole body in all the Veins, and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
the <hi>whole Man:</hi> even so the Holy Ghost reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
the whole Nature, and is the <hi>Heart</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and raigneth in the good Qualities of every
thing.</p>
               <p>20. Now if thou hast that spirit in thee, so that it
enlightneth, <hi>filleth</hi> and replenisheth thy spirit, then
thou wilt understand what followeth in this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>21. But if not, then it will be with thee, as it was
with the <hi>wise</hi> Heathens, who gazed and stared on the
Creation, and would search and sift it out by their
<hi>own Reason,</hi> and though with their fictions and conceits
they came before Gods countenance or Face yet they
were not able to see it; but were stark <hi>blind</hi> in the
knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>22. And as the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Desart
could not behold <hi>Moses</hi> his countenance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he must put a Vail before his face, when he
drew near to the people.</p>
               <p>23. The cause of it was, they neither understood
nor knew the true God and his Will, who <hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
walked among them, and therefore that Vail
was a sign and type of their blindnesse and mis-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>24. As little as a peece of work can apprehend
him that made it, so little also can <hi>Man</hi> apprehend
and know God his creator, unlesse the Holy Ghost
<hi>enlighten</hi> him; which hapneth only to those, that
rely not upon themselves, but set their <hi>hope</hi> will and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61095:39"/>
desires, only upon God, and move in the Holy Ghost,
and these are <hi>one Spirit</hi> with God.</p>
               <p>25. Now if we consider rightly of the Sun and
Starrs, with their <hi>Corpus</hi> or Body, operations and
Qualities, then the very divine Being may be found
therein, and that the vertues of the stars are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self.</p>
               <p>26. If the whole Wheel <hi>Circumference</hi> or Sphear of
the stars be well considered, then it is soon found, that
the same is the mother of all things: or the Nature
out of which all things are come, and wherein all
things stand and live, and whereby every thing
moveth, all things are made of these powers, and
therein they abide <hi>eternally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>27. And though, indeed <hi>they shall be changed</hi> at the
end of this Time, when good and evil shall be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
And so in like manner Angels and men, <hi>in
the power of Nature</hi> out of which they had gotten their
first beginning, shall subsist in God, eternally.</p>
               <p>28. But here thou must elevate thy minde in the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> and consider, how the <hi>whole Nature</hi> with all
the powers, which are in Nature, also the widenesse,
depth and height, also heaven, and earth, and all
whatsoever is therein, and all that is above the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
is together, the <hi>Body</hi> or Corporeity of
God; and the powers of the Starres are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Veins, in the naturall body of God, <hi>in this
world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>29. Thou must not conceive, that in the Body of the
Stars, is the <hi>tryumphing</hi> Holy Trinity, God the Father
Sonne and Holy Ghost, in which there is no evil, but
is the Light-holy eternal fountain of joy, which is
undividable, and unchangeable, which no creature
can sufficiently apprehend or expresse: which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61095:39"/>
and is above the Body of the Stars in it self, whose
depth no creature is able to measure or fathom.</p>
               <p>30. But we must not so conceive, as if God were
not at all in the <hi>Corpus</hi> or Body of the Starrs, and in
this world: for when we say; <hi>ALL,</hi> or <hi>from
Eternity to Eternity,</hi> or <hi>All in All</hi>
then we understand, the Entire <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31.
Take <hi>Man</hi> for a Similitude or Example, <hi>who is
made after the Image or Similitude of God,</hi> as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in <hi>Moses,</hi> Gen. 1. 27.</p>
               <p>32. <hi>The Inward or hollownesse in the Body of Man,</hi> is
and signifieth the Deep betwixt the Stars and the
Earth.</p>
               <p>33. <hi>The whole Body with all its parts,</hi> signifieth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth.</p>
               <p>34. <hi>The Flesh</hi> signifieth the Earth, and is also from
Earth.</p>
               <p>35. <hi>The Blood</hi> signifieth the Water, and is from
the Water.</p>
               <p>36. <hi>The Breath</hi> signifieth the Ayr, and is also Ayr.</p>
               <p>37. The <hi>Wind-Pipe and Arteries,</hi> wherein the Ayr
qualifieth or operateth, signifieth the Deep betwixt
the Stars and the Earth, wherein fire, ayr and water
qualifie in an elementary manner, and so the warmth
the Ayr, and water, qualifie also in the <hi>Wind-Pipe
and Arteries,</hi> as they do in the Deep above the Earth.</p>
               <p>38. <hi>The Veins</hi> signifie the powerfull flowings out
from the Stars: and are also the powerful outgoings
of the Stars: for the Start with their powers raign in
the Veins, and drive forth the Forme shape and
condition in Men.</p>
               <p>39. <hi>The Entrails</hi> or <hi>Guts</hi> signifie the operation of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61095:40"/>
the Stars, or their consuming of all that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from their power, for whatsoever <hi>themselves</hi>
have made, that they consume again, and remain
Still in their vertue and power, and so the Gutts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
are the consuming of all that, which man Thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and stuffeth into his <hi>Gutts,</hi> even all whatsoever
groweth from the power of the Stars.</p>
               <p>40. <hi>The Heart</hi> in man Signifieth the Heat, or the
Element of Fire, and it is also the Heat: for the
Heat in the whole Body, hath its Original in the
<hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41. <hi>The Wind-Pipe</hi> and <hi>Arteries,</hi> signifie the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Aire, and the Aire ruleth also therein.</p>
               <p>42. <hi>The Liver</hi> signifieth the Element of water,
and it is also the water: for from the Liver cometh
the Blood in the whole Body into all the Members.
The Liver is the Mother of the Blood.</p>
               <p>43. <hi>The Lungs</hi> Signify the Earth, and are also of
the same Quality.</p>
               <p>44. <hi>The Feet</hi> Signify near and afar off, for near
and afar off, are all one in God: and so man by
means of his Feet can come and go <hi>near</hi> and <hi>far off:</hi>
let him be where he will, he is in Nature, neither
near, nor <hi>afar off;</hi> for in God these are <hi>one</hi> thing.</p>
               <p>45. <hi>The Hands</hi> signifie Gods Omnipotence: for
as God in Nature can <hi>change</hi> all things, and make of
them what he pleaseth: so man also can with his
Hands <hi>change</hi> all that which is grown in Nature,
and can make with his Hands out of them what he
pleaseth: he ruleth with his Hands the <hi>Work</hi> and
Being of the whole Nature, and so they very well
signifie the Omnipotence of God.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61095:40"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now observe here further;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>46.
<hi>The whole Body, to the Neck;</hi> signifieth, and is, the
round circle or Sphear of the Starres, as also the Deep
within or between the Stars, wherein the <hi>Planets</hi> and
<hi>Elements</hi> reign.</p>
               <p>47. <hi>The Flesh</hi> signifyeth the Earth, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed,
and hath no motion: and so the flesh in it
self hath no Reason, Comprehensibility, or Mobility,
but is moved only by the power of the <hi>Stars,</hi> which
raign in the flesh and veins.</p>
               <p>48. No more could the earth bring forth any
fruit, neither could there grow any Metals, as Gold,
Silver, Copper, Iron, or stones, if the <hi>Starrs</hi> did not
work in them; neither could there grow any Grasse,
without the operation of the Starts.</p>
               <p>49. The <hi>Head</hi> signifieth Heaven; the same is
grown on the Body, by the veins, passages and going
forth of powers; and so all the powers come again
from the Head and <hi>Brain</hi> into the Body, into the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-veins
or Arteries of the flesh.</p>
               <p>50. Now Heaven is a pleasant Pallace of joy,
wherein all the powers are, as in the whole nature
in the Starrs and Elements, but not <hi>so hard</hi> working
and Springing. For every <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> hath
but one Species kind or form of power, Springing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>bright</hi> and <hi>meek,</hi> not promiscuously Evil and Good
one in another, as in the Starrs and Elements, but
very <hi>pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>51. It is made out of the Midst of the <hi>waters,</hi> but
not qualifying in such a manner, as the <hi>water</hi> in the
<hi>elements,</hi> for fiercenesse or wrath is not therein. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Heaven belongeth to Nature, because the Stars
and Elements have their original and power from
the <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:61095:41"/>
52. For Heaven is the <hi>Heart</hi> of the water, as in all
creatures, and in all that, which is in this world, the
water is the <hi>Heart</hi> thereof and nothing can Subsist
without water, be it in the flesh or out of the
flesh, in the Vegetables of the earth, or in Metals
and Stones, in every thing the water is the kernel or
the Heart of it.</p>
               <p>53. And so Heaven is the Heart in Nature,
wherein all the powers are, as in the Stars and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and it is a soft supple and meek matter of all
powers, as the Brain, in mans Head, is.</p>
               <p>54. Now Heaven kindleth with its power, the
Stars and Elements, so that they move and work:
And so the <hi>Head</hi> of man is also like Heaven.</p>
               <p>55. For as in Heaven all powers are meek and
full of joy; And as Heaven hath a <hi>Closure</hi> or <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
above the Starrs; and yet all powers go forth
from Heaven into the Stars: so the Brain also hath
a Closure or Firmament between it and the body,
and yet all the powers go forth from the Brain into
the Body, and into the whole man.</p>
               <p>56. <hi>The Head Containeth the five Senses,</hi> viz. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, and Feeling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Stars and Elements qualify, and therein exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Sydereal or Heavenly Starry or Astral and
Natural spirit in Men and Beasts, in this floweth forth
Good and Evil, for it is the <hi>House</hi> of the Stars.</p>
               <p>57. Such power the Stars borrow from Heaven,
that they can make in the flesh a Living and moving
<hi>Spirit</hi> in Man and Beast. The moving of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
maketh the Stars moveable, and so the Head al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
maketh the Body moveable.</p>
               <p>58.
Now open here the eyes of thy Spirit, and behold God
thy Creator.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61095:41"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Now the Question is, From whence hath Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or whence Borroweth it this power, that it
causeth such <hi>Mobility</hi> in Nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>59. Here you must Lift up your Eyes Beyond
Nature, into the Light-holy Tryumphing divine
power, into the unchangeable holy Trinity, which is a
triumphing Springing moveable Being, and all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are therein, as in Nature.</p>
               <p>60. For this is <hi>the Eternal Mother of Nature,</hi> of
which Heaven, Earth, Stars, Elements, Angels,
Devils, Men, Beasts, and all have their being, and
therein <hi>ALL</hi> standeth.</p>
               <p>61. When we nominate Heaven and Earth, Stars
and Elements, and all that is therein, and all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is above the Heaven, then thereby is nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Totall God,</hi> which hath made himself <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely</hi>
in these above mentioned Beings, in his power
which goeth forth from him.</p>
               <p>62. But <hi>GOD</hi> in his TRINITY is unchangeable,
and whatever there is in Heaven and upon Earth, and
above the Earth, hath its Spring Source and Original,
from the <hi>Power</hi> which proceedeth from God.</p>
               <p>63. Yet you must <hi>not</hi> therefore conceive, that in
God, there is Good and Evil, for God Himself is the
<hi>Good,</hi> and hath the <hi>Name</hi> from good, which is the
triumphing Eternal Joy: only <hi>all</hi> the <hi>powers</hi> proceed
from him, which you can search out in Nature, and
which are in <hi>all</hi> things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>64. <hi>Now perhaps you may say:</hi> Is there not good
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61095:42"/>
and Evil in Nature: <hi>and so</hi> seeing every thing cometh
from God, needs must then the Evil also come from God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>65. Behold there is a <hi>Gall</hi> in mans Body, which
is <hi>poison,</hi> and he cannot live without this Gall; for
the Gall maketh the <hi>Astral spirits</hi> moveable, joyous,
triumphing or laughing: for it is the source of
joy.</p>
               <p>66. But if it be inflamed or kindled in one of the
Elements, then it <hi>spoileth</hi> the whole Man, for the wrath
in the Astral spirits cometh from the Gall.</p>
               <p>67. That is, when the Gall overfloweth, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the Heart, then it kindleth the Element of
<hi>fire,</hi> and the fire kindleth the Astral <hi>spirits,</hi> which
<hi>raign</hi> in the <hi>Blood</hi> in the veins and in the Element of
<hi>Water;</hi> and then the whole Body trembleth by reason
of the wrath and the poyson of the Gall.</p>
               <p>68. And such a source hath <hi>Joy,</hi> and from the same
substance as also the <hi>wrath.</hi> That is, when the Gall in
the <hi>Loving</hi> or Sweet quality is inflamed, in that,
which man is in love withall, then the whole body
trembleth for joy, in which many times the <hi>Astrall</hi>
spirits are affected also, when the Gall is overflown,
and is kindled in the <hi>Sweet</hi> quality.</p>
               <p>69. But it hath no such Substance in God, for he hath
not flesh and blood, but he is a Spirit, in whom all powers
are; <hi>as we pray in the Lords Prayer,</hi> Thine is the
power. <hi>(John 4. 24. Matth. 6.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>70. <hi>And as it is written of him in</hi> Isaiah 9. He is
Wonderful, Counsel, Power, Champion, Eternal Father,
Prince of Peace.</p>
               <p>71. The <hi>Bitter</hi> quality is in God also, but not in
that manner as the Gall is in Man, but it is an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:61095:42"/>
power, in an elevating triumphing spring or
source of Joy.</p>
               <p>72. And though it be written in <hi>Moses, I am an
angry zealous God,</hi> Exod. 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 24. yet the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it is <hi>not,</hi> that God is angry <hi>in himself,</hi> and
that there ariseth a fire of anger in the <hi>Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>73. No; that cannot be, for it is written,
<hi>against those that hate me,</hi> in that same Creature, <hi>the
fire of anger riseth up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>74. But if God should be angry in Himself, then the
<hi>whole Nature</hi> would be on fire, which will come once
to passe <hi>On the Last Day</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Not</hi> in <hi>God,</hi>
but <hi>in God, the triumphing Joy will burn;</hi> it was never
otherwise from eternity, nor will it Ever be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>75. But now the elevating springing triumphing
joy in God maketh Heaven triumphing and <hi>moveable,</hi>
and <hi>Heaven</hi> maketh the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Elements</hi> move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and the Stars and the Elements make the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
moveable,</p>
               <p>76. Out of the <hi>Powers</hi> of God, are the Heavens
proceeded: out of the <hi>Heaven</hi> are the Stars; out of the
<hi>Stars</hi> are the Elements; out of the <hi>Elements</hi> are the
<hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Creatures</hi> come to be.</p>
               <p>77. Thus all had its beginning even to the Angels
and Devils; <hi>which,</hi> before the Creation of Heaven,
Stars, and the Earth, were proceeded out of the same
power out of which the Heaven, the Stars, and the
Earth were proceeded.</p>
               <p>78. This is a short Entrance or Introduction, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how the Divine and Natural Being is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
Henceforth I will describe the true Ground
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61095:43"/>
and Depth concerning What God is, and how all
things are framed in Gods Being.</p>
               <p>79. Which indeed hath been partly concealed
from the beginning of the World to this time, and
Man with his <hi>Reason</hi> could not comprehend it.</p>
               <p>80. But seeing God is pleased to reveal Himself in
Simplicity in this last Time; I shall give way to his
Impulse and Will; I am but a very little Spark of
Light. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

you faithfully <hi>admonished,</hi> to let go your
Opinion and Conceit, and not to Gaze
after the <hi>Heathenish</hi> wisdome, nor be
offended at the simplicity of the Authour: for this
work comes not from <hi>his Reason,</hi> but from the impulse
of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. Onely be thou careful to get into thy spirit the
Holy <hi>Ghost,</hi> which issueth forth from God, and He
will lead thee into all truth, and reveal <hi>Himself</hi> unto
thee.</p>

When Our Saviour JESUS CHRIST taught his
Disciples to pray, he said; <hi>When ye pray, say
thus: Our Father, which art in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 6.</p>
               <p>5. The meaning is not, as if Heaven could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
encompasse or contain God the <hi>Father:</hi> for
<hi>itself</hi> is made by the Divine power: for <hi>Christ</hi> saith,
<hi>My Father is greater then all,</hi> Joh. 10. 29.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>And God saith in the Prophet,</hi> Heaven is my
Throne, and the Earth is<note n="*" place="margin">The Durt under my Feet.</note> my footstool, <hi>Esa.</hi> 66. What
house would you build for me? I compasse the Heaven
with a Span, <hi>and</hi> the Earth with three Fingers, <hi>Esa. 40.
12. Also,</hi> I will dwell in Jacob, and Israel shall be my
Tabernacle, <hi>Psal. 135. 4. Syrac.</hi> 25. 13.</p>
               <p>7. But in that Christ calls his Father a <hi>Heavenly</hi>
Father, his meaning is, that his Fathers <hi>lustre</hi> and
power appeareth and shineth very <hi>bright</hi> and pure in
Heaven; and that, <hi>above</hi> the circle or incloure, which
we behold with our Eyes, and which we call <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
doth appear the totally <hi>Triumphing</hi> Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
The <hi>Father Sonne</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Christ also thereby distinguisheth his <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Father from the Father of <hi>Nature,</hi> which is indeed
the Stars and the Elements, these are our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Father, out of which we are made, and by whose
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61095:44"/>
impulse we live here in this world, and from whence
we have our food and nourishment.</p>
               <p>9. But God is <hi>therefore</hi> Our Heavenly Father, in
that our <hi>Soul</hi> continually longeth after him, and is
desirous of him, yea it thirsteth and hungreth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
after him.</p>
               <p>10. The <hi>Body</hi> hungreth and thirsteth after the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Nature, which is <hi>viz.</hi> the Stars and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and <hi>that Father</hi> also feedeth and nourisheth
the Body.</p>
               <p>11. But the Soul thirsteth after the heavenly Holy
Father, and he also giveth meat and drink to it, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with his holy Spirit, and the spring source or
fountain of joy.</p>
               <p>12. Yet we have <hi>not two</hi> Fathers, but only <hi>One:</hi>
for Heaven is made by his Power, and the Stars out
of his Wisdome, which is <hi>in him,</hi> and proceedeth
forth <hi>from him.</hi>

               <head>Of the Substance and Property
of the Father.</head>
               <p>13.
When we consider the whole Nature and its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
then we see the Father.</p>
               <p>14. When we behold Heaven and the Stars, then we
behold his eternal <hi>Power</hi> and Wisdom: so many
Stars as stand in the whole Heaven, which are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
and incomprehensible to <hi>Reason,</hi> and some of
them are not visible; so manifold and <hi>various</hi> is the
Power and Wisdome of God the Father.</p>
               <p>15. But Every Star in Heaven Differeth in its power
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61095:44"/>
and <hi>Quality,</hi> which also maketh so many Distinctions
in and among the Creatures upon the Earth, and in
the whole Creation.</p>
               <p>16. But all the <hi>Powers,</hi> which are in <hi>Nature,</hi>
proceed from God the Father; All Light, Heat Cold,
Ayr, Water, and all the powers of the Earth;
Bitter, Sowre, Sweet, Astringent, Hard, and Soft,
and more then can be Reckoned; all have their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
from the Father.</p>
               <p>17. Therefore if a Man would liken the Father
to any thing, he should liken him to the Round
Globe of Heaven.</p>
               <p>18. Thou must not conceive here, that the very
power, which is in the Father, standeth in a Peculiar
severed or divided part and <hi>place</hi> in the Father, as the
Stars do, in Heaven.</p>
               <p>19. No! but the Spirit sheweth that <hi>all</hi> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the Father are one in another, as one power.</p>
               <p>20. A Resemblance Image or Figure whereof, we
have in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel the 1. Chap.</hi> Who seeth the
Lord in the Spirit and resemblance, like a wheele, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Four other wheels</hi> one in another, the Four being
like one another, and when they moved, they went
Strait forward, which way soever the Wind did sit,
or Blow, and that way they went all forward, having
no cause of returning.</p>
               <p>21. And thus it is with God the Father; for all
the powers are in the Father, one in another, <hi>as one
power;</hi> and all powers Consist in the Father, in an
unsearcheable Light and Clarity, or Brightnes and
Glory.</p>
               <p>22. Yet thou must not think, that God who is in
Heaven and above the Heaven, doth there stand and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61095:45"/>
hover, like a power and quality which hath in it
<hi>neither</hi> Reason, nor knowledge in it.</p>
               <p>23. As the Sun which turneth round in its circle,
and shooteth forth from it self Heat and <hi>Light,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be for benefit or hurt to the Earth and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which indeed would be for hurt, if the other
Planets and Stars did not hinder.</p>
               <p>24. No! the Father is <hi>not so,</hi> but he is an All-mighty,
All-wise, All-knowing, All-seeing, All-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
All-smelling, All-feeling, All-tasting God, who
in himself is meek, friendly, gracious, merciful, and
full of Joy, yea Joy it self.</p>
               <p>25. And he is thus from Eternity to eternity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably:
He never changed himself in his <hi>Being,</hi>
neither will he change himself in all <hi>Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>26. He is proceeded or born of nothing, but <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
is all in Eternity; and all whatsoever is, is come
from his power, which from Eternity goeth forth
from <hi>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>27. His Immensenesse Heighth and Depth, <hi>no
Creature,</hi> no not any Angel in Heaven, can search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, but the Angels live in the <hi>power</hi> of the Father
very meekly, and full of Joy, and they alwaies <hi>Sing</hi>
in the power of the Father.</p>

If a Man will see <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> he must once
more look upon natural things, otherwise I <hi>cannot</hi>
write of him: the Spirit indeed beholdeth him, but
that can neither be spoken nor <hi>written;</hi> for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61095:45"/>
Being consisteth in power, which can neither be

               <p>29. Therefore we must use <hi>Similitudes,</hi> if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to speak of God: for we live in this world, as
men who know <hi>but in part,</hi> and are made of that
which is but in part. Therefore I cite the Reader
into <hi>the life to come,</hi> where and when I shall speak
more properly and more clearly of this high Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</p>
               <p>30. In the mean while, the loving Reader is to
attend to the sense and <hi>meaning of the Spirit,</hi> and then
he will not fail to get a little refreshing, if he hath
but any <hi>hunger</hi> in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31.
The Turks and Heathens say, <hi>God hath no Sonne:</hi>
Set Open your Eyes wide, here; and do not make
your selves <hi>stark</hi> blind, and you will see the Sonne.</p>
               <p>32. The Father is all, and all power Subsisteth in
the Father: He is the Beginning and the End of all
things; and besides and beyond him is nothing; and
whatever is, is from the Father.</p>
               <p>33. For <hi>before</hi> the beginning of the Creation of the
Creatures, there was nothing but only GOD; and
where there is nothing, out of that nothing will be.
All things must have a Cause or Root, or else Nothing
will be.</p>
               <p>34. Yet you are not to think that the Sonne is <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi>
God, then the Father. Neither should you
think, that the Sonne is without or <hi>besides</hi> the Father,
and that he is a severed part or divided piece; as when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61095:46"/>
two men stand one by another, where one compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
not the other.</p>
               <p>35. No! the Father and the Sonne is not of <hi>such</hi>
a substance, or such a kind of thing: for the Father
is not an <hi>Image,</hi> to be likened to any thing; but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the <hi>fountain</hi> of all powers, and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are one in another as one power, and therefore
he is said to be ONE onely GOD.</p>
               <p>36. Otherwise if his powers were <hi>divided,</hi> then
he were not Al-mighty, but now he is the Self-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting,
All-mighty, and All-powerful God.</p>
               <p>37. And the <hi>Sonne</hi> is the <hi>Heart</hi> in the Father, all
the powers, which are in the Father, are the <hi>proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the Father; and the Sonne is the <hi>Heart</hi> or the
Kernel or Pith, in all the powers, in the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and he is the <hi>cause</hi> of the springing Joy in all
powers in the whole Father.</p>
               <p>38. From the Sonne, who is the Fathers Heart in
all his powers, the Eternal Joy ariseth and springeth
in all the powers of the Father, such a joy, <hi>as no eye
hath seen, nor ear heard, neither hath ever entred
into the Heart of any Man,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>1 Cor.</hi>
2. 9.</p>
               <p>39. But if a man here on Earth be enlightned
with the Holy Ghost from the fountain of JESUS
CHRIST, so that the spirits of Nature, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the Father, be kindled in him, then there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
such a Joy in his <hi>Heart,</hi> and it goeth forth into
all his <hi>veins,</hi> so that the whole body trembleth, and
the Soulish animal spirit triumpheth, as if it were sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the holy Trinity, which is understood onely
by those, that have been Guests in that place.</p>
               <p>40. And this is but a Type or Glimpse of <hi>the Sonne
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61095:46"/>
of God</hi> in Man, whereby <hi>Faith</hi> is strengthened and
preserved: for the joy cannot be so great in an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>vessel,</hi> as in a heavenly, wherein the perfect
power of God is fully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now here I must write a Similitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41.
I will shew thee a Similitude in Nature, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how the holy Being in the holy Trinity, is.</p>
               <p>42. Consider Heaven, which is a round <hi>Globe,</hi>
having neither beginning nor end, but its beginning
and end is every where, which way soever you look
upon it: and so is <hi>God,</hi> who is in and above the
Heaven, he hath neither beginning nor end.</p>
               <p>43. Now consider further; the Circle or Sphear
of the Stars, they denote the <hi>various</hi> Powers and
Wisdome of the Father, and they are made also by
the Power and Wisdom of the Father.</p>
               <p>44. Now the Heaven, the <hi>Stars,</hi> and the whole
<hi>Deep</hi> between the Stars, together with the <hi>Earth;</hi>
signifie, the Father.</p>
               <p>45. And the <hi>Seven Planets,</hi> signifie, the seven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of God, or the Princes of the Angels, among
which also Lord LUCIFER was one, before his
Fall; which all were made out of the Father in the
beginning of the creation of Angels, before the Time
of this World.</p>
               <p>46. <hi>Now Observe:</hi> The Sun stirreth in the midst
in the Deep between the Stars in a round circle, and
is the heart of the Stars, and giveth Light and power
to all the stars, so <hi>tempering</hi> the power of the starres,
that all becometh pleasant and joyfull.</p>
               <p>47. It <hi>enlighteneth</hi> also the Heaven, the Stars, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61095:47"/>
the Deep above the Earth, working in all things
that are in this world, and so rightly signifieth, the
<hi>Sonne</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>48. For, as the <hi>Sun</hi> standeth in the midst betwixt
the Stars and the Earth, enlightening all powers, and
is the Light and <hi>Heart</hi> of all the powers, and is all the
Joy in this world; besides, all beauty and pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
standeth in the light and power of the Sun.</p>
               <p>49. Even so, the Sonne of God <hi>in</hi> the Father, is
the Heart in the Father, and shineth in all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Father; his power is the moving <hi>spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joy</hi> in all the powers of the Father, and shineth
in the whole Father, as the Sun doth in the whole
world.</p>
               <p>50. If the Earth should be taken away, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth,
the <hi>House</hi> of Misery Trouble or of Hell; then
the whole Deep would be Light in one place, as well
as in another: as indeed the whole Deep in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is as light in one place as in another, from the
<hi>Lustre</hi> of the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>51. And as the Sun is a Self-subsisting creature,
power, and Light; which shineth not <hi>forth from</hi> or out
of all creatures, but <hi>in</hi> and into all creatures, and all
creatures rejoyce in its power:</p>
               <p>52. So the Sonne in the Father, is a self-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ubsisting
person, and enligheneth all the powers in the Father,
and is the Fathers joy <hi>or Heart</hi> in his Centre, or the
Midst of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here the Great Mystery of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>53.
The Sun is made or Generated from all the Stars, and
is a Light, taken from the whole Nature, and shineth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61095:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
again, into the whole Nature of this World, it is <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
with the other Stars, as if it self together with all
the stars, were but <hi>one</hi> starr.</p>
               <p>54. And so the Sonne of God is Continually Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from all the powers of his Father, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not made, but the Heart and <hi>Lustre</hi> shining
forth from the powers of his Heavenly Father; a
self-subsisting Person, the Center, or Body of the
Lustre in the deep.</p>
               <p>55. For the Fathers power Generateth the Sonne
continually from Eternity, to Eternity: but if the
Father should <hi>cease</hi> to <hi>Generate,</hi> then the Sonne
would be no more: also if the <hi>Sonne</hi> should shine no
more in the Father, then the Father would be a dark
valley: also then the Fathers power would not rise
from Eternity, to Eternity, and so the Divine Being
would not <hi>Subsist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>56. Thus the Father is the <hi>selfe-subsisting</hi> Being of
all powers, and the sonne is the heart in the Father,
which is Generated continually out of all the powers
of the Father, and who again <hi>enlightneth</hi> the powers of
the Father.</p>
               <p>57. Do not conceive, that the Sonne in the Father
is so mix'd, that his <hi>Person</hi> can neither be seen nor
known: No; for if it were so, then it were but one
Person.</p>
               <p>58. For as the <hi>Sun</hi> shineth not from or out of the
<hi>other</hi> stars, though it had its original from the <hi>other</hi>
stars; so also the Sonne shineth not from or out of
the powers of the Father, as to his Body or <hi>Corporeity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>59. And though he be generated continually out
of the powers of the Father; And yet he shineth
back again into the powers of the Fahter, for he is
<hi>another</hi> Person than the Father, but <hi>not</hi> another
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61095:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
60. He is eternally <hi>in</hi> the Father, and the Father
generateth him continually from eternity to eternity,
and the Father and the Sonne is ONE <hi>God,</hi> of an
Equall Being in Power and Omnipotence.</p>
               <p>61. The Sonne seeth, tasteth, heareth, feeleth,
smelleth and comprehendeth <hi>All,</hi> as the Father doth;
in <hi>His</hi> power, all liveth and is, whatsoever is Good,
as in the Father; But that which is Bad or Evill is
<hi>not</hi> in <hi>Him.</hi>

               <p>65. Consider, the Sun and Stars again; the <hi>Stars</hi>
being many and several, inexpressible and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
they signifie the Father: out of the stars the
<hi>Sun</hi> is come to be; for God hath made it out of <hi>them,</hi>

Elements,</hi> Fire, Ayr, Water, and Earth: as hereafter

               </p>
               <p>67.
<hi>The three Elements,</hi> Fire, Ayr and Water; have a

one Body: and consider, the fire or heat swells and
flies aloft from the Sun and stars; and from the Heat
the Ayr<note n="*" place="margin">or Expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self.</note> swells and flies aloft; and from the Ayr
comes the Water.</p>
               <p>68. And in <hi>this</hi> motion or qualification consisteth
the life and spirit of all creatures, and whatever can
be named in this world; and <hi>that</hi> signifieth the Holy
Ghost.</p>
               <p>69. And as the three Elements, fire ayr and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
proceed from the Sun and stars, and are <hi>one Body</hi>
in one another, and cause the <hi>living motion,</hi> and the
spirit of all the Creatures of this world:</p>
               <p>70. So the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Sonne, and causeth the <hi>living motion</hi> in
all the powers of the Father.</p>
               <p>71. And as the three Elements move in the Deep, as
a <hi>self-subsisting</hi> spirit, and cause heat, cold, and clouds,
and do flow forth from the power of all the stars;
and as all the powers of the Sun and stars are in the
three Elements, as if they <hi>themselves were</hi> the Sun and
Stars, from whence is the life and spirit of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and doth consist therein:</p>
               <p>72. Just so the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the
Father and the Sonne, and moveth in the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61095:49"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here, the deep Mystery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>72.
<hi>All</hi> the <hi>Stars</hi> which men see, and those which
they do not see, they all signifie the <hi>Power</hi> of God the
Father: and out of these stars is Generated the <hi>Sun,</hi>
which is the <hi>Heart</hi> of all the stars.</p>
               <p>73. Also there goeth forth from all the stars, the
<hi>Power</hi> which is in every star, into the Deep: And
the Power, Heat and shining of the Sun goeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
into the Deep.</p>
               <p>74. And in the Deep, the power of all Stars, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Heat and lustre of the Sun, are all
but <hi>one thing:</hi> a moving boyling <hi>hovering,</hi> like a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
or Matter. Onely it hath not Reason, for it is not
the Holy Spirit; and thus also the fourth Element
must adhere or belong to a natural spirit; or it is
not capable of Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>[75. <q>And thus God the <hi>Father</hi> goeth forth in his
Deep out of all his powers, and Generateth the
Splendor the Heart or the Sonne of God in
his Center.</q>]</p>
               <p>76. Which may be likened to the round <hi>Globe</hi> of
the <hi>Sun,</hi> which shineth upwards, downwards, and on
every side; And so the splendor together with all the
powers, goeth forth from the Sonne of God in the
whole Father.</p>
               <p>77. Now, in the whole Deep of the Father, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
without the Sonne, there is nothing but the
manifold and unmeasurable or unsearchable <hi>Power</hi>
of the Father.</p>
               <p>78. And the unsearchable Power and <hi>Light</hi> of the
Sonne, is in the Deep of the Father, a living, all-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61095:49"/>
all-knowing, all-hearing, all-seeing, all-smell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all-tasting, all-feeling <hi>Spirit,</hi> wherein is all
power splendor and wisdom, as in the Father and
the Sonne.</p>
               <p>79. And as in the four Elements, there is the
power and splendor of the Sun and <hi>all</hi> the stars: so
it is in the whole <hi>Deep</hi> of the Father: and that is,
and is rightly called, <hi>the Holy Ghost,</hi> which is the
third self-subsisting <hi>Person</hi> in the Deity.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Holy TRINITY.</head>
               <p>80.
Now when we speak or write of the <hi>Three Persons</hi>
in the Deity, you must <hi>not conceive</hi> that therefore
there are three Gods, each Raigning and Ruling by
himself, like temporal Kings on the Earth.</p>
               <p>81. No:<note n="*" place="margin">or the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath no such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Being in God.</note> Such a Substance and Being, is not in
God: for the Divine <hi>Being</hi> consiseth in power and
not in Body or flesh.</p>
               <p>82. The Father is the whole Divine power,
whence <hi>all creatures</hi> have proceeded; and hath been
alwayes from Eternity: He hath neither beginning
nor end.</p>
               <p>83. The Sonne is in the Father, being the Fathers
Heart or Light, and the Father generateth the Sonne
continually from Eternity, to Eternity; and the
Sonnes <hi>Power</hi> and Splendor shineth back again in the
whole Father, as the Sun doth in the <hi>whole</hi>
World.</p>
               <p>84. Also the Sonne is <hi>another</hi> person then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but not Externally without or severed from the
Father, <hi>nor</hi> is he any other God then the Father is;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61095:50"/>
his power, Splendor, and Omnipotence is <hi>no lesse</hi>
then the whole Father.</p>
               <p>85. The Holy Ghost <hi>proceedeth</hi> from the Father
and the Sonne, and is the <hi>Third</hi> self-subsisting person
in the Deity: As, the <hi>Elements</hi> in this World go forth
from the Sun and the Stars, and are the moving Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which is in every thing in this world.</p>
               <p>86. So the Holy Ghost is the moving Spirit in
the whole Father, and proceedeth or goeth forth from
Eternity to Eternity <hi>continually</hi> from the Father and
Sonne, and replenisheth the whole Father; he is
nothing Lesse, or Greater then the Father and Sonne;
His <hi>moving power</hi> is in the whole Father.</p>
               <p>87. <hi>All things</hi> in this World are according to the
similitude of this <hi>Ternary.</hi> Ye blind Jewes, Turks,
and Heathens, open wide the Eyes of your Mind: I
must shew you, in your Body, and in every Natural
thing, in Men, Beasts, Fowles, and worms; also in
wood, stone, leaves and grasse, the Likenes of the
Holy Ternary in God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>88. Ye say, there is but <hi>One</hi> Being in God, and
that, God hath no Sonne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>89. Open your Eyes, and consider your Selves:
Man is made according to the similitude, and out of
the power of God in his Ternary. Behold thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, and then thou wilt see it most plainly,
and clearly, if thou art <hi>not</hi> a fool, and an irrational
Beast; therefore observe.</p>
               <p>60. In thy Heart, in thy Veins, and in thy Brain,
thou hast thy spirit; and all the powers which move
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61095:50"/>
in thy heart, in thy Veins, and in thy Brain, wherein
thy Life consisteth, signifieth God the Father.</p>
               <p>91. From that power Springeth up thy <hi>Light,</hi> so
that thou seest, understandest and knowest in the
same power, what thou art to do; for that Light
glimmereth in thy whole Body: and the whole Body
moveth in the power and knowledge of the <hi>Light,</hi> for
the Body helpeth all the Members in the knowledge
of the Light: which signifieth, God the Sonne.</p>
               <p>92. For as the <hi>Father</hi> generateth the <hi>Sonne</hi> out of
his power, and as the Sonne shineth back in the
whole Father: so in like manner the <hi>Power</hi> of thy
Heart, of thy Veins, and of thy Brain, generateth a
<hi>Light</hi> which shineth in all thy powers in thy whole
Body. Open the Eyes of thy Mind, consider it, and
you shall find it so.</p>
               <p>93. <hi>And Observe:</hi> As from the Father and the
Sonne there <hi>goeth forth</hi> the Holy Ghost, and is a self-subsisting
Person in the Deity, and moveth in the
whole Father; so also out of the powers of thy
heart, veins and thy brain, goeth forth the <hi>Power</hi>
which moveth in thy <hi>whole</hi> Body; and out of thy <hi>light</hi>
goeth forth in the same Power, Reason, Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
skill, and Wisdom, to govern the whole body,
and to distinguish all whatsoever is Externally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Body.<note place="margin">Extra Corpus.</note>
               </p>
               <p>94. And both these are but one in the government
of thy Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> thy <hi>spirit,</hi> which signifieth God
the Holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> also the Holy Ghost from God <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in</hi> this spirit in thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thou art a child of <hi>Light</hi>
and not of <hi>darknesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>95. For in respect of <hi>this</hi> light understanding and
government, is man <hi>distinguished</hi> from Beasts, and is
an Angel of God, as I shall clearly shew, when I shall
write of the Creation of Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61095:51"/>
96. Therefore observe exactly, and take notice of
the order of this Book, and thou wilt find,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatsoeve thy Heart desireth,
or ever longed for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>97. Thus you find in Man <hi>three</hi> fountains. First
the <hi>Power</hi> in thy whole Mind, which signifieth, God
the Father; Then secondly, the <hi>Light</hi> in thy whole
mind, enlightening the whole Mind, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
God the Sonne: Then thirdly, there goeth
forth out of all thy powers, and out of thy light al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
a <hi>spirit,</hi> which hath understanding.</p>
               <p>98. For, all the Veins together with the Light in
thee, as also thy Heart and thy Brain, and all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is in thee, make or Constitute <hi>that</hi> spirit, and
that is thy <hi>Soul;</hi> and it well signifieth, the Holy
Ghost, which goeth forth from the Father and the
Sonne, and raigneth in the whole Father: for the
<hi>Soul</hi> of Man raigneth in the <hi>whole</hi> Body.</p>
               <p>99. But the Body or the beastial flesh in man, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth,
the <hi>dead</hi> corrupted Earth, which Man through
his <hi>Fall</hi> hath so framed it to himself, as more shall
be spoken of in its due place.</p>
               <p>100. The <hi>Soul</hi> containeth the first Principle, and
the <hi>Soul's spirit</hi> the second principle, <hi>in Ternario sancto,</hi>
in the Holy Ternary; and the <hi>outward spirit,</hi> viz. the
Astral, containeth the third principle of this world.</p>
               <p>101. Thus you find also the Ternarie of the Deity, in
Beasts: for as the Spirit of a man, is, and Existeth,
so it is also in a Beàst, and therein is no difference.</p>
               <p>102. But the difference, lyeth in <hi>this,</hi> that Man
is made by God himselfe out of the best Kernel or
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61095:51"/>
                  <hi>Pith</hi> of Nature, to be his Angel and Similitude, and
<hi>God Ruleth</hi> in man with his holy Spirit; so that Man
can Speak discourse distinguish and understand all
things.</p>
               <p>103. But a Beast is made of the <hi>wild</hi> Nature of this
World; the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Elements</hi> have generated Beasts
through their motion, according to the will of God.</p>
               <p>104. And so the spirit in Birds, Fowles and
Wormes, Existeth also: and <hi>all</hi> hath its three-fold
source in <hi>similitude</hi> to the Ternary in the Deity.</p>
               <p>105. And you see also the Ternarie of the Deity
in Wood and Stones, as also Herbs, Leaves, and in
Grasse: only <hi>these</hi> are <hi>all</hi> Earthly.</p>
               <p>106. However Nature Generateth nothing, be it
what it will in this World, and though perhaps it
should stand or continue, but scarce a Minute, yet
it is all generated in the Ternarie, or according to the
similitude of God,</p>
               <p>107. <hi>Now Observe:</hi> In either wood, stone or herbs,
there are three things contained, neither can any
thing be generated or grow, if but one of the three
should be left out.</p>
               <p>108.
<list>
                     <item>I. First there is the <hi>Power,</hi> from which <hi>a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
comes to be, whether wood, stone, or
herbs.</item>
                     <item>II. After that in the same, there is a <hi>Sap</hi> in
that thing, which is the <hi>Heart</hi> of the
thing:</item>
                     <item>III. And thirdly, there is in it a <hi>springing</hi>
flowing Power, Smell or Taste, which
is the <hi>spirit</hi> of the thing, whereby it
groweth and encreaseth. Now if any
of these three fail, the thing cannot
<hi>subsist.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61095:52"/>
109. <hi>Thus</hi> you find in Every
thing a Similitude of the <hi>Terna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
in the Divine Being; look
upon what you will; let no man
make himself so stark blind, as
to think <hi>otherwise,</hi> or to think
that God hath no Sonne and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost.</p>
               <p>110. I shall make this <hi>more</hi>
plain and clear, when I come
to write of the <hi>Creation:</hi> for I do
<hi>not borrow</hi> of other men in my
Writings: And though indeed
I quote many Examples and
Testimonies of Gods Saints;
Yet all is written by God in
my Mind, so that I <hi>absolutely</hi>
and infallibly believe, know,
and see it, yet not in the flesh,
but in the spirit, in the <hi>impulse</hi>
and motion of God.</p>
               <p>III. It is not so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61095:52"/>
that my Reason is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or higher than all other
mens living, but I am the Lords
<hi>Twigg</hi> or Branch, and am a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mean and little Spark of his;
he may set me where he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
I cannot <hi>hinder</hi> him in
that.</p>
               <p>112. Neither is this my <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
will,</hi> that I can do it by my
own small ability, for if the
Spirit were withdrawn from
me, then I could neither know
nor understand <hi>my own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
and I must on every side
fight and struggle with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and lye open to temptation
and affliction as well as other
men.</p>
               <p>113. But in the following
Chapters you will <hi>soon see</hi> the
Devil and his Kingdom <hi>laid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:61095:53"/>

               <head>Of the Divine Quality.</head>
               <p>8.
Since thou hast perceived, in the <hi>Third</hi> Chapter,
the Ground of the Ternarie in the Divine Being, I
shall here shew plainly, the <hi>power</hi> and operation, as
also the Qualities or qualification in the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
or, <hi>from what</hi> the Angels were properly and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
created, or what their <hi>Body</hi> and Power is.</p>
               <p>9. And as I said before: All the powers
or vertues are in God the Father, and no man
with his sense and thoughts can <hi>reach</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61095:54"/>
it. But in the Stars and the Elements, as also
by all the creatures in the whole creation of this
World, a Man may <hi>clearly know</hi> it.</p>
               <p>10. All power and vertue is in God the Father,
and proceedeth also forth from him, as Light, Heat,
Cold, Soft, Gentle, Sweet, Bitter, Sowre, astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or harsh, sound or noise, and much more that is
not possible to be spoken or apprehended. <hi>All these</hi> are
in God the Father, one in another as one power, and
yet all these powers move in his <hi>Exit</hi> or going
forth.</p>
               <p>11. But the powers in God do not operate or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify
in that <hi>maner,</hi> as in Nature, in the stars, and
Elements, or in the creatures.</p>
               <p>12. No; you must <hi>not</hi> conceive it so: For Lord <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi>
in his Elevation made the powers of impure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>thus</hi> burning, bitter, cold, astringent, soure,
dark and unclean.</p>
               <p>13. But in the Father, all powers are mild, soft,
like Heaven, very full of joy, for all the powers
tryumph in one another, and their voice or sound
riseth up from Eternity, to Eternity.</p>
               <p>14. There is nothing in them but Love, meeknesse,
mercy, friendlinesse, or courtesie; even such a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing,
rising source or fountain of joy wherein all
the voices of Heavenly joyfulnesse <hi>sound</hi> forth, so as
no man is able to expresse it, nor can it be likened to
any thing.</p>
               <p>15. But if a man <hi>will</hi> Liken it to any thing, it may
<hi>nearest</hi> be Likened to the Soul of Man, when <hi>kindled</hi>
or enlightened by the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>16. For <hi>then</hi> it is thus joyful and tryumphing,
and all powers rise up in it, and tryumph, and so
raise the Bestial Body, that it trembleth: this is a true
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61095:54"/>
glimpse of the <hi>divine</hi> Quality, as the quality is in
God; But in God all is Spirit.</p>
               <p>17. The quality of water, is not of <hi>such</hi> a running
and Qualifying condition or maner in God, as it is
in <hi>this</hi> World; but is a Spirit, very bright cleare and
thinne, wherein the Holy Ghost riseth up; a <hi>meer
power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. The bitter Quality Qualifieth in the sweet,
astringent or harsh and sowre Quality, and the <hi>Love</hi>
riseth up therein from Eternity, to Eternity.</p>
               <p>19. For the Love in the Light and clarity or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Brightnes goeth forth from the <hi>Heart</hi> or Sonne
of God, in all the powers of the Father, and the Holy
Ghost moveth in them all.</p>
               <p>20. And this, in the Deep of the Father, is Like
a Divine<note n="*" place="margin">or SALNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRUM.</note> SALITTER, which I must needs liken
to the <hi>Earth,</hi> which before its corruption was even
such a <hi>Salitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. But not so Hard, Cold, Bitter, Sowre, and
Dark, but like the Deep or like Heaven, very clear and
pure, wherein all powers were <hi>Good</hi> fair and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
But that Prince Lucifer thus <hi>Spoiled</hi> them; as
you shall perceive here following.</p>
               <p>22. This Heavenly Salitter, or powers one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
generate Heavenly joyful fruits and colours;
all manner of Trees and Plants, on which do <hi>grow</hi>
the fair pleasant and lovely fruits of <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>23. There Spring up also in these powers and
vertues, all manner of Blossoms and <hi>Flowers,</hi> with
fair Heavenly colours and smells.</p>
               <p>24. They are of <hi>Several</hi> Tastes, each according to
its Quality and kind, very <hi>Holy, Divine,</hi> and full of
joy.</p>
               <p>25. For every Quality beareth its own fruit, <hi>as it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61095:55"/>
is</hi> in the corrupted murtherous Den or dark Valley
and Dungeon of the Earth; there spring up all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Earthly Trees, Plants, Flowers, and Fruits.</p>
               <p>26. Also <hi>within the Earth, Grow</hi> curious pretious
Stones, Silver, and Gold, and these are a <hi>Type</hi> of the
Heavenly Generating or Production.</p>
               <p>27. Nature <hi>Laboureth</hi> to its utmost diligence upon
this corrupted Dead Earth, that it might generate
Heavenly forms and Species or Kinds; but it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
<hi>only</hi> Dead, Dark, and Hard fruit, which are
no more then a meer shadow or Type of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>28. Moreover its fruit is <hi>altogether</hi> fierce, or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Bitter, Sowre, astringent or harsh and Hot, also
Cold, hard and naught; they have <hi>Scarce</hi> any spark
or spice of Goodnesse in them.</p>
               <p>29. Their Sap and spirit is <hi>mix'd</hi> with hellish
quality, their scent or smell is a very <hi>stink;</hi> thus hath
Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> caused them to be, as I shall clearly
shew hereafter.</p>
               <p>30. Now when I write of Trees, Plants and Fruits,
you must <hi>not</hi> understand them to be <hi>Earthly,</hi> like those
that are in this world: for it is <hi>not</hi> my meaning, that
there should grow in heaven, such Dead hard Trees
of wood; or <hi>such</hi> stones, as consist of an earthly Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>31. No; but my meaning is heavenly and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
yet <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly such:</hi> I mean no other thing,
Then what I set down in the Letter.</p>
               <p>32. In the Divine Pomp and State are especially
<hi>two</hi> things to be considered: <hi>first</hi> the <hi>Salitter</hi> or the
Divine powers, which are moving springing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>33. In <hi>that</hi> same power groweth up and is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61095:55"/>
fruit according to every quality and species or
kind, <hi>viz. heavenly</hi> Trees and Plants, which without
ceasing bear fruit, fairly blossom, and grow in divine
power: so Joyfully, that I can neither speak nor write
it down:</p>
               <p>34. But stammer it like a <hi>child,</hi> that is learning to
speak, and can by <hi>no means</hi> rightly call it, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
giveth it forth, to be known.</p>
               <p>35. The <hi>second</hi> form or property of Heaven in the
divine pompe or state is <hi>Mercurius,</hi> or the Sound,
as, in the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the Earth, there is the Sound,
whence there groweth Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron,
and the like; of which men make all manner of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Instruments</hi> for founding; or for mirth, as Bells,
Organ Pipes, and other <hi>things</hi> that make a sound:
Also there is likewise a Sound in all the creatures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, else all would be in stillnesse and <hi>silence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>36. By that sound in <hi>Heaven</hi> all powers are moved,
so that all things grow Joyfully, and generate very
beautifully: And as the Divine power is manifold
and various, so also the sound or <hi>Mercurius</hi> is also
manifold and various.</p>
               <p>37. For, when the powers spring up in God, they
<hi>touch</hi> and stirre one another and move one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and so there is a constant harmony, <hi>mixing</hi> or
Consort, from whence go forth all manner of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>38. And in those Colours grow all manner of <hi>Fruits;</hi>
which rise or spring up in the <hi>Salitter,</hi> and the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius</hi>
or found mingleth it self therewith, and riseth
up in all the powers of the Father, and then sounding,
and <hi>Tunes,</hi> rise up in the heavenly joyfulnesse.</p>
               <p>39. If you should in this world bring many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
kinds of musical Instruments together, and all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61095:56"/>
should be tuned in the best manner most artificially,
and the most skilful Masters of Musick should play
on them in consort together, all would be no more
then the <hi>Howlings</hi> and barkings of Dogs in <hi>comparison</hi>
of the <hi>Divine Musick,</hi> which riseth up through the
Divine Sound and Tunes from Eternity to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>40. Further, if thou wilt consider the heavenly
Divine Pomp State and <hi>Glory,</hi> and conceive how it
is, and what manner of Sprouting Branching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and joy there is in it;</p>
               <p>41. View this world diligently, and <hi>consider</hi>
what manner of fruit sprouts branches and encreases,
groweth out of the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the Earth, from Trees,
Plants, Herbs, Roots, Flowers, Oyles, Wine, Corn
and whatever else there is that thy <hi>heart</hi> can find
out: <hi>all</hi> is a <hi>Type</hi> of the heavenly Pomp.</p>
               <p>42. <hi>For,</hi> the <hi>earthly</hi> and corrupt nature hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
laboured from the beginning of its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this day to bring forth <hi>heavenly</hi> forms or
shapes in the Earth, as also in Man and Beasts: as
men very well see that every year <hi>New Arts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and brought to Light, which hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
so from the beginning to this time.</p>
               <p>43. But yet Nature hath <hi>not</hi> been <hi>able</hi> to bring
forth heavenly power vertue and qualities, therefore
its fruit is half dead, corrupt, and impure.</p>
               <p>44. You must <hi>not think,</hi> that in the divine pomp,
there cometh forth, Beasts, Worms and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in flesh, as in this World they do: No; but I
mean only the <hi>wonderful</hi> proportion, power, vertue,
and comelinesse of feature in them.</p>
               <p>45. And Nature laboureth with highest diligence,
to produce in its Power <hi>heavenly</hi> figures shapes or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61095:56"/>
forms, as we see in Men, Beasts, Fowles and Worms,
as also in the encrease or growth of the Earth, that
all things are done, shew, and appear most curiously,
Artificially, and delicately.</p>
               <p>46. <hi>For</hi> Nature would fain be delivered from this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that it might procreate heavenly forms in the holy
Power.</p>
               <p>47. For, in the Divine Pomp likewise go forth <hi>all
manner</hi> of Sprouting and Vegetation of Trees, Plants,
and all manner of fruit, and every one beareth <hi>its
own</hi> fruit, yet not in an earthly quality and kind, but
in a <hi>Divine</hi> quality form and kind.</p>
               <p>48. Those fruits are not of so dead, hard, bitter,
soure and astringent a relish for <hi>food;</hi> nor do they <hi>rot</hi>
and grow stinking, as those in this world do; but
all consist in holy Divine power.</p>
               <p>49. Their Constitution or <hi>composition</hi> is from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
power, from the <hi>Salitter</hi> and <hi>Mercurius</hi> of the
divine pomp, and are the food of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>50. If mans <hi>abominable</hi> Fall had not spoiled it, he
would have been feasted, in <hi>such</hi> a manner, in this
world, and have eaten such fruit as indeed they were
presented to him in Paradise, in a <hi>twofold</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>51. But the infectious <hi>Lust,</hi> longing and Malady
of the Devil, who had infected and spoiled the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litter,</hi>
of which <hi>Adam</hi> was made, <hi>that</hi> brought Man
into an <hi>Evil Longing</hi> or Lust <hi>to eat</hi> of both the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
the <hi>Evil</hi> and the <hi>Good,</hi> whereof I shall write
clearly here following, and demonstrate it.</p>

               <p>52.
The Spirit sheweth plainly and clearly, that <hi>before</hi>
the Creation of the <hi>Angels,</hi> the Divine Being with
its rising and qualifying was from eternity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
so <hi>in</hi> the Creation of Angels, as it is also at

with the creaturely heaven, which we behold
with our eyes, as also the Space or Place of the <hi>Earth</hi>

               <p>56. Supposing thereby he should grow hugely and
highly <hi>light</hi> and qualifying, <hi>above</hi> the Sonne of God:
but he became a Fool, therefore <hi>this place</hi> or space
in its burning quality could <hi>not</hi> subsist in God,

               <p>57. But this world at the End, in <hi>Gods</hi> appointed

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61095:57"/>
the Creation of Angels, and Lord Lucifer will
have a <hi>hole</hi> or dungeon for his eternal habitation
therein, and he will <hi>remain</hi> eternally in his kindled
quality, which will be an eternal base filthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
Habitation, an empty void dark valley or

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>58. God in his moving, created the holy Angels
at <hi>once,</hi> not out of a strange <hi>matter,</hi> but out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
out of his <hi>own</hi> power, and eternal wisdom.</p>
               <p>59. But the Philosophers had <hi>this opinion, as</hi> if
God had made the Angels only out of the light: but
they <hi>erred therein,</hi> for they were made not only out
of the light, but out of <hi>all</hi> the Powers of God.</p>
               <p>60. And as I have shewed <hi>before,</hi> there are <hi>two</hi>
things especially to be observed in the Deep of God
the Father: first the power, or all Powers of God the
Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, are very
lovely, pleasant and various, and yet are all <hi>One in
another</hi> as one power.</p>
               <p>61. And as the powers of all the stars <hi>rule</hi> in the
Ayre, so also in God: but every power in God <hi>Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
it self with its operation, severally and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>62. Then afterward the Sound is in every power,
and the Tone or tune of the Sound is according to
the quality of every power; and therein consisteth
the total Heavenly Kingdom of Joy, and so from this
divine <hi>Salitter</hi> and <hi>Mercurius</hi> all Angels are made,
viz. out of the Body of Nature.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61095:58"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>63. But thou mayest here ask: <hi>How</hi> are they made
or generated; or in what way and manner?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>64. If I had the <hi>tongue</hi> of an Angel, and thou
hadst an Angelical <hi>understanding,</hi> we might very fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discourse of it. But the Spirit only doth see it,
and the tongue cannot advance towards it. For I
can use <hi>no other</hi> words, then the words of this world:
but now the Holy Ghost being in thee, thy <hi>Soul</hi> will
well apprehend it.</p>
               <p>65. For behold the totall holy Trinity hath with
its moving Composed <hi>compacted</hi> or figured a Body, or
Image out of it self, like a <hi>little</hi> God, but not so fully
or <hi>strongly</hi> going forth, as the whole Trinity, yet in
some measure according to the <hi>extent</hi> and Capacity
of the Creatures.</p>
               <p>66. For in God there is <hi>neither</hi> beginning nor end,
but the Angels <hi>have</hi> a beginning and end, but not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscriptive
apprehensive palpable or <hi>conclusive:</hi>
for an Angel can sometime be great, and suddenly
little again, their alteration is as swift as mans
thoughts are. All <hi>qualities</hi> and powers are in an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
<hi>as</hi> they are in the whole Deity.</p>
               <p>67. But thou must rightly understand this. They
are made and compacted together, or figured out of
the <hi>Salitter</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi> that is, out of the <hi>exit</hi> or
excrescence,</p>
               <p>68. Consider this <hi>Similitude:</hi> Out of the Sun and
Stars, go forth the Elements, and they make in the
<hi>Salitter</hi> of the Earth a <hi>living</hi> spirit, and the stars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in their Circle or Sphear, and <hi>that</hi> Spirit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61095:58"/>
getteth the quality of the starres.</p>
               <p>69. But now the Spirit after its compaction, is a
severed <hi>distinct</hi> thing, and hath a substance of its
own as all the Stars have, and the stars also are and
remain <hi>severed</hi> and distinct things, each of them is
free to it self.</p>
               <p>70. Neverthelesse the quality of the Stars <hi>reigneth</hi>
in the Spirit; yet the Spirit can and may raise or
demerse it self in its own qualities, or may live in
the <hi>influences</hi> of the stars, as it pleaseth: for it is
free, for it hath gotten the qualities which it hath in
it self, for its <hi>own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>71. And though it <hi>had them</hi> at the beginning from
the stars, yet they are now its proper <hi>own:</hi> Just as a
mother when she hath the seed in her self, as long as
she hath it in her, and that it is <hi>a feed,</hi> it is hers: but
when the seed is become a <hi>child,</hi> then it is no more
the mothers, but is the childs proper own.</p>
               <p>72. And though the child be in the mothers <hi>house,</hi>
and the mother <hi>nourisheth</hi> the child with her food,
and that the child could <hi>not</hi> live without the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet both the Body and the Spirit, which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
out of the mother, are the <hi>Childs</hi> proper own,
and it retaineth its corporeal right to it self.</p>
               <p>73. And in this <hi>manner</hi> it is with the Angels, they
are also all composed framed or figured out of the
<hi>Divine Seed,</hi> but every one hath his own <hi>Body</hi> to it self,
though they are in Gods house, and feed on the <hi>fruit</hi>
of their mother, out of which they were made, yet
their Bodies are their <hi>proper</hi> own.</p>
               <p>74. But the quality <hi>Externally</hi> without them, or
externally without their Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> their mother; is
<hi>not</hi> their propriety, as also their mother is not the
childs propriety; also the <hi>mothers</hi> food is not the

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:61095:59"/>
and then we shall get the Angelical Clarity or Glory
and Purity again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. Now thou wilt ask; How are the Angels then
Created according to the Image of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. First, the compacted figured Body is indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and incorruptible, and not to be <hi>felt</hi> by Mans
Hands; for it is constituted or composed out of the
<hi>Divine</hi> power, and that power is so knit and <hi>bound</hi>
together, that it can never be destroyed again.</p>

an understanding <hi>spirit,</hi> which riseth up in that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</p>
               <p>15. First of all the powers of the Father, generate
a light, whereby an Angel seeth into the <hi>whole</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whereby he can see the <hi>outward</hi> power and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God, which is Externally without its own
Body, and thereby can <hi>see</hi> its fellow-brethren, and
can see and <hi>enjoy</hi> the glorious fruit of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isteth its Joy.</p>
               <p>16. And that light at <hi>first</hi> came out of the Sonne
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61095:59"/>
of God in the powers of the Father, into the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Body creaturely, and is the <hi>Bodies</hi> proper own,
which cannot be withdrawn from it by any thing,
<hi>unlesse</hi> it self extinguisheth it, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did.</p>
               <p>17. Now all the powers, which are in the whole
Angel, generateth that light; and as God the Father
generateth his Sonne to be his <hi>Heart,</hi> so the power of
the Angel generateth also <hi>its</hi> Sonne and Heart in it
self, and that <hi>again</hi> enlightneth all powers, in the
whole Angel.</p>
               <p>18. After that there goeth forth out of all the
powers of the Angel, and also out of the Light of the
Angel; a <hi>fountain,</hi> which springeth or boyleth in
the whole Angel: and that is its <hi>spirit,</hi> which riseth
up into all eternity: for in that spirit is all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and <hi>skill</hi> of all the powers, which are in the
total God.</p>
               <p>19. For, that spirit springeth up out of all the
powers of the Angel, and goeth up into the <hi>Mind,</hi>
where it hath <hi>five</hi> open Doors, there it can look
round about and <hi>see</hi> whatsoever is in God, and also
whatsoever is in it self.</p>
               <p>20. And so goeth forth from all the powers, of
the Angel, as also from the light of the Angel: <hi>as
the Holy Ghost</hi> goeth forth from the Father and the
Sonne, and <hi>filleth</hi> the whole <hi>Corpus</hi> or Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe the Great Mystery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. As there are <hi>Two</hi> things to be observed in God:
the <hi>first</hi> is the <hi>Salitter,</hi> or the Divine powers, out of
which the Body or Corporeity, is: and the <hi>second</hi> is
the <hi>Mercurius,</hi> Tone, Tune or Sound. Thus also it is
in <hi>like manner</hi> and form, in an Angel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61095:60"/>
22. First there is the <hi>power,</hi> and in the power is the
Tone or <hi>Tune,</hi> which riseth up in the spirit, into the
Head, into the <hi>Mind,</hi> as in man in the Brain, and in
the Mind it <hi>hath its open Doors or Gates;</hi> but in the
<hi>Heart</hi> it hath its <hi>Seat</hi> Residence and Original, where
it existeth out of all powers.</p>
               <p>23. For the fountain of all powers floweth<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>or</hi> to.</note> in the
Heart, as it doth also in man, and in the Head it
hath its <hi>Princely</hi> seat, where it seeth all, smelleth all,
and feeleth all.</p>
               <p>24. And now when it seeth and heareth the <hi>divine</hi>
Tone Tune and Sound rise up, which is externally
without it, then is its spirit <hi>affected,</hi> and kindled
with joy, and elevateth it self in its Princely seat,
and <hi>Singeth</hi> and ringeth forth very joyful words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Gods Holinesse, and concerning the fruit
and vegetation of the <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>25. Also concerning the ornament colours and
Beauty of the eternal <hi>Joy,</hi> and concerning the amiable
blessed glance or gracious <hi>aspect</hi> and Countenance of
God the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost; also concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the excellent fraternity fellowship and <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of Angels, concerning the continual everlasting
joyfulnesse, concerning the holiness of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Angels own</hi> Princely Government.</p>
               <p>26. In brief, concerning <hi>all powers,</hi> and that which
proceedeth <hi>from</hi> all Gods powers, which in regard
of the untowardnesse of my corruption in the flesh I
<hi>cannot</hi> write; I would much rather be there present
my self.</p>
               <p>27. But what I cannot write here, I will commit
to <hi>thy Soul</hi> to consider further of it: and at the day
of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> you shall see it most plainly and
clearly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61095:60"/>
28. You should not here scorn my spirit, for it is
<hi>not</hi> sprung forth from the wild Beast, but is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from my power and vertue, and <hi>enlightened</hi> by
the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>29. I write not here without knowledge; but if
thou, like an <hi>Epicure</hi> and Fatted Swine of the Devill,
from the Devils instigation shouldst <hi>mock</hi> at these
things, and say:</p>
               <p>30. The Fool surely hath <hi>not</hi> gone up to heaven,
and seen or heard them: <hi>these</hi> are meer Fables: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the power of my knowledge, I would have
you warned and <hi>Cited</hi> before the severe Judgment of
God.</p>
               <p>31. And though in my body I am <hi>too weak,</hi> to bring
thee thither; yet <hi>That</hi> from which I have my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
is mighty and potent enough to cast thee even
into the Abysse of Hell.</p>
               <p>32. <hi>Therefore</hi> take warning, and consider, that
thou also belongest to the Angelical <hi>Quire,</hi> and read
the following <hi>Hymne</hi> with longing delight, and then
the Holy Ghost will be awakened and stirr'd up in
thee, and thou also wilt get a desire and Longing
after the heavenly <hi>Chorus</hi> and Quire of Dancing.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>33.
The Musician hath wound up his Pegs and tuned
his Strings; the Bridegroom cometh, take <hi>heed</hi> thou

from the <hi>Wedding,</hi> seeing thou hast no <hi>Angelical
Garment</hi> on.</p>
               <p>34. Surely the Gate will be lock'd upon thee, and
so thou wilt not enter in any more, but wilt <hi>Dance</hi>

thee.</p>

               <head>Of the Qualification of an Angel.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>35. The Question now is, What manner of <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification</hi>
hath an Angel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>36. The <hi>Holy Soul</hi> of a man, and the spirit of an
Angel, is and hath one and the same Substance and
Being, and there is no difference therein, but onely
in the <hi>quality</hi> it self, or their corporeal government,
that which qualifieth <hi>outwardly</hi> or from without in
man, by the Ayr, hath a <hi>corrupt earthly</hi> quality; yet
on the other side it hath also a <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi>
quality hidden from the Creatures.</p>
               <p>37. But the <hi>holy</hi> Soul understandeth it well, as the
Kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord rideth on the
wings of the wind,</hi> Psal. 104. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>38. But a simple man may ask: What do you
mean by the word <hi>qualifying,</hi> or, what is that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>39. I mean thereby the power, which in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Angel <hi>entereth in</hi> from without, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
forth again: As in a Similitude; When a
a man fetcheth breath and breatheth it forth again:
for <hi>therein</hi> standeth the life both of the Body and of
the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:61095:61"/>
40. The quality from without, <hi>kindleth</hi> the spirit
in the heart, in the first fountain; whereby all the
powers in the whole Body become stirring, and
then that quality in the corporeal spirit, which is
the <hi>natural Spirit</hi> of an Angel or Man, riseth up into
the Head where it hath its Princely Seat or <hi>Throne</hi>
and Government, and there it hath its <hi>Counsellours,</hi>
whose advice it taketh.</p>
               <p>41. The <hi>first</hi> Counsellour is the <hi>Eyes,</hi> they are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with every thing they look upon, for they are
the <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>42. For, as the Light goeth forth from the Sonne
of God in the whole Father into all the powers, and
<hi>affecteth</hi> all the powers of the Father, and on the other
side all the powers of the Father affect the <hi>Light</hi> of
the Sonne of God:</p>
               <p>43. So do the Eyes work in the thing they look
upon, and the <hi>thing</hi> worketh again in the Eyes, and
the Counsellor, the Eyes bringeth it into the <hi>Head</hi>
before the Princely Seat or Throne; and there it is
to be approved of.</p>
               <p>44. Now if the spirit is <hi>pleased</hi> therewith, then it
bringeth the same to the heart, and the heart giveth
it to the passages or <hi>Issuings</hi> forth of the powers or
fountain-veins in the whole Body; and then the
Mouth, and Hands, and Feet, fall to work.</p>
               <p>45. The <hi>second</hi> Counsellour is the <hi>Ears,</hi> which
have their rise also from all the powers in the whole
body through the spirit, their fountain is <hi>Mercurius</hi>
or the <hi>Sound,</hi> which ariseth from all the powers.</p>
               <p>46. And as in all the powers of God the <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
riseth and soundeth, wherein the heavenly Tone
Tune or Joy consisteth, and the Tone or Tune goeth
forth out of all the powers, and so in the <hi>attraction</hi> of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61095:62"/>
the Spirit in God, is <hi>elevated</hi> or raised up:</p>
               <p>47. And when one power toucheth or stirreth the
other, and tuneth or soundeth; Then the Tune or
Sound <hi>goeth forth,</hi> and riseth up <hi>again</hi> in all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Father; and so all the powers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are <hi>again</hi> affected therewith, whereby they are
alwayes impregnated with the Tune, and <hi>continually</hi>
generate it again in every power.</p>
               <p>48. Thus also the second Counsellour in the
Head, is the <hi>Eares,</hi> they stand open, and the <hi>sound</hi>
goeth forth through them, in all that soundeth.</p>
               <p>49. Now where the <hi>Mercurius</hi> soundeth, and is
elevated, there the <hi>Mercurius</hi> of the spirit goeth also
in, and is thereby affected, and <hi>bringeth it</hi> before the
Princely Throne in the Head, where it is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the <hi>other</hi> Four Counsellours.</p>
               <p>50. And if the Spirit is pleased therewith, then
it bringeth the same before its Mother into the
Heart, and the Heart or the fountain of the heart <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
it</hi> to all the powers in the whole Body; and
then the Mouth and Hands lay hold on it.</p>
               <p>51. But if the <hi>whole</hi> Princely Counsel in the head
Be <hi>not</hi> pleased, so that it is approved, then it lets that
go again, and bringeth it not to the Mother the
Heart.</p>
               <p>52. The <hi>third</hi> Princely Counsellour is the <hi>Nose,</hi>
there the fountain riseth up from the Body in the
Spirit into the Nose, and there it hath two open
Doores or Gates.</p>
               <p>53. And as the Excellent pretious and amiable <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
savour or smell goeth forth from all the powers of
the Father and of the Sonne, and <hi>tempereth</hi> it self with
all the powers of the Holy Ghost, whence the <hi>Holy
Spirit</hi> and most pretious Savour riseth up from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61095:62"/>
fountain of the Holy Ghost: And floweth or boyleth
in all the powers of the Father, and <hi>kindleth</hi> all the
powers of the Father, whereby they are impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>again</hi> with the amiable blessed savour or <hi>Saving
Smell,</hi> and so generate it in the Sonne and Holy Ghost:</p>
               <p>54. <hi>So also</hi> in Angels and Men, the power of the
smell riseth up out of all the powers of the <hi>Body</hi> by
and through the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and cometh forth at the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils</hi>
of the Nose, and is affected with all Smells or
savours, and bringeth them through the Nostrils of
the Nose, which is the third counsellour, into the
Head; before the Princely Seat, or Throne.</p>
               <p>55. And there it is to be proved, <hi>whether</hi> it be
a good smell or savour pleasing to its Constitution
and Complexion, or no: if it be <hi>good,</hi> then it bringeth
the same to its mother, that it may be brought to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
if not, then is it expelled and thrust away.</p>
               <p>56. And <hi>this</hi> Counsellor of the Smell, which is
generated out of the <hi>Salitter,</hi> is also mix'd with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius,</hi>
and so belongeth to the heavenly joyfulnesse,
and is a glorious, <hi>Excellent</hi> and fair fountain in
God.</p>
               <p>57. The <hi>fourth</hi> Princely Counsellour is the <hi>Taste,</hi>
on the <hi>Tongue,</hi> which also ariseth from all the powers
of the Body through the spirit into the Tongue: for
all <hi>fountain-veins</hi> of the whole Body go into the
Tongue, and the tongue is the sharpnesse or <hi>Taste</hi> of
all the powers.</p>
               <p>58. As the Holy Ghost goeth forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Sonne, and is the sharpnesse or <hi>proof</hi> of
all powers, and in his moving or rising up; bringeth
all that which is good, <hi>again</hi> into all the powers of
the Father, whereby the powers of the Father are
<hi>impregnated</hi> again, and so continually generate the
Taste.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61095:63"/>
59. But that which is <hi>not good,</hi> the Holy Ghost
<hi>speweth that out,</hi> as a loathsome <hi>abomination,</hi> as it is
written in the <hi>Apocalypse the 3. Chap. v.</hi> 16. and as
he spewed out the Great Prince <hi>Lucifer</hi> in his pride,
and perdition. For he could no more endure to Taste
the fiery proud <hi>stinking</hi> quality: and thus it is also as
to all Proud stinking Men.</p>
               <p>60. O Man let this be told thee, for the Spirit is
earnestly <hi>Jealous</hi> in this thing especially: <hi>desist</hi> from
Pride, or else it will be with you, as it befell the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils:
there is no jesting or <hi>trifling</hi> herein; the Time
is very short, thou wilt suddenly Taste it, I mean the
hellish fire.</p>
               <p>61. Now as the Holy Ghost proveth all; so the
<hi>Tongue</hi> also proveth all Tastes: and if the same plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Spirit, then it bringeth the same into the
head; to the <hi>other four</hi> Counsellours before the
Princely Seat, and there it is proved, whether it be
profitable or wholsome for the qualities of the
Body.</p>
               <p>62. If so, then is it brought to the Mother, the
<hi>Heart,</hi> which giveth it to all the <hi>veins</hi> or powers of
the Body, and then the Mouth and Hands lay hold
on it.</p>
               <p>63. But if it be <hi>not</hi> good, then the tongue <hi>spits</hi> or
speweth it out, before it comes to the Princely Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</p>
               <p>64. But <hi>though</hi> it be pleasant to the Tongue, and
is of a good Taste, and yet is not <hi>serviceable</hi> and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the whole Body, then it is <hi>rejected</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
when it comes before the Councell, and the
Tongue must spit or <hi>spew</hi> it out, and touch it no
more.</p>
               <p>65. The <hi>fifth</hi> Princely Counsellour is the <hi>Feeling;</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61095:63"/>
which fifth Counsellour ariseth also from all the
powers of the Body in the spirit, into the Head.</p>
               <p>66. For as <hi>all powers</hi> go forth from God the Father
and Sonne, in the Holy Ghost, and so one toucheth
the other, from whence existeth the <hi>Tune</hi> or <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
so that all the powers do sound and move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>67. Else if one did not touch the other, nothing
would stir <hi>at all,</hi> and so this touching maketh the
Holy Ghost <hi>stir,</hi> so that he riseth up in all the powers,
and toucheth all the powers of the Father, wherein
then existeth the heavenly joyfulnesse or <hi>triumphing;</hi>
as also tuning, sounding, generating, blossoming, and
vegetation or Springing, <hi>all</hi> which, hath its rising
from this, that one power <hi>toucheth</hi> the other.</p>
               <p>68. For Christ saith in the Gospel, <hi>John 5. v. 17.
I work, and my Father worketh also.</hi> And he meanet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
this very touching and working, in that every pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
goeth forth from him, and generateth the Holy
Ghost, and in the Holy Ghost all the powers are <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi>
clearly <hi>stirr'd,</hi> by the going forth of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>69. And therefore the Holy Ghost floweth <hi>boyleth</hi>
and riseth up from eternity, and kindleth again, all
the powers of the Father, and maketh them Stirring,
so that they are alwayes impregnated.</p>
               <p>70. In such a manner it is <hi>also</hi> in Angels and Men:
for all powers in the Body arise, and <hi>touch</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or else Angels and Men could Feel nothing.</p>
               <p>71. But if one member be too much <hi>stirr'd,</hi> it cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the whole Body for Help, and the whole Body
<hi>stirs,</hi> as if it were in a great commotion or <hi>Uproar,</hi> as
if the <hi>Enemy</hi> were at hand, and cometh to help that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61095:64"/>
Member, and to deliver and release it from the
Pain.</p>
               <p>72. This you may see if a <hi>Finger</hi> be but hurt,
crush'd or wounded, or any other member of the
Body, be it which it will; presently the Spirit in
that place <hi>runneth</hi> suddenly to the mother the Heart,
and complaineth to the Mother; and if the pain do
but a little <hi>exceed,</hi> then the mother rouzeth up and
awakeneth all the members of the Body, and <hi>all</hi> must
come to help <hi>that</hi> Member.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>73. Thus <hi>one</hi> power continually toucheth and
stirreth the <hi>other</hi> in the whole Body, and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
rise up into the head before the Princely Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
which proveth the stirring of all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>74. Now if one member stirreth <hi>too much,</hi> and at
any time <hi>hurteth</hi> a princely Counsellour; <hi>viz.</hi> by
<hi>Seeing,</hi> it would be in Love with that which it <hi>ought
not</hi> be in love withall.</p>
               <p>75. As Lord Lucifer did, who saw the Sonne of
God, and fell in love with that <hi>high light,</hi> and
moved and stirred himself so very much, intending
to be <hi>equal</hi> with him, or indeed to be <hi>higher</hi> and
brighter then He; such stirring or medling, the
Counsellours reject.</p>
               <p>76. Or if it would stir and move too vehemently
br <hi>Hearing,</hi> and would fain hear false and wicked
Tongues in talking Lies and Fictions, and bring that
to the <hi>heart,</hi> this also is rejected by the Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61095:64"/>
77. Or if it would by the <hi>Smelling</hi> get a Longing
or Lusting after that which is none of its own, as
Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> did also, who longed after the <hi>holy</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
or <hi>Sweet Smell</hi> of the Sonne of God, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his elevation and kindling to smell and savour
yet <hi>more pleasantly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>78. In that manner as he deceived our Mother
<hi>Eve</hi> also, saying; <hi>If she did but eat of the forbidden
Tree,</hi> then <hi>she should be wise</hi> or witty, <hi>and be like God,</hi>
Gen. 3. 5. But this smelling or <hi>stirring,</hi> the Councell
rejected also.</p>
               <p>79. Or if by <hi>Tasting</hi> it should fall into a desire and
longing, to <hi>eat</hi> that which is <hi>not</hi> of the quality of the
Body, or is none of its own; as Mother <hi>Eve</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
fell a longing to eat of the Devils Swine-Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and <hi>did</hi> eat thereof; such stirring in lust the
Councel also rejecteth.</p>
               <p>80. In brief: There are therefore <hi>Five</hi> in the prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Councell, that one should <hi>advise</hi> the other: and
every one is of a peculiar <hi>sundry</hi> Quality, and that
compacted or concreted spirit which is <hi>generated</hi>
out of all the powers, He is their King or Prince, and
he sitteth in the <hi>Head</hi> in the Brain of a Man, and in
an Angel in that Power which is instead of the
Brain of a Man, and in the Head also upon his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Throne, and executeth every thing, which was
concluded and decreed by the whole Princely Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>How an Angel, and a Man, is the Similitude and
Image of God.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1.
BEhold! as the <hi>Being</hi> in God, is, so is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also in <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> and as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Body is, so is also the Angelicall and
humane Body or Corporeity.</p>
            <p>2. But with this difference only, that an Angel
and a Man is a <hi>Creature,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> Being, but
a Sonne of the whole Being, whom the whole being
hath generated: and therefore it is fit that it should
be in <hi>subjection</hi> to the whole Being, seeing it is the
<hi>Sonne</hi> of its Body.</p>
            <p>3. Now if the Sonne resist and <hi>oppose</hi> the Father,
it is but right, that the Father should cast him away
out of the House: seeing the <hi>Sonne</hi> sets himself
against him that hath generated him, and from
whose power he is <hi>become</hi> a Creature.</p>
            <p>4. For if any make somewhat out of that, which
is his own, he may, if it doth <hi>not</hi> prove according
to his will, do with it what he pleaseth, <hi>and make it
either a vessel of honour or dishonour;</hi> which was done
even so to <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The <hi>whole</hi> Divine power of the Father speaketh
forth from all Qualities, the WORD; that is, the
Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:61095:65"/>
6. Now that Voice or <hi>that</hi> WORD, which the
Father speaketh, goeth forth from the Fathers <hi>Salitter</hi>
or powers, and from the Fathers <hi>Mercurius</hi> Sound
or Tune; And the Father speaketh this forth in
himself, and <hi>that</hi> WORD is the very splendor or
Glance proceeding from all his powers.</p>
            <p>7. But when it is spoken forth, it stayeth or stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>no more</hi> in the powers of the Father, but sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or tuneth back again in the whole Father in <hi>all</hi>
powers.</p>
            <p>8. Now that WORD, which the Father <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth</hi>
or speaketh forth, hath such a <hi>sharpnesse,</hi> that
the Tone of the WORD goeth swiftly in a moment,
through the whole <hi>Deep</hi> of the Father, and that
sharpnesse is <hi>the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. For the WORD, which is spoken forth, or
outspoken, abideth as a splendor or glorious<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Edict,</hi>
before the King;</p>
            <p>10. But the Tone or Sound, which goeth forth
through the <hi>Word, executeth</hi> the Edict of the Father,
which he had outspoken through the Word, and that
is the <hi>Birth</hi> or Geniture of <hi>the holy Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. Now behold! An Angel and a Man is thus
also: the power in the whole Body hath all the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi>
as it is in God the Father.</p>
            <p>12. And as all the powers in God the Father, rise
up from eternity to eternity: so all the powers rise
up also in an Angel and in a Man, into the <hi>Head,</hi> for
higher they cannot rise: for they are but Creatures,
which have a Beginning and End.</p>
            <p>13. And in the Head is the <hi>divine</hi> Councel-Seat
or Throne, and it signifieth God the Father, and the
<hi>Five Senses</hi> or qualities are the Counsellours, which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61095:66"/>
have their influences out of the <hi>whole</hi> Body out of all
the powers.</p>
            <p>14. Now the <hi>Five Senses</hi> alwayes sit in Councel
in the Power of the whole Body, and when the
Councels <hi>Decree</hi> is concluded, then the compacted
or concreted <hi>Judge</hi> speaketh it out into its Center or
midst of the Body; as a <hi>WORD,</hi> into the Heart: for
that is the fountain of all powers, from which also it
taketh its rise.</p>
            <p>15. Now it standeth there in the Heart, as a <hi>self-subsisting
Person,</hi> composed out of all powers, and is
a Word; and signifieth God the Sonne; and now it
goeth out from the <hi>Heart</hi> into the <hi>Mouth</hi> on to the
<hi>Tongue,</hi> which is the sharpnesse, and that so sharpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, that it soundeth forth and is distinguished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Five Senses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. From what Quality soever the word taketh
its original, in that quality it is thrust forth upon
the Tongue, and the power of the <hi>distinction</hi> or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
goeth forth from the <hi>Tongue;</hi> and that signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>17. For as the Holy Ghost goeth forth from the
Father and the Sonne, and <hi>distinguisheth</hi> and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all, and effecteth or produceth that, which the
Father speaketh through the Word.</p>
            <p>18. So also the Tongue sharpneth <hi>articulateth</hi> and
distinguisheth all that, which the <hi>Five Senses</hi> in the
head bring through the heart on to the Tongue, and
the Spirit goeth forth from the Tongue through the
<hi>Mercurius</hi> or Tone in <hi>that</hi> place, as it was decreed or
concluded by the Councel of the <hi>five Senses,</hi> and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth
it all.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:61095:66"/>
               <head>Of the Mouth.</head>
               <p>19.
The <hi>Mouth</hi> signifieth, that thou art an un-all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Sonne of thy Father, whether thou art an
Angel or a Man. For through the Mouth thou <hi>must</hi>
draw into thee the power of thy Father, if thou
wilt <hi>live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>20. An Angel must do so, <hi>as well</hi> as a man, though
indeed he needs not to use the Element of <hi>Aire,</hi> in
that manner <hi>as</hi> a man doth; yet he must attract in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself, through the Mouth, <hi>the Spirit,</hi> from which,
the <hi>Ayr</hi> in this world existeth.</p>
               <p>21. For in Heaven there is <hi>no</hi> such Ayr, but the
qualities are very meek and joyful, like a pleasant
cheering <hi>Breath</hi> of wind, and the Holy Ghost is
among all the qualities in the <hi>Salitter</hi> 2nd <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22. And this the Angel <hi>also</hi> must make use of, or
else he cannot be a <hi>moveable</hi> creature, for he must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
eat of the heavenly fruit, through the Mouth.</p>
               <p>23. Thou must <hi>not</hi> understand this in an <hi>earthly</hi>
manner, for an Angel hath no Guts, neither Flesh
nor Bones, but is constituted or composed by the
Divine power, in the shape <hi>form</hi> and manner of a
man, and hath all members, like Man, <hi>except</hi> the
Members of Generation and the Fundament or <hi>going
out of the Draffe,</hi> neither hath an Angel need of
them.</p>
               <p>24. For Man gat his members of Generation and
Fundament first in his dolefull and <hi>lamentable</hi> fall.
An Angel sendeth forth nothing, but the <hi>Divine</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61095:67"/>
which he taketh in at his Mouth, wherewith he
kindleth his heart, and the heart kindleth all the
<hi>members,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> he sendeth forth from himself
again at the Mouth, when he speaketh and praiseth
God.</p>
               <p>25. But the heavenly fruits which he eateth, are
<hi>not</hi> earthly; and though they are in such a <hi>form</hi> and
shape as the earthly are, yet they are meer <hi>Divine</hi>
power, and have such a pleasant Lovely Taste and
Smell, that I cannot liken it to any thing in this
world: for they <hi>Taste</hi> and <hi>Smell</hi> of the <hi>Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>26. Thou must not think, that they are there only
as it were a Type or <hi>shadow</hi> of things; <hi>no:</hi> for the
Spirit sheweth plainly, that in the heavenly pomp
in the heavenly <hi>Salitter</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi> do grow <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Trees, Plants, Flowers, and all <hi>sorts,</hi> of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is in this world but as a type and resemblance:
And as the Angels are, so are the vegetation and
fruits, all <hi>from</hi> the Divine power.</p>
               <p>27. These heavenly Sprouts and Springings thou
must <hi>not wholly</hi> liken to this world: For there are
two Qualities <hi>in this world,</hi> a <hi>Good</hi> and an <hi>Evil:</hi> and
many things grow through the power of the Evill
quality, which doth <hi>not</hi> so in Heaven.</p>
               <p>28. For Heaven hath but <hi>one</hi> form or manner,
nothing groweth there, which is <hi>not good:</hi> Only Lord
Lucifer hath deform'd and dress'd this world in that
manner: And therefore was Mother <hi>Eve ashamed,
when she had eaten</hi> of that which was dress'd by the
<hi>Evil</hi> quality, in like manner also she was ashamed of
her members of Generation, which she had caused
by biting of <hi>this Apple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>29. The Angelical and Heavenly fruit hath <hi>not</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61095:67"/>
such a substance: indeed it is most certain and true,
that <hi>there are</hi> all manner of fruits in <hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>not</hi>
meerly Types and Shadowes: also the Angels <hi>pluck</hi>
them with their Hands, and eat them, as we do that
are Men, but they need <hi>not</hi> any Teeth to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<hi>neither</hi> have they any, for the fruit is of a divine
power.</p>
               <p>30. Now all this, whatsoever an Angel maketh
use of, which is Externally <hi>without</hi> him, for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
of his life, is <hi>not</hi> his corporeal propriety, as
if he had it by a Natural right, but the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
giveth it them in love.</p>
               <p>31. True it is, their Body is their own propriety,
for God hath given it to them for a propriety: Now
whatsoever is given to any for his <hi>own</hi> or for proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that is his by <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and he doth not
deal righteously which taketh it from him again,
unlesse upon condition and agreement: And thus
God doth <hi>not neither,</hi> and therefore an Angel is an
eternal incorruptible Creature which standeth or
subsisteth in all Eternity.</p>
               <p>32. But what would the Body <hi>profit</hi> him, if God
did <hi>not feed</hi> it, for then it would have no mobility,
and would lye still like a dead Block. Now <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
the Angels are obedient to God, and humble
themselves before the <hi>powerful</hi> God, they honour
laud and praise him in his Great Deeds and Works
of <hi>Wonder,</hi> and sing continually of Gods <hi>Holinesse,
Because</hi> He feedeth them.</p>

The right <hi>Love</hi> in the <hi>divine</hi> Nature cometh from

then all the powers in <hi>their</hi> Body are kindled; and

so like wise with him, and the Holy Ghost will get

            <p>1.
HEre the Devil will <hi>oppose</hi> like a Snarling

and he will give the Reader many a sore
stroake, and alwayes put him in <hi>doubt</hi>
that these things are not so.</p>
            <p>2. For nothing doth torment him more, then when
his Glory is <hi>upbraided</hi> to him, by signifying what
a Glorious King and Prince he hath been: when this
is objected to him, then he is in a <hi>rage,</hi> and madnesse,
as if he would storm and overthrow all the world.</p>
            <p>3. If this Chapter, should be lighted upon by a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in whom the fire of the Holy Spirit should be
somewhat <hi>weak,</hi> I fear the Devil would be very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to set upon him, tempting him to <hi>doubting</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the things, set down here, be so or no, that his
kingdome might not stand so very naked, nor his
shame be so <hi>quite</hi> discovered.</p>
            <p>4. Now if he can but suppose he shall bring it to
pass to be doubted of in any heart, he will not <hi>fail</hi>
to use his <hi>utmost</hi> skill pains and labour therein. I
see very well <hi>already,</hi> that he hath it in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

               <hi>Now Observe:</hi>

            <p>6. When God Almighty had <hi>Decreed</hi> in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,

power and <hi>wisdom,</hi> according to the form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Liberty in his Deity, and according to
the <hi>Qualities</hi> in his Divine Being.</p>
            <p>7. At first he made three Kingly Governments or
Dominions, answerable to the <hi>number</hi> of the Holy
Trinity, and each Kingdom had the Order or Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
power and <hi>quality</hi> of the divine Being.</p>
            <p>8. Now elevate thy Sense Thoughts and Spirit

The Place or Space of this world the Deep of the

            <p>9. The other two Kingdoms, that of <hi>Michael</hi> and
that of <hi>Uriel,</hi> those are <hi>above</hi> the created Heaven, and
are like that other Kingdom.</p>
            <p>10. These three Kingdoms together contain such
a Deep, as is not of any <hi>humane</hi> Number, nor can

            <p>15. And the three Kingdoms are <hi>circular</hi> round
about the Sonne of God, <hi>neither</hi> of them is further
or nearer to the Sonne of God, for the one is equally
as near about the Sonne of God as the other.</p>
            <p>16. From <hi>this</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Tree.</hi>

with the Light and power of the Sonne of God
in and through all <hi>Angelical</hi> Kingdomes or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
and without <hi>beyond</hi> and besides all the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Kingdoms, which no Angel or man is able to
dive or search into.</p>
            <p>17. Neither have I any purpose to consider of it
<hi>further,</hi> much lesse to write, but <hi>my Revelation</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
even into the three Kingdoms, like an Angelical
Knowledge.</p>
            <p>18. But <hi>not</hi> in my Reason or apprehension or in
<hi>perfection</hi> like an Angel, but <hi>in part,</hi> and so-long only,
as the Spirit tarrieth in me, further I know it
<hi>not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61095:70"/>
19. When he parteth from me, I know nothing,
but the Elementary and earthly things of this world:
but the Spirit seeth even into the <hi>depth</hi> of Deity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. Now one may ask, what manner of Substance
or thing it is? that the Sonne of God is Generated
in the Center or <hi>midst</hi> of these Three Kingdoms?
<hi>Surely</hi> one Angelical Hoast must needs be nearer unto
him then the other, seeing their Kingdom hath so
great a Deep?</p>
            <p>21. Also then the Glory Clarity or <hi>brightnesse</hi> and
power of the Sonne of God would not be so great
without <hi>beyond</hi> or besides those Kingdoms, as in with
and <hi>among</hi> those that are near him, and as in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Circuit or Court?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. <hi>Answ.</hi> The holy Angels were made to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
from God: that they should <hi>praise sing</hi> ring
forth and Jnbilate before the Heart of God, which
is the Sonne of God, and <hi>tncrease</hi> the heavenly
joy.</p>
            <p>23. <hi>Where</hi> then should the Father else place them,
but before the Gate of his Heart? Doth not all joy of
Man, which is in the <hi>whole</hi> man, arise from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Heart: so in God also then there ariseth
the gyeat joy out of the fountain of his Heart.</p>
            <p>24. And <hi>therefore</hi> hath he created the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
out of himself, which are as it were <hi>little</hi> Gods,
answerable to the Being and qualities of the whole
God, that in the power should Act <hi>forth</hi> the praise,
and sing and ring forth in the power, and <hi>increase</hi> the
arising joy from the heart of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:61095:71"/>
25. But the Splendor and the power of the Sonne of
God, or heart of God, which is the <hi>Light,</hi> or source and
fountain of joy, taketh up his <hi>fairest</hi> and most joyfull
original; in the center or <hi>midst</hi> of these kingdoms, and
shineth into, and <hi>through</hi> all the Angelical Gates.</p>
            <p>26. Thou must understand this <hi>properly,</hi> what the
meaning of it is: for when I speak by way of simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and <hi>liken</hi> the Sonne of God to the Sun or to
a round Globe; it hath not that meaning as if he
were a circumscriptive fountain, which can be <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,</hi>
or whose depth, beginning, or end, could be
fathomed. I write so only by way of similitude, till
the <hi>Reader</hi> may come to the true understanding.</p>
            <p>27. For the meaning is not here, that the Sonne
of God should be generated <hi>only</hi> in the Center or
midst of these Angelical Gates, and no where else
without beyond or <hi>besides</hi> these Angelical Gates.</p>
            <p>28. For the powers of the Father are <hi>every where,</hi>
from and out of which the Sonne is generated and
from which the Holy Ghost goeth forth; <hi>how</hi> should
he then be generated only in the Center of these
Angelical Gates?</p>
            <p>29. This therfore is the only gronnd and <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
that the Holy Father, who is ALL would <hi>have</hi>
in these Angelical * Gates, his most joyful and most
richly loving Qualities, out of which the most joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and most <hi>richly loving</hi> Light, Word, heart, or
fountain of powers; is Generated: and therefore
hath created his Holy Angels in <hi>this</hi> place for his
joy honour and Glory.</p>
            <p>[30. In the Abyssal or bottomlesse Eternity indeed, it
is in one place as well as in another: but where there are
no Creatures, it cannot be known but by the Spirit in its
wonders.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61095:71"/>
31. And this is the <hi>Select</hi> place of the glory of
God, which God the Father, in himself, hath made
choise of, <hi>wherein</hi> his Holy WORD, or heart is
generated in <hi>highest</hi> glory Clarity or brightnes, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and tryumphing joy.</p>
            <p>32. For, Observe this Mystery; The Light,
which is generated out of the powers of the Father,
which is the true fountain of the Sonne of God, is
generated <hi>also</hi> in an Angel, and a Holy Man, so that
in the same light and knowledge he tryumpheth
in <hi>great</hi> joy;</p>
            <p>33. How then is it that he should <hi>not</hi> be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
every where, in the <hi>whole</hi> Father? For his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is ALL, and every where, even there, where our
heart and sences or Thonghts cannot reach.</p>
            <p>34. And so Now, <hi>where</hi> the Father is, <hi>there</hi> is also
the Sonne and the Holy Ghost: for the Father every
where <hi>generateth</hi> the Sonne, his holy WORD, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
light, and sound, and the Holy Ghost, goeth every
where forth, from the Father and the Sonne, even
<hi>within</hi> all the Angelical gates, and <hi>without</hi> besides or
beyond the angelical gates also.</p>
            <p>35. Now if a Man likeneth the Sonne of God to
the <hi>Globe</hi> of the Sun, as I have often done in the
foregoing Chapters; that is spoken in the way and
manner of Natural similitudes, and I was <hi>constrained</hi>
to write so, because of the mis-understanding of the
Reader, that so he might raise his Sense or Thoughts
in these natural things, and climbe from step to step,
from one <hi>degree</hi> to another, till he might come into
the high mysteries.</p>
            <p>36. But it hath not this meaning, that the Sonne of
God is a circumscribed compacted figured Image,
like the Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:61095:72"/>
37. For if it were so, then <hi>must</hi> the Sonne of God
have a beginning, and the Father must have genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him at <hi>once,</hi> and then he could <hi>not</hi> be the Eternal
Almighty Sonne of the Father, but were like a King,
who had yet a <hi>greater</hi> King <hi>above</hi> him, who had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
him in Time, and in whose power it were
to alter and to <hi>change him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>38. This were such a Sonne, as had a beginning,
and his power and splendor were <hi>like</hi> the power of
the Sun which goeth forth from the Sun; the Body
or Globe of the Sun standing still in its place: And
if this were so, then indeed one Angelical<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Part.</hi>
               </note> Gate
would be <hi>nearer</hi> to the Sonne of God, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>39. But here I will shew to thee the highest Gate
of the divine Mystery, and thou needst seek no higher,
for there is no higher.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40. The Fathers power is all, in and above all
Heavens, and the same power every where genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Light. Now this ALL-POWER, is, and
is called, the <hi>all-power</hi> of the Father; and the Light
which is generated out of that all-power, is, and is
called the Sonne.</p>
            <p>41. But it is therefore called the Sonne, in that it
is generated out of the Father, so that it is the <hi>Heart</hi>
of the Father in his powers.</p>
            <p>42. And being <hi>generated,</hi> so it is another Person,
then the Father is: for, the Father is the <hi>power</hi> and
Kingdom, and the Sonne is the <hi>Light</hi> and Splendor
in the Father, and the Holy Ghost is the <hi>moving</hi> or
<hi>exit</hi> out of the powers of the Father and of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61095:72"/>
Sonne, and formeth figureth <hi>frameth</hi> and Imageth
all.</p>
            <p>43. As the <hi>Ayr</hi> goeth forth from the power of
the Sun and Stars, and moveth in this world, and
causeth that all creatures are generated, and that the
Grasse Herbs and Trees spring and grow; and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<hi>all</hi> whatsoever is in this world to be:</p>
            <p>44. So the Holy Ghost goeth forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Sonne, and moveth or acteth, formeth
or frameth and Imageth all that is in the <hi>whole
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>45. All growing or vegetation and forms in the
Father arise and spring up moving in the Holy
Ghost; therefore there is but ONE only GOD, and
<hi>three</hi> distinct <hi>Persons</hi> in one divine Being, Essence or
substance.</p>
            <p>46. Now if a Man should say, the Sonne of God
were an Image, circumscriptive or measureable like
the sun, then the Three Persons would onely be in
that place where the Sonne is, and his splendor or
<hi>shining</hi> would be without or beyond him, and as gone
forth from the Sonne, and the Father would be One,
onely Externally without or besides the Sonne,
and then the power of the Father, which would be
afar off, and wide distant from the Sonne, <hi>would not</hi>
generate the Sonne and Holy Ghost, externally
without and beyond the Angelical Gates; and so
there would be an <hi>un-almighty</hi> Being, Externally
without or besides this place of the Sonne; and
moreover the Father would be a Circumscribed or
measurable Being.</p>
            <p>47. Which is <hi>not</hi> so: but rhe Father every where
generateth the Sonne out of all his powers, and the
Holy Ghost goeth every where forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61095:73"/>
and the Sonne, and so <hi>there is</hi> but ONE onely
God in one Being with three distinct Persons.</p>
            <p>48. Of which you have a similitude in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Gold-Oar or a Gold-Stone, unseparated. First
there is the matter, that is, the <hi>Salitter</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi>
which is the <hi>Mother</hi> or the whole stone, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
the Gold every where in the whole <hi>Stone,</hi> and
in the Gold is the glorious power or vertue of the
Stone.</p>
            <p>49. Now the <hi>Salitter</hi> and <hi>Mercurius</hi> signifie the
Father, the Gold signifieth the Sonne, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or vertue signifies the Holy Ghost: in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
also is the <hi>Ternarie</hi> in the holy Trinity onely, that
all moveth and goeth forth therein universally.</p>
            <p>50. Men find also in a Gold stone a little bit of
it in some place wherein there is more and <hi>purer</hi>
Gold, then in another not discerned, though there is
Gold in the <hi>whole</hi> stone or Oare.</p>
            <p>51. Thus also is the Place or Space in the <hi>Center</hi>
or midst of the Angelical Gates a more pleasant,
more gracious amiable and blessed Place, to the
Father, wherein his Sonne and Heart is generated
in the most richly and fully loving manner, and
wherein the Holy Ghost goeth forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Sonne, in the most richly and fully lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
manner.</p>
            <p>52. Thus you have the right ground of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
and you <hi>ought not</hi> to think, that the Sonne of
God was generated of the Father, at <hi>once</hi> at a <hi>certain
time,</hi> as one that hath a beginning, and that he stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
now as a <hi>King,</hi> and will be worshipped.</p>
            <p>53. No; this were <hi>not</hi> an Eternal Sonne, but one
that had a beginning, and were under beneath or
<hi>inferiour</hi> to the Father, that had generated him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61095:73"/>
54. <hi>Neither</hi> would he be all-knowing, for he
could not know how it was before his Father had
generated him.</p>
            <p>55. But the Sonne is allwayes generated <hi>continually</hi>
from eternity unto eternity, and reshineth alwayes
continually from eternity, into the powers of the
Father again, whereby the powers of the Father are
alwayes from Eternity to Eternity <hi>continually</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with the Sonne, and generateth him
continually.</p>
            <p>56. Out of which, the Holy Ghost <hi>continually</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isteth
from eternity to eternity, and so continually
from eternity to eternity goeth forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Sonne, and hath neither Beginning nor
End.</p>
            <p>57. And <hi>this</hi> Being, is not onely so, in <hi>one</hi> place of
the Father, but <hi>every where,</hi> in the whole Father, who
hath neither beginning nor end; into which, no
creature can reach with its <hi>Senses</hi> or thoughts.</p>

               <p>61.
If a man will find out the mystery, and deepest
Ground; he must diligently and <hi>exactly</hi> view and
consider the Creation of this world, the Government
or Dominion and order or <hi>Ordinance,</hi> as also the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
of the stars, and the elements.</p>
               <p>62. And although these are of a <hi>corrupted</hi> and

for it is but the corrupt <hi>Salitter</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius,</hi>
in which King Lucifer kept House, wherein
is both Evil and Good, though it be indeed the <hi>reall</hi>
power of God, which before its corruption was
bright and pure, as now it is, in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>63. This power of the Stars and Elements, did

<hi>frame</hi> and put into such order again, as the
Kingdome of the Angels <hi>stood in,</hi> in the Divine pomp,
before his fall.</p>
               <p>64. Only thou must <hi>not think,</hi> that the Angelical
Kingdom with its creatures, were so rolled wheeled
and tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d round about, as now the Stars are, which

               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>65. The Sun <hi>standeth</hi> in the Center or <hi>Midst</hi> of the
Deep, and is the light or heart which proceeded out
of all stars: For when the <hi>Salitter</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Creation of the world, in the Kingdome of
Lucifer became thin or dim and bad qualified one
with the other: <hi>then</hi> God extracted the Heart out of
all the powers, and made the Sun thereof.</p>
               <p>66. And <hi>therefore</hi> the Sun is the most shining and
brightest of all, and re-enlighteneth all the starres
again, all the stars <hi>work</hi> in its Power, and it self hath
the power of all the stars, it <hi>kindleth</hi> all the powers
of the stars with its splendour and heat, and so every
Star receiveth from the Sun, according to its power
and condition, or <hi>Kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>67. <hi>Thus</hi> also is the Frame and Constitution of
the Angelical Kingdom: The Sun signifieth the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preamest
Throne-Angel, the <hi>Cherubin</hi> or King, in an
Angelical Kingdom: such a one as Lord Lucifer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
was, before his fall: He had his <hi>seat</hi> in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Midst of his Kingdom, and raigned by his
power <hi>in</hi> all his Angels.</p>
               <p>68. As the Sun ruleth in all the powers of this
world in the <hi>Salitter</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi> that is in soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and hardnesse, in sweetnesse and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bitternesse and astringency, in heat and cold, in Ayr
and Water.</p>
               <p>69. As is <hi>apparent</hi> in Winter, when there is so
hard Cold or Frost, that the water becometh Ice;
though the Sun shineth somewhat warm through all

the cold frost, yet for all its beams by which it shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
on them, it <hi>freezeth</hi> into Snow and Ice.</p>
               <p>70. But <hi>here</hi> I will shew thee the right Mystery.
Behold; the Sun is the Heart of all powers in this
world, and is compacted framed or composed out of
all the powers of the stars, it <hi>re-enlightneth</hi> all the
stars, and all the powers in this world again, and all
powers grow <hi>active</hi> operative or qualifying in its
Power.</p>
               <p>71. [<q>Understand it <hi>Magically:</hi> for it is a Mirrour
Looking-Glasse or Similitude of the Eternall
world:</q>]</p>
               <p>72. As the Father generateth his Sonne, <hi>that is,</hi> his
Heart or light, out of all his powers, and that <hi>light</hi>
which is the Sonne, generateth the <hi>life</hi> in all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

a condition is the Kingdom of Angels, all, according

Understand he hath composed it by the <hi>Fiat, viz.</hi> the
Center of Nature.</q>]</p>
               <p>76. And hath formed out of that the Cherubim
or <hi>King,</hi> that he might presse or penetrate again with
his power into all the Angels, and <hi>affect</hi> them all,
with his power.</p>
               <p>77. As the Sun with its power presseth into all
the Stars, and affecteth them all; or as the power of
God the Son, presseth into all the powers of God the
Father, whereby they are <hi>all</hi> affected, wherein the
Birth or Geniture of the heavenly Joyfulnesse
springeth up.</p>
               <p>78. In this form condition and <hi>manner</hi> it is also
with the Angels. All the Angels of one Kingdome,
signifie, the many and <hi>various powers</hi> of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the Angelical King, signifieth, the Sonne of
the Father, or the <hi>Heart</hi> out of the powers of the
Father; out of which the Angels are made; The
<hi>Exit</hi> out of the King of Angels, or his going forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Angels, or his <hi>affecting</hi> of his Angels, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
God the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>79. And as the Holy Ghost goeth forth from the
Father and the Sonne, and affecteth all the powers
of the Father, as also all heavenly <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>forms,</hi>
from whence all hath its rising, and wherein the
heavenly joyfulnesse doth consist:</p>
               <p>80. Just in such a manner is the <hi>operation</hi> or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of a Cherubim or Throne-Angel, which worketh
or operateth in all his Angels, as the Sonne and Holy
Ghost <hi>operateth</hi> in all the powers of the Father; or
as the Sun operateth in all the powers of the
Stars.</p>
               <p>

81. Whereby all Angels <hi>obtain</hi> the will of the

they all work in his power which is <hi>in them</hi>
all.</p>
               <p>82. For they are the <hi>Members</hi> of his body: as
all the powers of the Father, are <hi>Members</hi> of the

forms and fruits are Members of the Holy Ghost,
and he <hi>their</hi> heart, in whom they rise up.</p>
               <p>83. Or as the Sun is the heart of all the stars, and

THe Angelical Kingdoms are <hi>throughout</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
according to the Divine Being, and
they have no other form or Condition, then
the <hi>Divine</hi> Being hath in its Trinitie.</p>
               <p>2. Onely this is the difference; that their Bodies
are <hi>creatures,</hi> which have a Beginning and End, and
that the Kingdom, where their Locality <hi>habitation</hi> or
Court is, is not their corporeal propriety or proper
own, having it for their Natural right, as they have
their bodies for a <hi>Natural right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But the Kingdom belongs to God the Father,
who hath made it out of his powers, and he may set
it and <hi>dispose</hi> it which way he pleaseth; otherwise
their Body is made according to all, and out of all,
the <hi>powers</hi> of the Father.</p>
               <p>4. And their power generateth the light and
knowledge <hi>in them:</hi> and as God generateth his
Sonne out of <hi>all</hi> his powers; also as the Holy Ghost
goeth forth out of <hi>all</hi> the powers of the Father and
the Sonne: so also in an Angel the Spirit goeth forth
from their Heart, from their light, and from <hi>all</hi>
their powers.</p>

               </p>
               <p>5. As the condition and <hi>constitution</hi> of an Angel
is in his <hi>Corporeal</hi> Body, with all the Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
such is the condition of a whole Kingdom, which
together is as it were one Angel.</p>
               <p>6. If a man rightly considereth all circumstances,
he will find, that the whole government in its loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
circumference or <hi>Region</hi> in a Kingdom, is of the
same Condition or Constitution as the body of an
Angel is, or as the <hi>Holy Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here the Depth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. <hi>All power</hi> is in God the Father, and he is the
<hi>fountain</hi> of all powers in his Deep; in <hi>Him</hi> is Light
and Darknesse, Ayr and Water, Heat and Cold,
Hard and Soft, Thick and Thin, Sound and Tone,
Sweet and Soure, Bitter and Astringent, and that,
which I <hi>cannot</hi> number or rehearse.</p>
               <p>8. Onely I <hi>conceive</hi> of it in my Body, for That is
originally from <hi>Adam</hi> to this time made out of <hi>all
powers,</hi> and <hi>according to the Image of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. But here thou must <hi>not</hi> think, that the powers
in God the Father are in such wise, or qualifie in
such a <hi>corrupt</hi> manner and kind, as in man, which
Lord Lucifer hath so brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to passe; but it is all
very lovely pleasant <hi>delicious</hi> and joyfull, very Gentle
and Meek or Mild.</p>
               <p>10. First there is the Light: (as I may <hi>naturally</hi>
compare or resemble it) like the light of the Sun,
but not so <hi>intolerable;</hi> as the light of the Sun is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
to our corrupted perished Eyes, but very
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61095:77"/>
lovely pleasant and delightful an <hi>Aspect</hi> or Glance of
Love.</p>
               <p>11. But the darknesse is <hi>hidden</hi> in the Center of
the light, that is, when a creature is made out of the
power of the light, and would move and boyl <hi>higher</hi>
and faster in that light then God Himself doth; then
that light would go out and be <hi>extinguished</hi> in that
Creature.</p>
               <p>12. [<q>Understand, the Creature kindleth the fire, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
its spirit elevateth it self beyond the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
that is</hi> from Love: Read the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
and <hi>Third</hi> Book, viz. the Three
Principles, and the Three-fold Life of
Man.</q>]</p>
               <p>13. And instead of Light it hath <hi>darknesse,</hi> and
therein the Creature is <hi>sensible</hi> by experience, that
there is a darknesse, hidden in the Center.</p>
               <p>14. As when a man kindleth a Wax <hi>Candle,</hi> it
giveth Light, but when it is put out, then is the
Snuffe or Candle, darknesse: <hi>Thus</hi> also the light shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
from all the powers of the Father: but when
the powers are perished or <hi>corrupted,</hi> then the light
is extinguished, and the powers would remain in
darknesse, as is apparant by <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. The Ayr also is not of such a kind <hi>in God,</hi> but
is a lovely pleasant still breath or voyce blowing or
moving; that is; The <hi>exit</hi> going forth, or moving, of
the powers, is the <hi>original</hi> of the Ayr, in which the
Holy Ghost riseth up.</p>
               <p>16. Neither is the water of such a kind in God,
but it is the <hi>source</hi> or fountain in the powers, <hi>not</hi> of
an elementary kind, as in this world; if I should li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it to any thing, I must liken it to the Sap or <hi>Juyce</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61095:78"/>
in an Apple, but very bright and <hi>lightsome</hi> like Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is the Spirit of all powers.</p>
               <p>17. It is Lord Lucifer which hath thus <hi>spoiled</hi> it,
that it rageth and raveth so in this world, which so
runneth and floweth and is so thick and dark, and
moreover <hi>if it runneth not</hi> it becometh stinking; of
which I shall treat more largely, when I shall write
of <hi>the Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. The Heat is in God a most lovely pleasant
soft gentle mild meek warmth, an <hi>exit</hi> or going forth
of light, which expandeth it self rising up <hi>from</hi> the
light, wherein the source or fountain of Love Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up.</p>
               <p>19. The Cold also in God is not of such a kind,
but is a cooling or refreshing of the Heat, a mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or allaying of the Spirit, a rising up boyling or
moving of the Spirit.</p>

               <p>21. Now the Question is: What is the wrath

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here there are chiefly <hi>Seven</hi> sorts of Qualities or
Circumstances to be observed.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I. Of the First Species or
Circumstance.</head>
               <p>22.
First there is in the Divine power hidden in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
the astringent Quality, which is a Quality of
the <hi>Kernel</hi> Pith or hidden Being, a sharp compaction
or penetration in the <hi>Salitter</hi> very sharp and harsh or
astringent, which <hi>generates</hi> hardnesse and also cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and when that heat is <hi>kindled,</hi> it generateth a
sharpnesse like to <hi>Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>23. This is one <hi>Species</hi> or source of wrath in the
Divine <hi>Salitter,</hi> and when this source is kindled,
which may be done by <hi>great motion</hi> or elevation,
touching or stirring, then the astringent causeth, or
qualifieth in, great <hi>coldnesse,</hi> which is very sharp, like
to Salt, very hard binding knitting and <hi>attracting</hi>
together like a Stone.</p>
               <p>24. But in the heavenly Pomp or State it is not so
elevating; for it doth <hi>not elevate</hi> it self, neither doth
it kindle it self; Onely, King <hi>Lucifer</hi> hath kindled
this quality in his Kingdom, through his Elevation
and <hi>Pride,</hi> whence this quality is <hi>burning</hi> even till the
Last Day.</p>
               <p>25. And by this now, in the Creation of this
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61095:79"/>
world, the Stars and the Elements, as also the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<hi>tremble</hi> and burn, out of which existeth also the
House of Death and of Hell, also an Eternal Base
loathsome Habitation for the Kingdom of <hi>Lucifer</hi>
and for all <hi>wicked</hi> Men.</p>
               <p>26. This Quality generateth in the heavenly
Pomp, the <hi>sharpnesse</hi> of the spirit, out of which, and
whereby, the creaturely Being is so formed or consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
that a heavenly <hi>Body</hi> may be framed, as also
all manner of colours, forms and sprouts or vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>27. For it is the contraction <hi>compacting</hi> or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of a thing, and therefore it is the first Quality,
and a <hi>beginning</hi> of the Angelical Creatures, and of
all Images or figurations which are in Heaven, and
which are in this world, and all <hi>whatsoever</hi> can be
named or expressed.</p>
               <p>28. But if it be kindled through elevation, which
those creatures <hi>onely</hi> can do in their own Kingdome,
which are created out of the <hi>Divine Salitter,</hi> then
it is a burning source-vein of the wrath of God.</p>
               <p>29. For it is one of the <hi>seven Spirits of God,</hi> in whose
power standeth the Divine Being in the whole or
<hi>total</hi> Divine Power and heavenly Pomp.</p>
               <p>30. And so if it be kindled, then it is a <hi>fierce</hi> source
of wrath, and a beginning of hell, and a torment and
woe of the hellish fire, also a quality of <hi>darknesse;</hi>
for the Divine Love, and also the Divine Light are
extinguished <hi>therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. [<q>It is a Key, which locketh in to the Chamber of
<hi>Death,</hi> and generateth Death, from
whence proceedeth Earth, stones, and all
hard things.</q>]</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:61095:79"/>
               <head>II. Of the Second Species or
Circumstance.</head>
               <p>32.
The <hi>Second</hi> Quality or Second Spirit of God in the
Divine <hi>Salitter,</hi> or in the Divine power, is the <hi>sweet</hi>
quality, which worketh in the astringent, and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth
the astringent, so that it is altogether lovely
pleasant and mild or meek.</p>
               <p>33. For it is the <hi>overcoming</hi> of the astringent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and is the very source or <hi>fountain</hi> of the Mercy
of God, which overcometh the wrath, whereby the
astringent harsh source is <hi>mollified,</hi> and Gods Mercy
riseth up.</p>
               <p>34. Of this you have a <hi>Similitude</hi> in an Apple,
which at first is astringent <hi>harsh</hi> or choaky, but when
the sweet quality forceth and overcometh it, then it
is very soft lovely and pleasant to <hi>eat:</hi> and thus it is
also in the Divine power.</p>
               <p>35. For when Men speak of the mercy of God
the Father, they speak of his <hi>power,</hi> of his <hi>fountain</hi>
spirits of the qualities, which are in the <hi>Salitter</hi> out
of which his most richly loving <hi>Heart</hi> or Sonne is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>36. The astringent or harsh Quality is the Heart
Pith or <hi>Kernel</hi> in the Divine power, the contraction
compaction or imaging forming or impression; for
it is the sharpnesse and <hi>cold,</hi> as is seen, that the harsh
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61095:80"/>
astringent cold <hi>dryeth</hi> the water, and maketh it sharp
Ice.</p>
               <p>37. And the sweet Quality is the <hi>allaying</hi> or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
whereby the harsh or astringent and cold qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
becometh thin and <hi>soft,</hi> whence the water taketh
its original.</p>
               <p>38. Thus the astringent quality <hi>is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Germanicè Barm-Hertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit, Warm-Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse. Mercy.</note> and <hi>is called</hi>
the Heart; and the sweet, is called <hi>Barm,</hi> or <hi>Warm,</hi>
or softening or <hi>mitiga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing:</hi> and they are the two Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
out of which the Heart or the Sonne of God
is generated.</p>
               <p>39. For the astringent or <hi>harsh</hi> quality, in its stock
or kernel when it qualifieth or operateth in its own
Power, is a Darknesse: And the sweet Quality, in
its own power is a moving boyling warming and
rising Light, a source or <hi>fountain</hi> of meeknesse and
well-doing.</p>
               <p>40. But while both of them qualifie or operate
one in another, in the Divine power; as if they were
but <hi>one</hi> power, they are a meek mild lovely pleasant
<hi>merciful</hi> qualifying.</p>
               <p>41. And these two Qualities are <hi>two</hi> of the spirits
of God among the <hi>Seven</hi> qualifying or fountain-Spirits
in the Divine power.</p>
               <p>42. Whereof you have an Image in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>John:</hi> Apocalypse, Chap. 1. where he seeth
<hi>seven Golden Candlesticks</hi> or Lights <hi>before the Sonne of
God,</hi> which signifie <hi>the seven spirits of God,</hi> which
shine in great clarity brightnesse or lustre before the
Sonne of God, out of which the Sonne of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
generated from eternity to eternity, and is
the Heart of the seven Spirits of God, which I will
here describe in <hi>order</hi> one after another.</p>
               <p>43. You must here elevate your sense or mind in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61095:80"/>
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> if you intend to understand and <hi>apprehend</hi>
it: Or else in your own sense or mind you will be
an astringent hard blind Stock.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>III. Of the Third Circumstance
or Species.</head>
               <p>44.
The Third Quality or the Third Spirit of God,
in the Fathers power, is the bitter quality; which
is a penetrating or <hi>forcing</hi> of the sweet and astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or harsh Quality, which is <hi>trembling,</hi> penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and rising up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>45. The astringent or harsh quality is the kernel
or stock, or soure or <hi>attractive,</hi> and the sweet is the
light <hi>mollifying</hi> and softning, and the bitter is <hi>pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating</hi>
or triumphing; which riseth up and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth
in the astringent or harsh and sweet qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>46. This is the source of joy, or the cause of the
<hi>laughing</hi> elevating Joy, whereby a thing trembleth
and Jubilateth for Joy; whence the heavenly joy
existeth.</p>
               <p>47. Moreover, it is the Imaging or forming of all
sorts of <hi>Red</hi> colours in its own quality: in the sweet
it Imageth or formeth all sorts of <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Blew:</hi> in
the astringent or harsh and soure, it formeth all sorts
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61095:81"/>
of <hi>Green Dusky</hi> and mix'd colours, with all manner
of forms or <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Smells.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48. The bitter quality is the first spirit, whence
the <hi>life</hi> becometh stirring, from whence mobility
taketh its original, and is well called <hi>Cor</hi> or the
Heart, for it is the trembling shivering elevating pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
spirit, a triumphing, or Joy, an elevating
source of <hi>laughing,</hi> in the sweet quality the bitter is
mollified, so that it becometh very richly loving and
Joyfull.</p>
               <p>49. But if it be moved, elevated and kindled too
much, then it kindleth the sweet and astringent or
harsh quality, and is like a tearing, stinging and
<hi>Burning</hi> Poyson, as when a man is tormented with a
raging plague-sore, which maketh him <hi>cry out</hi> for
woe and misery.</p>
               <p>50. This quality in the Divine power, when it is
kindled, is the spirit of the Zealous or Jealous and
bitter <hi>wrath</hi> of God, which is unquenchable, as may
be seen by the Legions of <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>51. Yet further, this quality, when it is kindled,
is the bitter <hi>hellish</hi> fire, which putteth out the Light,
turning the sweet quality into a <hi>Stinck,</hi> causing a
sharpnesse and tearing, a hardnesse and coldnesse, in
the astringent or harsh quality.</p>
               <p>52. In the sowre quality it causeth a <hi>ranknesse</hi> and
brittlenesse, a stinck, misery, a house of mourning, a
house of darknesse, of Death and of Hell, an End of
Joy, which therein can no more be thought upon:
for it cannot be quieted, or <hi>stilled</hi> by any thing, nor
can be enlightned again by any thing, but the dark,
astringent or harsh, stinking, sowre, torn, bitter
<hi>fierce</hi> quality riseth up to all Eternity.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:61095:81"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>53. In these three Species or Qualities standeth
the Corporeal Being, or the <hi>Creatural</hi> Being of all
Creatures in heaven and in this world, whether it
be Angel, or Man, Beast, or Fowl, or Vegetable, of
a heavenly or earthly form, quality, and kind, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>all</hi> colours and forms.</p>
               <p>54. Briefly, whatsoever Imageth it self, standeth
in the power and authority of these three <hi>head Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi>
and is formed by them, and also is formed out
of its own power.</p>
               <p>55. First the astringent and sowr quality is a <hi>Body</hi>
or source, which attracteth the sweet power, and
the cold in the astringent or harsh quality maketh it
<hi>Dry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>56. For the sweet quality is the heart of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for it is thin and light or bright, and is like
Heaven: and the bitter quality maketh it separable
or <hi>distinct,</hi> so that the powers form themselves into
<hi>Members,</hi> and causeth mobility in the Body.</p>
               <p>57. And when the sweet quality is dryed, then it
is a <hi>Corpus</hi> or Body, which is perfect, but wanting
Reason.</p>
               <p>58. And the Bitter quality penetrateth into the
<hi>Body,</hi> into the astringent sowre and sweet quality, and
frameth all sorts of Colours according to that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which the Body is <hi>most eagerly</hi> inclined to, or to
that quality which is strongest in the Body: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that the bitter quality frameth the Body with
its <hi>colours,</hi> and according to that quality the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath her greatest impulse and inclination, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
boyling and will.</p>
            </div>

               <head>IIII. Of the Fourth Circumstance
or Species.</head>
               <p>59.
The fourth Quality, or the fourth fountain-Spirit
in the Divine power of God the Father is the Heat,
which is the true <hi>Beginning</hi> of life, and also the true
<hi>Spirit</hi> of Life.</p>
               <p>60. The astringent or harsh, sowre, and sweet,
quality is the <hi>Salitter,</hi> which belongeth to the <hi>Body,</hi>
out of which the Body is framed.</p>
               <p>61. For coldnesse and hardnesse standeth in the
astringent quality, and is a <hi>contraction</hi> and Drying;
and in the <hi>sweet</hi> quality standeth the water, and the
light or shiningnesse, and the whole matter of the
Body.</p>
               <p>62. And the bitter quality is the <hi>separation</hi> and
forming, and the Heat is the Spirit or the kindling
of the life, whereby the Spirit existeth in the Body,
which springeth or moveth in the whole Body, and
shineth out from the Body; also maketh the <hi>living
motion</hi> in all the qualities of the Body.</p>
               <p>63. Two things are chiefly to be eyed in <hi>all the
qualities:</hi> if you look upon a Body, you see first the
Stock Pith or the Kernel of all the qualities, which
is framed or <hi>Composed</hi> out of all the qualities: for to
the Body belong the astringent or harsh, soure, sweet,
bitter and hot qualities; These qualities being <hi>dryed
together,</hi> make the Body or Stock.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:61095:82"/>
               <head>The Great Mysterie of the
Spirit.</head>
               <p>64.
Now these Qualities are <hi>mix'd</hi> in the Body, as if
they were all but <hi>one</hi> quality; and yet each quality
moveth or boyleth in its own power, and so goeth
forth.</p>
               <p>65. <hi>Each</hi> quality goeth forth from it self into the
other, and <hi>toucheth</hi> or stirreth the other, that is, it
<hi>affecteth</hi> the other, whereby the other qualities get
the will of this; that is, they prove the sharpnesse
and spirit of this quality, as to what <hi>is in it,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
mix with it continually.</p>
               <p>66. Now the astringent or harsh quality together
with the sowre, alwaies <hi>contract</hi> or attract the other
qualities together, and so apprehend and retain the
Body, and Dry it.</p>
               <p>67. For it dryeth all the other powers, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth</hi>
them all through its infection or <hi>influence,</hi> and
the sweet softneth and moistneth all the other, and
so blendeth and tempereth it self with all the other,
whereby they become daintily pleasant and mild or
soft.</p>
               <p>68. And the bitter maketh all the other <hi>stirring</hi>
and moveable, and parteth or distinguisheth them
into members; so that every member in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
obtaineth the <hi>fountain</hi> of all the powers,
whence mobility existeth.</p>
               <p>69. And the Heat kindleth all the qualities, out
of which the light riseth up and expandeth it self
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61095:83"/>
aloft in <hi>all</hi> the qualities, so that the one seeth the
other: for when the <hi>Heat</hi> worketh in the sweet Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
then it generateth the Light in all the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
so that the one seeth the other.</p>
               <p>70. From whence the Senses and Thoughts exist,
so that the one quality seeth the other, which is also
in it and <hi>tempered</hi> with it self, and <hi>proveth</hi> it with its
sharpnesse, so that it becometh to be a will, which
in the Body riseth up in the first fountain source or
well-spring in the <hi>astringent</hi> or harsh quality.</p>
               <p>71. And there the bitter quality penetrateth in
the heat through the astringent, and the sweet in the
water letteth it <hi>easily</hi> or Gently through; and there
the bitter in the heat goeth <hi>through</hi> the sweet water
forth from the Body, and maketh <hi>two</hi> open <hi>Gates,</hi>
which are the Eyes, the first Sense, or Sensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>72. You have an example and type or <hi>resemblance</hi>
of this; If <hi>you</hi> behold and consider this world, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Earth, which is of the <hi>kind and Condition</hi> of
all qualities, and all <hi>manner</hi> of figures or shapes are
formed and Imaged therein.</p>
               <p>73. First the astringent quality is therein, which
attracteth the <hi>Salitter</hi> together, and <hi>fixeth</hi> or maketh
the Earth firm and compact, so that it cometh to be
a solid <hi>Body,</hi> which holds together and doth not break
asunder, and Imageth or frameth or formeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>all manner</hi> of Bodies, according to the kind of each
quality, <hi>viz.</hi> all manner of Stones and Oares of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
and all manner of Roots, according to the
<hi>condition</hi> or kind of each quality.</p>
               <p>74. Now when that is Imaged or formed, there
it lyeth as a <hi>corporeal</hi> springing boyling mobility, for
it moveth or boyleth <hi>thorough,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> the bitter qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61095:83"/>
in it self, as in its own Imaged formed or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Body: But hath <hi>as yet</hi> no life to growing vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
springing or spreading abroad <hi>without</hi> the
Heat, which is the<note n="*" place="margin">or Nature-Spirit.</note> 
                  <hi>Spirit</hi> of Nature.</p>
               <p>75. But when the heat of the Sun <hi>shineth</hi> upon the
Earth, then there spring and grow in the Earth all
manner of Images or Figures of Oares or Minerals,
Herbs, Roots and Worms, and <hi>all whatsoever</hi> is
therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Understand this aright:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>76. The heat of the Sun kindleth, in the earth, the
sweet quality of water, in all Imaged or framed
<hi>figures:</hi> and then through the heat the light cometh
to be in the sweet water, and that <hi>enlightneth</hi> the
astringent, sowre, and bitter, qualities, so that they
see <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by</hi> the light: and in that seeing the one ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
up into the other, and <hi>proveth</hi> the other; that is,
in that seeing, the one tasteth of the others sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
from whence cometh the Taste.</p>
               <p>77. And when the sweet quality tasteth the <hi>Taste</hi>
of the bitter quality, it<note n="*" place="margin">Checks or stops it. Flend flemmet undweich.</note> caggs at it, and giveth
back even as a man when he tasteth astringent harsh
or bitter <hi>Gall,</hi> he openeth both the<note n="†" place="margin">Throat or Jawes.</note> Gummes of his
<hi>Pallate</hi> in his Mouth in his<note n="*" place="margin">or check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Cagging, and wideneth
his Pallate <hi>more</hi> then it is of it self; and just so doth
the sweet Quality against the Bitter.</p>
               <p>78. And when the sweet quality thus stretcheth
or <hi>wideneth</hi> it self, and retireth from the bitter, then
the astringent alwayes presseth after it, and <hi>would</hi>
also fain taste of the sweet; and alwaies maketh
the Body that is behind it, and <hi>in</hi> it, to be Dry: for
the sweet quality is the Mother of the water, and is
very meek mild soft and Gentle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:61095:84"/>
79. Now when the astringent or harsh and bitter
quality get <hi>their</hi> light from the Heat, then they <hi>see</hi>
the sweet quality, and taste of its sweet water, and
then they continually make <hi>haste after</hi> the sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and drink it up, for they are very Hard, rough,
and thirsty, and the Heat dryeth them <hi>quite
up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>80. And the sweet quality alwaies flyeth from
the Bitter and Astringent, and stretcheth its<note n="*" place="margin">Throat or Jawes.</note> Pallate
alwayes <hi>wider,</hi> and the Bitter and astringent conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
hasten after the sweet, and <hi>refresh</hi> themselves
from the sweet, and dry up the Body.</p>
               <p>81. Thus is the true Springing or <hi>vegetation</hi> in
Nature, be it in Man, Beasts, Wood, Herbs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
Stones.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Now observe the End of Nature
in this World.</head>
               <p>82.
When the sweet quality thus flyeth from the
bitter, sowre and astringent, then the astringent and
bitter make <hi>all the haste they can</hi> after it, as their best
treasure; and the sweet presseth vehemently from
them, and striveth so much, that it <hi>driveth</hi> and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrateth
through the astringent or harsh quality,
and <hi>rends</hi> the Body, and goeth forth from the Body,
out above the earth, and hasteneth so fast, till a long
<hi>stalk</hi> groweth up.</p>
               <p>83. And then the heat above the earth presseth
upon the stalk, and so the bitter quality is then
kindled by the Heat, and<note n="*" place="margin">the Stalk.</note> it receiveth a <hi>repulse</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:61095:84"/>
from the Heat, so that it is terrified, and the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality dryeth it.</p>
               <p>84. And therein the astringent, the sweet, the
bitter, and the Heat, <hi>struggle</hi> together, and the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality in its coldnesse continually maketh its
drinesse, and so the sweet withdraweth on the <hi>sides,</hi>
and the other hasten after it.</p>
               <p>85. But when it seeth that it is <hi>like</hi> to be taken or
captivated, the bitter quality from <hi>within</hi> pressing
so hard upon it, and the heat from <hi>without</hi> pressing
upon it also, it maketh the bitter, fervent, or burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and inflameth it, and there it <hi>leapeth,</hi> springing
up through the astringent quality, and riseth up
again aloft, so there cometh to be a hard <hi>knot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it in that place, where the struggling was, and
the knot gets a Hole or <hi>Orifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>86. But when the sweet quality leapeth or spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up through the knot, then the bitter quality had
so much <hi>affected</hi> or wrought upon it, that it was all
in a trembling; and as soon as it cometh <hi>above</hi> the
knot, it suddenly stretcheth it self forth on <hi>all</hi> sides,
striving to flie from the bitter quality: and in that
stretching forth, its Body keepeth <hi>hallow</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and in the trembling leaping or <hi>springing up</hi>
through the knot, it still gets more Stalk or leaves,
and now is frolick or cheerly that it hath escaped
the <hi>Battle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>87. And so when the heat from without, thus
presseth upon the stalk, then the qualities become
<hi>kindled</hi> in the stalk, and presse through the stalk, and
so become affected or wrought upon in the external
light of the Sun, and generate <hi>colours</hi> in the stalk, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the kind of its quality.</p>
               <p>88. But so long as the Sweet water is in the stalk,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61095:85"/>
the stalk <hi>retaineth</hi> its greenish colour according to
the kind of the sweet quality.</p>
               <p>89. And such matters the qualities alwaies bring
to passe with the heat in the stalk, and the stalk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
groweth <hi>further,</hi> and alwayes one <hi>Storm</hi> or
assault is held after another, whereby the stalk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
getteth <hi>more</hi> knots, and still spreadeth forth
its branches further and further.</p>
               <p>90. In the mean while, the heat from without
alwayes dryeth the sweet water in the stalk, and the
stalk alwaies is <hi>smaller</hi> at the Top; the higher it
groweth, the smaller it is, <hi>growing on</hi> so long, till it
can escape or run <hi>no</hi> further.</p>
               <p>91. And then the sweet quality yieldeth to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>captive,</hi> and so the bitter, sowre, sweet, and astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
do raign joyntly together, and the sweet stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
it self a little forth, but it can <hi>escape</hi> no more,
for it is captivated or caught.</p>
               <p>92. And then from all the qualities, which are
in the Body, there groweth a <hi>Bud</hi> or Head, and there
is a new Body in the Bud or head, and is formed or
figured <hi>answerable</hi> or like to the first Root in the
Earth, onely now it gets another more subtile
form.</p>
               <p>93. And then the sweet quality extends it self
Gently or mildly, and there grow little <hi>subtile</hi> leaves
in the Head which are of the kind of all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and then the sweet water is as it were a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
woman new with child, having <hi>conceived</hi> the
Seed, and it alwaies presseth onward, till it openeth
the Head.</p>
               <p>94. And then also it presseth forth in <hi>little</hi> leaves,
like a woman which is in travel and bringing forth,
but the little Leaves or <hi>Blossoms</hi> have no more its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61095:85"/>
and form, but the form of all the Qualities:
for now the sweet quality must bring forth the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
of the other Qualities.</p>
               <p>95. And when this <hi>sweet Mother</hi> hath brought
forth the Fair, Green, Blew, White, Red, and Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
Flowers Blossoms or Children, then she grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>quite</hi> weary, and cannot long nourish or Nurse
these children, neither can she have them long, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are but her <hi>step-children,</hi> which are very
tender.</p>
               <p>96. And so when the <hi>outward</hi> heat presseth upon
these tender children, all the qualities in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
cannot be kindled, for the Spirit of Life quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
or floweth in them.</p>
               <p>97. And seeing they are <hi>too weak</hi> for this strong
Spirit, and cannot elevate themselves, they yeeld or
surrender their Noble power, and that smells so
<hi>lovely</hi> and with so pleasant a savour, that it rejoyceth
the very Heart, and maketh it Laugh: but they <hi>must
wither</hi> and fall off, because they are too tender for
this Spirit.</p>
               <p>98. For the Spirit draweth from the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Bud</hi>
into the Blossoms, and the Head or Bud is formed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>kind</hi> of all the Qualities; the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality attracteth or collecteth the Body of the
Bud or Head, and the sweet quality softneth it and
spreadeth it abroad, and the Bitter quality parteth
or <hi>distinguisheth</hi> the matter into Members, and the
Heat is the <hi>living</hi> spirit therein.</p>
               <p>99. Now all the qualities labour or work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and bring forth their fruit or children, and <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
child is qualified or conditioned according to the
kind and property of <hi>all</hi> the Qualities.</p>
               <p>100. This they drive and act so long till all the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61095:86"/>
                  <hi>matter</hi> be quite dryed, till the sweet quality or sweet
water be dryed up, and then the <hi>fruit falls off,</hi> and
the <hi>stalk</hi> dryeth also and falleth down.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>And this is the end of Nature
in this World.</head>
               <p>101.
Concerning this, much higher things are to be
written, which you will find concerning the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this world: this is <hi>only</hi> brought in for a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,</hi>
and described in the briefest manner.</p>
               <p>102.
Now the <hi>other</hi> form or kind of Qualities or of the
Divine Powers, or of the Seven Spirits of God, are
especially to be observed or known by the <hi>Instance</hi>
or Example of Heat.</p>
               <p>103. First there is the ground, or the corporeall
Being, although in the Deity or in the Creatures
either, it hath no peculiar or <hi>several</hi> Body, but all
the Qualities are in one another as <hi>One,</hi> however the
operation of every quality is perceived in particular
and <hi>severally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>104. Now in the Body or fountain is the Heat,
which <hi>generateth</hi> the <hi>fire,</hi> which is a form or kind of
thing which a man <hi>can</hi> search into, and out of the
heat goeth the light <hi>through</hi> all the Spirits and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
and the light is the <hi>living</hi> Spirit, which a
man <hi>cannot</hi> search into.</p>
               <p>105. Bnt a man <hi>can</hi> search into its <hi>will,</hi> and know
what it willeth, or <hi>how</hi> it is: for it proceedeth in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61095:86"/>
the sweet quality, and the Light riseth up in the
<hi>sweet</hi> Quality in the sweet water, and <hi>not</hi> in the other
qualities.</p>
               <p>106. For Example; thou <hi>canst</hi> kindle <hi>all things</hi>
in this world, and so make them give light and burn,
if the <hi>sweet</hi> Quality have the predominancy in it;
and where the other qualities are predominant in it,
thou <hi>canst not</hi> kindle <hi>that:</hi> And though thou <hi>mayest</hi>
bring Heat into it, yet thou canst <hi>not</hi> bring the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
into it, to make it give <hi>light:</hi> therefore all qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
are the children of the sweet quality, or of the
sweet water, because the spirit riseth up onely in
the <hi>water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>108. Art thou a rational Man, in whom is the
Spirit and <hi>understanding,</hi> then look all about in the
world, for there thou wilt find it <hi>thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>109. Thou <hi>canst</hi> kindle wood, that it give <hi>light,</hi>
for the water is chief upper Regent or predominant

                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, Dear Man. Here lyeth or sticketh the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.
The wood which thou kindlest, is not very
<hi>Fire,</hi> but a Dark or Opake <hi>stock,</hi> onely the fire and
light taketh their original from thence.</p>
               <p>112. But thou must understand this, concerning
the <hi>sweet</hi> quality of the <hi>water,</hi> and not concerning the
stick or block; but it is to be understood concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Oyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Unctuositie</hi> or fatnesse which is the spirit
therein.</p>
               <p>113. Now, in the Elementary water on earth,
the sweetnesse is <hi>not</hi> the Chief, or Upper Regent, but
the astringent, bitter, and sowre quality; else the
water were not <hi>mortale,</hi> but were as <hi>that</hi> water is,
out of which Heaven is created.</p>
               <p>114. And that I will demonstrate to thee <hi>thus,</hi>
viz. that the astringent, sowre and bitter Quality is
predominant in the <hi>Elementary</hi> water on Earth.</p>
               <p>115. Take Rie, Wheat, Barley, Oates, or what
you will, wherein the sweet quality is <hi>predominant,</hi>
soak or steep it in the Elementary water, afterward
<hi>Distill</hi> it, then the sweet quality will <hi>take away</hi> the
predominancy from the other, and afterward kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
that water, and then you will <hi>see</hi> the spirit, which
is remaining in the water of the<note n="†" place="margin">or <hi>Oyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
                  </note> unctuousnesse or

               <p>116. This thou <hi>seest</hi> also in Flesh: the flesh nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>117. Thou mayst perhaps ask: How comes that
to passe; or, In what manner is it so?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>118. Behold; in Flesh, the <hi>astringent,</hi> sowre and
bitter quality is predominant; and in the fat, the
<hi>sweetnesse</hi> is chief and predominant; Therefore fat
creatures are alwaies Merrier and frolicker then the
lean, because the <hi>sweet Spirit</hi> floweth more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in them then in the Lean.</p>
               <p>119. For the light of Nature, which is the Spirit
of life, shineth more in them, then in the lean: For
in that Light in the sweet quality, standeth the <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing</hi>
or the Joy, for the astringent or harsh and
bitter quality triumph therein, for they rejoyce that
they are refresh'd, fed, given to drink, and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>light</hi> quality.</p>
               <p>120. For in the astringent or harsh quality there
is <hi>no</hi> life, but an astringent cold hard Death; and in
the bitter quality there is no Light, but a <hi>dark,</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and raging Pain, a house of Trembling Horrour
and fierce wrathful fearful <hi>Misery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>121. Therefore when they are Guests <hi>feasting</hi> at the
sweet and Light quality, then are they affected, and
pleasant, very joyful and triumphing <hi>in</hi> the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>122. And therefore <hi>no</hi> Lean creature is merry,
unlesse it be so that <hi>Heat</hi> be predominant therein:
that is, though it be Lean, and hath <hi>little</hi> of the fat,
or oyl in it; yet perhaps <hi>sweetnesse</hi> is very abundant
there.</p>
               <p>123. On the other side, many Creatures have
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61095:88"/>
                  <hi>much</hi> fatnesse and yet are very Melancholy or sad;
which is, because their fatnesse is <hi>inclined</hi> to the
condition of the Elementary water, wherein the
astringent or harsh and bitter quality is somewhat
<hi>strong.</hi>

               <p>128. Observe!<note place="margin">Barm-Hertz-zig. Warm-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. or Mer-ci-full.</note> the word BARM- is chiefly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
upon thy <hi>Lips;</hi> and when thou pronouncest
BARM- then thou shuttest thy Mouth, and snarlest
in the hinder part of the Mouth: and this is the
Astringent quality, which environeth or <hi>incloseth</hi>
the word; that is, it figureth <hi>compacteth</hi> or contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the word together, that it becometh hard, or
soundeth, and the Bitter quality separateth or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
or <hi>distinguisheth</hi> it.</p>
               <p>129. That is, when thou pronouncest BAR, the

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61095:89"/>
Breath, and thus doth the bitter quality which
is a trembling.</p>
               <p>130. Now the word BARM- is a dead word,
void of understanding, so that no man understands
what it meaneth: which signifieth, that the <hi>Two</hi>
Qualities, Astringent, and Bitter, are a hard dark
cold and Bitter Being, which have <hi>no</hi> Light in them:
And therefore a man cannot understand their power
<hi>without</hi> the Light.</p>
               <p>131. But when a man saith BARM-HERTZ-, he
fetcheth or presseth the second syllable out from the
<hi>Deep</hi> of the Body, out from the Heart, for the <hi>right</hi>
Spirit speaketh forth the word HEARTZ, which
riseth up aloft from the <hi>heat</hi> of the Heart, in which
the Light goeth forth and floweth.</p>
               <p>132. Now Observe, when thou pronouncest
BARM, then the two qualities, the astringent, and
bitter, form frame or <hi>compact</hi> together the word
BARM, very leisurely or slowly: for it is a long <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi>
feeble syllable, because of the weaknesse of
the qualities.</p>
               <p>133. But when thou pronouncest -HERTZ- then
the spirit in the word -HERTZ- (Heart) goeth forth

               <p>134. But when thou prnouncest -IG, then thou
<hi>catchest</hi> or captivatest the spirit in the midst of the
other two qualities, so that it <hi>must stay</hi> there and form
the word.</p>
               <p>135. And thus is the Divine power also; the
Astringent and Bitter quality, are the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the

the Creation of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> and of

               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>142, Out of that fire goeth the <hi>flash</hi> or the light,
forth, and moveth or boyleth in all the powers, and

and so then it reciprocally maketh all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the Father <hi>living</hi> and moving, and through

143. And that Spirit preserveth and <hi>supporteth
all,</hi> formeth all, all vegetation, colours and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
both in heaven and in this world, and <hi>above</hi>
all the Heaven of Heavens. For the Birth or <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of the Holy <hi>Trinity</hi> above all is thus, and no
otherwise, neither will it be otherwise in all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>144. But when the fire is Kindled in a Creature; that
is, when a Creature elevateth it self <hi>too high</hi> or too
much, as Lucifer and his Legions did, then the light
extinguisheth or goeth out, and the <hi>fierce</hi> wrathfull
and hot source, the source of the hellish fire riseth
up, that is, the Spirit of the fire riseth up in the
fierce Quality.</p>
               <p>145. Observe here the <hi>Circumstances,</hi> how this is
done, or how it can come to be done. Therefore
consider an Angel, is formed figured composed or
compacted together out of <hi>all</hi> powers, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
it at large.</p>
               <p>146. Now when he elevateth himself, he eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
himself <hi>first</hi> in the astringent quality, which he
gripeth close together, as a woman, which is in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;
and <hi>presseth</hi> himself, whereby the hard quality
becometh so hard and <hi>sharp,</hi> that the sweet water
can force or prevail with it <hi>no more,</hi> and so can rise
up no more meekly or mildly in the Creature; but
is captivated and <hi>dried up</hi> by the astringent quality,
and changed into a hard, sharp fierce Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>147. For it becometh too<note n="*" place="margin">Derb.</note> empty and dry by the
astringent <hi>contraction,</hi> and loseth its bright lustre,
and its unctuosity, fatnesse or Oylinesse (wherein the
<hi>light Spirit</hi> riseth up, which is the Spirit of the Holy
<hi>angelical</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> life) becometh so hard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61095:91"/>
and pressed together by the astringent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
whereby it is dried up like sweet dry
<hi>Wood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>148. And so when the bitter quality riseth up in
the exsiccated or dryed sweet quality, then <hi>cannot</hi> the
sweetnesse mollifie it, and imbibe it with its sweet
light-water, because it is dried up.</p>
               <p>149. And there the bitter quality raveth and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,</hi>
and seeketh for rest and food, and finds it not,
and moveth or boyleth in the Body as a faint Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>150. And now, when the heat <hi>kindleth</hi> the sweet
quality, and would mitigate its heat in the sweet
water, whence it riseth up, and <hi>shineth</hi> in the whole
Body, there it finds nothing but a hard dry sweet
source or quality, there is no sap, or <hi>moisture,</hi> it being
quite exsiccated or dryed up, by the astringen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
               <p>151. Then it kindleth the sweet source or quality
with an intent to be <hi>refreshed,</hi> but there is no sapp
left, only the sweet source or quality is now burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and <hi>glowing,</hi> even as a <hi>hard</hi> dryed or burnt stone,
and can <hi>no more</hi> kindle its light, and so the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
remaineth now a Dark valley, in which there is
nothing, but a fierce hard coldnesse in the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality, and in the sweet, a hard glowing fire
only, wherin the fierce <hi>Wrathful</hi> heat riseth up in all
Eternity, and in the bitter quality there is a raving
raging, stinging and <hi>burning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>152. And thus you have here the true descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

along in the sweet quality, and riseth up into
the bitter and astringent quality, and so <hi>kindleth</hi> the
bitter and astringent quality, <hi>feeding</hi> them with its

them, and making them <hi>living</hi> or lively, cheerfull
and friendly.</p>
               <p>160. And when the Light-love-power cometh at
them, so that they <hi>taste</hi> thereof, and get its life; O
there is a friendly Meeting <hi>Saluting</hi> and Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a friendly wellcoming and great love, a most

               <p>163. O Immense greatnesse! I <hi>cannot</hi> compare

               <p>165. O, was not the gracious amiable blessed

wert thou not a Cherubin? and was there any thing

the <hi>gracious</hi> amiable blessed love <hi>in</hi> the seven Spirits

               <p>168. O thou lying Devil, stay but a <hi>little,</hi> the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

               <p>170. O, <hi>Security!</hi> the Devil watcheth for thee!
O, <hi>High-mindednesse,</hi> thou art a hellish Fire. O,

               <p>171. O <hi>Man,</hi> why will the world be too narrow,

O this is the Devils high-mindednesse, who <hi>fell</hi> out

               <p>172. O, Man! Alas, O man! why dost thou <hi>Dance</hi>

dost thou think thou shalt <hi>not</hi> have enough, in
<hi>this</hi> world? O, blind man! is not Heaven and Earth

himself: O no, it is not so: there is nothing in
God, but a <hi>mercifull</hi> amiable love and Bright

               <p>175. O ye <hi>Watchmen</hi> of Israel! why do ye <hi>sleep?</hi>
Awake from the sleep of whoredom, and dresse or
trim your <hi>Lamps:</hi> the Bridegroom cometh, <hi>Sound</hi>
your Trumpets.</p>

how do you wooe and go a whoring after the

               </p>

               <p>1.
BEcause I write here of heavenly and Divine
things, which are <hi>altogether strange</hi> to the
<hi>corrupted</hi> perished Nature of Man; the
Reader doubtlesse will wonder at the <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi>
of the Authour, and be offended at it.</p>
               <p>2. Because the condition and inclination of the
corrupted Nature is, to gaze <hi>onely</hi> on <hi>high</hi> things,
like a proud, wild, wanton and <hi>whorish</hi> woman,
which alwayes gazeth in her heat or burning Lust
after <hi>Handsome</hi> men, to act wantonnesse with
them.</p>
               <p>3. Thus also is the Proud corrupted perished
Nature of Man, it stareth only upon <hi>that,</hi> which is
glittering and in <hi>Fashion</hi> in this world, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
that God hath forgotten the afflicted, and
therefore plagueth them so, because he mindeth
them not.</p>
               <p>4. Corrupt Nature imagineth, that the Holy
Ghost regardeth onely <hi>high</hi> things, the high Arts and
Sciences of <hi>this world,</hi> the profound studies and Great
Learning.</p>

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:61095:95"/>
5. But whether it be so, or no; look but back and
then you will find the true <hi>Ground: What was</hi> Abel?
A shepherd. <hi>What was</hi> Enoch <hi>and</hi> Noah? plain
simple men. <hi>What were</hi> Abraham, Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob?
Herdsmen.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>What was</hi> Moses, that dear man of God? A
Herdsman. <hi>What was</hi> David, when the Mouth of the
Lord call'd him? A shepherd.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>What were</hi> the Great, and Small Prophets?
Vulgar plain and mean People: <hi>some of them</hi> but
Countrey people, and Herdsmen, <hi>counted the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
or footstooles of the world:</hi> men counted them but
meer fooles.</p>
               <p>8. And though they did Miracles Wonders
and shewed great signs, yet <hi>the world</hi> gazed only on
high things, and the Holy Ghost must be as the Dust
under their feet: for the proud Devil <hi>alwaies endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured</hi>
to be King in this world.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>And how came</hi> Our King JESUS CHRIST
into this world? Poor and in great trouble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
and <hi>had not whereon to lay his head,</hi> Matth. 8.
20.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>What were</hi> his Apostles? Poor, despised, illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Fishermen, <hi>and what were</hi> they that believed
their preaching? The poorer and meaner sort of the
people. The High Priests and Scribes <hi>were the</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners
of Christ, who <hi>cryed out, Crucifie him, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him,</hi> Luk. 23. 21.</p>
               <p>11. <hi>What were they</hi> that in all Ages in the Church
of Christ stood to it most stoutly and constantly?
The poor contemptible despised people, who shed
their Bloud for the sake of Christ.</p>
               <p>12. <hi>But who were they</hi> that falsified and adulterated
the right pure Christian Doctrine, and <hi>alwayes fought</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:61095:95"/>
against and opposed it? <hi>Even</hi> the Learned Doctors
and Scribes, Popes, Cardinals, Bishops and great
Dons, or Masters and Teachers; <hi>And why did the
world</hi> follow after them, and depend on them? But
because they had great respect, were in great <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and <hi>power;</hi> lived stately and carried a Port in the

               <p>13. <hi>Who was it</hi> that purged the Popes Greedinesse

               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>

The true doctrine of Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No; but the<note n="o" place="margin">That is the real knowledge, of the manner how the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, spoken of in the Doctrine of Christ, as they are in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Physically or Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural things, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its true Ground; and the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Mind.</note> Philosophie; and the <hi>deep

<hi>Evil</hi> proceedeth: The Creation of this world; The

The Last Judgment, And Change of this
world; The Mystery of the Resurrection of the
Dead; And of Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>15. <hi>This</hi> shall arise in the Depth, in great plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and <hi>simplicity: But why not</hi> in the heighth in
Art? That no man should dare to boast, that he
himself hath done it, and that <hi>hereby</hi> the Devils

               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:61095:96"/>
116. But why doth God so? <hi>Of his great love</hi> and
<note n="†" place="margin">Barm-hertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ig keit.</note> Mercy towards all People and Nations, and to

men shall behold and enjoy the <hi>perfection,</hi> and
move in the <hi>pure</hi> Light and Deep Knowledge of
God.</p>
               <p>17. Therefore <hi>before hand will arise</hi> the Dawning
of the Day, or Morning Rednesse, whereby the <hi>Day
may be known or taken notice of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. He that will now sleep, let him sleep still; and he
that will awake and trim his Lamp, let him awake still:
Behold the Bridegroom cometh, and he that is awake and
is ready, accompanieth into the <hi>eternal heavenly</hi> Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
But he that sleepeth at his coming, he sleepeth for
ever <hi>Eternally in the dark prison of fiercenesse or
wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19. Therefore I would have the Reader warned,
that he read <hi>this Book</hi> with diligence, and not be
<hi>offended</hi> at the meannesse or simplicity of the Author,
for God looketh <hi>not</hi> at high things, for He <hi>alone</hi> is
High: but <hi>he careth for the Lowly,</hi> how to help
them.</p>
               <p>20. If you come <hi>so far,</hi> as to apprehend the spirit
and sense of the Authour, then you will need no <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,</hi>
but will rejoyce and be Glad in this light,
and thy Soul will Laugh and <hi>Triumph</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>21. <hi>Now Observe:</hi> the Gracious amiable blessed
Love, which is the <hi>fifth</hi> fountain-spirit, in the divine
power, is the <hi>hidden</hi> source fountain or Quality,
which, the corporeal being <hi>cannot</hi> comprehend or
apprehend, <hi>but</hi> onely, when it riseth up in the body,
and <hi>then</hi> the Body triumpheth therein, and behaveth
it self friendly lovely and <hi>Courteously,</hi> for that Quality
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61095:96"/>
or spirit belongeth <hi>not</hi> to the Imaging or <hi>framing</hi> of
a Body, but riseth up in the Body, as a <hi>flower</hi> spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up out of the Earth.</p>
               <p>22. Now this fountain-spirit taketh its original
at <hi>first</hi> out of the <hi>sweet</hi> Quality of the water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Understand this, how it is, and observe it
exactly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>23.
<hi>First</hi> there is the astringent quality, <hi>then</hi> the sweet,
<hi>next,</hi> the bitter: the Sweet is in the <hi>midst</hi> between
the Astringent and Bitter. Now the Astringent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
things to be hard, cold, and dark, and the bitter
<hi>teareth,</hi> driveth, rageth, and divideth or <hi>distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
These two Qualities <hi>rub</hi> and drive one another
so hard, and move so eagerly, <hi>that</hi> they generate the
Heat, which now in these two Qualities is <hi>dark,</hi> even
as Heat in a <hi>Stone</hi> is.</p>
               <p>24. As when a man taketh a stone, or any hard
thing, and <hi>rubbeth</hi> it against wood, these <hi>two</hi> things
are heated: now this heat is but a darknesse, having
<hi>no</hi> light therein: and so it is also, in the Divine
power.</p>
               <p>25. Now the astringent and bitter quality <hi>without</hi>
the sweet water, rub and drive themselves <hi>so hard</hi>
one against another, that they generate the dark
heat, and so are <hi>kindled</hi> in themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:61095:97"/>
26. And this Together is the
Wrath or Anger of God, the
source and originall of the hellish
Fire.</p>
               <p>As we see by <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who <hi>elevated</hi> and compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself so hard together, with his <hi>Legions,</hi> that
the sweet fountain-water in him was <hi>dryed up,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the light kindleth, and wherein the Love riseth
up.</p>
               <p>27. <hi>Therefore</hi> now he is <hi>Eternally,</hi> an Astringent,
Hard, Cold, Bitter, Hot and Sowre stinking foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-<hi>source:</hi>
For when the sweet quality in him, was
dryed up, it <hi>became</hi> a sowr stinck, a valley of misery,
and a House of perdition and woe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now further into the Depth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. When the astringent and bitter quality <hi>rub</hi>
themselves so hard one upon another, that they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
Heat, and so now the sweet quality, the sweet
fountain-water, is therein in the midst or center <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi>
the astringent and bitter quality, and the <hi>heat</hi>
becometh generated between the astringent and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quality, in the sweet fountain-water, <hi>through</hi> the
astringent and bitter Quality.</p>
               <p>29. And there the Light kindleth in the heat in
the sweet fountain-water, and <hi>this is the beginning of
Life:</hi> for the astringent and bitter Qualities, are the
beginning and cause of the heat and of the Light, and
<hi>thus</hi> the sweet fountain water becometh a <hi>shining</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:61095:97"/>
light, like the Blew or <hi>Azure</hi> Light of heaven.</p>
               <p>30. And that bright-Light fountain-water <hi>kindleth</hi>
the astringent and bitter quality, and the heat, which
is generated by the astringent and bitter quality in
the sweet water, <hi>riseth up</hi> out of the sweet fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
through the astringent and bitter quality, and
in the astringent and bitter quality the light <hi>first then</hi>
becometh dry and shining, as also moveable and
triumphing.</p>
               <p>31. And when the light riseth up out of the sweet
fountain water <hi>in the heat</hi> in the astringent and bitter
quality, then the bitter and astringent quality <hi>tasteth</hi>
the light and sweet water, and the bitter quality
<hi>catcheth</hi> the taste of the sweet water, and in the sweet
water is the <hi>light,</hi> but only of a skie-colour or <hi>Azure</hi>
which is Blew.</p>
               <p>32. And then the bitter quality trembleth, and
<hi>dissolveth</hi> the hardnesse in the astringent Quality, the
Light becometh dry in the Astringent, and shineth
clear, <hi>much</hi> brighter then the Light of the Sun.</p>
               <p>33. In this rising up, the astringent quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
meek, light, thin or <hi>transparent,</hi> and pleasant
or lovely, and obtaineth its life, whose <hi>original</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
up out of the heat in the sweet water, and this
now is <hi>the true fountain or well-spring of Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe this, in the deep Sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>34. How should Love and Joy <hi>not</hi> be there?
where life is generated in the very Center or midst
of Death, and Light, in the midst of darknesse?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou askest, <hi>How</hi> comes <hi>that</hi> to passe?</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:61095:98"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>35. Indeed, if <hi>my</hi> spirit did sit in <hi>thy</hi> heart, and
spring up in thy heart, then <hi>thy</hi> Body would find, feel,
and apprehend it.</p>
               <p>36. But <hi>otherwise</hi> I cannot bring it into thy sense,
neither canst thou apprehend or understand it, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse</hi>
the Holy Ghost kindle thy soul, so that <hi>this</hi> light
it self shine in <hi>thy</hi> Heart.</p>
               <p>37. And then will this light it self be generated
<hi>in thee,</hi> as in God; and rise up in <hi>thy</hi> astringent and
bitter quality, in <hi>thy</hi> sweet water; and triumph, as
in God: Now when <hi>this</hi> is done: then you will <hi>first
understand my Book,</hi> and not before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>38. When the light is generated in the Bitter
quality, that is, when the bitter and dry fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sources
<hi>catch</hi> the sweet fountain water of Life, and
<hi>drink</hi> it, then the bitter spirit becometh Living, in
the astringent spirit, and the astringent spirit which
is as a spirit impregnated with child, is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with life, and must continually generate the
Life.</p>
               <p>39. For, the sweet water, and the life in the sweet
water rise up <hi>continually</hi> in the astringent quality, and
the bitter quality triumpheth continually <hi>therein,</hi> and
so there is nothing else but meer laughing, and Joy, a
meer being in Love.</p>
               <p>40. For the astringent quality-<hi>loveth</hi> the sweet
water.</p>
               <p>41. And First, because, in the sweet water, the
Spirit of Light is generated, and <hi>imbibeth</hi> or giveth
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61095:98"/>
Drink to the astringent hard and cold Qualities;
also it enlightneth them, and warmeth them: for in
Water, Light, and Heat, The <hi>Life consisteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>42. And secondly, the astringent Quality loveth
the bitter; because, the bitter Quality in the sweet
water, that is, in water heat and light, <hi>triumpheth</hi> in
the astringent Quality, and maketh the astringent,
moveable or stirring, <hi>wherein</hi> the astringent also can
triumph.</p>
               <p>43. And thirdly, the astringent quality loveth the
Heat, because in the heat the light is Generated,
<hi>whereby</hi> the astringent quality is enlightned and
warmed.</p>
               <p>44. And the sweet quality also loveth the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
               <p>45. And first, because it drieth up the astringent
<hi>that</hi> it become <hi>not</hi> thinne or dimme <hi>like</hi> the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
water, and that its quality consisteth in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and <hi>because,</hi> that in the Astringent Quality the
<hi>light,</hi> which is generated therein, becometh <hi>shining</hi>
and <hi>dry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>46. Besides, the astringent quality is a cause of
the heat, which is generated in the sweet water,
wherein the light riseth up, and wherein the sweet
water standeth in great <hi>clarity brightnesse or</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>47. And secondly, the sweet quality also loveth
the bitter, because it is a cause of the <hi>heat,</hi> and also
therefore, because the bitter spirit triumpheth and
<hi>trembleth</hi> in the sweet water, heat, and light, and so
maketh the sweet water moveable or stirring, and
<hi>living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48. And thirdly, the sweet quality loveth heat
<hi>exceedingly,</hi> and so very much, that I cannot compare
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61095:99"/>
it with any thing: but you may take this for a <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,</hi>
though it comes very short thereof: Suppose
<hi>two</hi> young People of a noble <hi>Complexion,</hi> these being
kindled in the Heat and fervour of burning Love one
to another, there is such a fire as this; so that if
they could creep into the Bodies and <hi>Hearts</hi> one of
another, or transmute themselves into <hi>one</hi> Body,
they would do it.</p>
               <p>49. But this <hi>Earthly</hi> love is only cold Water, and
is not true Fire: A man cannot find any <hi>full</hi> simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of it in this <hi>half-dead</hi> World; <hi>Onely</hi> the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Dead at the last Day, is a <hi>perfect</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
in all <hi>divine</hi> things, which receive the <hi>true
Love-fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>50. But the sweet quality doth thus love the Heat
<hi>because</hi> it generateth therein the light-spirit, which
is the Spirit of Life. For <hi>life</hi> existeth in the heat;
for if the Heat were not, all would be a dark valley:
Now <hi>so dear</hi> as the Life is, so dear is also the Heat,
to the sweet spirit, and the light, in the Heat.</p>
               <p>51. And the bitter quality also loveth <hi>all</hi> the other
fountain-spirits. And first the sweet. For in the
sweet water, the bitter spirit is <hi>refreshed,</hi> and
therein it <hi>quencheth</hi> its great thirst; and its bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
is therein mitigated, also it obtaineth its
light-Life <hi>therein:</hi> in the astringent it hath its Body,
wherein it triumpheth cooleth and mitigateth it self;
and in the Heat it <hi>hath</hi> its power and strength, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its Joy standeth.</p>
               <p>52. And the hot quality also loveth <hi>all</hi> the other
qualities, and the love is so <hi>great</hi> therein toward, and
in the other, that it cannot be likened to any thing,
for it is generated from and out of the other.</p>
               <p>53. The astringent and bitter qualities are the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61095:99"/>
                  <hi>Father</hi> of the heat, and the sweet fountain water, is
its <hi>Mother,</hi> which conceiveth, retaineth, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
it: for the heat existeth through the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and bitter hard driving, which riseth up in the
sweet quality, as in wood, or fewel.</p>
               <p>54. Wilt thou <hi>not believe</hi> this? then open thy
Eyes, and go to a <hi>Tree,</hi> look upon it, and bethink
thy self; there you see first the <hi>whole</hi> Tree, take a
knife and cut a <hi>Gash</hi> in it, and taste how it is; then
you <hi>first</hi> taste the astringent harsh <hi>choaky</hi> quality,
which draweth thy Tongue together, and that also
<hi>draweth</hi> and holdeth together all the powers of the
Tree.</p>
               <p>55. Then you taste the bitter quality, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Tree moveable or stirring, so that it <hi>spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
and groweth green and flourisheth, and so getteth
its Branches Leaves and Fruit.</p>
               <p>56. <hi>After that</hi> you taste the sweet, which is very
<hi>Gentle</hi> and sharp: for it getteth the <hi>sharpnesse</hi> from
the astringent and bitter Quality.</p>
               <p>57. Now these <hi>three</hi> Qualities would be Dark
and Dead, if the <hi>Heat</hi> were not therein: but as soon
as the <hi>Spring</hi> time cometh, that the Sun with its
<hi>Beams</hi> suppleth and warmeth the Earth, the spirit
becometh living by the Heat in the Tree, and the
spirits of the Tree begin to grow green, <hi>flourish</hi> and
Blossom.</p>
               <p>58. For the spirit riseth up in the heat, and <hi>all</hi>
the spirits rejoyce therein, and so there is a hearty
love between them.</p>
               <p>59. But the heat is generated through the power
and <hi>Impulse</hi> of the astringent and bitter qualities in
the sweet water.</p>
               <p>60. But they must use the Heat of the Sun to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61095:100"/>
their kindling, because the qualities <hi>in this world</hi> are
half dead, and are too weak, of which King Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
was the cause, which you will find, here follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
concerning <hi>his Fall,</hi> and concerning the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this world.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the friendly Love, gracious amiable blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and Unity, of the Five qualifying or
fountain-spirits of God.</head>
               <p>61.
Though it be impossible for the hands of men to
describe this sufficiently, yet the <hi>enlightned</hi> spirit of
<hi>Man</hi> seeth it: for it riseth up just in such a form
and Birth, as the light in the Divine power, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in the qualities, which are <hi>in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>62. Onely this is to be Lamented concerning
Man, that his qualities are corrupted, perished and
<hi>half</hi> Dead, and therefore it is that mans spirit or his
qualities, rising, or kindling in this world, can come
or attain to <hi>no perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>63. On the Other side, again it is highly to be
rejoyced at, that mans spirit, in his necessity becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<hi>enlightned</hi> and kindled by the Holy Ghost: As
the Sun kindleth the cold heat, in a Tree or Herb,
whereby the cold <hi>chilled</hi> Heat becometh living.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>64. As the members of Mans Body love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
so do the spirits also in the <hi>Divine</hi> power; there
is nothing else but a meer longing desiring and well
liking acceptation, as also a <hi>triumphing</hi> and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the one in the other: for through these spirits
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61095:100"/>
cometh the <hi>understanding</hi> and distinction in God, in
Angels, Men, Beasts, and Fowles, and in <hi>every thing</hi>
that liveth.</p>
               <p>65. For in <hi>these Five</hi> Qualities riseth up the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
smelling, tasting and feeling, and so a <hi>Rational</hi>
spirit cometh to be.</p>
               <p>66. As when the light riseth up, then one spirit
seeth the other.</p>
               <p>67. And when the sweet spring or fountain water
riseth up <hi>in the light,</hi> through all the spirits, then
the one tasteth the other, and then the spirits become
<hi>living,</hi> and the power of life penetrateth through
all.</p>
               <p>68. And in <hi>that</hi> power the one smelleth the other;
And through this qualifying <hi>influence</hi> and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the one feeleth the other.</p>
               <p>69. And so there is nothing else, but a <hi>Hearty</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and friendly aspect or seeing, curious smelling,
a good relishing or tasting and lovely feeling, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
amiable <hi>blessed</hi> kissing, a feeding upon and
drinking of one another, and lovely walking and
<hi>conversing</hi> together.</p>
               <p>70. This is the gracious amiable blessed BRIDE,
which <hi>rejoyceth in her</hi> BRIDEGROOM, herein is
love, joy and delight, here is light and brightnesse
or clarity, here is a pleasant and lovely smell, here
is a friendly and sweet taste.</p>
               <p>71. And this for ever <hi>without End!</hi> How can a
Creature sufficiently rejoyce therein? O Dear love
and gracious amiable blessednesse! Surely thou hast
no End, No man can see any End <hi>in thee,</hi> thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Deep is unsearchable, thou art <hi>every where</hi>
all over thus, onely in the fierce Devil thou art <hi>not</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:61095:101"/>
thus, they have spoiled, and perished, thee in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>72. Now thou wilt say; <hi>Where</hi> then are these
gracious amiable and blessed spirits to be met with?
Do they dwell onely in themselves in <hi>Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>73. This is the other open Gate of the Deity, here
thou must set thy eyes <hi>wide</hi> open, and rouze up or
awaken the spirit in thy <hi>half</hi> dead heart: for this is
not an Obscure Fiction Contrivance or <hi>Phantasie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>74. The Seven Spirits of God contain or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
in their circumference, and <hi>space,</hi> Heaven and
this world, also the <hi>wide breadth and depth</hi> without
and beyond the heavens, even above and beneath
the world, and in the world, yea <hi>the whole Father,</hi>
which hath neither Beginning nor End.</p>
               <p>75. They contain also <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Creatures</hi> both in
heaven and in this world, and all the Creatures in
heaven and in this world are imaged fashioned or
framed out of these spirits, and live in them as in
their own <hi>propriety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>76. And their Life and <hi>Reason</hi> is generated in
them, in such a manner, as the Divine being is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and also in the <hi>same</hi> power.</p>
               <p>77. And out of and from the same <hi>Body</hi> of the
seven Spirits of God, are <hi>all things</hi> made and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
all Angels, all Devils, the Heaven, the Earth,
the Stars, the Elements, Men, Beasts, Fowles, Fishes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61095:101"/>
all Worms, Wood, Trees, also Stones, Herbs and
Grasse, and <hi>all</hi> whatsoever is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now thou wilt ask.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>78. Seeing God is <hi>every where,</hi> and is himself <hi>All,</hi>
How cometh it then that there is in this world, such
Cold and Heat, such biting and striking among all
Creatures, and that there is nothing else almost but
meer <hi>fiercenesse</hi> or wrath in this world?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>79. [The cause is, that the first four Forms of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are one at Enmity against the other
without the light; and yet they are the
causes of Life.]</q>
               <p>80. Behold, here the wickednesse and malice
which is the Cause; <hi>viz.</hi> when King <hi>Lucifer</hi> did sit
in his Kingdom, like a <hi>high-minded</hi> proud Bride, then
his Circuit Circle or Orbe, contained or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the place or <hi>space,</hi> where <hi>now</hi> the Created
Heaven is, which is made out of the water;</p>
               <p>81. And the <hi>place also</hi> of the created world, even
unto heaven, as also the <hi>Deep</hi> where now the Earth
is, that was <hi>all</hi> a pure and holy <hi>Salitter,</hi> wherein the
Seven Spirits of God were <hi>Compleat</hi> and Pleasant, as
now in Heaven, although they are <hi>still</hi> compleat and
<hi>full,</hi> in this world. But observe the Circumstances
rightly.</p>
               <p>82. When <hi>King Lucifer</hi> elevated himself, then he
elevated himself in the seven qualifying fountain-spirits,
and <hi>kindled them</hi> with his elevation, so that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61095:102"/>
all was wholly <hi>burning,</hi> and the astringent quality
was so <hi>hard</hi> and Compact, that it generated stones;
and was so <hi>cold,</hi> that it made the sweet spring or
fountain-water turn <hi>to Ice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>83. And the sweet spring water became very
thick <hi>brittle,</hi> and as<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>or</hi> stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> in many pieces; and the bitter
quality became very <hi>raging,</hi> tearing and raving,
whence <hi>Poyson</hi> arose aloft, and the fire or heat was
violently and zealously or fervently <hi>burning</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming,</hi>
and so there was a very great distemper and
confused <hi>Mixture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>84. <hi>Upon this,</hi> King Lucifer was thrust out of his
Royal Place or Kingly <hi>Throne</hi> which he had in <hi>that
Place,</hi> where now the created Heaven is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>instantly ensued</hi> the Creation of this world;</p>
               <p>85. And the hard Brittle matter, which had
<hi>wrought forth it self</hi> in the kindled seven qualifying or
fountain-spirits, was <hi>driven</hi> together, from whence
the Earth and Stones came to be, and after that, all
the Creatures were created out of the <hi>kindled Salit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the seven Spirits of God.</p>
               <p>86. Now the qualifying or fountain Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>so fierce</hi> and wrathfull in their kindling, that
the one continually spoileth the other with its evill
naughty quality or source, and so also now do the
creatures, which <hi>were made out of</hi> the qualifying or
fountain spirits, and <hi>live</hi> in the same impulse, the
one biting beating worrying and annoying the other,
all according to the kind or <hi>disposition</hi> of the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>87. Upon this now the <hi>Totall</hi> or Universall God
hath Decreed <hi>the Last Judgment,</hi> wherein he will
separate the Evil from the Good, and set the good
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61095:102"/>
again in the meek mild and Pleasant delight, as it
<hi>was before</hi> the horrible kindling of the Devill, and
will give that which is fierce or <hi>wrathfull</hi> to King
<hi>Lucifer</hi> for an <hi>Everlasting</hi> Habitation.</p>
               <p>88. And then there will be <hi>two Parts</hi> or divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this Kingdom, the one, <hi>Men</hi> will get, with
their King JESUS CHRIST; the other, the
<hi>Devills</hi> shall have with all ungodly Men and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse.</p>
               <p>89. This is a <hi>short</hi> Introduction, that the Reader
might the better understand the Divine Mystery:
concerning <hi>the Fall of the Devil,</hi> and concerning the
<hi>Creation</hi> of <hi>this</hi> world, you will find all more at
large particularly described. Therefore I would
have the Reader admonished, that he read <hi>all in
order,</hi> and so he will come to the true ground.</p>
               <p>90. It is true, that from the beginning of the
world it was <hi>not so fully</hi> revealed to any Man; but
seeing God will have it so, I submit to his Will, and
will see, what <hi>God</hi> will do with it.</p>
               <p>91. For his way which is <hi>before</hi> him is for the
<hi>most part</hi> hidden to me: but <hi>after</hi> him the Spirit
seeth, even into the highest and profoundest
Depth.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Sixth qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Spirit in the Divine
Power.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1.
THe <hi>Sixth</hi> qualifying or fountain Spirit in
the Divine Power, is the Sound Tone Tune
or Noise, wherein all soundeth and Tuneth,
whence ensued <hi>Speech,</hi> Language, and the
<hi>distinction</hi> of Every thing, as also the ringing melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and <hi>Singing</hi> of the holy Angels, and therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
the forming or framing of all <hi>Colours,</hi> Beautie,
and Ornament, as also the heavenly <hi>Joyfulnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But thou wilt ask: What is the Tone or Sound?
or how taketh this spirit its source and Original?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.
Observe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Seven</hi> Spirits are generated in one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
the one continually generateth the other, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of them is the first, neither is any of them the
last; for the last generateth as well as the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:61095:103"/>
the first, second, third and fourth, and so to the
last.</p>
            <p>4. But why one is called the <hi>first,</hi> another the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>
and so <hi>on,</hi> that is in respect to that which is the
first in order to the imaging framing and <hi>forming</hi> of a
Creature.</p>
            <p>5. For all the seven are <hi>Equally</hi> Eternal, and none
of them hath either Beginning or End; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in that the seven Qualities are continually <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating</hi>
one another, and that none is without the
other; it followeth, that there is ONE <hi>Only Eternal
Almighty</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>6. For, if any thing be generated out of or in the
Divine Being, that thing is not formed or framed by
or through <hi>one</hi> spirit alone, but by <hi>all</hi> the seven.</p>
            <p>7. And if a Creature, which is like or as the
whole Being of God, spoileth, elevateth and <hi>kindleth</hi>
it self in a Qualifying or fountain-spirit, yet it kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth
not one spirit alone, but <hi>all the seven</hi> spirits.</p>
            <p>8. And therefore that Creature is a loathsome
abomination before the <hi>Total</hi> God, and all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and must stand in eternal Emnity and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
or shame, <hi>before</hi> God, and all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>9. The Tone or <hi>Mercurius,</hi> taketh its originall in
the <hi>first,</hi> that is, in the Astringent and Hard Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe in the Depth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Hardnesse is the Fountain or Well-spring of
the Tone, but it cannot generate the same <hi>alone,</hi> yet
it is the Father thereof, and the whole <hi>Salitter</hi> is the
Mother; otherwise if the hardnesse were both Father
and Mother of the Tone, then a hard Stone also must
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61095:104"/>
have a Ringing sound. But it doth only make a
Noise, like knocking, as a seed or <hi>beginning</hi> of a
Tone, and that, it is, certainly.</p>
            <p>11. But the Tone or voice riseth up in the middle
center in the flash or <hi>Lightening,</hi> where the Light
is generated out of the <hi>Heat,</hi> where the flash or
Lightening of life riseth up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe, how this is done:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. When the astringent quality <hi>rubbeth</hi> it self
with the bitter, so that the Heat riseth up in the sweet
spring or fountain-water, then the heat kindleth the
<hi>sweet</hi> spring or fountain water, like a flash of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and that flash is the <hi>light;</hi> which in the Heat
goeth into the bitter quality, and there the Flash is
<hi>distinguished</hi> according to all the Powers.</p>
            <p>13. For all powers are discerned or distinguished
in the bitter, and the bitter receiveth the flash of
the light, as if it were <hi>horribly</hi> terrified; and goeth
with its trembling and terrour, into the astringent
and hard quality, and there it is <hi>bodily</hi> captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>14. And the bitter quality is now <hi>impregnated</hi>
with the light, and so trembleth in the Astringent
and Bitter quality, and stirreth therein, and is <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated</hi>
in the astringent quality, as in a Body.</p>
            <p>15. And now when the spirits do move, and
would <hi>speak,</hi> the hard quality must open it self; for
the bitter spirit with its flash breaketh it open, and
then <hi>there</hi> the Tone goeth forth, and is impregnated
<hi>with</hi> all the seven Spirits, which distinguish the
Word, as it was <hi>decreed</hi> in the Center, that is, in the
middle of the Circle; whilest it was yet in the
<hi>Councel</hi> of the seven Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:61095:104"/>
16. And therefore the seven Spirits of God have
created a <hi>Mouth</hi> for the Creatures, that when they
would utter their voyce which is their speaking, or
make a noise, they need not first tear open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and therefore it is that all the veins and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
or<note n="*" place="margin">conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating.</note> qualifying or fountain spirits <hi>go</hi> into the
Tongue, that the Tone or noise may comeforth <hi>gently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here Observe exactly, the<note n="†" place="margin">Mind or meaning.</note> Sense, and
Mysterie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. When the flash riseth up in the heat, then
first the sweet water <hi>catcheth</hi> or captivateth it, for
therein it becometh shining. Now when the water
catcheth the flash, that is, the <hi>birth</hi> of the light, then
it is terrified, and being so thin and pliant or feeble,
it giveth <hi>back</hi> very much trembling: for the heat
riseth up in the light.</p>
            <p>18. And now when the astringent quality, which
is very cold, catcheth the heat and flash, then it is
<hi>terrified,</hi> as in a Tempest of lightning; for when the
heat cometh with the Light into the hard cold, then
it maketh a <hi>fierce</hi> flash, of a very fiery and light co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
            <p>19. And then that flash <hi>retireth</hi> back, and the sweet
water catcheth it, and riseth up in that <hi>fiercenesse;</hi>
and in that rising and terrifying, changeth it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Green or Azure, or Blew Colour, and trembleth,
because of the fierce flash.</p>
            <p>20. And the flash in it self <hi>keepeth</hi> its fiercenesse,
from whence existeth the Bitter Quality, or the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Spirit, which <hi>now</hi> riseth up in the astringent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and inflameth or <hi>kindleth</hi> the hardnesse with its
fierce quality, and the light or flash <hi>dryeth</hi> it self in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61095:105"/>
the hardnesse and shineth clear and bright, <hi>far brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
then the Light of the Sun.</p>
            <p>21. But it is caught in the hard quality, so that
it subsists in a Bodily manner, and <hi>must</hi> shine <hi>so</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
and the flash trembleth in the Body, like a
fierce rising up, whereby all the qualities are stirred
alwaies and Eternally.</p>
            <p>22. And the flash of fire in the light trembleth
and <hi>triumpheth</hi> thus continually, and the hardnesse is
alwayes the <hi>Body,</hi> which retaineth preserveth and
dryeth it.</p>
            <p>23. And this stirring in the hardnesse, is the Tone,
so that it soundeth, and the light or flash maketh the
ringing, and the sweet water mitigateth the ringing:
so that a man can use it to the Distinction of Speech,
or <hi>Articulation of Syllables.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Here Observe the Nativity or Birth of the Bitter
quality, yet more plainly.</head>
               <p>24. The <hi>original</hi> of the bitter quality, is, when
the flash of life in the heat riseth up in the astringent
quality, and now when the flash of fire in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the water cometh <hi>into</hi> the astringent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then the spirit of the fiery flash <hi>catcheth</hi> the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and hard spirit, and both these together are
an earnest <hi>severe</hi> fierce quality, which rageth and
teareth vehemently like a fiery violent fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>25. I can liken it to nothing else, but to a <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Clap,</hi>
when the fierce fire first falls down, so that
it <hi>dazzleth</hi> the light; that fierce fire is like the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the conjunction of these two.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:61095:105"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>26. Now when the fire-spirit and the astringent
spirit <hi>struggle</hi> and wrestle thus together, then the
astringent maketh a vehement hard <hi>Cold</hi> astriction,
and the fiery maketh a terrible fierce <hi>Heat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>27. And now the rising up of the heat and of the
astriction maketh a trembling fierce <hi>terrible</hi> spirit,
which raveth and rageth, <hi>as if</hi> it would tear the
Deity asunder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thou must understand this, exactly,
and properly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. This is <hi>thus,</hi> in the Original of the Quality
in it self, but in the <hi>midst</hi> in the rising up of this
<hi>fierce</hi> spirit, this spirit is <hi>caught</hi> and mitigated in the
sweet water, where its fierce source or fountain is
<hi>changed</hi> into a trembling, bitter, and greenish Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
like a greenish duskinesse, and retaineth in it
self the <hi>condition</hi> and property of all <hi>three</hi> Qualities,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the fiery, astringent, and sweet, and so from
these three existeth the <hi>fourth</hi> Quality, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>29. For from the fiery quality the spirit becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<hi>trembling</hi> and <hi>Hot,</hi> and from the astringent it
becometh <hi>severe</hi> astringent, hard and <hi>corporeal,</hi> so
that it is a spirit; which alwayes subsisteth, and
from the sweet it becometh meek or <hi>mild,</hi> and the
fiercenesse changeth it into a gentle bitternesse:
which standeth now in the Fountain or <hi>Well-spring</hi>
of the seven Spirits of God, and helpeth continually
to generate the other six spirits.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:61095:106"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Understand this rightly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30. It doth <hi>as well</hi> generate its Father and Mother,
<hi>as</hi> its Father and Mother doth generate it, for after
that it is <hi>corporeally</hi> generated, it then, with the
astringent Quality <hi>alwayes</hi> generateth the fire <hi>again,</hi>
and the fire generateth Light, and the light <hi>is</hi> the
<hi>Flash,</hi> which alwaies generateth the <hi>Life</hi> again in all
the qualifying, or fountain spirits; whence the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have <hi>life,</hi> and alwaies generate one another
<hi>again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. But here thou must know, that <hi>one</hi> spirit <hi>alone</hi>
cannot generate another, neither can <hi>two</hi> of them do
it, but the birth of a spirit standeth in the operation
of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>seven</hi> spirits, <hi>six</hi> of them alwayes generate
the <hi>seventh,</hi> and so if <hi>one</hi> of them were not, then the
<hi>other</hi> would not be, neither.</p>
               <p>32. But that I sometimes take onely two or three
to the Nativity or birth of a spirit, I do that, because
of my <hi>own weaknesse,</hi> for I cannot bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> them all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at <hi>once</hi> in their perfection, in my<note n="†" place="margin">the Humane Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> corrupted
Brain.</p>
               <p>33. I see them <hi>all seven,</hi> very well, but when I
speculate into them, then the spirit riseth up in the
<hi>middlemost</hi> fountain or well-spring, where the Spirit
of life generateth it self, which goeth now <hi>upwards,</hi>
now <hi>downwards,</hi> it cannot apprehend all the seven
spirits in <hi>one</hi> thought or at once, but only in <hi>Part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>34. Every Spirit hath its <hi>own</hi> quality or source,
though indeed it is generated of the other; and so
it is with the <hi>apprehension</hi> of Man, he hath indeed the
fountain of all seven spirits <hi>in</hi> him, but in what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or fountain soever the spirit riseth up, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61095:106"/>
or fountain spirit <hi>thereof,</hi> wherein that same
spirit is most <hi>strongly</hi> Imaged, that is it which he
comprehendeth most sharply in <hi>that</hi> rising up.</p>
               <p>35. For even in the Divine power one spirit doth
<hi>not go</hi> through all the spirits equally <hi>at once</hi> in its<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>or</hi> Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up: for when it riseth up, then indeed it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or <hi>stirreth</hi> them all at once, but it is caught in its
rising up, so that it must lay down its statelinesse
and Pomp, and not <hi>triumph over all the seven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>36. [<q>It is the Being or Substance of the Senses and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/>
Thoughts, otherwise, if a Thought through
the Center of Nature could penetrate all
the forms, then it were <hi>Free</hi> from the
Band of Nature:</q>]</p>
               <p>37. Thus it is also in Man, when <hi>one</hi> qualifying
or fountain spirit riseth up, then it toucheth <hi>all</hi> the
other, and seeth all the other, for it riseth up in the
middle or central Fountain or Well-spring of the
Heart, where, in the <hi>Heat,</hi> the flash of Light kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth
it self, wherein the spirit in its rising up, in
the same flash, seeth through <hi>all</hi> the spirits.</p>
               <p>38. But, in our corrupted flesh, it is only like a
Tempest of <hi>lightning:</hi> for if I <hi>could,</hi> in my <hi>flesh,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the flash, which I very well see and know
<hi>how it is,</hi> I could clarifie or transfigure my Body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
so that it would shine with a <hi>Bright</hi> Light and
Glory.</p>
               <p>[<q>For from the Flash cometh the <hi>Light</hi> of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie:</q>]<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/>
               </p>
               <p>And then it would no more resemble and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Bestial Body, but to the Angels of
God.</p>
               <p>39. But hearken friend, tarry yet a <hi>little</hi> while,
and then give the bestial Body, for food, to the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61095:107"/>
Worms: but when the Total God shall <hi>kindle</hi> the
Seven Spirits of God in the <hi>corrupted</hi> Earth, then if
that same <hi>Salitter,</hi> which thou sowest in the earth,
will not be capable of the fire,<note place="margin">☞</note> then thy qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain-spirits, which thou didst sowe in
thy life-time, and is sowen in thy <hi>departure</hi> from
hence, will <hi>rise</hi> again in the same <hi>Salitter</hi> which thou
hast sown, and will triumph therein, and become <hi>a
Body</hi> again.</p>
               <p>40. But he<note n="†" place="margin">or whose <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litter.</hi> See Ch. 10. verse 110. the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litter</hi> which they have Corrupted. and Ch. 11. vers. 115. the Corrupted <hi>Salitter.</hi>
                  </note> that will be <hi>capable</hi> of the kindled fire
of the seven Spirits of God, he shall <hi>abide</hi> therein,
and his qualifying or fountain spirits shall rise in
<hi>hellish</hi> pain, which I shall demonstrate clearly in its
due place.</p>
               <p>41. I cannot describe unto thee the whole Deity
by the Circumference or extent of a Circle, for it is
unmeasurable; but to <hi>that Spirit</hi> which is in Gods
Love it is <hi>not</hi> incomprehensible: it comprehends it
well, yet but in Part; therefore take one part after
another, and then you will see the <hi>whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>42. In this corruption we cannot get higher, then
with such a Revelation, neither doth this world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
it self any higher, both as to the Beginning and
the End.</p>
               <p>43. I would very fain see <hi>somewhat higher</hi> in this
my anxious generating or Birth, whereby my sick
Adam might be refreshed.</p>
               <p>44. But I look round about me in all the world,
and can find out <hi>nothing;</hi> all is sick, lame and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
moreover Blind, Deaf, and Dumb.</p>
               <p>45. <hi>I have read</hi> the Writings of very high Masters,
hoping to find therein the ground and true depth:
but I have found nothing, but a <hi>half dead</hi> Spirit,
which in anxiety travelleth and laboureth for
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61095:107"/>
health, and yet because of its great weaknesse <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
attain perfect power.</p>
               <p>46. Thus I stand yet as an anxious woman in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
and seek <hi>perfect</hi> refreshing, but find onely the
scent or smell or savour in its rising up, wherein, the
Spirit examineth, what power <hi>sticketh</hi> in the true
cordial; and in the mean while refresheth it self in
its sicknesse with that <hi>perfect smell</hi> or savour, till the
true <hi>Samaritan</hi> doth come, who will dresse and bind
up its wounds and heal it, and bring it to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Inne</hi> or Lodging, then it shall enjoy the <hi>perfect
Taste.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>47. This <hi>Herb,</hi> which I mean here, from whose
Fragancy my spirit taketh its refreshing, Every
Countrey Plowman doth <hi>not</hi> know it, <hi>nor</hi> Every
Doctor; the one is as Ignorant of it, as the other; it
groweth indeed in <hi>every</hi> Garden, but in many it is
quite spoyled and naught: for the quality of the
Soyl or Ground is in <hi>fault.</hi> And therefore men do
not know it, nay the <hi>Children of this Mystery</hi> do hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know it: for, this knowledge hath been very rare
dear and pretious, from the beginning of the world
to this <hi>Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48. Though in Many, a source or fountain and
quality hath risen up, but then suddenly Pride pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
after it, and <hi>spoyled</hi> all; whereupon it was <hi>loath</hi>
to write it down in its mother-Tongue; it supposed,
that was <hi>too</hi> childish a thing, it must shew it
in a <hi>deeper</hi> Language, that the world should see, that
it is Manly; and for its <hi>advantage</hi> it kept it in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and <hi>dawbed</hi> it with deep strange names, that
men might not know it: such a <hi>Beast</hi> is the Devil's
Proud disease.</p>
               <p>49. But hear, thou simple Mother, which bringest
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61095:108"/>
all the children into this world, which afterward
in their rising up are <hi>ashamed</hi> of thee, and despise
thee, and yet are <hi>thy</hi> children, which thou hast
brought forth.</p>
               <p>50. Thus saith the Spirit, which
riseth up in the seven spirits of
God, which is thy Father, Despair
not, behold I am thy strength, and
thy power, I will fill to thee a mild
draught in thy Age.</p>
               <p>51. Seeing all thy children de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
thee; whom thou didst bear,
and hast given them suck in their
Childhood, and will not give thee
any attendance, or minister to thee
in thy high or old Age.</p>
               <p>52. Therefore I will comfort
thee, and will give unto thee a
Young <hi>SONNE</hi> in thy high or
old Age; he shall abide in thy
House, as long as thou livest, and
attend thee or minister to thee,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61095:108"/>
and comfort thee, against all the
raving and raging of thy proud
Children.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Now here Observe further, concerning the
Mercurius Tone or Sound.</head>
               <p>53. All Qualities take their<note n="†" place="margin">finite or transitory original.</note> beginning-original
in their <hi>middle</hi> or center: Therefore Observe, <hi>where</hi>
the Fire is generated; for, <hi>there</hi> riseth up the flash of
the life of all the qualities, and is <hi>caught</hi> in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so that it remaineth <hi>shining,</hi> and is dryed in the
astringency, so that it remaineth <hi>corporeal,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
shining Bright and Clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>54. For Instance: kindle some wood, and <hi>then</hi>
you will see the mysterie; the Fire kindleth it self
in the <hi>hardnesse</hi> of the wood: and this is now the
astringent hard quality, The quality or source <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus,</hi>
which <hi>maketh</hi> the wood hard and dry.</p>
               <p>55. But now, the <hi>light,</hi> that is, the flash, doth not
consist in the hardnesse; otherwise a stone also would
burn and give Light, but the light subsisteth onely in
the <hi>Sap</hi> of the wood, that is, in the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>or</hi> Oyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> water.</p>
               <p>56. Whilest there is Sap in the wood, the fire
<hi>shineth,</hi> as a shining Light: but when the sap is
consumed in the wood, the shining Light <hi>goeth out,</hi>
and the wood becometh a glowing Coal.</p>
               <p>57. Now behold, the fiercenesse, which riseth up
in the light; consists <hi>not</hi> in the water of the wood,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61095:109"/>
but when the heat riseth up in the hardnesse, then
is the flash <hi>generated,</hi> which the sap in the wood first
catcheth, whereby the <hi>water</hi> becomes shining.</p>
               <p>58. The Fiercenesse or Bitternesse is generated in
the midst or center of the hardnesse, and the <hi>heat</hi> is
generated in the flash, and therein also it subsisteth:
and so far as the flash, that is, the <hi>flame</hi> of the fire,
reacheth, so far also reacheth the <hi>fiercenesse</hi> of the
bitternesse, which is the sonne of the hardnesse and
heat.</p>
               <p>59. But thou must know this mystery, that the
bitternesse is <hi>already</hi> in the world, Else the fierce
bitternesse would not so suddenly generate it self like
<hi>lightning</hi> in the natural fire.</p>
               <p>60. For, as the Body of the fire generateth it
self, when wood is kindled, in such a manner like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is the <hi>Wood</hi> generated in and above the
earth.</p>
               <p>61. But if the fiercenesse should be generated in
the shining light, then surely it would reach <hi>as far</hi>
also, as the splendour or shining of the Light, but it
doth not so.</p>
               <p>62. But thus it is; the flash is the <hi>mother</hi> of the
light: for the flash generateth the light, and is the
<hi>Father</hi> of the fiercenesse, for the fiercenesse abideth
in the flash as a <hi>seed</hi> in the Father, and that flash ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth
also the Tone or Sound.</p>
               <p>63. When it goeth from the hardnesse and heat,
then the hardnesse maketh a thumping <hi>knocking</hi>
sound in the flash, and the heat ringeth forth, and
the light in the flash maketh the ringing <hi>shrill,</hi> and
the water mitigateth it, and then in the astringency
and hardnesse it is caught and dryed up, so that it
is a <hi>corporeal</hi> spirit in all the qualities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:61095:109"/>
64. For, <hi>every</hi> Spirit in the seven Spirits of God
is impregnated with <hi>all</hi> the seven spirits, and they
all are one in another as <hi>one</hi> spirit, neither of them is
without the other.</p>
               <p>65. Only the Birth there in is <hi>thus,</hi> and so the one
generateth the other, in and through it self, and the
Birth <hi>lasteth</hi> or continueth thus from Eternity to
Eternity.</p>
               <p>66. Here I will have the Reader warned, that
he rightly <hi>consider</hi> the Divine Birth. Thou must <hi>not</hi>
think, that one spirit standeth <hi>by</hi> another, as you see
the Stars of Heaven stand one by another.</p>
               <p>67. But all the seven are <hi>one in another</hi> as one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
as this may be conceived in Man, who hath <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral</hi>
Thoughts because of the operation of the seven
Spirits of God, which keep and reside in, the <hi>humane
Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>68. But you may say to me, Thou art foolish in
this, for <hi>Any Member</hi> of the whole body hath the
<hi>power</hi> of the Other.</p>
               <p>69. Yet in what quality soever thou excitest or
<hi>awakenest</hi> the spirit, and makest it operative or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying,
according to that same quality, the Thoughts
rise up, and <hi>govern</hi> the Mind.</p>
               <p>70. If thou stirrest or awakest the spirit in the
fire, then there riseth up in thee the bitter and harsh
<hi>Anger;</hi> for as soon as the fire is kindled, which is
done in the hardnesse and fiercenesse, <hi>then</hi> springeth
up the bitter fiercenesse or wrath in the flash.</p>
               <p>71. For when thou elevatest thy self in thy Body
towards or <hi>against</hi> any thing, be it in Love or in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
now <hi>that</hi> which thou liftest up thy self towards
or against, thou Kindlest the <hi>Quality</hi> of that, and
that it is, which <hi>burneth</hi> in thy compacted incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61095:110"/>
Spirit, but that qualifying or conditionating
spirit is <hi>excited</hi> in the Flash.</p>
               <p>72. For when thou lookest upon any thing, which
doth <hi>not please</hi> thee, but is <hi>against</hi> or contrary to thee,
then thou <hi>raisest up</hi> the fountain of thy heart; as
when thou takest a stone, and therewith strikest fire
on a Steel, and so when the <hi>spark</hi> catcheth fire in the
heart, <hi>then</hi> the fire kindleth.</p>
               <p>73. At first it <hi>gloweth,</hi> but when thou stirrest the
source or fountain of the heart more violently, then
it is as when thou <hi>blowest</hi> the fire, so that the <hi>flame</hi>
is kindled; and then it is high time to quench it, else
the fire will be too great, and then <hi>burneth</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth,
and doth hurt to <hi>its Neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>74. Thou askest: <hi>How</hi> can a man quench this
kindled fire?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>75. Hearken, Thou hast the <hi>sweet</hi> water in thee,
pour that into the fire, and then it goeth out: if thou
<hi>letst</hi> it burn, then it consumeth in thee the Sap that is
in all the seven qualifying or fountain Spirits, so that
thou wilt become dry.</p>
               <p>76. When that is done, then
thou art a hellish fire-Brand, and
a Billet or Faggot to lay upon the
hellish fire, and then there is no
remedy for thee Eternally.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:61095:110"/>
77. But when thou lookest upon a thing which
thou <hi>lovest</hi> and awaknest the spirit in thine heart,
then thou <hi>kindlest</hi> the fire in thine heart, which burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
first in the sweet water, like a <hi>Glowing</hi> coal.</p>
               <p>78. And whilst it is but <hi>glimmering,</hi> it is only a
gentle soft longing delight or pleasing Lust in thee,
and doth <hi>not</hi> consume thee; but if thy heart be in a
greater commotion, and thou kindlest the sweet qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or fountain, so that it becomes a <hi>burning flame,</hi>
then thou kindlest all the qualifying or fountain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and then the whole body burneth, and so Mouth
and Hands fall on to work.</p>
               <p>79. <hi>This fire</hi> is the most dangerous and hurtful, and
hath spoiled Most, since the world began, and it
is a <hi>very hard</hi> matter to quench it: for when it is
kindled, it burneth in the <hi>sweet</hi> water in the flash of
Life, and must be quenched through <hi>Bitternesse,</hi>
which is scarce a water, but much <hi>rather</hi> is a
fire.</p>
               <p>80. <hi>Therefore</hi> also there followeth a heavy sad sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
Mind, when one is to forsake that, which
burneth in his Love-fire in the sweet fountain wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>81. But thou must know, that thou, in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thy Mind, art <hi>thine own</hi> Lord and Master,
there will rise up <hi>no</hi> fire to thee in the circle or
whole circumference of thy Body and Spirit, <hi>unless</hi>
thou awaknest it <hi>thy self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>82. It is true, all thy spirits spring and move in
thee, and rise up in thee, and indeed <hi>alwaies</hi> One spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath <hi>more</hi> power in thee then another.</p>
               <p>83. For if the Government of the spirits were in
one man as in another, then we should <hi>all</hi> have <hi>one</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:61095:111"/>
will and form: but they are all seven in <hi>the power</hi> of
thy compacted incorporated spirit, which spirit is
the SOUL.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> 84. [<q>It hath in it the <hi>first principle;</hi> the spirit of
the soul hath the <hi>second;</hi> and the Astral or
starry spirit in the Elements, hath the
<hi>Third,</hi> viz. this VVorld:</q>]</p>
               <p>85. Now if a fire riseth up in one qualifying or
fountain spirit, then that is <hi>not concealed</hi> or hidden
from the soul, It may instantly awaken the other
qualifying or fountain spirits, which are <hi>contrary</hi> to
the kindled fire, and <hi>may</hi> quench it.</p>
               <p>86. But if the fire will be, or become, <hi>too big,</hi> then
hath the soul a <hi>Prison,</hi> wherein it may shut up the
kindled spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> in the hard astringent quality, and
the <hi>other</hi> spirits must be the Gaylors, till their wrath
be allayed, and the fire be <hi>extinguish'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe, what that is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. When <hi>One</hi> qualifying or fountain spirit dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
thee too strongly, or presseth thee <hi>too hard</hi> to a
thing, which is against <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> then thou
must turn thine <hi>Eyes</hi> away from it: if that will not
help, then take <hi>that spirit,</hi> and cast it into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</p>
               <p>88. That is, Turn thy heart <hi>away</hi> from temporall
Pleasure and voluptuousnesse, from fulnesse of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drinking, from the <hi>Riches</hi> of this world; and
think: that, To day is the <hi>last</hi> Day of the <hi>End</hi> of thy
<hi>Body:</hi> turn away from the <hi>wantonnesse</hi> of the world,
and call <hi>earnestly</hi> to God, and yield or submit thy self
to Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:61095:111"/>
89. When thou dost so, then the world <hi>mocketh</hi>
thee, and thou are a <hi>fool</hi> to them. But bear <hi>this</hi> crosse
patiently, and let not the imprisoned spirit get out
of Prison again, but trust in God, and <hi>he will
set upon thee, the Crown of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>90. But if the spirit <hi>breaketh out</hi> of Prison, then
put it in again, <hi>make good</hi> thy Part against it as long as
thou livest, and if thou gettest so much advantage,
that it do not <hi>wholly</hi> kindle the source or fountain of
thy heart, whereby thy soul <hi>would</hi> become a dry fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand
of wood, each fountain or source having <hi>yet</hi>
its Sap, <hi>when</hi> thou departest from hence:</p>
               <p>91. Then will not that kindled fire at the Last
Judgment Day, hurt thee; nor will it cleave or <hi>stick</hi>
in thy Sappy-spirits, but after this anxious affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and trouble, thou wilt be in the Resurrection,
<hi>A triumphing Angel of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>92. But now, thou maist say; Is there in God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a <hi>contrary</hi> Will or Opposition, amongst or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the spirits of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>93. No: though I shew here their <hi>earnest</hi> Birth,
how earnestly and severely the spirits of God are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
whereby every one may very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the great earnest <hi>severity</hi> of God:</p>
               <p>94. Yet it doth <hi>not therefore follow,</hi> that there is a
disunion or <hi>discord</hi> amongst them: For the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61095:112"/>
                  <hi>deepest</hi> Birth or Geniture in the heart or ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
is onely and altogether <hi>so,</hi> which no creature
can apprehend in the Body, but in the <hi>flash,</hi> where
the hidden spirit is generated, there it will be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended:
for that is also generated in <hi>such</hi> a manner
and in such a power, as is here mentioned.</p>
               <p>95. But unto me is opened the Gate of my <hi>Mind,</hi>
so that I <hi>can</hi> see and discern it, else it would indeed
remain concealed with and hidden to me, <hi>till</hi> the <hi>day</hi>
of the resurrection from the dead; yea it hath been
concealed from <hi>all men,</hi> since the beginning of the
world: but I submit my will to Gods Will, let him
do what he pleaseth.</p>
               <p>96. In God <hi>all</hi> the spirits do triumph, as <hi>one</hi> spirit,
and one spirit alwaies mitigateth and loveth the
other, and so there is nothing but meer Joy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:
but their <hi>severe</hi> Birth or Geniture which is
effected or done in <hi>secret,</hi> must be so: for life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>or</hi> All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> Omniscience is <hi>thus</hi> generated:
<hi>and this is an eternall Birth or
Geniture, which is never other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>97. Thou must not think, that perhaps in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
there is <hi>some</hi> manner of Body which <hi>onely</hi> is thus
Generated, <hi>which</hi> above all other things, is called
God.</p>
               <p>98. No; but the whole Divine Power, which it
self is heaven, and the Heaven of <hi>all</hi> Heavens, is <hi>so</hi>
generated, and that is called GOD <hi>the Father;</hi> of
whom all holy Angels are generated, and live also
in the same power, also the spirit of all Angels in
their Body is alwayes continually and eternally <hi>thus
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61095:112"/>
generated,</hi> in like manner also is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of all
Men.</p>
               <p>99. For this world belongeth as well to the Body
or<note n="*" place="margin">Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality <hi>or</hi> Corporei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> 
                  <hi>Corpus</hi> of God the Father, as the Heaven doth;
but the <hi>spirits</hi> which are in the locality or space of
this world, were kindled through King <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in
his elevation, so that all things in this world are as
it were <hi>half</hi> Faint and Dead: And <hi>therefore</hi> it is,
that we poor men are so very much blinded, and live
in so great and <hi>desperate</hi> Danger.</p>
               <p>100. Yet thou must <hi>not</hi> therefore think, that the
heavenly light in this world, in the qualifying or
fountain spirits of God is <hi>quite</hi> extinct: no; there
is onely a duskishnesse or dimme <hi>Obscurity</hi> upon it,
so that we cannot apprehend it with our <hi>corrupted</hi>
Eyes;</p>
               <p>101. But if God did <hi>once</hi> put away that duskish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which moveth about the light, and that thy
eyes were opened, then, in <hi>that</hi> very place, where
thou standest, sittest, or lyest: thou shouldest see;
<hi>the glorious Countenance or Face
of God and the whole heavenly
Gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>102. Thou needest not first to cast thine eyes up
into Heaven, for it is written: <hi>The word is near thee,</hi>
viz: <hi>on thy Lips, and in thy Heart,</hi> Deut. 30. 14. Rom.
10. 8.</p>
               <p>103. Yea God is so near thee,
that the Birth or Geniture of the
Holy Trinity is done or wrought,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61095:113"/>
even in thy heart, yea all the
Three Persons are Generated in
thy heart, even God the Father,
Sonne, and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>104. Now, when I write here, concerning the
midst or <hi>Center,</hi> that the fountain of the Divine Birth
or Geniture is in the midst or Center; the meaning
is <hi>not,</hi> that in Heaven there is a peculiar or <hi>severall</hi>
place, or a peculiar <hi>several</hi> Body, wherein the fire of
the divine life riseth up, out of which the seven spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of God go forth into the whole <hi>Deep</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>105. No; but I speak in a corporeal, or Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
or Humane way, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understand it; in such a manner, as the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Creatures were Imaged or framed, and as it is
in God every where, <hi>universally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>106. For thou canst not nominate any place ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in heaven or in this world, wherein the divine
Birth or Geniture is <hi>not thus,</hi> be it in an Angel, or
Holy man, or any where else.</p>
               <p>107. Wheresoever one qualifying or fountain
spirit in the divine power is <hi>touched</hi> or stirred, let the
place be where, or thing what, it will, <hi>except</hi> in the
Devils and all wicked damned Men; there is the
fountain of the divine Birth or Geniture, clearly at
hand, and there <hi>already</hi> are all the seven qualifying
or fountain-Spirits of God.</p>
               <p>108. As when thou wouldst make a spacious <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely</hi>
circumscribed circle, and hadst the whole
Deity peculiarly <hi>apart</hi> therein, Then Just so as it is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61095:113"/>
generated in a Creature, so it is also in the whole
Deep of the Father in all places and parts thereof,
and in all <hi>things.</hi>

               <p>109. And in such a manner,
is God, an All-mighty, all-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all-seeing, all-hearing, all-smelling,
all-feeling God, who is
every where, and proveth the

eternal Pain and Torment, and moreover Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
shame and Reproach.</p>
               <p>111. For the Total <hi>glorious</hi> face of God, together

above them and under them, and round

               <p>112. And all holy Angels together with all holy
Men, will eternally triumph above them, below
them, and round about <hi>them,</hi> and for great Joy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and Pleasantnesse; sing of Gods <hi>Holinesse,</hi> of

               </p>
               <p>113. On the contrary, the Devils with all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men will be <hi>forced</hi> into a Hole, where a hellish

the manner of the kindled spirits of God, eternally,
in their Body, as also in their <hi>Courts</hi> Dominions
Regions Space or Circumference.</p>
               <p>114. Nay, if they could be lock'd in or barred up
into a <hi>Hole,</hi> that the angry face of God might <hi>not</hi>

and would not be necessitated to endure eternal
Ignominie, shame, and reproach.</p>
               <p>115. But here is no help, their <hi>Torment</hi> encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

in the Divine Power.</head>
               <p>1.
THe <hi>Seventh</hi> Spirit of God in the Divine
Power is the <hi>Corpus</hi> or Body which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
out of the other <hi>Six</hi> spirits, wherein
<hi>All</hi> heavenly figures subsist, and wherein all
things Image and form themselves, and wherein all
<hi>Beauty</hi> and Joy riseth up.</p>
               <p>2. This is the very spirit of Nature, yea <hi>Nature
it self,</hi> wherein apprehensibility or comprehensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
consisteth, and wherein all Creatures are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in Heaven and on Earth. Yea <hi>heaven</hi> it self is
therein formed; and <hi>Naturality</hi> in the whole Deity,
consisteth in <hi>this</hi> Spirit.</p>
               <p>3. If it were not for this Spirit, there would be
neither Angel nor man, and God would be an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable</hi>
Being, subsisting <hi>onely</hi> in an unsearchable
Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Now the Question is: How is this form? Or
in what manner is this so?</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:61095:115"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou art a Rational Mercurial spirit, which
<hi>presseth</hi> through all the seven Spirits of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
proveth and examineth them, how they are,
then thou wilt by the <hi>explanation</hi> of this seventh Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
conceive and understand the <hi>Operation,</hi> and the
<hi>Being</hi> of the whole Deity, and apprehend it in thy
Sense or Mind.</p>
               <p>5. <q>But if thou <hi>understandest</hi> nothing by this Spirit,
then let this book alone,<note place="margin">Gregorius <hi>Richter</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marius Zu Gorlitz. Gregory <hi>Rickter</hi> the Primate or Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Clergy at Gerlitz.</note> and <hi>(Richte) Judge,</hi> neither
of the cold nor of the warmth therein: for <hi>thou</hi> art
too hard bound and captivated in <hi>Saturnus,</hi> and
art not a Philosopher in this world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>6. Let thy <hi>(Richten) Judging</hi> alone, or else thou wilt
receive thy <hi>evil</hi> wages for it; therefore I will have
thee faithfully warned of it. Tarry till thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
into the other life, for then the heavenly Gate
<hi>will</hi> be opened to thee, and then thou also wilt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now observe the depth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Here I must <hi>layhold</hi> on the whole divine Body
in the Midst or center at the Heart, and explain the
whole Body, how Nature is or existeth, and there
you will see <hi>the highest ground,</hi> how all the seven
Spirits of God <hi>continually</hi> generate one another, and
<hi>how</hi> the Deity hath neither Beginning nor End.</p>
               <p>8. Therefore behold and see the Longing desired
pleasure of thy Spirit, the eternal divine <hi>Joyfulnesse,</hi>
and the heavenly delight and corporeal Joy, which
in all eternity hath <hi>no</hi> End.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:61095:116"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. When the flash riseth up in the Center, then
the divine birth standeth in its full operation: in
God it is continually and <hi>Eternally</hi> thus: but <hi>not</hi> so in
us poor fleshly children.</p>
               <p>10. In this Life, the triumphing divine birth lasteth
in us Men, only <hi>so long</hi> as the flash lasteth, therefore
our <hi>knowledge is but in part,</hi> whereas in God, the flash
standeth unchangeably alwaies Eternally thus.</p>
               <p>11. Behold, all the seven Spirits of <hi>God</hi> are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
alike together at once; none of them is the first,
and none of them is the last; but we must have an
Eye to the Kernel, and consider how the divine
Birth or <hi>Geniture</hi> riseth up, otherwise man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
it not.</p>
               <p>12. For the creatures cannot comprehend <hi>at once,</hi>
all the seven Spirits, one in another, but they look
upon them; But when one Spirit is touched or stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
then that toucheth or stirreth all the other, and
then the Birth or Geniture standeth in full Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>13. Therefore it hath a beginning <hi>in Man,</hi> but
none <hi>in God;</hi> and therefore I must also write in a
<hi>creaturely</hi> manner, or else thou <hi>canst not</hi> understand
it.</p>
               <p>14. Behold all the seven Spirits without the flash,
were a dark Valley, but when the <hi>flash</hi> riseth up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Astringent and Bitter qualities, in the
Heat, then it becometh <hi>shining</hi> in the sweet water,
and in the flames of the Heat, it becometh Bitter and
triumphing and Living, and in the astringent it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
Corporeal, Dry and <hi>Bright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:61095:116"/>
15. And now these four Spirits move themselves
in the flash, for all the four become living therein,
and so now the power of these four riseth up in the
flash, as if the <hi>Life</hi> did rise up, and the <hi>power</hi> which
is risen up in the flash, is the Love, which is <hi>the fift
Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. And that power moveth so very pleasantly
and amiably in the flash, as if a dead Spirit did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
living, and were suddainly in a Moment set in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great clarity or <hi>brighnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. Now in this moving, one power toucheth or
stirreth the other: and first the astringent beateth or
striketh, and the heat maketh in that beating or
stroak, a <hi>clear</hi> ringing sound, and the bitter Power
divideth the ringing, and the water maketh it mild
and soft and so mitigateth it; And this is <hi>the sixth
Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. And now the Tone in all the <hi>five</hi> spirits riseth
up like a melodious pleasant Musick, and remaineth
so standing; for the astringent quality exsiccateth or
drieth it up.</p>
               <p>19 So now, in the same sound that is <hi>gone forth,</hi>
which now subsisteth being dryed, and is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>all the six</hi> qualifying or fountain spirits, and is
as it were the <hi>Seed</hi> of the other six spirits, which
they have there compacted or incorporated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and made a Spirit thereof, which hath the
quality of <hi>all</hi> the Spirits: And that is <hi>the Seventh Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God</hi> in the divine power.</p>
               <p>20. Now this Spirit subsisteth in its colour like
Azure or Heaven-<hi>Blew,</hi> for it is generated out of all
the six Spirits; and when the flash which standeth
in the midst or Center in the Heat, <hi>shineth</hi> into the
other Spirits, so that they rise up in the flash, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61095:117"/>
the seventh Spirit; then the <hi>flash</hi> riseth up
also in the birth of the <hi>six</hi> Spirits together in the
<hi>seventh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. But because the Seventh hath no <hi>peculiar</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in it, therefore cannot the flash in the seventh be
brighter, but it receiveth from the seventh, the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi>
Being of all the seven Spirits, and the flash
standeth in the midst or <hi>Center</hi> of these seven Spirits,
and is generated from all the seven.</p>
               <p>22. And the seven Spirits are the <hi>Father</hi> of the
Light, and the Light is their Sonne, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
continually generate thus from Eternity to
Eternity, and the light enlightneth and alwaies
Eternally maketh the seven Spirits living, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
for they all receive their rising and <hi>Life</hi> in the
power of Light.</p>
               <p>23. Again, they all generate the light, and all
are together alike the Father of the Light, and the
light generateth no one Spirit, but maketh them <hi>all</hi>
living and <hi>Joyful,</hi> that they alwaies continually stand
in the Birth.</p>
               <p>24. Behold I will shew it thee once more, that
so by <hi>any means</hi> thou mayst apprehend it, that this
high work <hi>may not</hi> passe away in vain without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to <hi>thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>25. The astringent quality is the <hi>first</hi> Spirit, and
that attracteth or draweth together and maketh all
Dry: The sweet quality is the <hi>second</hi> Spirit, and
that softneth or mitigateth it: Now the <hi>third</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is the bitter Spirit, which existeth from the
fourth and first.</p>
               <p>26. And so when the third Spirit in its rage <hi>rubs</hi>
its self in the astringent, then it kindleth the <hi>fire,</hi>
and then the <hi>fiercenesse</hi> in the fire riseth up in the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61095:117"/>
astringent. In that fiercenesse now the bitter Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
becometh <hi>self-subsisting;</hi> and in the sweet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
meek or <hi>Mild,</hi> and in the hard it becometh
<hi>Corpor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al,</hi> and so now it subsisteth, and is also the
<hi>fourth</hi> Spirit.</p>
               <p>27. Now the flash in the power of these <hi>four</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth in the heat, and riseth up in the sweet
spring water or fountain; the bitter maketh it <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing,</hi>
the astringent maketh it <hi>shining,</hi> dry, and
corporeal, and the sweet maketh it meek or <hi>Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi>
and so it receiveth its first shining or Lustre in the
sweet, and here now the flash, or the light subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the midst or Center, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. Now when that Light, which standeth in
the midst or Center, shineth <hi>into</hi> the four Spirits,
then the power of the <hi>four</hi> Spirits riseth up in the
light, and they become living, and <hi>Love</hi> the light;
that is, they take it into them, and are impregnated
with it, and that Spirit which is so taken in, is the
Love of the Life; which is the fifth Spirit.</p>
               <p>29. Now when they have taken the love into
them, then they qualifie Act or <hi>operate</hi> for great Joy:
for the one seeth the other in the Light, and so the
one toucheth or stirreth the other.</p>
               <p>30. And then the tone riseth up; and the har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Spirit beateth striketh or <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mpeth;</hi> but the sweet
maketh that beating or striking <hi>Mild;</hi> and the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>divideth</hi> it, according to the condition or kind of
every quality, the fourth causeth the <hi>ringing,</hi> the

sounding is the <hi>Tone</hi> or Tune or the <hi>Sixth</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>31. In this Tone riseth up the <hi>power</hi> of all the six
Spirits, and becometh a palpable Body, to speak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61095:118"/>
an Angelicall manner, and subsisteth in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the other six Spirits, and in the light; and this
is the <hi>Body</hi> of Nature, wherein all heavenly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Ideas Figures and Sprouts or Vegetations, are
Imaged or fashioned.</p>
            </div>

               <head>The Holy Gates.</head>
               <p>32.
But the <hi>Light,</hi> which subsisteth in the midst or
Center in all the Seven Spirits, and wherein stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>Life</hi> of all the seven Spirits; and whereby
all seven become triumphing and Joyful, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the heavenly <hi>joyfulnesse</hi> riseth up;</p>
               <p>33. That is <hi>it,</hi> which all the seven spirits do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and that is the <hi>Sonne</hi> of all the seven spirits, and
the seven Spirits are its <hi>Father,</hi> which generate the
Light; and the Light generateth in them, the <hi>Life;</hi>
and the <hi>Light</hi> is the Heart of the seven spirits.</p>
               <p>34. And this Light is the true
Sonne of God, whom we Christians
worship and honour, as the Second
Person in the holy Trinity.</p>
               <p>35. And all the seven Spirits of
God together, are God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>36. For no one spirit of them is <hi>alone</hi> or without

               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:61095:118"/>
37. But the <hi>Light</hi> is another <hi>Person,</hi> for it is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually</hi>
generated out of, or from the seven spirits,
and the seven spirits rise up continually in the light;
and the powers of these seven spirits go forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

thou <hi>art to rise</hi> from the Dead at the Last Day, and
live Eternally.</p>

               <p>45. Moreover thou art blind. For who shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
thee <hi>from the love of God,</hi> in which thou art
born or Generated, and <hi>wherein</hi> thou livest; if thou
perseverest and continuest therein, till the End?

               <p>What Prerogative or Advantage then have

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>51. Very much; For they <hi>know the way of life,</hi> and
know <hi>how</hi> they should rise from the Fall: but if any
<hi>will lye still,</hi> then he must be thrown into the <hi>Ditch,</hi>
and there must perish with all the <hi>wicked</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p>52. Therefore take heed what thou dost, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what thou art; thou <hi>judgest</hi> others, and art
<hi>blind</hi> thy self.</p>
               <p>53, But the Spirit saith thou hast no cause for it,
<hi>viz.</hi> to Judge him who is <hi>better</hi> then thou: Have we
not all <hi>one</hi> flesh, and our life subsisteth in God, be it
in his Love, or in his Anger? for <hi>what thou sowest,
that thou shalt reap.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:61095:120"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi>
               </p>
               <p>54. God is not the Cause thereof that thou art
lost: for the law, to do right or righteousness, is
written in <hi>Nature</hi> and thou hast <hi>that very Book</hi> in thy
Heart.</p>
               <p>55. Thou knowest very well, that thou <hi>shouldest</hi>
deal well and friendly with thy Neighbour; also
thou knowest well that thou shouldest <hi>not vilifie</hi> thy
own life; that is, thou shouldest not bemire and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file</hi>
thy own body and soul and lay open their
shame.</p>
               <p>56. Surely <hi>herein</hi> consisteth the Pith and kernell,
and the Love of God. God doth not regard any mans
<hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Birth,</hi> but he that moveth or acteth in the
Love of God, moveth in the <hi>Light,</hi> and the light is
the Heart of God. Now he that <hi>sitteth</hi> in the Heart
of God, who can spew him out from thence? none,
for he is begotten or Generated in God.</p>
               <p>57. O thou blind <hi>half dead</hi> world, cease from thy
Judging, O thou blind Jew, Turk and Heathen desist
from thy <hi>calumniating,</hi> and submit thy self in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God, and walk in the Light, then thou wilt
<hi>see, how</hi> thou shouldest rise from thy Fall, and how
thou shouldest Arme thy self in this world against
the hellish <hi>fiercenesse</hi> and wrath, and how thou mayst
overcome, and live <hi>with God,</hi> Eternally.</p>
               <p>58. Most certainly, <hi>there is but One God,</hi> but when
the vail is put away from thy Eyes, so that thou
seest and knowest <hi>him,</hi> then thou wilt also see and
know <hi>all</hi> thy brethren whether they be <hi>Christians,
Jews, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>59. Or dost thou think, that God is the God of
you <hi>Christians</hi> only? Do not the <hi>Heathens</hi> also live in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61095:121"/>
God <hi>whosoever doth</hi> right or <hi>righteousnesse, God</hi> loveth
and <hi>accepteth him,</hi> Act. 10. 35.</p>
               <p>60. Or, what didst thou know, that art a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<hi>how God would</hi> Redeem and deliver thee from
Evill? what friendship and <hi>familiarity</hi> haddest thou
with HIM? or what covenant haddest thou made
with HIM, <hi>when</hi> God caused his Sonne to become
Man or be incarnate, to redeem <hi>Mankind?</hi> Is He
only <hi>thy</hi> King? Is it not written, <hi>He is the comfort of
all the Heathen,</hi> Haggai. 2. 8.</p>
               <p>61. <hi>Hearken,</hi> By one man sin came into the world, and
pressed through one upon all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. and through
one came the Redemption into the world, and pressed
through one upon all, <hi>what therefore lieth in</hi> any mans
<hi>knowledge? No! indeed thou didst not know, how
God would deale with thee, when</hi> thou wert Dead <hi>in
Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>62. Now as <hi>Sin</hi> without distinction raigneth
through one Man over all, so <hi>Mercy</hi> and Redemption
raigneth through one over all.</p>
               <p>63. But unto those Heathens, Jews and Turks,
<hi>blindnesse did befall,</hi> yet for all that, they stand in an
anxious Birth, and <hi>seek</hi> for a rest, they <hi>desire</hi> Grace,
though they seek not for it at the right mark or in
the right Place or Limit: but <hi>God</hi> is <hi>every where,</hi> and
looketh upon the ground of the <hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>64. But if in their anxious Birth the Light be
generated <hi>in them;</hi> what art thou, that judgest
them?</p>
               <p>65. Behold! thou blind Man, I will demonstrate
this to thee, thus; Go into a Medow, there thou seest
<hi>several</hi> sorts of Herbs, and flowers, thou seest some
that are Bitter, some Tart, Sweet, Sowre, White,
Yellow, Red, Blew, Green, and many various
sorts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:61095:121"/>
66. Do they not all grow out of the <hi>Earth?</hi> Do
they not stand one by another? Doth the one <hi>Grutch</hi>
the beautious form of the other?</p>
               <p>67. But if one among them lifteth up it self too
high in its growth, and so <hi>withereth,</hi> because it hath
not Sap enough; How can the <hi>Earth</hi> help it? Doth it
not afford its Sap to <hi>that</hi> as well as to the other.</p>
               <p>68. But if <hi>Thorns</hi> grow among them, and the
Mower cometh to reap his crop, he cutteth them
down together, but he casteth out the Thorns and
they are to be <hi>burnt</hi> in the fire: but the various
flowers and good Crop, he gathereth and causeth it
to be brought into his Barn.</p>
               <p>69. Thus it is also with Men, there are <hi>diversities</hi>
of Gifts and accomplishments Endowments or
Aptitudes, one it may be is much <hi>Lighter</hi> or brighter
in God then an other, but all the while they do not
<hi>wither in the Spirit,</hi> they are not rejectible, but when
the <hi>Spirit</hi> withereth, then that is good and usefull
for nothing, but for fewell, and is only as wood for
the Fire.</p>
               <p>70. But if the Turks be of an <hi>astringent</hi> Quality,
and the Heathens of a <hi>Bitter,</hi> what is that to thee? Is
the light becom <hi>shining</hi> in the astringent and bitter
qualities, then it giveth Light also.</p>
               <p>71. But thou art generated in the Heat, where
the light riseth up in the <hi>sweet</hi> spring or fountain-water,
have a care, lest the Heat <hi>burn</hi> thee, it is time,
thou shouldst do well to <hi>Quench</hi> that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>72. Thou sayest: Is it <hi>right</hi> then that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
Jewes and Turks, should persevere in their
<hi>blindnesse?</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>73. No; but this I say; How can he see, that
hath <hi>no Eyes?</hi> for what doth the poor Lay <hi>or</hi> vulgar
man know, of the <hi>Tumults</hi> which the Priests have
in their drunkennesse? He goeth on in his simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and generateth anxiously, in his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>74. But then thou sayest: Hath <hi>God</hi> blinded the
Turks, Jews and Heathens?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No; but when God kindled the light for them,
then they lived after the pleasures <hi>voluptuousnesse</hi>
and Lusts of their own Hearts, and would not be
led or directed <hi>by the Spirit,</hi> and so the <hi>outward</hi> Light
extinguished.</p>
               <p>75. But it is not therefore so <hi>totally</hi> extinguished,
that it <hi>could not</hi> be generated in Man; for man is out
of or from God, and liveth in God, be it either in
Love or in Wrath.</p>
               <p>76. Now if man be in a Longing, should he not
be <hi>impregnated</hi> in his Longing: and so if he be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
once, then he can generate also. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>outward</hi> Light doth nor shine to him, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
he doth not know his Sonne, whom he hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated.</p>
               <p>77. But when the Light <hi>shall arise</hi> on the Last
Jugment Day, then he will <hi>See</hi> HIM.</p>
               <p>78. Behold, I tell thee a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery:

the <hi>North;</hi> For in the Center of the astringent

From the midst or Center, where the Heat Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

               </p>
               <p>82. Then what do those in the <hi>West?</hi> their Bitter

                  <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>before</hi> his Fall, and what, properly, the

the circumstances exactly concerning this <hi>seventh</hi>
qualifying or fountain-spirit of God, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>85. The seventh qualifying or fountain spirit of
God is the qualifying or fountain-spirit of <hi>Nature:</hi>
for the <hi>other</hi> six do generate the seventh; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
when it is generated, is then as it were the
<hi>Mother</hi> of the six, which encompasseth the other six,

               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here the Sense:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>86. The <hi>six</hi> rise up in a full or compleat Birth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

and when they are risen up, then is their power
mingled one in another, and the hardnesse <hi>dryeth</hi> it,

               <p>88. Now in this rising up of the six spirits, there
riseth up also the <hi>Mercurius,</hi> Tone, or Sound, of all

of the Deity also, wherein a Man is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
two principles of a twofold
source, <hi>viz. I.</hi> a Hot, Fierce, Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
Bitter, Anxious, Consuming One
in the fire-source. And out of the fire
cometh the <hi>II.</hi> viz. the light, which
dwelleth in the Fire, but is not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
or laid hold on by the fire; also it
hath another source then the fire hath,
which is, <hi>Meeknesse,</hi> wherein there is a
desire of <hi>Love,</hi> where then in the Love-desire
another will, is understood, then
that which the Fire hath.</p>
                  <p>92. For the fire will consume all, and causeth a
high rising in the source, and the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the light, causeth Entity or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61095:124"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> In the eternal light it
causeth the water-spirit of Eternal life;
And in the third principle of this world,
it causeth water, together with the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
or Original of the Ayr.</p>
                  <p>93. Thus the Reader is to understand this book as
concerning Three Principles or Births,
viz one is the original of the Eternall
Nature, in the eternal will or desire of
God; which desire driveth it self on in
great anguish till it come to the <hi>fourth
form,</hi> viz. to the Fire.</p>
                  <p>94. Wherein the second, which is the Light, exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and replenisheth the Eternal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
besides or beyond Nature, wherein we
understand the holy <hi>Ternarie</hi> in the
Light, without or beyond Nature, in the
power of the Light, in the Liberty, as
another or second spring or source without
Being; and yet united with the fire's
Nature, viz. as Fire and Light together
in One.</p>
                  <p>95. And the third principle of this world is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and created out of the First, that
is, Magically: as is clearly demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our<note n="*" place="margin">Three Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> 
                     <hi>Second</hi> and<note n="†" place="margin">Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Life.</note> 
                     <hi>Third Book,</hi>
unto which this Book is onely an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
and is the <hi>first Book,</hi> which was
not sufficiently apprehended by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
at the first time, though it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
clearly enough, yet all of it could not
be conceived; also it was as when a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
or stormy Showre of Rain passeth
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61095:124"/>
over a place, from whence vegetation and
springing existeth: for, therein, is the
<hi>Seed</hi> of the whole Deity:]</p>
               </q>
               <p>—96.</p>
               <p>As in the <hi>mother;</hi> and then the seventh genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
all manner of Fruits and Colours according to
the <hi>Operation</hi> of the Six.</p>
               <p>97. But here thou must know, that the <hi>Deity</hi> doth
not stand still, but worketh and riseth up without
<hi>intermission,</hi> as a pleasant wrestling, moving or
struggling;</p>
               <p>98. Like <hi>two</hi> creatures, which in <hi>great Love</hi> play
together, Embracing struggling and wrestling one
with the other; now the one is above, by and by
the other, and when <hi>one</hi> hath overcome, it yeeldeth
or giveth over, and lets the <hi>other</hi> rise up again.</p>
               <p>99. Thou mayst also understand it thus in a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
as when <hi>Seven Persons</hi> had begun a friendly
Sport and Play, where one gets the upper hand
above another, and a <hi>third</hi> comes to help <hi>that one</hi>
which is overcome; and so there is a pleasant friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sporting amongst them; whereas indeed they all
have one and the <hi>same</hi> agreement or Love-will toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and yet strive and fight or vie one against the
other in a way of <hi>Love</hi> in sporting and past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>
               <p>100. And thus also is the <hi>working</hi> of the six Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of God in the seventh; suddenly <hi>one</hi> of them
hath a strong rising up, suddenly <hi>another;</hi> and thus
they wrestle in love one with another.</p>
               <p>101. And when the Light riseth up <hi>along</hi> in this
striving, then the Holy Ghost moveth in the power
of the Light in the Play of the other six spirits, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61095:125"/>
so in the seventh there <hi>spring up</hi> all manner of fruits
of life, and <hi>all manner</hi> of Colours and vegetations or
Ideas and forms.</p>
               <p>102. Now as that quality is which is <hi>strongest,</hi> so
the Body of the fruit is Imaged, and the Colours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
in this striving, or wrestling the <hi>Deity</hi> formeth it
self into infinite and insearchable variety of kinds
and manners of Images or Ideas.</p>
               <p>103. For, the seven spirits are the <hi>seven</hi>-head-Sources
or springs, and when <hi>Mercurius</hi> riseth up
therein, that stirreth all, and the bitter quality mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
it, and <hi>distinguisheth</hi> it, and the astringent <hi>dryeth</hi>
it up.</p>
               <p>104. [<q>
                     <hi>Nature</hi> and the <hi>Ternarie</hi> are not one and
the same, they are distinct, though the
Ternarie dwelleth <hi>in</hi> Nature but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehended,
and yet is an eternall
Band, as is plainly expounded in our
Second and Third Book.</q>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Now observe here, how the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in Nature is in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Spirit.</head>
               <p>105. The sweet water is the <hi>beginning</hi> of Nature,
and the astringent quality draweth or attracteth it
together, that it becomes natural and <hi>creatural,</hi> to
speak in an Angelical way.</p>
               <p>106. Now being drawn together, it looketh like
<hi>Azure</hi> or Skie-colour Blew, but when the light or
flash riseth up therein, then it looketh like the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Jaspis, or <hi>Jasper stone,</hi> or as I may call it in my
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61095:125"/>
language, a Glassie Sea, on which the Sun shineth,
and that very clear and Bright.</p>
               <p>107. But when the bitter quality riseth up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
then it divideth and formeth it self, as if it were
<hi>alive</hi> or lively, or as if the Life did rise up there, in
a <hi>greenish</hi> flourishing manner and form, like a Green
Flash of Lightening, to speak after the manner of
men, even so that it dazleth a mans Eyes, and <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
him.</p>
               <p>108. But when the Heat riseth up therein, then
the Green form inclineth to a half Red or <hi>Ruddy</hi>
form, as when a Carbuncle stone shineth from the
Green flash or <hi>Beam</hi> of Light.</p>
               <p>109. But when the Light, which is the Sonne of
God, shineth into this Sea of Nature; then it get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
its <hi>Yellowish</hi> and Whitish Colour, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
compare with any thing; but you must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to stay or tarry with this aspect or vision, till
you <hi>come into</hi> the other Life.</p>
               <p>110. For this now is the true Heaven of Nature,
which is out of or from God. wherein the <hi>Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
dwell, and out of which they were created in
the beginning.</p>
               <p>111. Behold now, when the <hi>Mercurius</hi> or Tone in
this Nature Heaven, riseth up, there the Divine and
Angelical joyfulnesse riseth up, for therein rise up
Forms, Imagings, Colours, and Angelicall <hi>Fruits,</hi>
which blossome curiously, grow, spring, flourish,
and stand in <hi>Perfection,</hi> as to all manner of Bearing
or fruit Trees, Plants and springing growths, of a
Gracious comely lovely amiable blessed prospect
vision or sight to be looked upon, with a most deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
lovely pleasant Smell and Taste.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:61095:126"/>
112. But here I speak with an
Angels Tongue, thou must not
understand it Earthly, like to this
world.</p>
               <p>113. It is with <hi>Mercurius</hi> in this manner or form,
also; thou must <hi>not</hi> think, that there is any hard bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
striking, toning or sounding, or whistling and
Piping, in the Deity, as when one taketh a Huge
Trumpet, and Bloweth in it, and maketh it to
Sound.</p>
               <p>114. O <hi>no,</hi> Dear Man; thou half dead Angel,
that is not so, but all is done and consisteth, in <hi>power:</hi>
for the Divine Being standeth in power: but the
holy Angels sing, ring and Trumpet forth, with clear
and <hi>shrill sounding:</hi> for to that End God hath made
them out of himself, that they should encrease and
multiply the Heavenly Joy: <hi>[and therefore were the
Angels made out of God.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>115. Also such an Image was <hi>Adam,</hi> as God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, before his <hi>Eve</hi> was made out of him; but
the corrupted <hi>Salitter</hi> did wrestle with the Well-spring
of Life <hi>in Adam,</hi> till it overcame. And so
<hi>Adam</hi> became faint, which made him fall into a
<hi>Sleep.</hi> Here he was undone: And if the Bamhert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zigkeit,
or the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God had not come to help
him, and made a <hi>woman</hi> out of him, he should have
continued still asleep.</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:61095:126"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of this we will speak in its
proper Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>116. This, as in mentioned above, is that fair
Bright and holy Heaven, which is thus in the <hi>Totall</hi>
Deitie, which hath neither Beginning nor End, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no Creature with its sense <hi>can</hi> reach.</p>
               <p>117. Yet thou shalt know this, that alwaies in a
place suddenly <hi>one</hi> quality sheweth its self <hi>more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
then the other, suddenly the second prevaileth,
suddenly the third, then suddenly the fourth, sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
again the fifth, suddenly the sixth, then again
suddenly the seventh.</p>
               <p>118. Thus, there is an <hi>Eternal wrestling,</hi> working,
and friendly amiable rising up of Love; where then
in this rising up, the Deity continually <hi>sheweth</hi> it self
<hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> wonderful, more incomprehensible
and more unsearchable.</p>
               <p>119. So that the holy Angels cannot sufficiently
<hi>enough</hi> rejoyce themselves, nor sufficiently enough
converse walk and most lovingly sport therein, nor
sufficiently enough sing, that <hi>Te Deum Laudamus,</hi> We
praise thee, O God, <hi>in Halelujah's,</hi> as to each qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Great God, according to his wonderfull
Revelation, and Wisdome, and Beauty, and Fruit,
and Form.</p>
               <p>120. For the qualities rise up <hi>Eternally,</hi> and so
there is not with them or among them, either Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
Middle or End.</p>
               <p>121. And although I have written here: how all
is come to be, and how all is framed <hi>formed</hi> and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and how the Deity riseth up, yet for all that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61095:127"/>
thou must not think, that it hath any Rest ceasing or
extinction, and that afterward it riseth up thus
<hi>again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>122. O no: but I must write in <hi>part</hi> or by pieces,
for the Readers better understanding, that he might
thereby apprehend <hi>somewhat,</hi> and so attain the Sence
and Meaning thereof.</p>
               <p>123. <hi>Neither</hi> must thou think, that I have climbed
up aloft into Heaven, and beheld it with my <hi>carnall</hi>
or fleshly Eyes. O, no; hear me, thou <hi>half-dead</hi>
Angel, I am as thou art, and have no greater light
in my <hi>outward</hi> Being, then thou hast.</p>
               <p>124. Moreover, I am a <hi>sinful</hi> and mortall man,
as well as thou, and I must every day and hour grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
struggle and fight with the Devill who afflicteth
me in my corrupted lost Nature, in the fierce or
wrathful quality, which <hi>is</hi> in my flesh, as in all Men,
continually.</p>
               <p>125. Suddenly I get the better of him, suddenly
he is too hard for me; yet for all that he hath <hi>not</hi>
overcome or conquered me, though he often getteth
the <hi>advantage</hi> over me: <hi>for our life is as
a perpetuall warfare with the
Devill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>126. [<q>This Strife and Battle is about that most
High Noble Victorious Garland, till the
corrupted perished Adamical Man is
killed and <hi>dead,</hi> in which the Devill
hath an <hi>accesse</hi> to Man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>127. <q>Of which the Sophister will know nothing: for
he is not generated of God, but is <hi>born
of Flesh and Blood:</hi> and though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61095:127"/>
the Birth standeth open for and
towards him, yet he will not enter; for
the Devil withholds him: God blindeth
None.</q>]</p>
               <p>128. If he buffetteth me, then I must <hi>retire</hi> and
give back, but the Divine power helpeth me <hi>again,</hi>
then he also getteth a Blow, and often loseth the day,
in the fight.</p>
               <p>129. But when he is overcome, then the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gate openeth <hi>in my spirit,</hi> and then the spirit seeth
the Divine and heavenly Being, not externally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Body, but in the fountain or well-spring of
the <hi>Heart</hi> there riseth up the flash in the <hi>sensibility</hi> or
Thoughts of the Brain, and therein the spirit doth
contemplate or meditate.</p>
               <p>130. For <hi>Man</hi> is made out of all the powers of
God, out of all the seven Spirits of God, as the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
are also. But now seeing Man is <hi>corrupted,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Divine Birth doth not <hi>alwayes</hi> spring qualifie
or operate in him, no, nor in all men neither: And
though indeed it springeth in him, yet the <hi>high light</hi>
doth not presently shine in all men; and though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it doth shine, yet it is incomprehensible to the
corrupted Nature.</p>
               <p>131. For, the Holy Ghost will not be caught held
or <hi>retained</hi> in the <hi>sinful</hi> flesh; but riseth up like a
flash of lightning; even as fire flashes and sparckles
out of a Stone, when a man strikes fire upon
it.</p>
               <p>132. But when the flash is caught in the fountain
of the Heart, then the Holy Ghost riseth up in the
seven qualifying or fountain spirits, into the Brain
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61095:128"/>
like the Day-break, Dawning of the Day, or Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rednesse: and therein <hi>sticketh</hi> the mark Aime or
scope, and knowledge.</p>
               <p>133. For in <hi>that light,</hi> the one seeth the other, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the other, smelleth the other, tasteth the other,
and heareth the other, and is as if the whole Deity
did rise up therein.</p>
               <p>134. And <hi>herein</hi> the spirit seeth into the depth of
the Deity; for in God, near and afar off, is all one; And
that same God, of whom I write in this Book, is as
well in his <hi>Ternarie</hi> in the Body of a Holy soul; As
in Heaven.</p>
               <p>135. From this God I take my knowledge, and
from no other thing, neither will I know <hi>any other
thing,</hi> then that same God, and the same it is which
maketh that assurance in my spirit, that I <hi>steadfastly</hi>
believe, and trust in him.</p>
               <p>136. And though an Angel from heaven should
tell this to me, yet for all that I <hi>could not</hi> believe it;
much lesse lay hold on it, for I should alwayes doubt,
whether it were certainly so or no: But the <hi>Sun</hi> it
self ariseth in my spirit, and therefore I am most
<hi>sure</hi> of it, and I my self do see the proceeding and
Birth of the holy Angels and of <hi>all things,</hi> both in
heaven and in this world.</p>
               <p>137. For the Holy Soul is <hi>one spirit with God,</hi> though
indeed it is a Creature, yet it is <hi>like</hi> to the Angels:
Also the Soul of Man seeth much deeper then the
Angels; for the Angels see onely to the heavenly
Pomp, but the Soul seeth <hi>both</hi> the Heavenly and the
Hellish, for it liveth <hi>between</hi> both.</p>
               <p>138. Therefore it must undergo many hard Bangs
and pinches, and must every day and hour wrestle
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61095:128"/>
and struggle with the devill, that is, with the<note n="*" place="margin">or devillish conditions inclinations and passions in us.</note> 
                  <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
qualities,</hi> and so it liveth in great danger in this
world: and therefore this life is very well called,
the <hi>Valley of misery,</hi> full of anguish, a <hi>perpetual</hi> hurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burly
pulling and haling, worrying warring fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
struggling and striving.</p>
               <p>139. But the cold and <hi>half</hi>-dead Body doth not
<hi>alwayes</hi> understand this fight of the Soul: The Body
doth not know how it is with it, but is heavy and
anxious, it goeth from one room or <hi>businesse</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and from one Place to another; it seeketh for
ease and rest.</p>
               <p>140. And when it cometh thither, where it <hi>would
be,</hi> yet it findeth no such thing: then doubtings and
unbelief fall in between and come upon it; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it seems to it as if God had <hi>quite</hi> cast it off:
but it doth <hi>not</hi> understand the fight of the Spirit, how
the same is sometimes down, and sometimes gets
aloft.</p>
               <p>141. And what vehement and furious warre and
fight there is betwixt the <hi>hellish</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which fire the Devils <hi>Blow up,</hi> and the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<hi>Quench</hi> it; I leave to every Holy Soul to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of.</p>
               <p>142. Thou must know, that I write not here as a
Story or History, as if it were <hi>related</hi> to me from
another, but I must continually stand in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
or Battle, and I find it to be full of heavy stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
wherein I am often <hi>struck down</hi> to the ground,
as well as all other Men.</p>
               <p>143. But for the sake of the violent fight, and
for the sake of the <hi>earnestnesse,</hi> which we have toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this Revelation hath been given me, and the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61095:129"/>
vehement driving or impulse, to bring it so to passe
as to set all this down in <hi>Paper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>144. But what the Totall sequel is, which may
follow upon, and after this, I do not <hi>fully</hi> know: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sometimes, future Mysteries in the depth, are <hi>shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
to me.</p>
               <p>145. For when the flash riseth up in the Center,
one seeth through and through, but cannot well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
or lay hold on it; for it happeneth to such
a one as when there is a Tempest of <hi>Lightening,</hi>
where the flash of fire openeth it self, and sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vanisheth.</p>
               <p>146. So it goes also in the Soul, when it presseth
or breaks quite through in its fight or <hi>Combat,</hi> then
it beholdeth the <hi>Deity,</hi> as a flash of Lightening; but
the source quality or fountain of Sins, covereth it
suddenly again; For the <hi>Old</hi> Adam belongeth<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>into.</hi>
                  </note> to
the Earth, and doth not, with <hi>this</hi> flesh, belong<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>into.</hi>
                  </note> to
the Deity.</p>
               <p>147. I do <hi>not</hi> write this for my own Praise, but
to that end, that the Reader may know, wherein my
Knowledge standeth, that he might not seek that
from me, which I have not, or think me to be <hi>what
I am not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>148. But what I am, <hi>that,</hi> all men are, who
wrestle in JESUS CHRIST our King, for
the <hi>Crown</hi> of the Eternal Joy; and live in the <hi>Hope</hi>
of Perfection; the <hi>beginning</hi> whereof is at the Day
of the Resurrection, which is now <hi>shortly</hi> near at
Hand: which, in the circle of the rising or Horizon
of the East in the flash, is very <hi>well</hi> to be seen, in
which Nature sheweth it self as if it would be Day-Break.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Behold, when God
<list>
                  <item>Schuff</item>
                  <item>created</item>
               </list>the Angels; then
he created them out of the <hi>seventh</hi> qualifying or

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:61095:130"/>3. The word

<list>
                  <item>Schuff</item>
                  <item>Created</item>
               </list>thou must understand
thus, as when a man sayes,<note n="*" place="margin">attracted.</note> drawn together, or
<note n="†" place="margin">Compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> driven together, as the Earth is <hi>driven</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
together: In like manner, when the whole
God did move himself, then the astringent quality
drew or drove together the <hi>Salitter</hi> of Nature, and
<hi>dryed</hi> it, and so the Angels came to be: now <hi>such</hi> as
the Quality was, in every place, <hi>such</hi> also was the
Angel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe the depth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. There are seven Spirits of God, all these <hi>seven</hi>
have moved themselves, and the <hi>Light</hi> therein hath
moved it self also, and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which goeth forth
out of the seven Spirits of God, hath moved it self
also.</p>
            <p>5. Now the Creator intended, according to his
<hi>Ternarie,</hi> to create three<note n="*" place="margin">Armies Bands <hi>or</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> Hoasts, not one from
another, but one <hi>by</hi> another, as in a circle or
sphear.</p>
            <p>6. Now Observe: <hi>as</hi> the<note n="†" place="margin">seven Spirits of God.</note> Spirits were therein
in their moving boyling or rising up, <hi>so</hi> also were
the Creatures: In the midst or Center of each Hoast
was the <hi>Heart</hi> of each Hoast incorporated or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
together, out of which an Angelical or Great
or Chief-Prince, proceeded, or came to be.</p>
            <p>7. And as the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God is generated in the
midst or center of the seven Spirits of God, and is
the life and heart of the seven Spirits of God; so
there was <hi>one</hi> Angelical King created in the midst or
center of his circumference sphear extent or<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi>
               </note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
out of Nature, also out of Natures Heaven,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61095:131"/>
out of the <hi>power</hi> of all the seven qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spirits; and that now was the heart in one
Hoast, and had in him the quality might power and
strength of his <hi>whole</hi> Hoast, and was the fairest
amongst them or of them all.</p>
            <p>8. Just as the Sonne of God is the heart and <hi>Lif</hi>
and strength of all the seven Spirits of God, so is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that <hi>one</hi> King of Angels in his Hoast.</p>
            <p>9. And as there are seven principal qualities in
the <hi>divine</hi> power out of which the heart of God is
generated; so there are also some mighty <hi>Princely</hi>
Angels created in each Hoast, according to each
Head or chief quality; The number of which I
do not <hi>exactly</hi> know, and they are with or near the
King, <hi>Leaders</hi> of the other Angels.</p>
            <p>10. Here thou must know, that the Angels are
<hi>not</hi> all of one quality, neither are they equal or alike
one to another in Power and Might: Indeed, <hi>every</hi>
Angel hath the power of all the seven qualifying or
fountain-spirits, but in every one there is somewhat
of one Quality more predominant and strong then
another, and according to that quality is he glorified
also.</p>
            <p>11. For such as the <hi>Salitter</hi> was, in every place,
at the time of Creation, such also was the Angel
that came forth, and according to <hi>that</hi> quality, which
is strongest in an Angel, he is also named and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>12. As the <hi>Flowers</hi> in the Meadowes do every one
receive its colour from its quality, and is named al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
according to its quality, so are the Holy Angels
also: some are strongest in the <hi>astringent</hi> quality, and
those are of a<note n="*" place="margin">Dusky or Grey, or dim white like twilight.</note> Brownish Light, and are nearest of
Quality to the Cold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:61095:131"/>
13. And so when the Light of the Sonne of God
shineth on them, then are they like a brownish or
<hi>Purple</hi> flash of Lightening very Bright and clear in
their quality:</p>
            <p>14. Some are of the quality of the <hi>Water,</hi> and those
are light, like the holy Heaven; and when the light
shineth on them, then they look like to a <hi>Crystalline</hi>
Sea.</p>
            <p>15. Some are strongest in the <hi>Bitter</hi> quality, and
they are, like a<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raud.</hi>
               </note> green Pretious stone, which spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
like a flash of Lightening; and when the light
shineth on them, then they shine and appear as a
<hi>Greenish Red,</hi> as if a Carbuncle did shine forth from
it, or as if the Life had its Original there.</p>
            <p>16. Some are of the Quality of <hi>Heat,</hi> and they are
the Lightest and brightest of all, <hi>Yellowish</hi> and Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish;
and when the Light shineth on them, they
look like the flash or Lightening of the Sonne of
God.</p>
            <p>17. Some are strongest in the quality of <hi>Love,</hi> and
those are a Glance of the heavenly Joyfulnesse, very
light, and <hi>Bright,</hi> aud when the light shineth on
them, they look like<note n="*" place="margin">Azure <hi>or</hi> Watchet.</note> 
               <hi>Light-Blew,</hi> of a pleasant
Glosse Glance or Lustre.</p>
            <p>18. Some are strongest in the quality of the <hi>Tone,</hi>
or Sound, and those are Light or bright also; and
when the Light shineth on them, they look like the
<hi>rising</hi> of the flash of Lightning, as if some thing
would lift it self aloft there.</p>
            <p>19. Some are of the Quality of the <hi>totall</hi> or whole
Nature, as a General mixture, and when the light
shineth on them, they look like the holy <hi>Heaven,</hi>
which is formed out of all the Spirits of God.</p>
            <p>20. But the King is the heart of all the qualities,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61095:132"/>
and hath his circumference<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Court</hi> Quarters or Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the midst or Center, like a fountain: And
as the <hi>Sun</hi> standeth in the midst among the Planets,
and is a King of the Stars, and the heart of <hi>Nature</hi>
in this world: so great also is a <hi>Cherubin</hi> or King of
Angels.</p>
            <p>21. And as the other six planets with the Sun are
Leaders of Hoasts, and give up or submit their will
to the Sun, that it may raign and <hi>work</hi> in them: so
all the Angels give up or submit their will to the
<hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Princely</hi> Angels are in <hi>Councel</hi> with the
King.</p>
            <p>22. But thou must know here, that they all have
a <hi>Love-will</hi> one to another, none of them grut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the other his Form and <hi>Beauty:</hi> For as it
goeth among the spirits of God, so it goeth among
these.</p>
            <p>23. They all have <hi>joyntly</hi> and equally the Divine
Joy, and they equally enjoy the heavenly Food,
therein there is no difference.</p>
            <p>24. Only in the Colours and <hi>strength</hi> of power
there is a difference, but <hi>no</hi> difference at all in the
perfection: for every one hath in them the power
of all the spirits of God; therefore when the light
of the Sonne of God shineth on them, then each An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
quality sheweth it self by the <hi>Colour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. I have reckoned up onely some few of the
forms and colours of them, but there are a <hi>great
many</hi> more that might be written down, which I
will omit for brevity sake.</p>
            <p>26. For as the Deity presenteth it self <hi>infinitely</hi> in
its rising up, so there are insearchable many <hi>varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of colours and forms among the Angels: I can
shew thee no <hi>right</hi> similitude of it in this world but
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61095:132"/>
in the <hi>blossoming</hi> field of flowers in <hi>May,</hi> which yet

               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>27. Now it may be asked: <hi>What</hi> then is it, which
the Angels do in heaven; or <hi>why,</hi> or to what End
and purpose hath God created them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. Ye greedy covetous griping persons may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this, you who in this world <hi>seek</hi> after Pride,
State, dignity, Honour, Fame, Glory, Power, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Goods, and <hi>squeeze</hi> out the sweat and blood
of the poor oppressed and distressed, and spend their
Labours upon your Gallantry bravery and stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and <hi>think</hi> your selves Better then plain and
simple Lay-vulgar people, and suppose it is <hi>that</hi>
God hath created you for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why hath God created Angel-Princes, and
hath not made them all <hi>Equall,</hi>
or alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>29. Behold <hi>God is the God of Order:</hi> and as it is,
goeth, and boyleth, in his Government in himself,
that is, in his Birth or Geniture, and in his rising
up, so also is the <hi>order</hi> of the Angels.</p>
               <p>30. Now as there are in him, <hi>chiefly</hi> seven quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whereby the <hi>whole</hi> Divine Being is driven on,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61095:133"/>
and sheweth it self infinitely in these seven qualities,
and yet these seven qualities are the Chief or <hi>Prime</hi>
in the infinitenesse, whereby the divine Birth or
Geniture stands eternally in its Order unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
               <p>31. And as in the <hi>Midst</hi> or Center of the seven
Spirits of God, the heart of Life is generated whence
the divine Joy riseth up, <hi>thus</hi> also is the order of
Angels.</p>
               <p>32. The Angel-Princes were created according
to the spirits of God, and the Cherubin according
to the heart of God: And as the divine <hi>Being</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
so also do the Angels.</p>
               <p>33. That quality which riseth up in Gods Being,
and chiefly sheweth it self in its <hi>working,</hi> as in the
rising up of the Tone or Tune, or of the divine work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
wrestling and fighting; that Angelical Prince,
which is most strongly <hi>addicted</hi> to that Quality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
in his Rank or File and Round, with his Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
with singing, ringing forth, dancing, rejoycing
and Jubilating.</p>
               <p>34. This is <hi>heavenly Musick,</hi> for here every one
singeth according to the voice of his quality, and
the Prince leadeth the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire or <hi>Chorus;</hi> as a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
or singing-Master with his Scholars, and the
<hi>King</hi> rejoyceth and Jubilateth with his Angels, to
the honour of the great God, and to the encreasing
and multiplying of the heavenly Joyes: and that, is
in the Heart of God, as a Holy <hi>Sport</hi> or Scene; and
to that end also are they created for the Joy and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God.</p>
               <p>35. Now when the heavenly Musick of the Angel
riseth up, then, in the heavenly Pomp in the Divine
<hi>Salitter;</hi> there rise up all manner of Vegetations
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61095:133"/>
Springings or Sprouts, also all manner of figures
shapes or <hi>Ideas,</hi> and all manner of colours; for the
Deity presenteth sheweth or discovereth it self, in
<hi>endlesse</hi> and unsearchable varieties of kinds, colours,
Ideas, forms, and Joyes.</p>
               <p>36. Now, that qualifying or fountain-Spirit in
the <hi>Deity</hi> which doth shew it self then in a singular
manner with its rising up, and <hi>Love-wrestling;</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
become the Prince or Chief of them; that <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
Angel-Prince belonging to it, beginneth instantly
his heavenly Musick with his own Legions, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Quality, with singing, ringing forth, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
melody, and in all the manners of heavenly
<hi>Skill</hi> and Art, which riseth up in the Spirits of
God.</p>
               <p>37. But when the Center in the Midst riseth up,
that is, when the Birth or Geniture of the Sonne of
God, sheweth it self in a singular manner, as a
<hi>Triumph;</hi> then there rise up the Musicks melodies
or Joyes, of all the <hi>three</hi> Kingly Governments or
Royal Regiments of the whole Creation of all the
Angels.</p>
               <p>38. What manner of Joy this <hi>must</hi> be, let every
Soul consider: I, in my corrupted nature, cannot
apprehend it, much lesse can I write it.</p>
               <p>39. By this song I invite or Cite the Reader unto
the other Life; there himself will be also of that
Quire or <hi>Chorus,</hi> and then first will he give credit to
this spirit; what he doth not understand here, that
he will have there <hi>apparently</hi> in his view.</p>
               <p>40. Thou must know, that this is not forged out
of a Stone; but when the flash riseth up in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>then</hi> the Spirit seeth and knoweth it.</p>
               <p>41. Therefore look to it, and be not too scornfull
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61095:134"/>
in this Place, else thou wilt be found a scorner and
mocker before God, and then well mayst thou <hi>fare,</hi>
as King <hi>Lucifer</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Now it may be asked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What do the Angels then
when they sing Not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>42. Behold! What the Deity doth, that they
do also: When the Spirits of God <hi>lovingly</hi> generate
one in another, and rise up one in another, as in a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
saluting, Embracing, kissing, and feeding one
another: in which Taste and Smell, the <hi>life</hi> riseth
up, and the eternal refreshing; of which thou
mayst read before at Large.</p>
               <p>43. Then the holy Angels also walk and <hi>Converse</hi>
one with another friendlily, graciously amiably and
blessedly in the heavenly Circumference or Region,
and do behold the wonderful and pleasant form or
<hi>prospect</hi> of heaven, and eat of the gracious amiable
blessed and delicate fruits of <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:61095:134"/>
Now thou wilt Ask:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What do they Talk of, one
with another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>44. Behold! thou Pompous stately <hi>lofty</hi> and
Proud Man; the world is even <hi>too narrow</hi> for thee
here, and thou thinkest there is <hi>none</hi> like thee, or
Equal to thee: bethink thy self in this, whether
thou hast <hi>in thee</hi> the manner quality or condition of
an Angel or of a Devill.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To whom now shall I liken
the Angels?</head>
               <p>45. I will liken them to <hi>little</hi> children, which
walk in the fields in <hi>May,</hi> among the <hi>flowers,</hi> and
pluck them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make currous Garlands, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seys,
carrying them in their hands <hi>rejoycing,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
talk together of the several forms or shapes of
<hi>curious</hi> flowers, <hi>leading</hi> one another by the hand, when
they go to gather flowers.</p>
               <p>46. And when they come home, they <hi>shew</hi> them
to their Parents, and they also rejoyce in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and are merry and <hi>cheerly</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>47. So do the Holy Angels likewise, they take
one another by the <hi>Hand,</hi> and walk together in the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61095:135"/>
curious <hi>May</hi> of heaven, and parly or talk of the
pleasant and fair Spring or <hi>fruits</hi> in the heavenly
Pomp, and feed on the <hi>delicate</hi> blessed fruits of God,
and make use of the beautiful heavenly Flowers for
their play or sport in their <hi>Scenes,</hi> and make curious
Garlands, and rejoyce in the delicious pleasant May,
of God.</p>
               <p>48. Here is nothing but a Cordial or Hearty lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
a meek and gentle love, a friendly courteous
discourse, a gracious amiable and <hi>blessed</hi> Society,
where the one alwaies delighteth to see the other,
and to honour one another.</p>
               <p>49. They know of <hi>no</hi> malice, <hi>cunning</hi> subtlety or
deceit, but the divine fruits and pleasant lovelinesse
are <hi>common</hi> among them, one may make use of these
things, <hi>as well</hi> as the other, there is no disfavour or
hatred, no Envy, no contrary or <hi>opposite</hi> will, but
their hearts are knit together in Love.</p>
               <p>50. In this, the <hi>Deity</hi> hath its highest Delight, as
Parents have in their children, that its dear and
beloved children in heaven, behave themselves so
well, and so friendlily: for the Deity in it self play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>or sporteth</hi> also thus, <hi>one</hi> qualifying or fountain-spirit
in the other.</p>
               <p>51. And therefore the Angels can do no other,
then their Father doth, as also our Angelical King
JESUS CHRIST testified, when he was with us on
earth, as it is written in the Gospel, where he saith;
<hi>Verily the Sonne can do nothing of himself; but what He
seeth his Father do, that the Sonne doth also,</hi> John 5. 19.
Also <hi>if you do not convert, aud become like children, you
cannot come into the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> Matth.
18. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:61095:135"/>
52. Whereby he meaneth, that <hi>our hearts</hi> should
be knit together in Love, as the Holy Angels of God
are, and that we should deal friendly courteously
and kindly one with another, and love one another,
and <hi>prevent</hi> one another in kindnesse and <hi>respects,</hi> as
the Angels of God do.</p>
               <p>53. <hi>Not</hi> that we should <hi>Deceive</hi> and belye one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and tear the Bread out of others Mouthes
for very greedinesse and great Covetousnesse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should one <hi>outbrave</hi> another, in Statelinesse,
Fashions, and <hi>deportment,</hi> and so despise another who
cannot use his slie crafty subtile Devillish Policy
and <hi>Tricks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>54. O, no: the Angels in heaven do <hi>not</hi> so, but
they love one another, and rejoyce in the Beauty
and lovelinesse of others, and none esteemeth or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
himself excellenter then the other, but
<hi>every</hi> one hath his Joy in the other, and rejoyceth in
the <hi>others</hi> fair Beauty comely form and Lovelinesse,
whence then their love one towards another riseth
up, so that they lead one another by the Hand, and
friendlily Kisse one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe the Depth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>55. As, when the flash of life riseth up in the
Center of the <hi>Divine power,</hi> wherein all the spirits of
God attain their Life, and highly rejoyce; there, is
a loving and <hi>Holy</hi> Embracing, Kissing, Tasting, Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
or Feeling, Hearing, Seeing and Smelling. So
also there is among the Angels; when the one seeth,
heareth, feeleth or toucheth the other, then there ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
up <hi>in his heart</hi> the flash of Life, and one spirit
embraceth the other; as it is in the Deity.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:61095:136"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here, the Ground, and
highest Mystery of Gods
Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>56. If thou wilt now know, from <hi>whence</hi> their
Love, Humility and friendlinesse cometh, which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
up in their heart, then Observe that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
               <p>57. Every Angel is Constituted, as the <hi>whole</hi>
Deity is, and is as a <hi>little</hi> God. For when God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
the Angels, he constituted or framed them
<hi>out of Himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>58. Now God is the same in one place, as he is
in another, God is <hi>every where</hi> the Father and Sonne
and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>59. In these three Names and <hi>Powers,</hi> standeth
Heaven and this world, and all whatsoever thy
heart can think upon: and though thou shouldst
draw a little Circle, which thou canst hardly look
into or which thou canst hardly discern, even lesse
then the <hi>smallest Point</hi> thou canst imagine: yet even <hi>in
that</hi> is the <hi>whole</hi> Divine power, and the Sonne of
God is generated <hi>therein,</hi> and the Holy Ghost <hi>therein</hi>
goeth forth from the Father and the Sonne; if not
in Love, then in wrath, as it is written, <hi>with the holy
thou art Holy, and with the perverse thou art perverse,</hi>
Psal. 18. 26.</p>
               <p>60. They which <hi>stir up</hi> the wrath of God upon
themselves, which wrath standeth also in <hi>all</hi> the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of God, in that place, where it is awakened,
stirred up, or <hi>provoked:</hi> On the other side, where
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61095:136"/>
the love of God is awakened or stirred up, there it
standeth also in the <hi>full</hi> Birth or Geniture of the <hi>whole</hi>
Deity of or in the place or thing wherein it is awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>61. And herein there is <hi>no</hi> difference, the Angels
are created one as well as another, <hi>all</hi> out of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Salitter</hi> of the heavenly Nature: onely this is
the difference betwixt them; that when God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
them, each Qcality in the great Motion
stood in the <hi>highest</hi> Geniture or rising up.</p>
               <p>62. Hence it is come to passe, that the Angels are
of <hi>various</hi> and Manifold Qualities, and have several
colours and Beauties, and yet all out of or from
God.</p>
               <p>63. Yet <hi>every</hi> Angel hath <hi>all</hi> the qualities of God
in him, but one of them is strongest in him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which he is Named, and glorified in that
Quality.</p>
               <p>64. Now, as the qualities in God <hi>alwaies</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
raise up, and heartily Love, the one the other,
and the one alwayes getteth its <hi>life</hi> from the other;
And as the flash in the sweet water riseth up in the
heat, from whence the Life and the Joy have their
Original: so it is also in an Angel, his <hi>internal</hi> Birth
or Geniture is no otherwise then that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from him or without him, in God.</p>
               <p>65. And, as the Sonne of God, without or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Angels, is generated in the middle
or Centrall fountain <hi>Spring,</hi> in the heat, in the sweet
water, out of or from <hi>all</hi> the seven spirits of God,
and re-enlighteneth back again all the seven Spirits
of God; <hi>whence</hi> they have their Life and Joy.</p>
               <p>66. So also in like manner, the Sonne of God in
an Angel, is generated in the Angels middle or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61095:137"/>
fountain Spring of the <hi>heart</hi> in the heat in the
sweet water; and re-enlightneth back again all the
seven qualifying spirits of <hi>that</hi> Angel.</p>
               <p>67. And as the Holy Ghost goeth forth from
the Father and the Sonne, and formeth, Imageth
<hi>figureth</hi> or frameth and loveth <hi>All:</hi> even so the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost goeth forth in the Angel, <hi>into</hi> his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Brethren, and Loveth them, and rejoyceth with
them.</p>
               <p>68. For there is no difference between the Spirits
of God and the Angels, but <hi>only this;</hi> that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are <hi>Creatures,</hi> and their <hi>Corporeal</hi> Being hath a
beginning; but their <hi>power,</hi> out of which they are
created, is God himself, and is from Eternity, and
abideth in Eternity.</p>
               <p>69. Therefore their agility is as nimble and swift
as the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of a Man, where ever they would be
there also they are Instantly; moreover they can be
Great or Small, as they please.</p>
               <p>70. <hi>And this is the true Being
of God in Heaven, yea Heaven it
self;</hi> If thy Eyes were opened, thou shouldst see
it plainly and clearly on Earth in <hi>that</hi> place, where
thou art at present.</p>
               <p>71. For seeing God can let the spirit of Man see
it, which is yet staying in the Body, and can reveal
or manifest himself to him <hi>in the flesh,</hi> surely he can
well do it also when he is, out of the flesh, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>
               <p>72. O thou sinful House of <hi>this</hi> world, how art
thou encompassed with <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> awake, the
hour of thy Regeneration is at hand, the Day-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61095:137"/>
the Day-spring Dawning or Morning-Rednesse
sheweth it self.</p>
               <p>73. O thou Dumb and Dead world, <hi>why</hi> dost thou
require or demand <hi>Signes</hi> and Wonders? Is thy
whole body chilled and benummed? wilt thou not
awake from sleep?</p>
               <p>74. Behold a <hi>great sign</hi> is given Thee, but thou
sleepest and seest it not: Therefore the Lord will
give Thee a sign in his zeal or Jealousie which thou
hast awaked and <hi>provoked</hi> with thy Sins.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the whole Heavenly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of all the Three
Kingdomes of Angels.</head>
               <p>75. Here the Spirit sheweth, that where every
Angel is constituted stated or settled, there <hi>that
Place</hi> in the heavenly Nature, wherein, and out of
which he is become a creature, is his <hi>own</hi> seat;
which he possesseth by Right of Nature, as long as
he abideth <hi>in Gods Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>76. For it is the Place, which he hath had from
<hi>Eternity,</hi> before he was become a Creature, and that
<hi>Salitter</hi> stood in the same place, out of which he
existed, and <hi>therefore</hi> that seat remaineth to him, and
is his, by right of Nature, as long as he moveth in
Gods Love.</p>
               <p>77. But thou must not think, as if God were
tyed to it, and cannot or may not <hi>expell</hi> him from
thence, if he should move or stirre otherwise, then
God had constituted settled or <hi>stated</hi> him at
first.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:61095:138"/>
78. For as long as he abideth in obedience, and
in love; the Place is <hi>his,</hi> by right of Nature; but
when he elevateth himself and kindleth that place
in the wrathful fire; then he sets his Fathers House
on fire, and becomes a contrary will or <hi>opposite</hi> to the
Place, out of which he is made, and maketh TWO
out of that, which was ONE, before his Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>79. Now when he doth so, then he <hi>keeps</hi> his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Right of Nature to himself, and that Place
also keepeth <hi>its</hi> own to it self: but seeing the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
which hath a beginning, will oppose or set it
self against the First Being, which was before the
Creature was, which had no beginning, and will
needs spoil the Place, which is <hi>none</hi> of its making,
wherein it was created a creature in the Love, and
will <hi>turn</hi> that love into a wrath-fire, then it is equal
and just, that the Love should spew up the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire
forth together with the Creature.</p>
               <p>80. From hence also the<note n="†" place="margin">Lawes Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Polities.</note> RIGHTS in this world
exist or have their original. For when a sonne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
his Father, and striketh his Father, then he
loseth his Fatherly or Paternal <hi>inheritance,</hi> and his
Father may thrust him out of his House: but so long
as he continueth in obedience to his Father, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath no right authority or Lawfull Power to
Dis-inherit him.</p>
               <p>81. This worldly<note n="*" place="margin">Jus.</note> 
                  <hi>Right</hi> taketh its original from
Heaven; as also many other worldly Rights, which
are written in the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and original from the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in Heaven,
which I shall demonstrate plainly in its due place
from the true ground in the Deity.</p>
               <p>

Now; one might Object and say;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then an Angel is fully bound and tyed to that
place, in which he is created, and
must not stir, nor can stir
from thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>82. No: as little as the <hi>Spirits of God</hi> are or will
be tyed in their rifing up; that they should not
move one among another, so little are the <hi>Angels</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
tyed to their place at all.</p>
               <p>83. For as the spirits of God rise up continually
one in another, and have a Sport or Game of Love
in their Birth or Geniture, and yet every spirit keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his natural <hi>seat,</hi> or place, in the Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, wherein it <hi>never cometh to passe,</hi> that the
Heat is changed into the Cold, or the Cold into the
Heat, but each keepeth its natural place or <hi>Posture,</hi>
and the one riseth up in the other, from whence the
life hath its Original.</p>
               <p>84. So the Holy Angels move walk or <hi>converse</hi> in
all the three Kingdoms, one among another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they conceive, or receive their <hi>conceptions,</hi> one
from the other; <hi>that is,</hi> from the others Beauty
comely form, friendlinesse courtesie and vertue, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one receiveth his highest joy, and yet <hi>each</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his naturall seat or Place, in <hi>which</hi> he is become
a creature, for his <hi>own</hi> propriety.</p>
               <p>85. Like one in this world, that when he hath a
dear and near kinsman, which <hi>returns</hi> home from
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61095:139"/>
                  <hi>forraign</hi> Parts of the world, whom he had a very
<hi>hearty</hi> desire, and earnest longing to <hi>see;</hi> there is joy
and friendly saluting and bidding welcome, also a
friendly loving discourse or conference between
them, and so he treateth this loving and wellcome
<hi>Guest</hi> in the best manner that he can: yet this is but
cold water, in <hi>respect</hi> of the Heavenly.</p>
               <p>86. And <hi>thus</hi> the Holy Angels do one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
when the Army or Company of one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
cometh to the other, or when the Army or
Company of one princely Quality cometh to an
Army or Company of another princely Quality,
there is nothing but meer loving Entertainment sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting
and <hi>embracing</hi> reception; a very gracious
amiable and blessed discourse and friendly respect, a
very gracious amiable <hi>blessed</hi> and loving walking
and playing together; a most <hi>chast</hi> and humble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise;
a friendly kissing and leading one another
up and down, here beginneth the lovely Quire and
set <hi>Dancing,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>87. Like little Children, when they go in <hi>May</hi>
to gather <hi>flowers,</hi> where many often meet together,
there they talk and <hi>confer</hi> friendly, and pluck or
gather many sundry sorts of flowers.</p>
               <p>88. Now when this is done, they carry those
flowers in their Hands, and <hi>begin</hi> a sportfull Dance,
and sing from the joy of their Heart rejoycing. Thus
also do the Angels in Heaven, when the <hi>Forraign</hi>
Armies or Companies meet together,</p>
               <p>89. For the corrupted Nature in this world, <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi>
in its utmost power and diligence, that it might
bring forth heavenly forms, and many times little
children might be their Parents School-masters and
<hi>Teachers,</hi> if Parents could but understand, or would
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61095:139"/>
but take <hi>notice</hi> of them; But now adayes the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption

                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>90. By this high <hi>humility</hi> of the Angels, the Spirit
admonisheth the children of this world, that they
should view and <hi>examine</hi> themselves, whether they
bear such a love one to another? whether there be
such humility among them? what kind of Angels
do they think they are? and whether are they like

the <hi>third</hi> Angelical Kingdome.</p>
               <p>91. Behold the Spirit will here a little present

one another, such despising, belying, entrapping
circumventing over-reaching cheating deceiving
betraying, extorting Usury, coveting, envying and

Dost thou suppose thou standest now in the flower

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Kingly Primacy, or of the
power and Authority of the
Three Angelical
Kings.</head>
               <p>103. As the Deity in its Being is Threefold, in
that the Exit out of the seven Spirits of God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and generateth it self as <hi>Threefold,</hi> viz. Father
Sonne and Holy Ghost, <hi>One</hi> God; wherein the whole
Divine Power consisteth, and all whatsoever is
therein; and they are the <hi>Three Persons</hi> in the Deity,
and yet are not a divided Being, but in one another
as <hi>one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>104. So also when God moved himself and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Angels,</hi> there came to be <hi>Three</hi> speciall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
out of the best Kernel of Nature, out of the
Being of the <hi>Ternary</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, and in
such power authority and Might as the Ternary in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61095:141"/>
the seven Spirits of God, and is again the Life and
Heart of all the seven Spirits.</p>
               <p>105. And so also, the <hi>Three</hi> Angelical Kings, <hi>each</hi>
of them in the manner kind and Nature of his Hoast
or Army, is risen up, and is a Natural Lord of his
Place or Region, over the Regiment or <hi>Dominion</hi> of his
Angels; but the Ternary of the Deity retaineth that
<hi>Place,</hi> which is unalterable or unchangeable to it self:
and the King retaineth the Dominion of the Angels.</p>
               <p>106. Now as the Ternary of the Deity is one
only Being or Substance in all <hi>Parts</hi> in the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and is united together, as the Members in
Mans <hi>Body,</hi> and all places are as <hi>one</hi> Place, though
one place may have a different condition frame and
<note n="*" place="margin">Office <hi>or</hi> Function.</note> 
                  <hi>Constitution,</hi> distinct from the other, as also the
members of men have; yet it is the Body of God.</p>
               <p>107. So also are the Three Angelical Kingdomes
<hi>united</hi> one in another, and not each <hi>severed</hi> asunder:
No Angelical King ought to say: This is my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
or that there ought <hi>no other</hi> King to come
thereinto; though indeed it is his first <hi>beginning</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
natural inheritance; and remaineth also to
be his: yet <hi>all</hi> other Kings and Angels are his true
Naturall Brothers, generated out of or from one
Father, and do inherit their Fathers Kingdom.</p>
               <p>108. And as the qualifying or fountain Spirits of
God, have <hi>each</hi> of them the Natural seat or possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its Birth or <hi>Geniture,</hi> and retaineth its Naturall
<hi>Place</hi> to it self, and yet is, together with the other
spirits, the one only Spirit; so that if the other
were not, <hi>that</hi> would not be neither, and thus also
they rise up One in the other.</p>
               <p>109. So it is also with the Chief or <hi>Principall</hi> of
the Holy Angels in his Constitution; and is in no
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61095:142"/>
other <hi>manner</hi> then as it is in God; and therefore
they live all friendlily peaceably and blessedly <hi>one
with another,</hi> in their Fathers Kingdom, as loving dear
brethren; there are no Bounds or Bars how far any
should go, and how far not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon what do the Angels walk?
or upon what do they stay or
set their Feet?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>110. I will here shew thee the right Ground, and
it is <hi>no</hi> otherwise in Heaven, then as thou here findest
in the letter, for the Spirit looketh into this Deep,
very unremoveably or <hi>steadfastly,</hi> also it is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible.</p>
               <p>111. The <hi>whole</hi> Nature of the Heaven, standeth
in the power of the seven qualifying or fountain-spirits,
and in the seventh consisteth <hi>Nature</hi> or the
apprehensibility of all the Qualities: this now is
very lightsome and solid as a Cloud, but very <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent,</hi>
and shining, like a Crystalline Sea, so that a
man can see through and through it all: Yet the
whole depth upward and downward is wholly
<hi>thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>112. Now the Angels also, have such Bodies, but
more dry and close compacted or incorporated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and their body also is the kernel, of or out of
Nature, even the best or fairest splendor and <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
of or out of Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:61095:142"/>
113. Now upon the seventh spirit of God their
Foot doth stay, which is solid like a Cloud, and clear
and bright as a Crystalline Sea, wherein they walk
upward and downward, which way soever they
please. For their Agility or Nimblenesse is as swift
as the <hi>Divine-power</hi> it self is, yet one Angel is more
swift then another, and that answerably according
to their Quality.</p>
               <p>114. In that seventh spirit of Nature, rise up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Heavenly fruits and colours, and whatsoever
is apprehensible or comprehensible, and is like to
such a<note n="*" place="margin">Text Forma.</note> 
                  <hi>Forme,</hi> or manner, as if the Angels did
dwell <hi>betwixt</hi> Heaven and Earth in the Deep, where
they ascend and descend, and where ever they are,
there their foot resteth, <hi>as if</hi> it stood upon the
Earth.</p>
               <p>115. Antiquity hath represented the Angels in
Picture, like Men with Wings but they have <hi>no need</hi>
of any Wings, yet they have Hands and Feet, as
Men have, but after a Heavenly manner and kind.</p>
               <p>116. At the Day of the Resurrection from the
Dead, there will be no difference between the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, they will be of one and the <hi>same kind</hi>
of <hi>forme;</hi> which I shall shew plainly in its due place,
and our <hi>King</hi> JESUS CHRIST clearly testifieth
the same, where he saith, <hi>In the Resurrection they
are like the Angels of God,</hi> Matth. 22. 30.</p>

               <head>Of the Great Glory Brightnesse
and Beauty of the Three
Angelical Kings.</head>
               <p>117. This is the very <hi>Billet</hi> or Staffe, which is
flung at the <hi>Dog,</hi> to make him run away, because of
this Song, Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> could pull and tear off the
Hair of his Head and Beard for grief sorrow and
Pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here the depth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the King or Great
Prince
MICHAEL.</p>
               <p>118. MICHAEL signifieth the Great <hi>strength</hi>
or power of God; and beareth the name operative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
actually and in <hi>Deed:</hi> For he is incorporated or
consolidated together, out of the seven qualifying
or <hi>fountain</hi> spirits, as out of a Kernel or seed of them,
and standeth here now, as in the stead of God the
Father.</p>
               <p>119. The meaning is <hi>not,</hi> that He is God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who consisteth in the seven spirits of the <hi>whole</hi>
Deep, and is not creaturely; but, the meaning is,
that in Nature among the Creatures there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
such a kind of Creature, as is <hi>like</hi> God the Father,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61095:143"/>
as he is in the seven qualifying or fountain spirits,
which is to raign among the <hi>Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>119. For when God made himself creaturely,
then he made himself creaturely according to his
<hi>Ternarie;</hi> And as in God, the <hi>Ternarie</hi> is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and chiefest, and yet his wonderful proportion,
form and variety <hi>cannot</hi> be measured, in that he
sheweth himself in his operation so <hi>variously</hi> and
manifoldly. So also he hath created Three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Angel-Princes, according to the <hi>highest</hi> Primacy
of his <hi>Ternarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>120. After that, he created the Princely-Angels,
according to the seven qualifying or fountain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
answerable to their Quality, <hi>viz.</hi> GABRIEL,
an Angel or Prince of the Tone, sound, or of swift
or speedy Messages; as also RAPHAEL, and
others beside in the Kingdom of MICHAEL.</p>
               <p>121. Thou must not understand this, as if these
Royal Angels were to Rule in the <hi>Deity,</hi> that is, in
the seven qualifying or fountain-spirits of <hi>God,</hi>
which are without or distinct from the creatures;
no, but each over his Creatures, or the creatures of
his <hi>own</hi> Dominion.</p>
               <p>122. For as the <hi>Ternarie</hi> of God raigneth over the
infinite or <hi>Endlesse,</hi> Being and over the figures and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>various</hi> forms or Ideas in the Deity, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
varieth and Imageth or frameth the same.</p>
               <p>123. So also are the three Angelical Kings, Lords
over <hi>their</hi> Angels even to the heart and deepest
Ground, though they <hi>cannot</hi> corporeally or Bodily
vary or change themselves, as God himself <hi>can,</hi> who
hath created them; yet they rule them <hi>(viz.</hi> the
Angels) Corporeally, and are bound or united to
them; as body and soul are bound one to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:61095:144"/>
124. For the King is their <hi>Head,</hi> and they are the
<hi>Members</hi> of the King; and the<note n="*" place="margin">or facultating potentiating.</note> Qualifying or
fountain Princely Angels are the Kings <hi>Counsellours</hi>
or<note n="†" place="margin">instruments in Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>Officers</hi> in his Affaires, like the five Senses in
Man, or as the Hands and Feet, or the Mouth, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils,
Eyes and Ears, whereby the King <hi>executeth</hi> or
accomplisheth his Affairs.</p>
               <p>125. Now as all Angels are bound to the King,
so is the King also bound to <hi>God</hi> his Creator, as Body
and Soul: the Body, signifieth God; and the Soul the
Angelical King, which is in the Body of God, and is
become a <hi>Creature</hi> in the Body of God, and abideth
eternally in the Body of God, as the soul doth in its
Nest, and therefore also hath God so highly glorified
him, as his own <hi>propriety,</hi> or as the Soul is glorified
in the Body.</p>
               <p>126. Thus the King or Great Prince <hi>Michael</hi>
Looks like God the Father in his glorification, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or brightnesse, and is a King and prince of God
upon the <hi>Mount</hi> of God, and hath his Office in the
Deep, wherein he is created.</p>
               <p>127. That circumference or space, Region or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
wherein he and his Angels are created, is <hi>his</hi>
Kingdom, and he is a <hi>loving</hi> Sonne of God the Father
in Nature, a <hi>Creaturely</hi> Sonne, in whom the Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth.</p>
               <p>128. Thou must <hi>not</hi> compare him with the Heart
or Light of God, which is in the whole Father,
which hath neither Beginning nor End, as well as
God the Father himself.</p>
               <p>129. For this Prince <hi>is</hi> a Creature, and <hi>hath</hi> a
Beginning, but he is <hi>in</hi> God the Father, and is bound
and united with him <hi>in his Love,</hi> as his dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Sonne, whom he hath created out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:61095:144"/>
130. Therefore he hath set upon him the <hi>Crown</hi>
of Honour, of Might Power and Authority, so that
there is in heaven no higher nor Excellenter, nor
mightier then He is, <hi>except</hi> God himself in his <hi>Terna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi>
And this is one King; rightly described, with
a true ground, in the knowledge of the Spirit.</p>

               <head>Of the second King LUCIFER,

               <p>132. This High and Mighty, Glorious and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
King, <hi>lost</hi> his right name in his Fall: for he is

expell'd out of the Light of God.</p>
               <p>127. His name was <hi>not so</hi> at the beginning: for he
was a creaturely Prince or King of the Heart of God

               <p>134. As <hi>Michael</hi> is Created according to the
quality manner and property of God the Father; So
was <hi>Lucifer</hi> Created according to the quality, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and Beauty of God the Sonne, and was bound
to and united with him in Love, as a dear Sonne or
Heart, and his heart also stood in the <hi>Center</hi> of Light,
as if he had been God himself; and his Beauty or
Brightnesse transcended all.</p>
               <p>135. For his circumference conception or chiefest
mother, was, the Sonne of God, and there he stood
as a King or Prince of God.</p>
               <p>136. His Court, Province, place, Region or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
wherein he dwelt with his whole Army or
Company, and wherein he is become a <hi>Creature,</hi> and
which was his Kingdome; is the created Heaven
and this world, <hi>wherein</hi> we dwell with our King
JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>137. For our King sitteth in Divine <hi>Omnipotence,</hi>
where King <hi>Lucifer did</hi> sit, and on the Kingly throne
of <hi>expulsed</hi> Lucifer, and the Kingdome of King Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer
is now become HIS; O Prince <hi>Lucifer,</hi> how
dost thou relish that?</p>
               <p>138. Now as God the Father is bound and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in great love with his Sonne; so was King Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer
also bound with King <hi>Michael</hi> in great love,
as One heart or One God, for the fountain or well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of the Sonne of God <hi>hath</hi> reach'd even into the
heart of Lucifer.</p>
               <p>139. Onely that the Light, which he had in his
Body, he had it for his <hi>own</hi> propriety, which while
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61095:145"/>
it shone with or agreeable to the Light of the Sonne
of God, which was Externally without or distinct
from him, they both qualified incorporated and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together as one thing, though they were two,
yet they were bound or united together, as Body
and Soul.</p>
               <p>140. And as the light of God raigneth in all the
<hi>powers</hi> of the Father, so he also did raign in all <hi>his</hi>
Angels, as a mighty King of God, and did wear on
his Head the fairest Crown of Heaven.</p>
               <p>141. Here at present I will leave him a little
<hi>scope,</hi> because I shall have so much to do concerning

raigneth in all; such also is the power and gracious
amiable blessednesse of a Cherubin; who is the
King and heart of all his Angels; that is, when his

               <p>152. And although the Devil will raise scorners

they find it by experience with Eternal Shame, then
the fountain of woe Lamentation and sorrow will

               <p>153. Also I have not gone up to Heaven, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held</hi>

it with my fleshly Eyes, much lesse hath any

without enlightening from God, much <hi>lesse</hi> believe
it.</p>
               <p>154. For I should alwayes stand in Doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were a good Angel, sent of God or no, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Devil can transform or cloath himself in the
form of an Angel of light, to seduce Men, <hi>2 Corinth.</hi>
11. 14.</p>
               <p>155. But because it is <hi>generated</hi> in the Center or
Circle of Life, as a bright shining light, like unto
the heavenly Birth, or rising up of the Holy Ghost,
with a fiery driving or impulse of the spirit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I cannot resist or withstand it, though the <hi>world</hi>
alwaies make a mock of me for it.</p>
               <p>156. The Spirit testifieth, that there is yet a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

end this spirit is a fore-runner, <hi>Messenger,</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimer
of the Day.</p>
               <p>157. And then whatsoever man, is not found in
the <hi>Birth</hi> of the Holy Ghost at that time; in him the
Birth will never rise at all, but he abideth in the
quality or source of darknesse, as a dead hard Flint
stone, in which the source or quality of fiercenesse
wrath and corruption riseth up Eternally.</p>
               <p>158. And there he will be a mocker eternally in
the Birth of the hellish Abomination: for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

sowest scorn and contempt, thou wilt also reap scorn
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61095:147"/>
and contempt, and that will be thy food.</p>
               <p>160. Therefore, O child of Man! have a care,

I. The <hi>Stars</hi> signifie or denote the Angels: for as
the stars must continue unaltered, till, to the End of
this Time, so the <hi>Angels</hi> also in the <hi>Eternal Time</hi> of
heaven must remain unaltered for ever.</p>

the form and posture of Heaven: For as the Deep
between the Starres and Earth alwaies alter and

then rain; now snow, suddenly the Deep is Blew or
Azure, suddenly greenish, by and by whitish, then
suddenly again Dusky.</p>
               <p>167. Thus also is the change and alteration of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> into many several colours and <hi>forms,</hi> but
not in such a manner and kind as in this world, but
all, <hi>according</hi> to the rising up of the Spirits of God,
and the Light of the Sonne of God shineth therein
Eternally: But the rising up in the birth differs in

               <p>And therefore the wonderful wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

up:</p>
               <p>169. IIII. And the <hi>Birds</hi> or <hi>Fowles Fishes and Beasts</hi>

               <p>170. Thou art to know this, for the spirit in the

            <argument>
               <p>Of the terrible, dolefull and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
miserable Fall of
the Kingdome of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1.
I Would have all proud, covetous, envious, and
wrathfull men <hi>invited</hi> to look into this Glasse,
and there they will see the original of their
pride, covetousnesse, envy and wrath, also the
<hi>issue</hi> and final requital or wages thereof.</p>
            <p>12. The <hi>Learned</hi> have produced many and various
Monsters concerning the beginning of Sin, and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the Devil, and scuffled one with another
about it; every one of them, thought he had the
Axe by the Handle, yet it continued hidden from
them <hi>all,</hi> till this very time.</p>
            <p>3. But since it will henceforth be <hi>fully</hi> revealed,
as in a clear Looking-Glasse, therefore it may well
be conceived, <hi>that the Great Day of
the Revelation of God is now near
at hand,</hi> wherein the fiercenesse and the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
fire will be <hi>separated</hi> from the Light.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Therefore let none make himself stark blind,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61095:149"/>
for</hi> The time of the Restitution, of
whatsoever man hath lost, is now
near at Hand: the Day Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
or, the Morning-Rednesse
breaketh forth; It is high Time
to awake from sleep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it may be Asked:</p>
            <p>What is the source or fountain
of the first Sin of <hi>Lucifers</hi>
Kingdom?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Here we must <hi>again</hi> take in Hand the highest
depth of the Deity; and see, Out of what, King Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,
became a Creature, or what was the first
source or fountain of Evil or <hi>Malice</hi> in him?</p>
            <p>6. The Devil and his <hi>crew</hi> continually excuse
themselves, and so do all wicked men, which are
begotten in corruption, saying; God doth them
<hi>wrong,</hi> in thrusting them out or rejecting them.</p>
            <p>7. Nay, this present world doth dare to say, that
God hath <hi>Decreed</hi> or concluded it so in his <hi>predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
purpose and counsel; that some men should be
<hi>Saved,</hi> and some should be <hi>Damned,</hi> and say, to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61095:150"/>
that end also God hath rejected Prince <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that
he should be a spectacle of Gods <hi>wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. As if Hell or Malice and Evil, <hi>had been</hi> from
Eternity, and that it was in Gods predestinate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that Creatures should and <hi>must</hi> be therein;
and so they pull and <hi>hale</hi> and bestir themselves to
prove it by <hi>Scripture,</hi> though indeed they neither
have the knowledge of the <hi>true</hi> God, nor the
<hi>understanding</hi> of the Scriptures: though some
erroneous things also are <hi>brewed</hi> from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>9. Christ saith, <hi>the Devil was a murtherer and
Lyar from the beginning, and did not stand in the Truth,</hi>
John 8. 44. But being these Justifiers and Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
assist the Devil so stedfastly, and <hi>pervert</hi> Gods
truth, and change it into Lies, in that, they <hi>make</hi>
of God a thirsty and fierce wrathful Devil, and such
a one, as hath created and still willeth Evil, and so
all of them, together with the Devil, are <hi>joyntly</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
and Lyars.</p>
            <p>10. For, as the Devil is the <hi>Founder</hi> and Father
of Hell and Damnation, and hath himself built and
<hi>prepared</hi> for himself the Hellish <hi>quality</hi> to be his
Royal Seat; so also such Writers and <hi>Scriblers</hi> are
the <hi>Master</hi>-Builders of Lies and Damnation, who
help to confirm and Establish the Devils Lies, and
to make of the Merciful loving and friendly God,
a murtherer and furious <hi>Destroyer,</hi> and so pervert
and turn the truth of God into Lies.</p>
            <p>11. For God saith in the Prophet:</p>
            <p>As true as I live, I have no delight
or pleasure, in the death of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61095:150"/>
but that he turn and live,
<hi>Ezek. 33. 11. And in the</hi> Psalms <hi>it is thus;</hi>
thou art not a God, that hast plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in wickednesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
            <p>12. Besides, God hath given Lawes to man, and
hath <hi>forbidden</hi> the Evil, and <hi>commanded</hi> the Good.
Now if God would have the Evil, and also the
Good, then he should be at Odds with himself, and
it would follow, that there would be destruction or
destructivenesse in the <hi>Deity,</hi> one quality running
counter against the other, and the one spoiling and
corrupting the other.</p>
            <p>13. Now how all this is come to passe, or how
<hi>Wickednesse</hi> hath taken its First Source, original and
beginning, I will declare in the highest simplicity
in the greatest depth.</p>
            <p>14. To which End the spirit inviteth and citeth,
summoneth or <hi>warneth</hi> all men that are seduced into
Errours by the Devil, that they come and present
themselves before the Looking-Glasse of this <hi>School</hi>
wherein they shall see and inspect the murtherous
Devil into his very heart.</p>
            <p>15. Then he that will not take heed and <hi>beware</hi> of
his Lies, whilest he may very well do it, there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
<hi>Remedy</hi> for him neither here nor hereafter: he that
soweth and will <hi>sowe,</hi> with the Devil, must <hi>Reap</hi> with
the Devil also.</p>
            <p>16. In the Center of the flash
it is shewed, that the Harvest is
white already: wherein every one
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61095:151"/>
will Reap, what he hath Sown.</p>
            <p>17. Here, my <hi>Entrusted</hi> Talent, which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
I will let out for rent profit and encrease as
I am commanded to do, and he that will deal with
me in <hi>this</hi> way of gain or usury, it shall be free for
him, he may freely do it; <hi>whether</hi> he be a Christian,
a Jew, a Turk, or a Heathen; they will be all alike
advantagious to me; my Ware-house shall stand
open for every one, let none fear Exacting tricks or
deceit, for he that cometh to <hi>deal with me</hi> in my
Wares, shall be justly rightly and fairly dealt
with.</p>
            <p>18. Every one should here, have a care, to deal
so well that he bring in some Gain of <hi>use-money</hi> for
his Master: for I am afraid, that every Merchant
will not be <hi>fitted</hi> in my Warres for his turn; for to
some they will be very strange and <hi>uncouth,</hi> neither
will every one understand my Language Phrase and
Expression.</p>
            <p>19. I would therefore have every one warned,
that he deal circumspectly and <hi>warily,</hi> and not be
conceited, that he is rich, and cannot grow poor;
truly I have very admirable and <hi>wonderfull</hi> wares to
Sell, every one will not have understanding and skill
to know what to do with them.</p>
            <p>20. Now if any one should in a dull humour fall
upon them, and plunge himself into perdition, let
him bear his own blame; he hath need of a light
<hi>in his Heart,</hi> that his <hi>Understanding</hi> and Mind may be
well governed.</p>
            <p>21. Else let him forbear to come into my Ware-house,
or he will but deceive his own expectation;
for the Ware which I have to sell is very Pretious
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61095:151"/>
and Dear, and requireth a very sharp and acute <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:</hi>
therefore have a care, and do not climb
aloft, where you see no Ladder is, else you will
fall.</p>
            <p>22. But to me is shewen the Ladder of <hi>Jacob,</hi> upon
which I am climb'd up, even into heaven, and have
received my Ware, which I have to sell and vent:
Therefore if any one will climb up after me, let him
take heed that he be not drunken, but he must be
girt with the sword of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>23. For he must climb through a horrible deep,
a <hi>giddinesse</hi> will frequently come into his head; and
besides, he must climb through the midst or center
of the Kingdom of Hell, and there he will feel by
experience what a <hi>deal</hi> of scoffings and upbraidings
he must Endure.</p>
            <p>24. In this combate, I had many hard tryals to
my <hi>hearts</hi> grief: my Sun was often eclipsed or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,</hi>
but did rise again; and the oftner it was
eclipsed or put out, the <hi>brighter</hi> and clearer was its
rising again.</p>
            <p>25. I do not write this for my own <hi>praise,</hi> but
only for an <hi>Item</hi> or hint, that if it go so with you, you
should not despair about it, for there belongeth and
is requisite a mighty endurance hard labour and
stoutnesse, for him that fighteth with the Devil,
<hi>betwixt</hi> Heaven and Hell: for He is a potent
Prince.</p>
            <p>26. Therefore have a care, that thou put on the
Coat of Mayl or<note n="*" place="margin">Corslet <hi>or</hi> Brest-plate.</note> 
               <hi>Habergeon</hi> of the Spirit, else do not
venture to come <hi>near</hi> my Ware-house, that my
wares be not ill handled by thee, and so be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to thee.</p>
            <p>27. Thou must <hi>renounce</hi> the Devil and the world,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61095:152"/>
if thou wilt enter into this fight, else thou wilt not
overcome: But if thou <hi>overcomest not,</hi> then let my
book alone, and meddle not with it, but <hi>stick</hi> to thy
Old matters, <hi>else</hi> thou wilt receive but evil wages
for thy pains: <hi>be not deceived, God will not be mocked,</hi>
Gal. 6. 7.</p>
            <p>28. Truly it is a narrow and strait passage, or
<hi>entrance,</hi> through the Gates of Hell; for them that
will presse <hi>in</hi> to God: they must endure many <hi>pangs</hi>
crushings and squeezings from the Devil.</p>
            <p>29. For the <hi>humane</hi> flesh is very young and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the <hi>Devil</hi> is rough and hard, also dark, hot,
bitter, astringent and cold: and so these <hi>two</hi> are very
ill <hi>match'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>30. Therefore I seriously exhort the Reader, and
would have him faithfully warned, as it were with
a <hi>Preface</hi> to this Great Mystery, that if he do <hi>not</hi>
understand it, and yet longeth and would fain have
the meaning or understanding thereof, that he would
pray to God for his Holy Spirit, and that he would
<hi>enlighten</hi> him with the same.</p>
            <p>31. For, without the illumination thereof you
will <hi>not understand</hi> this Mystery; for there is a strong
Lock and Bar before it <hi>in the spirit of Man,</hi> that must
be first unlockt or opened, and that <hi>No man</hi> can do,
for the Holy Ghost is the <hi>onely</hi> Key to do it withall.</p>
            <p>32. Therefore if thou wilt have an open Gate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Deity, then thou must move stirre and walk <hi>in
Gods Love,</hi> this I have set down here for thy Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>

               <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>33. Every Angel is created in the <hi>seventh</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </note> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
or fountain-spirit, which is<note n="†" place="margin">NATURA.</note> NATURE, out
of which his Body is compacted or incorporated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and his Body is given him for a propriety, and
the same is <hi>free</hi> to it self, as the whole Deity is free.</p>
            <p>34. He hath no impulse or driving without or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from himself, his impulse and mobility stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>in his Body,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the Body.</note> which is of such a kind and manner,
as the <hi>whole</hi> God is; and his light and knowledge,
as also his life, is generated in that manner, as the
whole Divine Being is generated.</p>
            <p>35. For the Body is the incorporated or compacted
spirit of Nature, and encompasseth or incloseth the
other six Spirits; these generate themselves <hi>in the
Body,</hi> just as it is in the <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>36. Now <hi>Lucifer</hi> had the fairest Beautifullest and
powerfullest Body, in Heaven, of or among <hi>all</hi> the
Princes of God, and his Light, which he hath, and
is continually generated in his Body, that hath incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
<hi>with</hi> the heart or Sonne of God, as if they
were <hi>One</hi> thing.</p>
            <p>37. But when he saw that he was so fair and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and found or felt his inward birth and great
power or authority, then his spirit, which he had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in his Body, which is his ANIMAL (or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated)
or <hi>Life</hi>-spirit,—</p>
            <p>[Note, The Author calls the soulish Birth the <hi>ANIMAL</hi>
Birth; from <hi>Anima,</hi> which signifieth the <hi>Soul;</hi>
but being the Scripture otherwise understandeth by
the word <hi>Animal,</hi> the perished or corrupted Soul,
or <hi>Animalem hominem,</hi> the <hi>Animal</hi> man or
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61095:153"/>
the corrupted Natural Man, <hi>that is, the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
beastial Man;</hi> and so he being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of it, he altered that Expression, and used it
no more any further.</p>
            <p>—or Sonne or Heart; exalted it self, <hi>intending</hi>
to triumph over the Divine Birth, and to lift up or
extoll it self <hi>above</hi> the Heart of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here Observe the Depth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>38. In the middle or central fountain or well-spring,
which is the Heart; where the Birth riseth
up; the astringent or harsh quality rubs it self with
the Bitter and Hot, and there the <hi>light</hi> kindleth,
which is the <hi>Sonne,</hi> of which it is alwayes impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in its Body, and that enlighteneth and maketh
it <hi>living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>39. Now that light in <hi>Lucifer</hi> was so fair bright
and Beautiful, that he <hi>excelled</hi> the bright form of
heaven, and in that light was perfect <hi>Understanding:</hi>
for all the seven qualifying or fountain spirits gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
that same light.</p>
            <p>40. But now, the seven qualifying or fountain-Spirits
are the Father of the Light, and may <hi>permit</hi>
or suffer the Birth of the Light to be as much as they
please: and the light <hi>cannot</hi> exalt or raise it self
higher, then the qualifying or fountain-spirits will
permit, or give it leave.</p>
            <p>41. But when the Light is generated, then it <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth</hi>
all the seven qualifying or fountain spirits,
so that all seven are Understanding; and do all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
give their will to the <hi>Birth</hi> of the Light.</p>
            <p>42. But now, every one hath power and Might
to <hi>alter</hi> its will in the Birth of the light, according as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61095:153"/>
there is <hi>need:</hi> now if that be so, then the spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
triumph thus, but must lay down its <hi>prancing</hi>
Pomp.</p>
            <p>43. And therefore it is that all seven spirits are
in full power, every one of them hath the Reines in
its hand, that it may hold in and <hi>check</hi> the <hi>generated</hi>
spirit, from triumphing any higher, then is <hi>fit</hi> for
it.</p>
            <p>44. But the seven spirits, which are in an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
which generate the light and understanding,
they are bound and united with the <hi>whole</hi> God, that
they should not qualifie any other way, either
higher or <hi>more</hi> vehemently, then God himself; but
that there should be one and the same <hi>manner</hi> and
way between <hi>them both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>45. Seeing they are but a part or <hi>peece</hi> of the
whole, and not the whole it self, for God hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
created them out of <hi>himself,</hi> that they should
qualifie operate or Act in such a manner form and
way as God himself doth.</p>
            <p>46. But now the qualifying or fountain spirits in
<hi>Lucifer</hi> did not so, but they seeing that they sate in
the highest Primacie or <hi>Rank,</hi> they moved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so hard, and strongly, that the spirit, which
they generated was very fiery, and climbed up in
the fountain of the heart, like a Proud <hi>Damsell</hi> or
Virgin.</p>
            <p>47. If the qualifying or fountain spirits had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
qualified or acted gently and lovely, as they <hi>did</hi>
before they became creaturely, as they were <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally</hi>
in God before the Creation, then had they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
also a gentle lovely mild and meek Sonne
in them, which would have been <hi>like</hi> to the Sonne
of God; and then the Light in <hi>Lucifer</hi> and the Light
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61095:154"/>
of the Sonne of God had been <hi>One</hi> thing, one quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
operating acting and affecting, one and the
same lovely kissing, Embracing and struggling.</p>
            <p>48. For the great Light, which is the Heart of
God, would have <hi>played</hi> meekly mildly and loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the <hi>small</hi> Light in <hi>Lucifer,</hi> as with a young
sonne, for the <hi>little</hi> sonne in Lucifer should have
been the dear <hi>little</hi> brother, of the Heart of God.</p>
            <p>49. To this End God the Father hath created the
Angels, that as he is manifold and <hi>various</hi> in his
Qualities, and in his <hi>alteration</hi> or variegation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
in his Sport or <hi>Scene</hi> of Love; so,
the <hi>little</hi> spirits also, or the little Lights of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
which are as the Sonne of God, should play or
sport very <hi>gently</hi> or lovely in the great light before
the Heart of God; that the Joy in the Heart of God
might here be <hi>encreased,</hi> and that so there might be
a holy Sport Scene or play in God.</p>
            <p>50. The seven spirits of Nature in an Angel
should play and rise up <hi>gently</hi> in God their Father,
as they had done before their creaturely Being, and
rejoyce in their New-born sonne, which they have
generated out of <hi>themselves,</hi> which is the Light and
Understanding of their Body.</p>
            <p>51. And that light should rise very gently or
mildly in the Heart of God, and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in the light
of God, as a child with its Mother, and so there
should be a Hearty loving, and friendly kissing, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
meek and pleasant Taste or relish.</p>
            <p>52. In this the Tone should rise up, and sound,
with <hi>singing</hi> and ringing forth; in praising and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilating:
also all the qualities should rejoyce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and every spirit should <hi>exercise</hi> or practise its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
work or labour, as God the Father <hi>Himself</hi>
doth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:61095:154"/>
53. For the seven spirits had this in perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
for they were united and <hi>actuated</hi> with God
the Father, so that they <hi>could all</hi> see, feel, taste, smell
and hear, what God their Father <hi>did,</hi> or wrought
and made.</p>
            <p>54. But when they elevated themselves in a sharp
or strong kindling, then they did <hi>against</hi> Natures
Right, otherwise then God their Father did, and
this was a stirring quality or rising up, <hi>against</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the whole Deity.</p>
            <p>55. For they kindled the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the Body, and
generated a high triumphing Sonne, which in the
astringent quality, was hard, rugged or rough, dark
and cold; in the sweet, was <hi>burning</hi> bitter and fiery:
The Tone was a hard <hi>fiery noise;</hi> The Love was a
lofty <hi>Emnity</hi> against God.</p>
            <p>56. Here now stood the kindled Bride in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Nature-spirit, like a <hi>Proud Beast;</hi> now she sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
she was beyond or above God, nothing was
like her now: Love grew <hi>cold,</hi> the Heart of God
could not touch it, for there was a <hi>contrary</hi> will or
opposition betwixt them. The Heart of God moved
very meekly and lovingly, and the heart of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
moved very darkly <hi>hard</hi> cold and fiery.</p>
            <p>57. And the heart of God should now <hi>unite</hi> and
qualifie with the Heart of the Angel, but that could
<hi>not</hi> be; for there was now hard against soft, and
soure against sweet, and dark against light, and fire
against a pleasant gentle warmth, and a hard
knocking or rumbling against a loving melodious
song.</p>
            <pb n="280" facs="tcp:61095:155"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hearken <hi>Lucifer,</hi> Where ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the fault now, that thou art
become a Devill? Is God in fault,
as thou lyingly sayst?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>58. O no, <hi>thou</hi> thy self art faulty, the qualifying
or fountain Spirits in thy Body, which thou thy self
art, have generated thee <hi>such</hi> a little sonne: Thou
canst not say, that God hath kindled the <hi>Salitter,</hi> out
of which he made thee, but thy qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spirits have done it, whereas thou wert clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before, a Prince and King of God.</p>
            <p>59. Therefore, when thou sayst, God Created
thee thus, or that he hath <hi>without sufficient</hi> cause spew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee up out of thy place: then art thou a Lyar
and Murtherer. For the <hi>whole</hi> heavenly Hoast or
Army beareth witnesse against thee, that thou hast
<hi>thy self</hi> erected and prepared this fierce Quality for
thy self.</p>
            <p>60. If it be not so, then go before the face of
God, and <hi>Justifie</hi> thy self. But thou seest it plain
enough without that; and besides, thou darest not
look on that matter: Wouldst not thou <hi>fain</hi> have a
friendly kisse of the Sonne of God, that thou mightst
once be eased or refreshed? if thou art in the Right,
then do but once look upon HIM: perhaps thou
mayst be made sound or whole again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:61095:155"/>
61. But stay a little, <hi>another</hi> sitteth on thy Throne,
He is kissed, and he is an obedient sonne to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and doth as the Father doth.</p>
            <p>62. Stay yet a little while, and the <hi>Hellish</hi> fire
will kisse thee; in the mean while, make much of
this Latine till more groweth out of it; thou wilt
<hi>suddenly</hi> lose thy Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now one might Ask:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then in <hi>Lucifer,</hi> is properly, that Emnity
against God; for which he was Thrust and
driven out of his place?</p>
            <p>63. Here I will shew you exactly the Pith Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
and <hi>Heart</hi> of Lucifer, and then you will see, what
a Devil is, or <hi>how</hi> he is become a <hi>Devil.</hi> Therefore
take heed, and do not Invite or Entertain him as a
Guest, for he is the Arch-sworn Enemy of God,
and of all Angels and Men, and that in his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>64. Now if thou understandest and apprehendest
<hi>this</hi> aright, then thou wilt not make of God a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
as some do, which say: <hi>God hath created the
Evil,</hi> and that his will is, that some men should be
Lost; which men, that so say, help to encrease the
Devils <hi>Lies,</hi> and bring upon themselves the severe
Judgment, by their perverting Gods <hi>truth,</hi> and so
turning them into Lies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>65. The whole Deity hath in its innermost or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
Birth, in the Pith or kernel, a very tart ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:61095:156"/>
               <hi>sharpnesse,</hi> in which, the astringent quality is a
very horrible, tart, hard, dark and cold attracting
or drawing together, like <hi>winter,</hi> when there is a
fiery bitter cold frost, when water is frozen into Ice,
and besides is very Intolerable.</p>
            <p>66. Then think or suppose if in such a hard Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when it is so cold, the <hi>Sun</hi> should be taken away,
what kind of hard Frost, and how very rough <hi>fierce</hi>
and hard darknesse would it be, wherein no life <hi>could</hi>
subsist.</p>
            <p>67. After such a manner and kind is the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality in the innermost kernel or Pith <hi>in it self,</hi>
and to it self alone, without the other qualities <hi>in
God;</hi> for the austerenesse or severity maketh the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
or drawing together, and fixation or Glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinousnesse
of the body, and the hardnesse dryeth it
up, so that it subsisteth<note n="*" place="margin">Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> as a Creature.</p>
            <p>68. And the bitter quality is a <hi>tearing,</hi> penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and cutting bitter quality or source: for it <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedeth</hi>
and driveth forth the hard and astringent
Quality, and maketh the mobility.</p>
            <p>69. And betwixt these two qualities is heat ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
from its hard and fierce bitter rubbing, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and raging, which riseth up in the Bitter and
hard quality, as a <hi>fierce</hi> wrathful kindling, and
presseth quite through, as a <hi>hard</hi> fiery <hi>Noise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>70. From whence existeth the hard Tone, and in
that rising up, or climbing, it is invironed and <hi>fixed</hi>
in the astringent quality, so that it becometh a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which subsisteth.</p>
            <p>71. Now if there were <hi>no</hi> other quality in this
Body, which could quench the <hi>fiercenesse</hi> of these four
qualities, then there<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>were.</hi>
               </note> would be a perpetual Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
therein. For the bitter<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>were.</hi>
               </note> would be against the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61095:156"/>
astringent, in that it stormeth and teareth so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
therein, and <hi>breaketh open</hi> the astringent.</p>
            <p>72. And then the astringent also would be against
the bitter, in that it attracteth, draweth together
and holds fast, the bitter, <hi>captive,</hi> that it could not
have its own course.</p>
            <p>73. And the Heat would be against both, in that
with its fierce wratful kindling and rising up,
it maketh all hot, <hi>burning,</hi> and raging, and is fully
or totally against the cold.</p>
            <p>74. And so the Tone would be a great Emnity in
all the other, in that it penetrateth forcibly through
all like a <hi>Tyrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>75. <hi>And thus, this is the very
deepest and innermost hidden
Birth of God,</hi> according to which, he calleth
himself <hi>an angry</hi> zealous or <hi>Jealous God,</hi> as may be seen
by the Ten Commandements on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Exod.
20. 5. Deut. 5. 9.</p>
            <p>76. And in this quality standeth <hi>Hell</hi> and Eternal
Perdition, as also the eternal Emnity and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Den, and such a creature the <hi>Devil</hi> is come to
be.</p>
            <p>77. But now, seeing he is a sworn Arch-enemy of
God, and though indeed the Disputants and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Devil will needs force it so, in <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
that God willeth the good and also the evil,
and that he hath created <hi>some</hi> men to Damnation;
therefore and thereupon the Spirit of God <hi>citeth</hi>
them upon pain of eternal Emnity, to come before
this Looking-Glasse, wherein their <hi>Heart</hi> shall be
laid open; and they shall see, <hi>what</hi> God is, and <hi>who</hi>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:61095:157"/>
the Devil is, or <hi>how</hi> he is become a Devil.</p>
            <p>78. If thy heart be not bolted and barred up in
death, through thy <hi>stubborn</hi> wilfulnesse aed Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and <hi>drown'd</hi> in horrible sins, purposing not to
desist from them, or leave them, then <hi>awake,</hi> and
behold; I take Heaven and Earth; also the Stars
and Elements, and all the Creatures, and Man
himself also in his whole substance, to witnesse, and
so I will prove it also <hi>plainly</hi> and clearly in its due
place, with all these forementioned things, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
when we come to treat of the <hi>Creation</hi> of all
the Creatures.</p>
            <p>79. If these things will <hi>not</hi> give thee satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
then pray to God, that He would <hi>open</hi> thy
Heart, and then thou wilt know and <hi>see</hi> Heaven and
Hell, as also the <hi>whole</hi> Deity with all its qualities;
and then no doubt thou wilt forbear, and justifie the
Devil no more: <hi>I am not able to open
thy heart for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Now observe the true<note n="*" place="margin">or the Divine Birth.</note> Birth or Geniture
of God.</head>
               <p>80. Behold, as I have mentioned above; the Birth
or Geniture of God in its innermost Being, in <hi>these</hi>
four qualities; is thus Sharp or Tart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou must understand it exactly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>81. The astringent quality is thus sharp in its
own proper quality in <hi>it self:</hi> but it is not alone, or
without the other; neither is it generated of or in it
self, as being wholly free, but the other six Spirits
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:61095:157"/>
generate it, and they also hold it by the Reins, and
may let their Reins and <hi>authority</hi> go as far only, as
they please.</p>
               <p>82. For, the sweet spring or fountain water is
suddenly a whip scourge or Lash upon the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality, and mitigateth softneth or suppleth
it, so that it groweth very thin, gentle mild and
soft, as also very <hi>Bright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>80. But that it is thus sharp in it self, is to the
end, that a <hi>Body</hi> may be Imaged or framed through
its attracting or drawing together, otherwise the
Deity <hi>would not</hi> subsist, much <hi>lesse</hi> a creature.</p>
               <p>84. And in this sharpnesse, God is an All-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
and all-fixing or all-fastning sharp God:
for the Birth Geniture and sharpnesse of God is <hi>thus</hi>
every where.</p>
               <p>85. But if I shall describe the Deity in its Birth or
<hi>Geniture</hi> in a small round circle, in the highest
Depth, then it is <hi>thus</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a Similitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>86. As suppose a WHEEL standing before thee,
with seven <hi>wheeles</hi> one so made in the other, that it
could go on <hi>all</hi> sides, forward, backward, and crosse
wayes, without need of any turning back or stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
               <p>87. And in its going, that, alwayes one wheel in
its turning about <hi>generateth</hi> the other, and yet none
of them do vanish out of sight, but that all seven be
visible; or in <hi>sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>88. And the seven Wheeles alwaies generating
the <hi>Naves</hi> in the midst or center according to their
turning about, so that the Nave stand alwaies free
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61095:158"/>
without alteration or removing; whether the
wheeles go forward or backward or crosse waies, or
upward or downward.</p>
               <p>89. And the Nave alwaies generating the <hi>Spoaks,</hi>
so that in their turning about, they stand right and
direct from the <hi>Nave</hi> to the <hi>Felleys</hi> of the wheel:
and yet none of the <hi>spoaks</hi> to be out of sight, but still
turning about, thus one with another, going whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever
the <hi>wind</hi> drive it, and that without need
of any turning back or <hi>stopping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now observe what I shall inform you in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>90. The <hi>seven Wheeles</hi> are the seven Spirits of God,
the one alwaies generating the other; and are like,
the turning about of a wheel, which hath seven
wheels <hi>one in another,</hi> and the one alwaies wheeleth
it self otherwise then the other in its <hi>station,</hi> and the
seven wheeles are Felleyed, or <hi>hooped</hi> Round with
Felleys, like a round <hi>Globe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>91. And yet that a man may see all the seven
wheeles turning round about severally apart, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the whole <hi>fitnesse</hi> or compasse of the frame, with
all its Felleys and Spoaks and Naves.</p>
               <p>92. And the <hi>seven Naves</hi> in the midst or Center
being as it were <hi>one Nave,</hi> which doth fit every
where in the turning about, and the wheeles conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
generating these Naves, and the Naves ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
the Spoaks continually in all the seven
wheeles, and yet none of the wheeles, as also none
of the Naves, nor any of the Felleys or Spoaks <hi>to be
out of sight,</hi> and as if this wheel had <hi>seven</hi> wheeles,
and yet were all but <hi>one</hi> wheel, and went alwayes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61095:158"/>
                  <hi>forward,</hi> whithersoever the wind drove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Behold, and Consider.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>93. The seven wheeles one in another, the one
alwaies generating the other, and going on every
side, and yet none out of sight, or turning back:
these are the <hi>seven</hi> qualifying or fountain <hi>Spirits</hi> of
God the Father.</p>
               <p>94. And they generate in the seven wheeles, in
each wheel a Nave, and yet there are not seven
Naves, but only <hi>One,</hi> which fitteth in all the seven
wheeles: And this is the Heart or <hi>innermost</hi> Body of
the wheeles, wherein the wheels run about, and
that signifieth the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>95. For all the seven Spirits of God the Father
generate continually in their circle, and that, is the
sonne of all the seven spirits, and all those qualifie
or <hi>act</hi> in his Light, and is in the midst or Center of
the Birth, and <hi>holds together</hi> all the seven spirits of
God, and they in their Birth turn about therewith,
thus.</p>
               <p>96. That is, they clime either upward or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
backward or forward or crosse-wayes, and so
the Heart of God is <hi>alwayes</hi> in the midst or center,
and fitteth alwaies every qualifying or fountain Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>97. Thus there is <hi>One</hi> Heart of God, and <hi>not</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is alwaies generated from all the seven,
and is the heart and <hi>life</hi> of all the seven.</p>
               <p>98. Now the <hi>Spoaks,</hi> which are alwaies
generated from the Naves and Wheeles,
and which do fit all the wheeles in their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and are their Root, stay, and fastning, in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61095:159"/>
which they stand, and out of which they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;
signifie God the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which goeth
forth from the Father and the Sonne, even as the
Spoaks go out from the Nave and Wheel, and yet
<hi>abide</hi> also <hi>in</hi> the wheel.</p>
               <p>99. Now as the Spoaks are many, and go alwaies
about with and in the wheel; so the Holy Ghost is
the <hi>Workmaster</hi> in the wheel of God, and formeth,
Imageth and frameth all, in the whole or total
God.</p>
               <p>100. Now this wheel hath seven wheels one in
another, and one Nave, which is fitted in all the
seven wheels: and all the seven wheels <hi>turn on that
one Nave:</hi> Thus God is one God, with seven qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
or fountain spirits, and yet is but one God,
just as these seven wheeles are but <hi>One</hi> wheel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>101. The wheel in its incorporated structure and
frame signifieth the <hi>astringent</hi> quality, which attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or draweth together the whole corporeal Being
of the Deity, and holds it, and dryeth it, so that it
<hi>subsisteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>102. And the <hi>sweet</hi> spring or fountain-water is
generated by the driving about or <hi>rising up</hi> of the
spirits, for when the light is generated in the Heat,
then the astringent quality is amazed or terrified for
great Joy, and this is a submitting or lying down,
or growing thin, and the <hi>hard</hi> corporeal being, sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down like a meeknesse or mildnesse.</p>
               <p>103. And so now the terrour or the <hi>glance</hi> of the
Light riseth up in the astringent quality very <hi>gently</hi>
and shivering, and trembleth; which now in the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61095:159"/>
                  <hi>water</hi> is bitter, and the Light dryeth it, and maketh
it friendly and sweet.</p>
               <p>104. Now therein standeth <hi>life</hi> and <hi>joy:</hi> for the
terrour or flash riseth up in all the qualities, like the
wheel aforementioned which turneth about, and
then there all the seven spirits rise up one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and generate themselves, as in a <hi>Circle,</hi> and
the light is shining in the midst or Center of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Spirits, and re-shineth back again in all the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and all the spirits <hi>triumph</hi> therein, and rejoyce
in the light.</p>
               <p>105. And as the seven Wheeles turn about upon
one Nave, as upon their Heart, which <hi>holds</hi> them,
and they hold the Nave; so the seven spirits gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Heart, and the <hi>heart</hi> holds the seven spirits,
and so there arise <hi>voyces,</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> joyfulnesse, of
<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
                  </note> hearty loving and kissing.</p>
               <p>106. For when the spirits with their light move,
or boyl, turn about and rise one in another, then
the life is <hi>alwayes</hi> generated: for one spirit alwaies
affordeth to the other its taste or relish, that is, it is
<hi>affected</hi> with the other.</p>
               <p>107. Thus the one tasteth and feeleth the other,
and the Tone presseth forth from all the seven spirits
<hi>towards</hi> the Heart, and riseth up in the heart in the
flash of the light, and then rise up the voices and
<hi>joyfulnesse</hi> of the Sonne of God: and all the seven
spirits triumph and rejoyce in the Heart of God,
each according to its quality.</p>
               <p>108. For in the Light in the <hi>sweet</hi> water, all astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
and hardnesse, and bitternesse, and heat, are
mitigated and made pleasant; and so there is, in the
seven spirits nothing else but a <hi>pleasant</hi> striving strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61095:160"/>
and wonderful generating like a divine holy
Sport or Scene of God.</p>
               <p>109. But their sharp or Tart Birth, of which I
have written above, abideth <hi>hidden</hi> as a kernel, for
it becometh mitigated by the light and sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>110. Just as a four bitter green Apple is <hi>forced</hi>
by the Sun, that it becometh very pleasant or lovely
to be eaten, and yet all its qualities are tasted: so
the Deity keepeth its qualities also, but striveth or
struggleth gently, like a pleasant lovely Sport or
Scene.</p>
               <p>111. But if the qualifying or fountain spirits
should <hi>extoll</hi> or lift up themselves, and penetrate
suddenly one into another, driving hard, rubbing
and thronging, crowding or sqeezing; then the
sweet water would be <hi>squeezed</hi> out, and the fierce
heat would be kindled, and then would rise up the
<hi>fire</hi> of the seven spirits, as in <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>112. This is now the true Birth
or Geniture of the Deity, which
hath been so from eternity in all
Corners and Places whatsoever,
and abideth so in all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>113. But in the Kingdom of <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Rev. 9. 11.</note> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer;</hi>
it is otherwise; as I have written above
concerning the <hi>fiercenesse;</hi> and in this world which
is now half kindled also, it is likewise after another
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61095:160"/>
manner; and will be so till the day of the Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
of which I shall write when I treat concerning
the <hi>Creation</hi> of this world.</p>
               <p>114. Now in this glorious lovely and heavenly
<hi>Salitter</hi> or divine Qualities, the Kingdom of <hi>Lucifer</hi>
also was created without any greater motion, then
the other.</p>
               <p>115. For when <hi>Lucifer</hi> was created, he was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>perfect,</hi> and was the fairest Prince in heaven,
adorned and indued with the fairest <hi>clarity</hi> or
Brightnesse of the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>116. But if <hi>Lucifer</hi> had been spoiled or destroyed
in the moving of the Creation, as <hi>he pretendeth,</hi> then
he had <hi>never had</hi> his Perfection, beauty and clarity;
but would have been <hi>presently</hi> a fierce dark Devill,
and not a Cherubin.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the glorious Birth and beauty of King
Lucifer.</head>
               <p>117. Behold thou murtherous and lying spirit!
here I will describe thy <hi>Royall</hi> Birth, how thou wert
in thy Creation, how God created <hi>thee,</hi> and how
thou becamest so beautiful, and to what <hi>end</hi> God
created thee.</p>
               <p>118. If thou sayst any other thing then this, which
Heaven and Earth, and all the Creatures testifie,
then thou Lyest, nay the whole <hi>Deity</hi> testifieth against
thee; that God created thee for his <hi>praise</hi> out of
himself, to be a Prince and King of God, as he did
Prince <hi>Michael</hi> and Prince <hi>Uriel.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:61095:161"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>119. When the Deity moved it self to Creation,
and would form Image or frame Creatures in <hi>its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
it kindled not the qualifying spirits, else they
would have <hi>burnt</hi> Eternally, but it stirr'd them very
gently or softly in the astringent quality.</p>
               <p>120. That, drew or attracted the Divine <hi>Salitter</hi>
together, and dryed it so that it became a <hi>Body,</hi> and
so the whole divine power of all the seven qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain-spirits of that place or Room, as far
as that of the Angels <hi>reached,</hi> was captivated in the
Body, and became the propriety of the Body, which
neither can nor shall, be destroyed again, in <hi>Eternity,</hi>
but shall remain the Bodies propriety or proper
own, in Eternity.</p>
               <p>121. Now the captivated or incorporated power
of all the seven qualifying or fountain spirits had its
<hi>propriety</hi> in the Body, and is risen in the Body, and
hath generated it self in the same manner as the
<hi>Deity</hi> generateth it self from all the seven qualifying
or fountain spirits.</p>
               <p>122. One quality hath alwaies generated the
other alike, and none of them have vanished or gone
out of sight, just as it is in the <hi>whole</hi> Deity: and then
the whole Body, as it is also in the Ternarie, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
it self just as the Deity generateth it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
or distinct from the Body, in the <hi>Ternarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>123. But this I must mention here; <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>Lucifer,</hi> the King, was incorporated together out of
his whole Kingdome, as the Heart of the whole
place or Room thereof, so <hi>far</hi> as his whole Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Hoast or Army reached when it was created, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61095:161"/>
so far as that circumference or circle, Region or
Quarter, reach'd, wherein He and his Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a creature, and which God before the time of
Creation had enclosed or concluded as a Room or
Space for a Kingdom, whose circuit or Extent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
<hi>Heaven and this world;</hi> as also the <hi>Deep of
the Earth,</hi> and of the whole Circle Sphear or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of this <hi>whole world</hi> of the Heavens and
Stars.</p>
               <p>124. And according to the qualities were his
qualifying or fountain Princes created, which are
his Kingly Counsellours, and so also were all his
Angels created.</p>
               <p>125. Yet you are to know, that <hi>every</hi> Angel hath
<hi>all</hi> the seven spirits in him, but one of the seven is
chief or principal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now behold!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>126. When the King was thus incorporated or
<hi>compacted</hi> together, as one comprehending his whole
Kingdom, then instantly, the same hour, and in the
same <hi>Moment:</hi> when he was incorporated or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
together: the birth of the Holy <hi>Trinity</hi> of
God, which he had for a propriety in his Body,</p>
               <p>[<q>Understand in the <hi>Liberty,</hi> not essentially, but
as the fire shineth forth or gloweth through the
Iron that is flaming hot, and the Iron remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
Iron still; or as the light replenisheth
or filleth the Darknesse, the dark source or
quality being changed into Light, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
joyful, and yet in the Center remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a darknesse, which is understood to be
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61095:162"/>
Nature; for a spirit; is repleninish'd onely
with the Majestie:</q>]
rose up and generated it self without, distinct from
the Creature, in God.</p>
               <p>127. For in the driving together of the Body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
likewise rose up the Birth also in great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
as in a New-born King, <hi>in God;</hi> and all the
seven qualifying or fountain spirits shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very joyful and <hi>triumphing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>128. And instantly in the same <hi>Moment</hi> the light
was generated and rose up out of the seven spirits in
the Center of the heart, as a new-born sonne of the
King, which also instantly in a Moment, clarified
or brightened the <hi>Body</hi> of all the seven qualifying or
fountain spirits from the Center of the Heart; and
externally from without, the light of the Sonne of
God clarified or brightened it.</p>
               <p>129. For the Birth of the new Sonne in the Heart
of <hi>Lucifer</hi> also penetrated through the whole Body,
and was glorified from the Sonne of God, which was
without distinct from the body, and was friendlily
welcommed with the <hi>greatest</hi> Beauty of Heaven, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Beauty of God the Sonne, and it was
to him as a loving Heart or propriety, with which
the whole Deity qualified or <hi>operated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>130. And then instantly also the spirit of the new
born sonne in the Heart, went forth from the light of
<hi>Lucifer</hi> through his <hi>Mouth,</hi> and united qualified or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated
with the holy Spirit of God, and was with
highest Joy received and embraced, as a dear <hi>little</hi>
Brother.</p>
               <p>131. Now here standeth the Beautious Bride:
what shall I write of her now? was she not a <hi>Prince</hi>
of God; as also the most beautiful; moreover in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61095:162"/>
Gods love also, and as a <hi>dear</hi> Sonne of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the horrible, proud, and henceforth doleful
Lamentable
Beginning of Sin.</head>
               <p>The highest Depth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>132.
When King <hi>Lucifer</hi> was thus fairly gloriously
Beautiously highly and holily framed or built, he
should <hi>surely</hi> have now begun to praise, honour and
magnifie his <hi>Creatour;</hi> and should do that, which
God his Creator doth.</p>
               <p>133. <hi>Viz.</hi> God his Creator qualifieth or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
very <hi>meekly,</hi> lovingly and Joyfully, and one
qualifying or fountain-spirit of God alwaies loveth
the other, and bringeth its <hi>affection</hi> into the other,
and alwaies helpeth the other to Image form and
frame all in the <hi>heavenly Pomp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>134. Whereby, in the heavenly pomp alwaies
such fair beautious forms, Ideas, <hi>figures,</hi> and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
spring up, as also <hi>various</hi> colours and fruits;
and this the qualifying or fountain spirits of God
do, <hi>in God,</hi> as a holy Play Sport or Scene.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now behold!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>135. Seeing then God had incorporated or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
together out of himself, <hi>Eternal Creatures,</hi> they
should not qualifie or operate in the heavenly pomp
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61095:163"/>
in such a way and manner, as to be <hi>like God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>136. No, by no means; for they were not thus
Imaged or framed to <hi>that End:</hi> For, the Creator had
for this cause incorporated or <hi>compacted</hi> the Body of
an Angel together, to be more dry, then he is in his
Body; that he might be and <hi>remain to be</hi> God; so
that the qualities should be harder and tougher, that
the Tone or Sound might be loud clear and shrill.</p>
               <p>137. So that, when the seven qualities in an Angel,
in the Center of the heart, do <hi>generate</hi> the Light and
the spirit or <hi>understanding;</hi> that then, that same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which in the light of the heart, goeth forth at
the mouth of the Angel, in the <hi>Divine</hi> power; should
as a loud clear shrill sound in the power of all the
qualities <hi>in God;</hi> sing and ring forth as a melodious
<hi>Musick,</hi> and in the forming Imaging framing or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
of God, rise up as a pleasant hearty loving
voyce; in <hi>Gods forming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>138. And when the Holy Ghost formeth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
fruit, then should the Tone, which should rise

in <hi>Gods</hi> Tone, so that the fruit is formed Imaged

               <p>141. <hi>Herein standeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost
and greatest depth of God,</hi>
O, Man, consider thy self! I will more <hi>largely</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it, in its due place.</p>
               <p>142. Now for such an end hath God created the
Angels, and they do so too: for their <hi>spirit,</hi> which
in the Center or heart goeth forth from their light
in the power of all the seven qualifying or fountain-spirits,
<hi>that</hi> goeth forth at their Mouth, as God the
Holy Ghost goeth forth from the Father and Sonne,
and helpeth to form Image or frame all, in God (that
is to say, in the Divine Nature) through the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius</hi>
song and speaking and Sport or Scene of
Joy.</p>
               <p>143. For, as God worketh in Nature to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of <hi>all</hi> manner of forms, Ideas, Images vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
springings, fruits and colours: so do the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

also in very great simplicity or sincerity; and
though they should <hi>scarce</hi> touch the least Twigg, or

house of his Father, and that he did not.</p>
               <p>147. But when his light was generated in him
in his heart, and that his qualifying spirits were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affected or <hi>invironed</hi> with the high light they
then became so highly rejoycing, that they elevated
themselves in their Body against the Right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and presently began as it were a Higher <hi>state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi>
more Pompous or Active qualifying or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then God himself <hi>exercised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>148. But these spirits elevating themselves thus,
and triumphing so eagerly and vehemently one in
another, and rising up against the right of Nature,
by that means they kindled the qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spirits too exceeding much; <hi>viz.</hi> the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Quality attracted or compacted the <hi>Body</hi> too
hard together, so that the sweet water was <hi>dryed</hi>
up.</p>
               <p>149. And the powerful and great Bright Flash,
which was risen up in the sweet water in the <hi>Heat,</hi>
from whence the bitter Quality existeth in the sweet
water, that rubb'd it self so horribly hard with the
astringent quality, as if it would break in pieces for
great <hi>Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>150. For the flash was so Bright, that it was as it
were intolerable to the qualifying or fountain spirits,
and therefore the bitter quality or source trembled
and rubb'd it self so hard in the astringent, that the
heat was kindled <hi>contrary</hi> to the Right of Nature,
and the astringent also dryed up the sweet water by
its hard attracting together.</p>
               <p>151. But now the quality of Heat was <hi>so severe,</hi>
furious and eager, that it bereaved the astringent
quality or source of its power: for the heat existeth
in the fountain or source of the <hi>sweet</hi> water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:61095:165"/>
152. But the sweet water being dryed up through
the astringent attracting together, therefore could
not the Heat any more rise to a flame or to any light,
(for the light existeth in the unctuosity or <hi>Oylinesse</hi> of
the water;) but <hi>glowed</hi> like a red hot Iron, or like Iron
not quite glowing, but very <hi>dimly</hi> and darkly: or as
if you should put a very hard <hi>stone</hi> into the fire, and
should let it lye there in great heat, as long as you
please, yet it would not be <hi>glowing</hi> light, because it
hath too little water, or <hi>Oylinesse</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>153. Thus now the Heat kindled the dryed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the light could <hi>no more</hi> elevate and kindle
it self, for the water was dryed up, and was quite
consumed by the fire or great Heat.</p>
               <p>154. The meaning is not here, as if the spirit of
the water were <hi>swallowed</hi> up or devoured, which
dwelleth, in all the seven qualities, but its Quality
or upper place or <hi>predominancy</hi> was changed into a
dusky hot and sour Quality.</p>
               <p>155. For here in this place the sour quality hath
taken its <hi>first original</hi> and beginning, which now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is <hi>inherited</hi> in this world; which is not in Heaven
in God, after <hi>such</hi> a manner at all, nor in any Angel:
for it is, and signifieth, the house of <hi>affliction</hi> trouble
and misery, and is a forgetfulnesse of all Good.</p>
               <p>156. Now when this was done, the qualifying or
fountain spirits <hi>rubb'd</hi> themselves one upon another
in that manner and way, as I have mentioned <hi>above</hi>
concerning the <hi>Figure</hi> of the Sevenfold wheel, for
they use thus to rise up one in another, and to taste
one another, or to <hi>affect</hi> one another, from whence
life and love existeth.</p>
               <p>157. Now in all the spirits there was nothing
else but a meer <hi>Hot</hi> Fiery <hi>Cold</hi> and Hard corruption,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61095:165"/>
and so one evil quality tasted the other, whereby the
whole Body grew so very fierce and wrathfull; for
the Heat was against the Cold, and the Cold against
the <hi>Heat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>158. And so the sweet water being dryed up, the
bitter quality (which existed and was generated by
the <hi>first flash,</hi> when the light kindled it self;) rose up
in the Body through all the spirits, as if it would
<hi>destroy</hi> the Body, and so raved and raged like the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
or worst Poison.</p>
               <p>159. And from thence existed the <hi>first</hi> Poison,
wherein we poor men now in this world have
enough to <hi>chew</hi> upon; and thereby the bitter <hi>poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Death</hi> is come into the flesh.</p>
               <p>160. In this raging and tearing now, the life of
<hi>Lucifer</hi> was generated, that is, his <hi>dear</hi> little sonne
in the circle or center of his heart: and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life and dear little sonne came to be, I offer to
any <hi>Rational</hi> Soul to consider of.</p>
               <p>161. For <hi>such</hi> as the Father was, <hi>such</hi> was the
Sonne also, <hi>viz.</hi> a dark, astringent, Cold, hard, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
hot, sour, stinkiug, fountain or source, and the
Love stood in the Bitter quality, in its <hi>penetrating</hi>
taste and relish; and became an emnity against all
the qualifying or fountain spirits in the Body of the
high minded <hi>arrogant</hi> King.</p>
               <p>162. Thus the Tone rose up through the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the bitter quality through the <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>dryed</hi>
water, and through the astringent hard quality; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>heart,</hi> into the little new dear sonne.</p>
               <p>163. And here the spirit <hi>went forth;</hi> and as He
was generated in the <hi>heart,</hi> so he went forth now at
the <hi>Mouth,</hi> but how welcome a Guest he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61095:166"/>
God, and in God, also before the Holy Angels
of the other Kingdoms, I leave to <hi>thee</hi> to consider
of.</p>
               <p>164. He should now have united with the Sonne
of God, as one Heart and one God: Alas for ever!

               </p>
               <p>3. When <hi>Lucifer</hi> had thus horribly spoiled and
destroyed himself, all his qualifying or fountain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were Emnity against God, for they all qualified
or acted much <hi>otherwise</hi> then God, and so there <hi>came

               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>

               <p>How Long did <hi>Lucifer</hi> stand in

The Depth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. When the Royall Body of <hi>Lucifer</hi> was incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
or compacted together, in that very <hi>Hour</hi>
the Light kindled it self also in <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:61095:167"/>
5. For as soon as his qualifying or fountain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in the framing of the Body <hi>began</hi> to qualifie or
operate, and to generate themselves, according to
the right of Nature, <hi>then</hi> rose up the flash of life
in the heart in the sweet spring or fountain water,
and so the Royall Body was <hi>ready furnished or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,</hi>
and the spirit went forth in the heart from
the light through the mouth <hi>into</hi> the Heart of
God.</p>
               <p>6. And so he was a most exceeding beautifull
Prince and King, and very <hi>dear</hi> and acceptable to
the Divine Being, and was received and <hi>embraced</hi>
with great Joy.</p>
               <p>7. In like manner also the spirit <hi>went forth</hi> from
the heart into all qualifying or fountain veins of the
Body, and kindled all the seven spirits, and so the
Royall Body was glorified <hi>in the twinkling of an Eye,</hi>
and there he stood as a King of God, in an unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
clarity, or Brightnesse, transcendently <hi>excelling</hi>
the whole heavenly Hoast or Army.</p>
               <p>8. Now in this clear and light flash the seven
qualifying or fountain spirits were <hi>instantly</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                  </note> affected
as a man kindleth a fire, for they were affrighted at
the terrible clarity or brightnesse of their spirit, and
so instantly at the <hi>first</hi> flash <hi>suddenly</hi> became highly
triumphing rising aloft extream stately, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyful,
and so moved themselves towards a <hi>higher
Birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. But if they had <hi>continued</hi> in their seats, and
had qualified or operated, as<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>viz.</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven spirits of Nature which they were constituted of.</note> they had done from
eternity, then that high Light had <hi>not hurt</hi>
them.</p>
               <p>10. For they were <hi>not</hi> new spirits made of any
<hi>new</hi> thing, but they were the <hi>Old</hi> spirits, which had
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61095:167"/>
no beginning; which had been in God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and <hi>knew very well</hi> the Right of the Deity and
of Nature, <hi>how</hi> they should move and stir.</p>
               <p>11. Also when God figured or framed the Body
together, he did <hi>not</hi> aforehand destroy the qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain spirits, but figured or framed the
Body of King <hi>Lucifer</hi> together out of the kernel of
that which was the <hi>best,</hi> wherein was the best know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all.</p>
               <p>12. Else if the qualities had been dead aforehand,
they had had need of a new Life, and it wonld have
been in <hi>doubt,</hi> whether the Angels <hi>could</hi> have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
Eternally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conceive it aright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. God created Angels out of himself, therefore,
that they might be harder and dryer incorporated
or compacted together, then the Ideas, figures,
shapes or forms, which through the qualifying or
operating of the Spirits of God in Nature, rise up,
and also through the moving of the spirits <hi>vanish</hi> or
passe away again, that their light in their hardnesse
should shine the clearer and <hi>Brighter,</hi> and that the
Tone of the Body should sound the clearer and shril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
whereby the joyfulness should increase the more,
in God. <hi>This was the cause, that God
created Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. But that it is said, the Angel generated <hi>a
new Light,</hi> or <hi>a new Spirit,</hi> that, is thus to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,</p>
               <p>15. When the qualifying or fountain Spirits
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61095:168"/>
were incorporated or compacted together, then the
light shone much brighter and clearer in the Body,
and from or out of the body, <hi>then</hi> it did <hi>before,</hi> in the
<hi>Salitter;</hi> for there then rose up a much clearer and
brighter flash in the body, then before, whilest the
<hi>Salitter</hi> was Thin and Dim.</p>
               <p>16. And therefore the qualifying or fountain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
also became stately and Proud, and supposed
they had a <hi>much fairer</hi> little sonne or Light then the
Sonne of God was; and therefore they would also
the more earnestly and eagerly qualifie or operate,
and elevate themselves, and so despised the qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Acting which is in God their Father, and the
Birth of the Sonne of God, as also the <hi>Exit</hi> or going
forth of God the Holy Ghost; and supposed, <hi>they
could do it,</hi> because they were so gloriously incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
or compacted together, therefore they would
now <hi>exalt</hi> them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>elves gloriously and stately, and
shew forth themselves, as if they were the most fair
and Beautious <hi>Bride</hi> of Heaven.</p>
               <p>17. <hi>They knew very well,</hi> that they were not the
whole or Totall God, but were onely a <hi>piece</hi> or <hi>part</hi>
thereof; they also knew very well, how <hi>far</hi> their
Omnipotence reached or extended, and yet they
would no more have their <hi>Old</hi> condition, but would
be higher then the whole or <hi>Total God;</hi> and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
thereby they should have their place Region
Quarters or Court above the whole or Total Deity,
above <hi>all</hi> Kingdoms <hi>whatsoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. And therefore they elevated or extol'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

intending to kindle or <hi>enflame</hi> the whole God,
and to Govern or rule the whole God by their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and might. All forms and <hi>Ideas</hi> should rise up in

the qualifying and acting of their Spirit. He would

               <p>19. <hi>Now this is the Root of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse,

                  </note>
                  <hi>Wrath;</hi> For in the <hi>fierce</hi> qualifying or acting
and boyling, rose up the wrath, and burnt like fire
of Heat and Cold, and was also <hi>bitter</hi> as Gall.</p>
               <p>20. For the qualifying or fountain spirits had <hi>no
outward</hi> impulse upon them gotten into them, but the
impulse to Pride elevated it self <hi>within</hi> the Body, in
the councel of the seven qualifying or fountain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
these <hi>agreed</hi> and united in a compact, that they
would be God alone.</p>
               <p>21. But because they could not begin it in their
Old seat, and so bring it to effect, they therefore
<hi>dissembled</hi> or playd the Hypocrite together, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
one with another, and so combined, intending
to extoll themselves against the Birth of God, and
would needs qualifie or work in the <hi>highest depth,</hi> and
then nothing could be like them, being they were
together the <hi>most Mighty</hi> Prince in God.</p>
               <p>22. The Astringent quality was the <hi>first</hi> Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
flatterer and Hypocrite, for when it saw, that it
generated so fair and bright a Light, then it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
it self together <hi>yet harder,</hi> then God had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it to be, intending to be <hi>much more</hi> terrible, and
to draw together all in its whole Region Circuit or
circumference, and keep it <hi>fast</hi> as a <hi>stern</hi> severe
Lord:</p>
               <p>23. And so in a degree then it had Effected some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
from whence Earth and Stones have their <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal:</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:61095:169"/>
which I will write of, when I treat concerning
the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World.</p>
               <p>24. The Bitter Quality was the <hi>second</hi> Murtherer,
which when it rose up in the Flash, did <hi>tear</hi> with
breaking and great Power in the Astringent quality,
as if it would break the <hi>Body</hi> in pieces.</p>
               <p>25. And the astringent quality permitted it, or
else it was very well able to have <hi>stayd</hi> and captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Bitter spirit, and to bathe or <hi>steep</hi> it in the
sweer-water, till his high mind had been <hi>allayed</hi> and
gone: But it would needs have <hi>such a little Brother,</hi>
because it was so serviceable to its turn; Else, being
the bitter spirit <hi>taketh</hi> its original from it, as it were
from its Father, it could well have <hi>stopped</hi> or hindred
that.</p>
               <p>26. The Heat is the <hi>third</hi> Murtherous spirit, which
<hi>killed</hi> its Mother the <hi>sweet</hi> water, but the astringent
spirit is the cause thereof, for by its stern severe <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting</hi>
together and hardening, it hath thus vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
awakened and kindled the fire by the bitter
Quality: for the fire is the <hi>Sword</hi> of the astringent
and Bitter quality.</p>
               <p>27. But being the fire riseth up in the sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
therefore it self hath the <hi>whip</hi> or scourge in its
own power, and might have <hi>stayd</hi> or kept back the
astringent quality in the water, but it also became a
<hi>flatterer,</hi> or hypocrite, and dissembled with the <hi>great</hi>
quality, <hi>viz.</hi> the astringent, and did <hi>help</hi> to destroy
the sweet water.</p>
               <p>28. The Tone is the <hi>fourth</hi> Murtherer: for it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
its <hi>ringing</hi> sound in the fire in the sweet water,
and riseth up very gently and lovely in the <hi>whole</hi>
Body.</p>
               <p>29. Yet it did not so here, but after it was risen
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61095:169"/>
up in the water, in the astringent quality, it rose up
<hi>so furiously</hi> like a Thunder-Clap, whereby it would
prove and shew forth <hi>its New Deity:</hi> And so the fire
rose up, as when there is a <hi>Tempest</hi> of Lightning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
thereby to be <hi>so great,</hi> as to be above all
things in God.</p>
               <p>30. And this they practised so long, till they had
<hi>murthered</hi> their mother the sweet water: and therein
the whole <hi>Body</hi> became a dark valley, and there was
no more remedy or Council in God that could help
here: For, Love was turn'd into Emnity, and the
whole Body became a black dark

               <head>The wonderfull Revelation.</head>
               <p>33. Behold King <hi>Lucifer</hi> was the Head in his

was a <hi>mighty</hi> King, and was created out of the <hi>ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>
or marrow of his whole Region and circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
also he would fain have kindled that whole
circumference by his Elevating, that so all might
have burned and qualified, or operated <hi>as he</hi> did in
his own body.</p>
               <p>34. Though indeed the Deity without or distinct
from his Body, would have meekly and gently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
or <hi>acted</hi> towards him, and have <hi>enlightned</hi> and
exhorted him to <hi>Repentance;</hi> yet now there was no
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61095:170"/>
other will in <hi>Lucifer,</hi> but that he would <hi>needs</hi> rule
over the Sonne of God, and kindle that whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or circumference, and in such a way <hi>himself</hi>
would be the <hi>whole</hi> God, above and over all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Hoasts or Armies.</p>
               <p>35. Now when the Heart of God with his <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
and <hi>Love</hi> made haste toward <hi>Lucifer,</hi> he despised
it, and thought <hi>himself</hi> far better then it, and then
storm'd back again with fire and coldnesse in <hi>hard</hi>
Claps of Thunder <hi>against</hi> the Sonne of God, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
he must be in subjection under him, and that
He himself was <hi>Lord.</hi> For he <hi>despised</hi> the Light of

               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>36. Yes, he had; for he was a <hi>great part</hi> of the

thereof, for he made an <hi>attempt</hi> also upon that King

who at last <hi>fought</hi> with him, and overcame him, in
whom the power of God in <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s Kingdom
fought vehemently also against <hi>its</hi> King, till at last

               </p>
               <p>37. No! He would receive no other Light then
his own, for he <hi>scorn'd</hi> the Light of the Sonne of
God, which did shine without, distinct from his
Body, being he had such a <hi>glittering</hi> light in himself,
and so elevated himself more and more, till his
water—</p>
               <p>[<q>This here, is <hi>the water of eternal Life,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the Light of the Majestie, but in

               <p>Concerning the Fall of all his Angels.</p>
               <p>One might Ask.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How comes it, that at this time all his
Angels did fall also?</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:61095:171"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>38. As <hi>this</hi> Lord commanded, so <hi>his</hi> Subjects
obeyed: when he elevated himself, and would be
God, his Angels seeing it, <hi>follow'd</hi> their Lord,
doing as he did, all made a proffer to <hi>assault</hi> and storm
the Deity.</p>
               <p>39. For they were all in subjection under him,
and he ruled <hi>in all</hi> his Angels, for He was created
out of the Pith or kernel of that <hi>Salitter,</hi> out of which
his Angels were <hi>all</hi> created, and he was the Heart
and Lord of all his Angels.</p>
               <p>40. <hi>Therefore</hi> they all did as he did, and all
would sit in the Primacie of the Deity, and would
rule powerfully in the whole Region Circuit or
circumference, over and above the <hi>whole Divine</hi>
power: They were all of one <hi>will,</hi> and would not
suffer <hi>the same</hi> to be taken from them.</p>
               <p>Now thou wilt Ask.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did <hi>not</hi> the whole Total or Universal God <hi>know</hi>
this, before the time of the Creation of
Angels; that it would so come
to passe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41. <hi>No:</hi> for if God, had known it, before the time
of the Creation of Angels, it had then been an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>predestinate</hi> purposed will in God to have it so,
and it had been <hi>no Emnity</hi> against God, but God had
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61095:172"/>
indeed at the beginning created and made <hi>him</hi> a
Devil.</p>
               <p>42. But God did create and make him <hi>a King of
Light,</hi> and when he became disobedient and would
be above the whole or Total God; then God did
<hi>spew him out</hi> of his seat; and in the midst or <hi>Center</hi> of
<hi>our Time</hi> did create another King out of the <hi>same</hi>
Deity, out of which Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> was Created:
[understand it a right; out of the <hi>Salitter,</hi> which was
without <hi>distinct</hi> from the Body of King <hi>Lucifer:]</hi>
and did set him on the Royal Throne of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and
did give him might authority and Power, as <hi>Lucifer</hi>
had, before his Fall.</p>
               <p>43. And the same King is called
<hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> and is the
Sonne of God and of Man.</p>
               <p>44. And this I will demonstrate clearly and at
Large in its proper Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>[45. This is explained in the Second and Third
Book: God knew this very well according
to his <hi>wrath,</hi> but <hi>not</hi> according to his
<hi>Love,</hi> according to which, <hi>God</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is there
any searching in the Love concerning the
<hi>Hellish</hi> Creature.</p>
                  <p>46. This foregoing <hi>Question</hi> is thus understood or
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61095:172"/>
meant; as when I say; <hi>God knoweth
not the Evil;</hi> Also <hi>God willeth not
the Evil,</hi> according to the Tenure of the
Scripture, then I understand, or mean,
that in his Love (which alone is the one
onely<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>or</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> 
                     <hi>Good,</hi> and is alone called <hi>God;)</hi>
there is <hi>no</hi> glimpse of Evil revealed or
manifested; otherwise if any evill were
revealed or manifested therein, then the
Love were not the Eternal <hi>Meeknesse</hi>
and <hi>Humility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>47. But in the outspeaking of his word, wherein the
Nature of the spiritual World existeth,
wherein perceptibility or Sensibility is
understood to consist, and wherein <hi>God
calleth himself an angry</hi> zealous or
<hi>Jealous God, and a consuming fire:</hi>
Therein indeed God <hi>hath known the
Evil</hi> from eternity, and that in ease
he should once move himself<note n="†" place="margin">in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which he is called a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming fire.</note> therein,
that the source or Quality thereof, would
become creaturely also, but therein is he
<hi>not called God,</hi> but a consuming
fire.</p>
                  <p>48. I understand the abovesaid Question magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
taking notice how <hi>Gods Love</hi> and
<hi>wrath</hi> differ, and are distinguished, and
how the Knowledge of Evil, viz, of <hi>the
Devil and Fall is</hi> discerned to differ
from his well-spring or source, from
whence the <hi>Fall</hi> also took its <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>49. And so also in Gods <hi>Love</hi> there is onely the
fountain and knowledge of <hi>Joyfulnesse,</hi>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:61095:173"/>
for every Science or Root causeth or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
its like.</p>
                  <p>50. For if I should say, Gods <hi>Love</hi> had willed
the <hi>Evil,</hi> or that there were<note n="*" place="margin">Text <hi>Scientz.</hi>
                     </note> a <hi>false</hi>
Science or Root in Gods Love and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
then I should speak contrary to the
Scripture: for what Gods love knoweth
<hi>sensibly or</hi> feelingly in it self, that it
also willeth, and nothing else.</p>
                  <p>51. From hence, in the Creation, <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi>
is existed: and I exhort the Reader to
conceive our very deep sense aright, and
not mistake or go astray here, but to read

ought also to come before <hi>this Glasse;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>55. But I marvel, that God should reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thus fully to such a <hi>silly</hi> Man, and that he thus
<hi>impelleth</hi> him also to set it down in writing: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there are many <hi>learned</hi> Writers, which could
set it forth and expresse it better in a more <hi>flourishing</hi>
style, and demonstrate it more exactly and fully
then I, that am but a <hi>scorn</hi> and <hi>Fool</hi> to the world.</p>
               <p>56. But I neither can nor will oppose him: for I
often stood in great striving <hi>against him,</hi> that if it
were not his impulse and will, that he would be

               <p>57. But I am climb'd up and mounted so very

have no giddinesse at all; but when I look back, and
would return, <hi>then</hi> am I giddy, and afraid to fall.</p>
               <p>58. Therefore have I put my confidence in the

               </p>
               <p>60. <hi>Sinne</hi> hath <hi>Seven</hi> kinds
forms species or sorts; among which there are
<hi>four</hi> speciall wellsprings or sources: and the
<hi>Eighth</hi> Kind or Sort is the <hi>House of

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>61. The <hi>Seven Forms</hi> are the seven qualifying or
fountain spirits of the Body; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Astringent</hi>
Quality, the <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Bitter,</hi> the <hi>Heat,</hi> the <hi>Sound,</hi>
the Love, the <hi>Nature</hi> or beginning from the other
Six: And when these are kindled, Each spirit gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
a <hi>several</hi> Emnity against God.</p>
               <p>62. Out of these Seven are generated <hi>other four</hi>
new sonnes, and they together are the <hi>new God,</hi> which
is wholly against the <hi>old God,</hi> as two professed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Enemies, which have sworn Eternal Emnity
one against the other.</p>
               <p>The first Sonne is Pride.</p>
               <p>The second Sonne is Covetousnesse.</p>
               <p>The third Sonne is Envy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:61095:174"/>
The fourth Sonne is Wrath.</p>
               <p>63. Now let us view these in the Ground, from
whence <hi>all</hi> hath its Original, and see how it is an
Emnity against God: and therein you will see, what
is the beginning and <hi>Root of Sin,</hi> and wherefore <hi>in
God</hi> it <hi>cannot</hi> be suffered or endured.</p>
               <p>64. Therefore come on ye <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi>
you that will maintain and undertake to prove
it, that God also created the <hi>Evill,</hi> and that he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the same; also that it is his <hi>predestinate</hi> purpose,
that the <hi>Devil fell,</hi> and that many <hi>Men</hi> are <hi>Damned;</hi>
else he could have altered all, and turned it some
other way.</p>

               <head>Of the First Kind or Form.</head>
               <p>70. The <hi>first</hi> spirit is the <hi>Astringent</hi> or Harsh
Quality, which in God is a gentle attracting or
drawing together, a drying and cooling or refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and is made use of in and for the Imaging or
framing of things, and though in its Depth it be
somewhat Sharp or <hi>Tart,</hi> yet it tempereth it self
with the <hi>sweet water,</hi> so that it is meek soft pleasant
and full of Joy.</p>
               <p>71. And when the light of the sweet water com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<hi>into it,</hi> then it willingly, friendlily and freely
<hi>yeeldeth</hi> up its birth thereunto, and maketh it dry,
and shining <hi>Bright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>72. And when the Tone or <hi>Tune</hi> riseth up in the
Light, then it also giveth up its Tone Tune and ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sound very <hi>gently</hi> and brotherly thereunto.</p>
               <p>73. Also it receiveth the <hi>Love</hi> from all the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:61095:175"/>
74. Also the <hi>Heat</hi> favoureth it, giving way friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it may be cooled, and so it is a friendly will,
in and with <hi>all</hi> the Qualities; It readily helpeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to Image or frame the spirit of <hi>Nature,</hi> and to form
therein all manner of shapes, figures, fruits and
Growths or vegetations according to the <hi>will</hi> of all
the six spirits.</p>
               <p>75. It is a very <hi>humble</hi> Father to its children, and
loveth them <hi>heartily,</hi> and playeth with them friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for it is the right <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>other six</hi> spirits,
which are generated in it, and it helps to generate
them all.</p>
               <p>76. Now when God constituted <hi>Lucifer</hi> with his
Hoast or Army, he created them out of <hi>this</hi> friendly
Deity, out of himself, out of the Place of Heaven
and of this wotld, there was no other matter to
make them of, this living <hi>Salitter</hi> was very gently and
softly attracted or drawn together without any <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
or slaying it, or without any <hi>great</hi> stirring or
motion.</p>
               <p>77. These Spirits thus incorporated or compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together had the knowledge, the skill and the
eternal infinite er beginning lesse <hi>Law,</hi> of God, and
knew full well, I. How the Deity had generated
them.</p>
               <p>78. II. They knew also well, that the heart of
God had the <hi>Primacie</hi> in the whole Deity: III. They
knew well also, that they had no more for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
own, to deal with and to <hi>dispose of,</hi> then their
own compacted incorporated <hi>Body;</hi> for they saw
very well, that the Deity generated it self without,
severally distinctly, apart from their body, as it had
done <hi>from Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>79. IIII. They knew likewise very well, that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61095:176"/>
they were not the <hi>whole</hi> Room or Place; But were
therein to encrease the Joy and wonderful propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
variety and <hi>Harmony</hi> of that same place, and
were to <hi>accord,</hi> qualifie and act friendlily with that
Room or Place of the Deity, and friendlily affect the
Qualities, that are without distinct from their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>80. V. They had also <hi>all power</hi> to dispose of all
the Ideas, figures and growths or vegetations, as they
would, all was a hearty Love-play Sport or <hi>Scene</hi> in
God, they had not at all moved God their <hi>Creator</hi>
to any contrary will, though they had <hi>broken</hi> all the
heavenly Ideas figures or vegetations and growths,
and had made of them all, <hi>Horses to Ride on;</hi> God
had still alwaies cause enough of <hi>other,</hi> to come up
instead of them, for it had all <hi>been</hi> but a play or
Scene in God.</p>
               <p>81. For to that very <hi>End</hi> also they were created,
that they should play and sport with the Ideas,
figures and growths or vegetations, and <hi>dispose</hi> of
them for their <hi>own</hi> use as they pleased.</p>
               <p>82. For, the Ideas or figures have in a manner fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

               </p>
               <p>83. Thou hast a very good <hi>Example</hi> and Instance

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now: What did the Astringent or harsh
quality, do in <hi>Lucifer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>84. When God had thus <hi>gently</hi> incorporated it or
compacted it together, then it found and felt it self
to be mighty and powerful, and saw that it retained
a <hi>Body</hi> as fair and excellent, as the figures were that
were without distinct from it: <hi>thereupon</hi> it became
high minded, and elevated it self in its Body, and
would be more severe and eager, then the <hi>Salitter</hi>
was, which was without distinct from its Body.</p>
               <p>85. But being<note n="†" place="margin">the Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or harsh Spirit.</note> it could not do any thing <hi>alone,</hi>
it <hi>flattered</hi> and playd the hypocrite with the other
Spirits, so that they followed it as their <hi>Father,</hi> and
did all as they saw it do, each in its own Quality.</p>
               <p>86. Now being thus agreed, they generated also
<hi>such</hi> a spirit which did come forth at the Mouth, at
the Eyes, at the Ears and at the Nostrils, and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or <hi>mixed</hi> it self with the <hi>Salitter</hi> that was without
distinct from the Body;</p>
               <p>87. For, the intent and purpose of the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or harsh quality, being it was so glorious,
when the kernel was incorporated or compacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
out of the whole Kingdome, <hi>viz.</hi> its intent was,
that it also through <hi>its</hi> spirit, which it did generate
by or with the other spirits, would rule powerfully
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:61095:177"/>
with the sharpnesse Externally without its own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in the whole <hi>Salitter</hi> of God, and that all should
stand and be in or under its <hi>own</hi> Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>88. It would Image frame and form all through
its own spirit, which it <hi>generated;</hi> as the whole
Deity did, It would have the <hi>Primacie</hi> in the whole
Deity: This was its purpose.</p>
               <p>89. But being it could not effect it in its true <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
seat, it thereupon elevated it self, and kindled
it self.</p>
               <p>90. And so by this kindling it kindled its <hi>spirit</hi>
also, which now went forth at the Mouth, the Ears,
the Eyes and the Nostrils as a very fierce <hi>furious</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and strove against the <hi>Salitter</hi> in its place, as a
furious storming raging Lord, and kindled the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litter,</hi>
and attracted or drew all forcibly together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou must understand it aright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>91. The astringent or harsh Quality in the spirit
that <hi>went forth,</hi> kindled the astringent or harsh Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which was in the Place of its <hi>Region,</hi> or in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the seventh qualifying or fountain Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and ruled powerfully in the astringent quality
in the <hi>Salitter,</hi> and that, the Astringent Quality
in the <hi>Salitter</hi> would not have, but strove with the
sweet water against this spirit, but all would <hi>not</hi>
help, the storm grew hotter and hotter, the longer
the greater, till at length the astringent or harsh
Quality of the <hi>Salitter</hi> was kindled.</p>
               <p>92. And so when this was done, then the storm
grew <hi>so hot,</hi> that the astringent quality drew the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litter</hi>
together, so that <hi>hard stones</hi> proceeded from it,
whence the stones in <hi>this</hi> world have their Original:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61095:177"/>
And the water in the <hi>Salitter</hi> was also attracted or
drawn together, so that it became very thick, as it
is now at present in this world.</p>
               <p>93. But when the astringent quality was kindled
in <hi>Lucifer,</hi> then it became very Cold: for the <hi>Coldnesse</hi>
is its own proper spirit, and thereupon now it kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth
with its cold fire also, all, in the <hi>Salitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>94. And hence the water of this world became
so cold dark and thick, and hence it is that all is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so hard and palpable, which was <hi>not</hi> so before
the Times of the Angels.</p>
               <p>95. Aud this now was a great contrary will in
the <hi>Divine Salitter,</hi> a great Battel and strife, and an
Eternall <hi>Emnity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now thou wilt say:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God should have withstood him, that it
might not have come so far.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>96. O, Dear Blind Man! it was not a Man nor a
Beast that stood here before God; But it was <hi>God</hi>
against <hi>God;</hi> one strong one against another: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
How should God withstand him? with the
friendly <hi>Love?</hi> that could not avail, for, <hi>Lucifer</hi> did
but <hi>scorn</hi> and dispise <hi>that,</hi> and would himself be
God.</p>
               <p>97. Should God withstand him then with Anger
or Wrath, which indeed must be done at <hi>length;</hi>
then God must have kindled himself in his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the <hi>Salitter,</hi> wherein King <hi>Lucifer</hi> dwelt, and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61095:178"/>
must in the strong zeal or Jealousie strive and fight
against him, which he did: and so this striving made
this kingdom so dark <hi>waste</hi> and evil, that another
Creation must <hi>needs</hi> afterwards follow upon it.</p>
               <p>98. Ye Philosophers and <hi>Jurists</hi> or Lawyers of
Prince <hi>Lucifer,</hi> here you must first defend the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or harsh quality in <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and <hi>answer</hi> whether
it hath dealt righteously or <hi>no,</hi> and prove it in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I do not <hi>accept</hi> of your extorted wrested bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
stretch'd and far-fetch'd Texts of Scripture,
<hi>brought in</hi> by head and shoulders for a <hi>proof,</hi> but I
will have living Testimonies.</p>
               <p>99. And I will set before you also <hi>living</hi> Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<hi>viz.</hi> the created and comprehensible Heaven,
the Stars, the Elements, the Creatures, the Earth,
Stones, Men, and lastly your dark, cold, hot, hard,
rough smoaky wicked Prince <hi>Lucifer</hi> himself: <hi>all
these</hi> are come into this present condition, through
his <hi>elevation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>100. Here bring in your <hi>defence,</hi> and answer for
your spirit; if not, it will be condemned. For this
is God <hi>Jus</hi> Right or Law, which hath no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the child, which is generated of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
should be <hi>Humble</hi> before the mother, and be
obedient to her; for it hath its life and Body from
the <hi>mother,</hi> who hath generated it.</p>
               <p>101. Also the <hi>house</hi> of the Mother, as long as the
mother liveth, is not the childs proper own; but the
mother keeps the child with her in love, she nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, and putteth on it the best and bravest <hi>Attire</hi>
which she hath, and giveth the same to it for its
<hi>own,</hi> that her joy may be encreased by the child, and
that she may have <hi>Joy</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>102. But when the child <hi>rebelleth</hi> and resisteth
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61095:178"/>
against the mother, and takes away all from the
mother, and <hi>domineers</hi> over her, and moreover stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
at her, and forceth her to change into a <hi>low</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
contrary to Right and Equity: then it is but
<hi>Just,</hi> that the child should be expell'd out of the
house, and left to sit behind the <hi>Hedge,</hi> and quite
lose its childs portion and Inheritance.</p>
               <p>103. And <hi>thus</hi> it was between God and his child
<hi>Lucifer.</hi> The Father did put on him the fairest At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
<hi>hoping</hi> to have Joy in him: But when the child
got the <hi>Robe</hi> and Ornament, he despised the Father,
and would <hi>domineer</hi> over the Father, and would
ruine his Fathers house; and besides, struck at the
Father, and would not be <hi>advised</hi> or taught to do
otherwise.</p>

               <head>Of the second Species form sort or spirit, of
Sins beginning, in Lucifer.</head>
               <p>104. The <hi>Second</hi> Spirit is the <hi>Water:</hi> And as
the astringent or harsh quality is the <hi>Father</hi> of the
other six spirits, which attracteth or draweth
them together, and so <hi>holds</hi> them: so the sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the <hi>Mother,</hi> in which all spirits are conceived,

               <p>105. Thus King <hi>Lucifer</hi> in the same manner did
get the sweet water for his corporeal Government,
and indeed the very kernel and <hi>Best</hi> thereof. For
God put on to his little sonne the Best Onrament,

                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what did this <hi>astringent</hi> or harsh Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with its <hi>Mother</hi> the sweet
Water?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>106. It flattered with the <hi>Bitter</hi> Quality, and
with the <hi>Heat,</hi> and perswaded them that they should
elevate themselves and be <hi>kindled,</hi> and so together
they would destroy their mother, and turn her into
a <hi>sour</hi> form or property, whereby they would do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer
with their spirit very sharply, over the <hi>whole</hi>

they would form frame figure and image all with
their <hi>sharpnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>107. According to this false or wicked conclusion,
and result they <hi>agreed</hi> to do one and the same thing,
and so <hi>dryed up</hi> the sweet water in <hi>Lucifer's</hi> Body, the
heat kindled it, and the astringent dryed it, and then
it became very sour and <hi>sharp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>108. And when in this qualifying or acting they
had generated the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> then the <hi>life</hi> of
the spirit, which riseth up in the water, as also the
<hi>light,</hi> became very sour and sharp.</p>
               <p>109. And now this sour spirit also <hi>stormed</hi> with
all its powers against the sweet water, which was
without distinct from the Body, in Gods <hi>Salitter,</hi> and
thought, it <hi>self</hi> must needs be the Prime and chief,
and should in its <hi>own</hi> power, from frame and Image
every thing.</p>
               <p>110. And this was the <hi>Second Emnity</hi> against God,
from whence is existed the <hi>sour</hi> quality in this
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61095:179"/>
world, for it was not so from Eternity; as you have
an <hi>Example</hi> thereof in this; <hi>viz.</hi> if you set any <hi>sweet</hi>
thing in the <hi>warmth,</hi> and let it stand therein, it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>sowr</hi> of it self: as also Water, Beer or Wine in
a vessell will do; but none of the other qualities do
alter, but only into a <hi>stinck,</hi> which is caused by the
Quality of Water.</p>
               <p>Now thou wilt Ask:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why did God suffer Lucifers <hi>Evil spirit</hi> which
proceeded out of the Body of Lucifer, to
come <hi>into Him?</hi> could he <hi>not</hi>
hinder it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>111. Thou must know, that betwixt God and
Lucifer there was no other difference, then there is
between <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>their Children;</hi> nay, there was
yet a <hi>nearer</hi> relation between them: For as Parents
generate a child out of their Body according to their
Image, and keep it in their house, as a natural <hi>Heir</hi>
of their Bodies, and cherish it: thus near also is
the <hi>Body</hi> of Lucifer to the Deity.</p>
               <p>112. For God had generated him out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and therefore also made him the <hi>Heir</hi> of his
Goods, and gave him the whole Region or Extent
of the place in which he created him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:61095:180"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The highest Depth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>113. But here thou must know, what it was, that
<hi>Lucifer</hi> did fight against God <hi>with,</hi> and so <hi>moved God
to Anger.</hi> For, he could <hi>not</hi> do it with his Body: for
his Body reached no further, then the place, where
he then stood; he could Effect <hi>little</hi> with that, but it
was <hi>something else.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be attentive here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>114. The spirit, which is generated from or out
of all the seven qualifying Spirits in the <hi>Centre</hi> of
the Heart; the same doth (while it is yet in the
Body, when it is generated) qualifie mix or <hi>act</hi> in
and with God, as one substance or thing, neither is
there any difference.</p>
               <p>115. And when that <hi>same Spirit,</hi> which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the Body, seeth any thing through the Eyes,
or neareth through the Ears, or smelleth through
the Nostrills, then it is already in <hi>that thing,</hi> and
worketh laboureth or acteth therein as in its own
propriety.</p>
               <p>116. And if the same be <hi>pleasing</hi> to it, it eateth
thereof, and is <hi>affected</hi> with the thing, and wrestleth
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>erewith, and maketh a mixture or <hi>Temper</hi> together:
let the thing be as far off as it will, even so far as the
<hi>Originality</hi> of its Kingdom, in God, reacheth; so far
can the Spirit govern or rule in a <hi>Moment,</hi> and is
withheld or hindred by Nothing.</p>
               <p>117. For it is, and comprehendeth the <hi>Power,</hi> as
God the Holy Ghost doth; and in this there is no
difference at all betwixt God the Holy Ghost, and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61095:180"/>
the Spirit of the Body, <hi>save onely</hi> this, that the Holy
Spirit of God, is the <hi>whole fulnesse,</hi> and the spirit of
the Body is but a <hi>Piece,</hi> or <hi>Part,</hi> which presseth through
the whole Fulnesse, and where ever it cometh, there
it is mixed or <hi>affected</hi> with the place, and presently
ruleth <hi>with</hi> God in the same place.</p>
               <p>118. For it is of God and in God, and cannot be
withheld or hindred, save onely by the <hi>seven</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-spirits
of the Body, which generate the anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or Soulish spirit; they have the <hi>Reins</hi> in their
Hand, and generate it as they please.</p>
               <p>[<q>Gods Spirit hath all the qualities fountains or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/>
sources, but distinguisheth it self in three
Principles, where three sources or qualities
arise, the first in the <hi>fire</hi> according to the
first principle, and the second in the <hi>light</hi>
in the second principle, and the third in the
<hi>spirit</hi> of this world in the <hi>Aeriall</hi> and
Astrall source:</q>]</p>
               <p>119. When the astringent or harsh quality; as
the <hi>Father,</hi> formeth the Word or <hi>Sonne,</hi> or Spirit,
then it stands captive in the Center of the Heart,
and is examined or <hi>tryed</hi> by the other spirits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be good or no. Now if it please the fire, then
the fire letteth the <hi>flash</hi> (in which the Bitter spirit
standeth) go through the <hi>sweet</hi> water, wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
the <hi>Love,</hi> and goeth therewith into the
astringent Quality.</p>
               <p>120. Now when the flash returns with the Love
into the astringent quality again, together with the
<hi>new</hi> generated spirit or <hi>will;</hi> then the astringent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<hi>rejoyceth</hi> in the New young Sonne, and elevateth
it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:61095:181"/>
121. Then the <hi>Tone</hi> layes hold thereon, and goeth
forth therewith at the Mouth, Eyes, Ears, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strills,
and executeth that which is decreed in the
councel of the seven spirits: for as the <hi>Decree</hi> of the
Councel is, so also is the spirit; and the <hi>Councel</hi> can
alter the same, as it will.</p>
               <p>122. Therefore the original Lust sticketh in the
circle of the Heart, in the <hi>Councel</hi> of the seven spirits;
and as they generate the spirit, so also it is.</p>
               <p>123. And so in this manner Lord Lucifer brought
the <hi>Deity</hi> into Anger and Wrath:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/>[<q>that is, Kindled the <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> according

               <p>Being he, together with all his Angels, as a <hi>malicious

to bring and subdue the <hi>whole</hi> Circumference Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit

               </p>
               <p>Then thou wilt say:</p>

are so hard and Evill, that they are not
suitable to or capable of the Deity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>126. Yes, dear Man, all this is true; The wrath
of God is certainly <hi>every where</hi> all over, In Silver,
Gold, Stones, Fields, Garments, Beasts and Men,
and all whatsoever is comprehensible and palpable;
otherwise they would not be so hard and harsh to
be felt as they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:61095:182"/>
127. But thou must know; that the <hi>kernel</hi> of Love
also, sticketh in all in the hidden Center, unlesse it
be too too altogether Evill, and <hi>so</hi> Evill a thing Man
hath <hi>no</hi> liking to at all, neither.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <q>God possesseth <hi>all,</hi> onely, as to <hi>Nature</hi>
He is not the <hi>essence,</hi> He possesseth <hi>himself.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Or dost thou think thou dost well, if thou bathest or
soakest thy self in Gods wrath? take heed, that it
doth <hi>not kindle</hi> thy Body and Soul, and so thou wilt
<hi>burn</hi> therein eternally, as befell <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>128. But when God shall bring forth the hidden
things, at the End of this time, then you will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
in what Gods love or wrath hath <hi>been.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have a care, and take heed, and <hi>turn</hi> thy Eyes

thy self into <hi>Perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>129. I take Heaven and Earth
to witnesse, that I have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here, as God hath revealed it
to me, that it is his Will.</p>
               <p>130. Thus hath King <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in his body turned
the sweet water into a sowr sharpnesse, intending
therewith, in his haughty-mindednesse, to <hi>rule</hi> in the
<hi>whole</hi> Deity.</p>
               <p>131. And he hath brought it so far to passe, that,
in this world, with that sharpnesse he reacheth <hi>into</hi>
the <hi>heart</hi> of all living Creatures, as also into vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
leaves and grasse, and into all other things, as
a King and Prince of this world.</p>
               <p>132. And if the Divine Love were <hi>not yet</hi> in the

            </argument>
            <p>1.
THe third Spirit in God is the <hi>Bitter</hi> Spirit,
which existeth in the flash of Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the
flash of Life riseth up in the sweet water
through the rubbing or <hi>fretting</hi> of the
astringent and hot quality: but the body of the flash
abideth in the sweet water, subsisting very meekly
as a <hi>Light</hi> or heart, and the flash is very trembling,
and by the terrour, and fire, and water, and astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
spirit, it becometh bitter through the <hi>original</hi>
of the water, in which it riseth up.</p>
            <p>2. And that flash or raging terrour, or bitter spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is caught or laid hold on by the astringent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in the clear bright light in the astringent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is <hi>Glorified,</hi> and exceeding highly Joyfull: which
now is the mobility or the root of life, which in the
astringent quality Imageth frameth and formeth the
Word, or maketh it <hi>distinct</hi> or severall, so that in
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61095:183"/>
the body, a Thought or Will doth exist.</p>
            <p>3. Now this highly triumphing and Joyous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is very fitly and excellently, in the Divine <hi>Salit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
used to the Imaging or framing; because it chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moveth in the tone or Tune, and in the Love, and
is <hi>nearest</hi> to the heart of God in the Birth, and bound
or united therewith in joy, which indeed is it self
also the spring and source of Joy, or the <hi>rising up</hi> in
the heart of God.</p>
            <p>4. And there is no difference here but onely such
as is between the Body and Soul in Man: and so
the <hi>Body</hi> signifieth or Resembleth the seven qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spirits of the Father; and the <hi>Soul</hi> signifieth or
Resembleth the onely begotten Sonne of God the
Father.</p>
            <q>[The <hi>spirit</hi> of the Soul signifieth <hi>or representeth</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="a"/>
the <hi>Heart</hi> of God; and the <hi>Soul,</hi> the Eye of
God in the first principle: as is declared in
our Third Book, concerning the Threefold Life
of Man:]</q>
            <p>5. Now as the Body generateth the soul, so the
seven Spirits of God generate the Sonne: and as the
Soul is a peculiar <hi>distinct</hi> thing when it is generated,
and yet is <hi>united</hi> with the Body, and cannot subsist
without the Body; so also is the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, when
he is generated, a peculiar severall distinct <hi>thing</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and yet cannot subsist without the <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Just in such a Kind and manner was also the
bitter quality in Lucifer, and had no cause to elevate
it self, neither had it <hi>any driving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to it from any thing,
but followed the proud loftinesse of the astringent
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61095:184"/>
quality, as its Father, and supposed also, it would
reign in <hi>its</hi> kind and manner over the whole Deity,
and so kindled it self in its elevation.</p>
            <p>7. Now when it had <hi>half</hi> generated the animated
or soulish spirit in the Body, that spirit became in
this kind and manner a fierce, stinging, raging, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled,
and tearing spirit, bitter as <hi>Gall,</hi> and is rightly
the Quality of Hell fire, a very fierce and Enimici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
hostile Being.</p>
            <p>8. Now when this spirit in the animated or sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
spirit out of or from the heart of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and
his Legions, roved <hi>[or speculated]</hi> into the Deity;
<q>
                  <hi>[that is, brought its will thereinto, as into the</hi> Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix:</q>]
then it was no other but a tearing, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
murthering and poisonous <hi>burning:</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which Christ said; <hi>The Devil is a Liar and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
from the beginning; and hath not continued in
the truth,</hi> Joh. 8. 44.</p>
            <p>9. But <hi>Lucifer</hi> intended, by that means, to be
above God, none could domineer and rule so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
as himself, all must stoop to him; he would
with his spirit in the whole Deity, Rule as a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
King over all; being he was the fairest and <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullest,</hi>
he would needs <hi>also</hi> be the most <hi>Potent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. But he saw and knew very well the meek
and <hi>humble</hi> Being, in God his Father: moreover he
knew also very well, that it stood in such meeknesse
from eternity, and that he also should generate in
such meeknesse, as a loving and <hi>obedient</hi> Sonne.</p>
            <p>11. But now being he was so beautiously and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
Imaged or formed as a King in Nature, his
beautious form and feature tickled him, and so he
thought with himself, <hi>I am now God;</hi> and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61095:184"/>
formed or framed out of God; who can vanquish
me; or who can alter or change me? I <hi>myself</hi> will
be Lord; and with my sharpnesse rule in all things,
and my <hi>Body</hi> shall be the Image, which shall be
worshipped; I will prepare and erect for my self a
<hi>new</hi> Kingdom: for the whole circumference Extent
or Region is mine, <hi>I am God alone,</hi> and none else.</p>
            <p>12. And in his pride he struck and smote himself
with darknesse and blindnesse, and made himself a
<hi>Devill,</hi> and that he must be and abide so <hi>Eternally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<q>He knew in God, onely the <hi>Majestie,</hi> and not the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="c"/>
                  <hi>Word</hi> in the Center, which hath the Fanne
or Casting shovell: He blinded himself with
the <hi>astringent</hi> darknesse; for he would needs
inflame himself, and rule in the fire over the
light, and over the Meeknesse:</q>]</p>
            <p>13. Now when these Evil Devillish Spirits [un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Center of the Genitrix:] moved or boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Gods <hi>Salitter,</hi> and Imagined Speculated or
roved thereinto, then there was nothing but stinging,
burning, murthering, Robbing, and a meer Opposite
or contrary will.</p>
            <p>14. For the Heart of God delighted in Love and
<hi>meeknesse;</hi> and <hi>Lucifer</hi> would needs turn the same by
force into a Raging Tyranny: And so there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Emnity and a contrary or Opposite will;
for by force he kindled the <hi>Salitter</hi> of God, which
had <hi>rested</hi> from Eternity and stood in its Meeknesse.</p>
            <p>15. Concerning this kindling in this circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or Extent, it is, that God calls himself <hi>an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Zealous or Jealous God, against those that hate him,</hi>
Exod. 20. 5. Deut. 5. 9. that is, against those, who
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61095:185"/>
kindle his wrath and <hi>fiercenesse yet more,</hi> with their
<hi>diabolical</hi> spirits, with swearing, cursing, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and all manner of furious fiercenesse and
wrath, which <hi>sticketh</hi> in the Heart, with pride, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse,
envy, and Anger; all that, whatsoever
is in thee, thou castest into God; <q>
                  <hi>[that is, into the</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="d"/> Genitrix <hi>of Nature, and therefore that must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and tryed through the fire, and the Soul's spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and the</hi> wickednesse <hi>or malice must abide and
remain in the Fire:]</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now thou Askest:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can that be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. When thou openest thy Eyes, and feest the
<note n="†" place="margin">Which is every where in this world in every Creature.</note> Being of God; then thou <hi>prickest,</hi> as it were with
Thorns, into the Being of God, and movest or stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
up the Wrath and Anger of God.</p>
            <p>17. And when a Tone or Noise soundeth in thy
<hi>Ears,</hi> so that thou receivest or catchest it up from
the Being of God; then thou infectest it, as if thou
didst dart Thunder-Claps into it.</p>
            <p>18. Consider what thou dost with thy <hi>Nostrills,</hi>
and with thy <hi>Mouth,</hi> whence thy dear newborn little
sonne rusheth forth with thy speech, as a little sonne
of all the seven spirits, and observe whether it doth
not <hi>storm</hi> and assault in Gods <hi>Salitter,</hi> as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did?
O! there is no difference at all in this.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>But again on the other side, God saith;</hi> I am
a merciful God to those that love me; Those I will do good
to, and blesse them, to a thousand Generations, <hi>Exod. 20.
6. Deut.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <pb n="341" facs="tcp:61095:185"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Here Observe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. And such are those, who contrary to the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
wrath-fire, do with their <hi>Love,</hi> meeknesse, and
industrious earnest yernings and <hi>kindlings</hi> of love,
with their prayers <hi>Quench</hi> the wrath-fire, and presse
on against the kindled fiercenesse.</p>
            <p>21. And here indeed is many a hard Blow or
Crushing: for the kindled wrath-fire of God falls
many times so heavy upon them, that they know
not <hi>where</hi> to bestow themselves; heavy Mountains
lye upon them, the <hi>Love-Crosse</hi> presseth sore, and is
heavy.</p>
            <p>22. But this is their Comfort and <hi>Strong
Helmet</hi> against the fiercenesse, and the kindled
fire; according as the Kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> saith,
<hi>To the</hi> Honest or <hi>the upright the light riseth up in the
darknesse,</hi> Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 112. 4.</p>
            <p>23. And in this strife and fight against the wrath
of God, and the kindled fiercenesse of the <hi>Devils,</hi>
and of all <hi>wicked</hi> Men; the Light riseth up in the
heart of the Honest and upright; and the friendly
Love of God <hi>embraceth</hi> him, that he may not despair
in his Crosse; but strive further still against the
wrath and fiercenesse.</p>
            <p>24. If there were not at all times some honest
upright Men on Earth, who <hi>quench</hi> the wrath of
God with their opposing; the Hellish fire had kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
self long ago; and then it would have well
been seen <hi>where</hi> Hell is, which men do <hi>not</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>25. But thus saith the Spirit; assoon as the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61095:186"/>
overcometh the opposition of love in this
world, then the <hi>fire</hi> kindleth it self, and then there
is <hi>no</hi> more <hi>time</hi> in this world.</p>
            <p>26. <hi>But, that the fiercenesse doth terribly burn
now at present, it needs no proof here, for it is
known as clear as the Day, by</hi> wofull experience.
Behold there riseth up yet, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fire, in the opposition against
the wrath, out of a singular espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Love-restraint of God: when
this groweth weak also, then is the
End of this Time.</p>
            <p>27. But whether <hi>Lucifer</hi> hath done rightly, in
that he hath awakened and stirr'd up the fiercenesse
in the <hi>Salitter</hi> of God, whence this world is become
Stinging, Venomous, Thorny, Rocky, Envious and
Evill false or wicked; let the <hi>Atturneys,</hi> Proctors,
Advocates, and defenders of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> answer plead
and justifie it if they can; if <hi>not,</hi> then this third <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
stinging venomous spirit shall be <hi>condemned</hi>
also.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Fourth Kind Species form or manner of Sin's
beginning in Lucifer.</head>
               <p>28. The Fourth Spirit of God is <hi>Heat,</hi> which is
generated between the bitter and astringent quality,
and is conceived or bred in the sweet water, and is
<hi>shining</hi> and giving light, and is the true fountain of
life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:61095:186"/>
29. For in the sweet water, it is very meek,
from whence Love existeth, and is onely a loving
<hi>warmth</hi> and no fire.</p>
               <p>30. And though indeed it be in the hidden kernel
of the fires quality or Originall; yet that fire is not
kindled or burning, for it is generated in the <hi>sweet</hi>
water.</p>
               <p>31. Now where the water is, there is not burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fire, but a pleasing warmth and gentle qualifying
or <hi>vivifying;</hi> but if the water should be dryed up,
then there would be burning fire <hi>there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. Thus Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> thought also, if <hi>he did</hi> but
kindle his fire, then he might domineer forcibly in
the Divine power: but he thought it would have
burnt <hi>Eternally,</hi> and also have given Light; his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was not to put out the Light, but he would
have it burn continually in the fire: he thought he
would dry up the water, and then the light would
move stirre or <hi>shine</hi> in the burning fire.</p>
               <p>33. But he <hi>knew not,</hi> that if he kindled the dryed
water, that the kernel, that is, the unctuosity oyl or
heart of the water would be <hi>consumed,</hi> and that the
light would turn into darknesse, and the water turn
into a sowr <hi>stinck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>34. For the oyl or unctuosity in the water is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
through meeknesse or well-doing, and that
is the unctuosity oyl unction marrow or fatnesse,
wherein the Light becomes <hi>shining.</hi> But if the
unctuousnesse be burnt up, then the water is turn'd
into a sowr stinck, and moreover becometh very
dark.</p>
               <p>35. And thus it befell the Pride of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> he
triumph'd a little while with his kindled Light; but
when his light was <hi>spent</hi> and burnt up, then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Black Devill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:61095:187"/>
36. But he supposed he would Eternally reign
thus in his burning light in the whole Divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as a very terrible God, and so with his fire-spirit
he <hi>wrestled</hi> with the <hi>Salitter</hi> of God, intending to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the whole circumference or Extent of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>37. And indeed he hath done somewhat, in that
he hath set the <hi>Divine</hi> power into a burning, which
appeareth even in the Sun and Stars; also the fire
in the <hi>Salitter</hi> in the Elements, is often kindled, so
that it seemeth as if the <hi>Deep</hi> were of a burning fire;
of which, I shall speak in another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="e"/>[<q>He stept back out of the <hi>meeknesse</hi> into the anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>fire-will;</hi> and fell into <hi>darknesse.</hi> The
Reader is advertised, that he must not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
in any place, as if the Devill had kindled
or fired the Light of <hi>God,</hi> no, but the forms of
<hi>Nature</hi> only, out of which, the <hi>light</hi> shineth.
For he hath not comprehended the Light, as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
as the fire doth, which cannot lay hold on the
Light: But he entred into the fire, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
into the Darknesse; and hath neither
<hi>fire</hi> nor light <hi>besides</hi> without or distinct from
his <hi>creature.]</hi>
                  </q> or own <hi>Creaturelinesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>38. Now in this quality, King <hi>Lucifer</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for himself the right Hellish Bath or Lake.
He <hi>dares not</hi> say, that God hath framed or erected
the Hellish quality for him, but he himself hath
done it: Moreover he hath <hi>offended</hi> the Deity, and
turn'd the powers of God into a hellish Bath or
Lake, for his own <hi>Eternal habitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>39. For when he and all his Angels had kindled
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61095:187"/>
in their Bodies the qualifying or fountain spirit of
the fire, then the unctuousnesse marrow or fatnesse
<hi>burnt</hi> in the sweet water, and the flash or terrour,
which riseth up fiercely in the birth of the light,
became raging and tearing, burning and stinging,
and a being or substance of a meer <hi>opposite</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
will.</p>
               <p>40. And here, in this quality, the <hi>Life</hi> was
turn'd into <hi>a Sting of Death;</hi> for through
Heat the bitter quality grew so fierce, stinging, raging
and burning, as if the whole body were meer fiery
Stings; these did tear and rage in the astringent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as if one did thrust <hi>fiery</hi> Pins, Needles or red-hot
Bodkins through the Body.</p>
               <p>41. On the other side, the <hi>cold fire</hi> of the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality was in a mad furious rage against the
heat, and against the bitter venom or Poison, like a
great Uproar or hurliburly; and now furthermore,
in the Body of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> there was nothing else but a
murthering, rubbing, fretting, burning and stinging,
a most horrible hellish fire.</p>
               <p>42. This <hi>fire-spirit,</hi> and right Devils-spirit, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
it self now also in the Center of the heart, and
would <hi>rule</hi> through the animated or soulish spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit—</p>
               <p>[<q>
                     <hi>Hereby is understood the</hi> spirit of the will, <hi>out of</hi>

the <hi>whole</hi> Divine power, and kindle the
whole <hi>Salitter</hi> of God as a new and potent God: and
so the formings and Heavenly Imagings, should rise
up in a horrible fiery Qvality, and suffer themselves
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:61095:188"/>
to be Imaged and framed according to this <hi>fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>43. Now when I write of the animated or <hi>sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
spirit,</hi> then thou must exactly know,
<hi>what it is,</hi> or <hi>how it is,</hi> else thou
wilt read this Birth or<note n="†" place="margin">or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</note> Geniture in vain, and it
will happen to thee, as it did to the wise Heathens,
who climbed up to the very face or countenance of
God, but could not <hi>see</hi> it.</p>
               <p>44. The<note n="*" place="margin">or Soulish spirit.</note> 
                  <hi>Spirit of the Soul</hi> is very much subtiler
and more incomprehensible then the Body, or the
seven qualifying or fountain spirits, which hold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and form the Body; for it goeth forth from the
seven spirits; As God the Holy Ghost, goeth forth
from the Father and the Sonne.</p>
               <p>45. The seven qualifying or fountain Spirits have
their compacted or incorporated Body, out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that is, out of the seventh Nature-spirit in
the <hi>Divine</hi> power; which in this Book, I call
<hi>the Salitter of God,</hi> or the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibility,</hi>
wherein the heavenly figures
or shapes arise.</p>
               <p>46. And that is <hi>a spirit,</hi> as all the rest of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Spirits are, onely the other six are an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
Being therein: for the Divine power
generateth it self in the comprehensibility of the
seventh Nature-spirit, as it were hidden or conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and incomprehensible to the Creatures.</p>
               <p>47. But the animated or <hi>soulish</hi> spirit generateth
it self in the heart out of or from the seven qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain spirits, in that manner as the Sonne
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:61095:188"/>
of God is generated; and keepeth its seat in the
heart, and goeth forth from that <hi>Seat</hi> in the Divine
power, as the Holy Ghost from the Father and the
Sonne; for it is of such a subtilnesse as the Holy
Spirit of God hath, and uniteth qualifieth or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
with God the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>48. And when the animated or soulish Spirit go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth out of the Body, then it is <hi>one</hi> thing with
the hidden Deity, and is together the midst or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Imaging or framing of a thing in Nature,
as God the Holy Ghost himself is.</p>
               <p>49. An example whereof you have in this: as
when a <hi>Carpenter</hi> will build a curious house or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
piece of Architecture, or any other <hi>Artist</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
about the making of some artificiall work, the
<hi>Hands</hi> which signifie <hi>Nature,</hi> cannot be the first that
begin the work; but the seven Spirits are the first
Workmasters about it, and the animated or soulish
spirit sheweth the form figure or shape of it to the
seven spirits.</p>
               <p>50. And then the seven spirits Image or frame
it, and make it comprehensible, and then the hands
<hi>first</hi> begin to fall to work, to make the Structure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Image or frame contrived: For a
work must be first brought to the sense, before you
can make it.</p>
               <p>51. For the Soul comprehendeth the <hi>highest</hi> sense,
it beholdeth what God its Father acteth or maketh,
also it Co-operateth in the heavenly Imaging or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
And therefore it maketh a description
draught platform, or modell, for the Nature-spirits,
shewing how a thing should be Imaged or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>52. And according to this delineation or prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61095:189"/>
of the Soul, all things in this world are made;
for the corrupted soul worketh or endeavoureth
continually, to bring forth or frame heavenly forms,
but cannot bring that to Effect, for the <hi>materials</hi> for
its work are onely the earthly corrupted <hi>Salitter,</hi>
even a <hi>half-dead</hi> Nature, wherein it cannot Image or
frame heavenly Ideas shapes or figures.</p>
               <p>53. By this you may understand, what great <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
the spirits of the expelled Angels have had in the
heavenly Nature; And what manner of substance
this perdition or <hi>Corruption</hi> is of; How they have
corrupted and spoiled Nature in heaven in their
place with their horrible kindling: from whence
the horrible fiercenesse which is predominant in <hi>this</hi>
world is existed.</p>
               <p>54. For the kindled Nature burneth still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
untill the last Judgment Day, and this kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
fire fource or quality is an Eternall <hi>Emnity</hi>
against God.</p>
               <p>55. But yet whether this kindled fire-spirit hath
<hi>Right</hi> therein; and whether God himself hath kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
it, from whence the wrath-fire is existed; let
the Electionists or Predestinarians, or those that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
so about Election, justifie it, and prove it in
<hi>Nature,</hi> if they can; if not, then this fire-spirit is to
be condemned also.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Fifth kind Species form or manner of Sin's

               <p>56. The fifth qualifying or fountain spirit in the

<hi>Love,</hi> which is the very Glance or aspect of <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
and humility, which is also generated in the

57. For the flash as a Crack penetrateth sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whereby Joy existeth, and then the stock of the
kindled light in the sweet water, abideth standing,
and <hi>presseth</hi> gently after the flash through the fire,
even into the astringent quality, and mitigateth the
fire, and mollifyeth softneth or suppleth the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality, which is also a Birth or geniture of
the water.</p>
               <p>58. But when the fire tasteth the <hi>mild</hi> sweet and
pliant Taste, then is it mitigated and formeth it self
into a meek warmth, very lovingly, and there riseth
up a very <hi>friendly</hi> life in the fire, and penetrateth
the astringent Quality with this pleasing lovely gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
warmth, and allayeth or stilleth the <hi>cold fire,</hi> and
mollifieth or suppleth the hardnesse, attenuateth the
thick, and maketh the dark to be Light.</p>
               <p>59. But when the Bitter flash together with the
astringent and fire-spirit, tasteth this meeknesse, there
is nothing else then but a meer longing, desiring and
replenishing, a very gentle pleasant tasting, wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
kissing, and love-Birth: For the <hi>severe</hi> births
of all the qualifying or fountain spirits in this pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating,
become very gentle, pleasant, humble and
friendly, and the very <hi>Deity</hi> rightly subsisteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>60. For in the first four qualifying or fountain
spirits standeth the Divine Birth or Geniture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they must be very Earnest and strong also,
though they have among them too, their <hi>meek mother</hi>
the sweet water, and in the fifth standeth the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
amiable and blessed Love, and in the sixth the
<hi>Joy,</hi> and in the seventh the framing Imaging or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>61. Now <hi>Lucifer!</hi> come on, with thy Love: how
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61095:190"/>
hast <hi>thou</hi> behaved thy self, is <hi>thy</hi> Love also such
a Well-spring or fountain as this? We will now
view that also, and examine what manner of <hi>loving
Angel</hi> thou art turned into.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>62. If <hi>Lucifer</hi> had not elevated and kindled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
then his fountain of Love would be no other
then that in God, for there was no other <hi>Salitter</hi> in
him, then there is in God.</p>
               <p>63. But when he elevated himself, <hi>intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to rule the whole Deity with his animated
or soulish spirit, then the stock and heart of light,
which is the kernel marrow or pith of <hi>love</hi> in the
sweet water, became a fierce and <hi>corroding</hi> croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fire source or quality, from whence, in the whole
body existed a very trembling, burning, government
and Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>64. Now when the animated or soulish spirit
was <hi>generated</hi> in this severe and astringent fire's-Birth,
then it pressed very furiously forth from the
Body into Nature, or the <hi>Salitter</hi> of God, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed</hi>
the gracious amiable and blessed love in the
<hi>Salitter:</hi> for it pressed very fiercely furiously and
firily, as a raging Tyrant, through all, and supposed,
that it self <hi>alone</hi> was God; it <hi>self</hi> alone would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
with its sharpnesse.</p>
               <p>65. From <hi>hence</hi> now is existed the great contrary
opposite will and Eternall Emnity between God
and <hi>Lucifer;</hi> for the power of God moveth very
<hi>softly</hi> meekly pleasantly and friendly, so that its
Birth cannot be conceived of or <hi>apprehended,</hi> and
the spirits of <hi>Lucifer</hi> move and tear very <hi>harshly,</hi>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:61095:190"/>
astringently firily swiftly and furiously.</p>
               <p>66. An example whereof you have in the kindled
<hi>Salitter</hi> of the Stars, which because of this kindled
fiercenesse, must <hi>Roul</hi> with the vanity, even to the
last Judgment Day: And <hi>then</hi> the <hi>fierceness</hi> will be
separated from them, and be given to King <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
for an Eternal house.</p>
               <p>67. But that this is a great opposite contrary will
in God, needs no proof: but a Man may think, in
case such a fierce fire source or quality should rise in
his Body, what an <hi>untowardnesse</hi> and contrary will
he should have in him, and how often the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
would be in a rage and fury.</p>
               <p>68. Which indeed befalls those, who lodge the
Devil within them, but so long as he is but a Guest,
he lyeth <hi>still</hi> like a Tame Whelp: but when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
the <hi>Host</hi> himself and Master of the house,
then he stormeth and maketh <hi>havock</hi> in the House, as
he did to the Body of God.</p>
               <p>69. And therefore it is, that, the wrath-fire of
God, is yet in the Body of God which is in this
world, till the End, and many a creature is swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up and <hi>devoured</hi> in the wrath-fire, of which much
is to be written, but is referred to its proper place.</p>
               <p>70. But now whether God himself hath created
and kindled this Emnity and fierce fire-source in
<hi>Lucifer,</hi> they are to plead for and justifie, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
for Predestination, Foreseeing, and the Election
of Grace, and they are to prove it in Nature, if they
can; if not, then this <hi>corrupted</hi> fire-source, which

beginning in Lucifer, and in his
Angels.</head>
               <p>71. The Sixth qualifying or fountain spirit in
the Divine power is the <hi>Mercurius</hi> or <hi>Tone</hi> or Tune,
wherein the distinction and heavenly Joy riseth
up.</p>
               <p>72. This spirit taketh its original in the fire-flash,
that is, in the bitter quality, and riseth up in the
flash through the <hi>sweet</hi> water, wherein it mitigateth
it self, so that it becometh clear and bright, and is
reserved and kept in the astringent quality, and there
it <hi>toucheth</hi> or stirreth all the spirits: and from this
touching or stirring riseth up the Tone; its rising
source or quality standeth in the flash, and its Body
or Root standeth in the sweet water in the <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>73. Now this Tone or Tune is the <hi>Divine Joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
the triumphing, wherein the Divine and meek
Love-play sport or scene in God riseth up, as also
the formings Imagings and all manner of <hi>Ideas</hi>
shapes and Figures.</p>
               <p>74. But here thou must know, that this quality
penetrateth very gently and pleasantly with its tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
or stirring, through all the Spirits, in such a
way and manner, as when a <hi>pleasant</hi> and meek fire
of Joy riseth up in the heart of a man, in which fire
of Joy, the animated or soulish Spirit triumpheth as
if it were in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>75. Now this spirit doth <hi>not</hi> belong to or concern
the Imaging or framing of the body, but to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
<hi>diversifying</hi> and mobility, especially to the
Joy, and to the distinction or difference in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
or <hi>shaping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:61095:191"/>
76. And when the animated or soulish Spirit in
the Center of the heart, in the midst or Genter of
the seven qualifying or fountain spirits is generated,
so that the <hi>will</hi> of the seven Spirits is incorporated
or compacted together, then the Tone bringeth it
forth from the Body, and is its <hi>Chariot,</hi> on which the
spirit rideth, and executeth that, which is Decreed
in the <hi>Council</hi> of the seven spirits.</p>
               <p>77. For the Tone goeth through the animated or
Soulish spirit into the nature of God, and into the
<hi>Salitter</hi> of the seventh qualifying or fountain spirit
in the <hi>Divine</hi> power, which is its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ceptive or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
Mother, and uniteth qualifieth or co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
with the same in the forming or framing, and
also in the distinguishing or diversifying of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
or <hi>shape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>78. Therefore when King <hi>Lucifer</hi> changed or
<hi>transmuted</hi> his high-minded prancing Nagg or Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
in the Tone, into a firy<note n="†" place="margin">or Restive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> resting, in all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
spirits; that was a terrible contrary or <hi>opposite</hi>
will in the <hi>Salitter</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>79. For when his animated or soulish spirit was
generated in his body, then he <hi>stung forth</hi> from his
Body into the <hi>Salitter</hi> of God, as a fiery Serpent, out
of a hole.</p>
               <p>80. But when the Mouth <hi>opened to speak,</hi> that is,
when the seven spirits had incorporated or compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the word together, in their will, and sent it
through the Tone into the <hi>Salitter</hi> of God, then it
was no otherwise, then if there went a fiery Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt
into Gods Nature; or as a fierce Serpent,
which tyrannizeth raveth and rageth, as if it would
<hi>tear</hi> and rend Nature all to pieces.</p>
               <p>81. Hence that taketh its original; that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:61095:192"/>
is called <hi>the old Serpent,</hi> Apocal. 12.
9. and also, that there are Adders and <hi>Serpents</hi> in
this corrupted world; moreover, all manner of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
or venomous Broods of Worms, Toads, Flies,
Lice and Fleas, and all such like things whatsoever;
and from hence also <hi>Tempestuous</hi> weather of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Thundring, Flashing and Hail-stones take their
Originall in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>82. When the Tone riseth up in the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then it riseth up gently from all the seven qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
or fountain spirits <hi>joyntly</hi> together, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
the word, or Ideas figures and shapes very
gently:</p>
               <p>83. That is, when one qualifying or fountain
spirit attracteth a will to the Birth or Geniture, then
it presseth very <hi>gently</hi> through the other qualifying
or fountain spirits even into the <hi>Center</hi> of the Heart,
and there that will is formed and approved by all
the spirits.</p>
               <p>84. And then the other six spirits speak it forth
in the Tone, out from <hi>Gods</hi> animated or soulish spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
forth, understand out from the heart of God, out
from the Sonne of God, which abideth standing in
the center as a compacted <hi>incorporated</hi> Word.</p>
               <p>85. And the flash out of that same Word, or the
stirring of the Word, which is the Tone, goeth forth
very <hi>finely</hi> and gently from the Word, and executeth
effecteth or performeth the will of the Word.</p>
               <p>86. And that same <hi>forthgoing</hi> from <hi>the</hi> Word is
the Holy Ghost, which formeth frameth and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61095:192"/>
all whatsoever was Decreed in the center of the
heart, in the <hi>Councel</hi> of the seven spirits of God the
Father.</p>
               <p>87. In such a gentle way and manner should King
<hi>Lucifer</hi> also have generated qualified or operated,
and according to the <hi>Right</hi> of the Deity, with his
animated or soulish spirit in the <hi>Salitter,</hi> or in the
Nature of God, have <hi>helped</hi> to Image or frame things
as a <hi>dear</hi> sonne in Nature.</p>
               <p>88. Just as a sonne in the House helps his Father
to drive or <hi>manage</hi> his work, according to his Fathers
way and profession Kind and Art: and so should <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi>
also with his Angels, in the <hi>great House</hi> of God
the Father, according to the manner and way of
God, have <hi>helped</hi> with his animated or soulish spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to Image all the forms Ideas and vegetations in
the <hi>Salitter</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>89. For the whole <hi>Salitter</hi> should be a House of
pleasure and <hi>delight</hi> for Angelicall Bodies, and all
should rise up according to the delight of their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and Image themselves so, that they should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
at all have <hi>any</hi> displeasure in any figure shape or
creature, but their animated or soulish spirit should
be Co-operative in every Imaging;</p>
               <p>[<q>The <hi>Imaging</hi> out of the heavenly <hi>Essences,</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="h"/>
performed <hi>Magically,</hi> all according to the
will and ability or potentiality of Nature
and the Creatures:</q>]
<hi>and then the</hi> Salitter <hi>should have been the Creatures
proper own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>90. If they had but continued in their meek Birth
or Geniture according to the <hi>Divine Right,</hi> then all
had Been their own, and their will would have been
alwaies <hi>fulfill'd</hi> eternally; and nothing had been
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61095:193"/>
among them and in them but meerly the Joy of
Love, to speak after an Earthly manner, as it were
an <hi>Eternal Laughing</hi> and a perpetuall rejoycing in an
eternal hearty delight. For God and the creatures
had been one heart and one will.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="g"/>[<q>The Image out of or proceeding from the Soul's fire, and the Love, and the Divine Center, are
in one Being:</q>]</p>
               <p>91. But when <hi>Lucifer</hi> exalted himself, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
his qualifying or fountain spirits, then the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
or soulish spirit went forth in the <hi>Tone</hi> out of
or from all the Bodies of <hi>Lucifers</hi> Angels, into the
<hi>Salitter</hi> of God, as a fiery Serpent, or <hi>Dragon,</hi> and
Imaged or framed all manner of fiery and poisonous
forms and Images, like to wild cruel and Evill
Beasts.</p>
               <p>92. And from hence these wild fierce and Evill
Beasts have their <hi>original</hi> in this world. For the
Hoast or Army of <hi>Lucifer</hi> had kindled the <hi>Salitter</hi> of
the Stars and of the Earth, and <hi>half</hi> kill'd spoyl'd and
destroy'd it.</p>
               <p>93. But when God, after the fall of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> made
the Creation of this world, then all was created out
of the same <hi>Salitter,</hi> wherein <hi>Lucifer</hi> had his Seat:
And so afterwards the creatures also in this world
must needs be created out of that same <hi>Salitter,</hi> which
now form themselves according to the condition or
kind of the kindled Qualities Evill and Good.</p>
               <p>94. And that Beast, which had most of the fire
or the Bitter or the astringent quality, in the <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi>
that became also a bitter, hot, and fierce Beast,
all according as the quality was predominant or
<hi>chief</hi> in the Beast.</p>
               <p>95. This I set down here only for a manuduction:
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61095:193"/>
you will find it demonstrated more at large, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Creation</hi> of this world.</p>
               <p>96. Now whether this fiery Tone or <hi>Dragon-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
in <hi>Lucifer</hi> and in his Angels be right, and whether
God hath thus created him, let the Atturneys or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> which make God to be as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
justifie it here by their Answer, and prove it in
<hi>Nature</hi> if they can, whether God be such a God, as
willeth the Evill, and as hath created the Evill.</p>
               <p>97. <hi>If not,</hi> then shall this spirit also be condemned
to the Eternall Prison: and they should give over
their lying and blaspheming of God; or else they
are <hi>worse</hi> then the wild Heathen or Pagans, which
know nothing of God; <hi>who</hi> notwithstanding, live in
God, and shall <hi>sooner</hi> possesse the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

HEre thou shouldst open thy Eyes <hi>wide,</hi> for

which have been kept hidden from all

wilt see the murtherous Denne of the <hi>Devill,</hi> and the

            <p>2. The Devill hath taught man <hi>Sorcery</hi> or <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:61095:194"/>

But if he had revealed to man the right true funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Ground, which did lurk behind or <hi>under</hi> it,
many would have altogether let it alone, and not
have medled with it at all.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Come on ye Jugglers and
Sorcerers or Witches,</hi> you that go a
wooing and a whooring after the Devill: Come to
my School; I will shew you, how with your <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancie</hi>
or Art you are carried into Hell.</p>
            <p>4. You <hi>tickle</hi> your selves with this, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
is in subjection to you, and ye suppose that ye
are gods: Here I will describe the Originall and
<hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>Necromancie,</hi> for I am become also a<note n="†" place="margin">Nature Kundiger. Naturalist Physicus, or Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher.</note> sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher

            <p>5. Being the Bow of <hi>fiercenesse</hi> is already Bent,
let every one look to himself, lest he be found in the

hand, to awake from sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Now the seventh form or the seventh spirit in
the divine power, is <hi>Nature,</hi> or the issue or
<hi>exit</hi> from the other six. For the astringent qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y
attracteth the <hi>Salitter</hi> together, or the Fabrick or
product of all the six spirits, even as a Magnet or
Loadstone attracteth to it self the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the
Iron: and when it is attracted together, then it is a
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61095:194"/>
               <hi>comprehensibility;</hi> in which the six spirits of God
qualifie act or operate, in an <hi>incomprehensible</hi> way or
manner.</p>
            <p>7. This Seventh spirit hath a colour and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or kind, of its own, as all the other spirits have:
for it is the <hi>Body</hi> of all the spirits, wherein they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
themselves as in a Body: Also out of this
spirit, all <hi>figures</hi> shapes and forms, are Imaged or
fashioned: moreover the Angels also are created out
of it, and <hi>all</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Natureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or the universall Nature.</note> 
               <hi>Naturality standeth
therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. And <hi>this Spirit</hi> is alwayes generated from the
six, and subsisteth alwaies <hi>continually,</hi> and is never
missing or wanting, nor doth ever passe away, and
it again continually generateth the six; for the other
six are in this seventh, as in a Mother inclosed or
encompassed; and they receive their nourishment
power and strength <hi>alwayes,</hi> in their mothers Body or
Womb.</p>
            <p>9. For the Seventh spirit is the <hi>Body,</hi> and the other
six are the <hi>Life,</hi> and in the middle center is the heart
of <hi>Light,</hi> which the seven spirits continually gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
as a Light of Life; and that Light is their Sonne,
and the boyling <hi>mobility</hi> or Penetration through all
the spirits, expandeth it self aloft in the Heart, in
the exit or rising up of the Light.</p>
            <p>10. And this is that spirit of all the seven, which
goeth forth out of the heart of God, which formeth
frameth and Imageth all in the seventh, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the qualifying or fountain spirits, with their
<hi>Love-wrestling</hi> present and shew themselves infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely.</p>
            <p>11. For the Deity is like a wheel, which with
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61095:195"/>
its <hi>Felleys</hi> and <hi>Spoaks,</hi> and with all the <hi>Naves,</hi> turneth
about, and is felleyed together as seven wheeles, so
that it can go any way forward, backward, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
upward, and crosse-wayes, without turning
back.</p>
            <p>12. Whereas yet alwayes the form of all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>wheeles</hi> and the One onely <hi>Nave</hi> in the Center of
all the wheeles, is fully in sight, and so it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
how the wheel is made; but the wheel
alwaies appears admirable <hi>wonderfull</hi> and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
with its rising up, and yet abideth also in its
own Place.</p>
            <p>13. In such a manner the Deity is continually
generated, and neverpasseth away, ceaseth, or vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out of sight; and in this manner also is the <hi>Life</hi>
in Angels and Men, continually generated.</p>
            <p>14. But according to the moving of the seven
spirits of God, the figures and Creatures of the <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorinesse</hi>
are <hi>formed,</hi> and not thus generated: though
indeed the Birth or geniture of all the seven spirits
sheweth it self <hi>therein,</hi> yet their quality standeth
onely in the seventh Nature-spirit, which the other
six spirits do form figure frame <hi>alter</hi> and <hi>change</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their <hi>wrestling</hi> and rising up.</p>
            <p>15. And therefore also the figures and <hi>transitory</hi>
forms and creatures are changed, according to the
condition of the <hi>seventh</hi> Nature-spirit, in which they
rise up.</p>
            <p>16. But the Angels are not onely Imaged or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
out of the seventh Nature-spirit, as the transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
creatures are, but when the Deity moved it self
to the creating of Angels, then in <hi>every</hi> circle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
each Angel was incorporated or compacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
there the Deity with its <hi>whole substance</hi> and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61095:195"/>
being, was <hi>incorporated</hi> or compacted together—[<q>
                  <hi>Understand;
the</hi> two <hi>Eternal Principles, viz.
the</hi> Fire <hi>and the</hi> Light, <hi>and yet not the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or source of the Fire, But the Essence
of it:</hi>
               </q>]</p>
            <p>—and became a Body, and yet the Deity conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in its <hi>seat,</hi> as before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Understand this wall:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. The Angels Body or the <hi>comprehensibility,</hi> is
from or out of the <hi>Seventh</hi> spirit, and the Birth or
Geniture in that Body, is, the <hi>Six</hi> qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-spirits;
and the spirit or the heart, which the
six spirits generate in the center of the Body, in which
the Light riseth up, and the animated or soulish spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
out of the Light, which also qualifieth uniteth
or operateth with the <hi>Deity,</hi> without, distinct from
the Body: that signifieth the Heart of God, out of
which the Holy Ghost goeth forth.</p>
            <p>18. And it also was from or out of the heart of
God co-united or mixed in the Body of the Angel in
their first compacting or <hi>incorporating</hi> together;
therefore the Angels Government in the <hi>Mind</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
<hi>it</hi> self, as the Deity doth.</p>
            <p>19. And as in the Seventh Nature-spirit of God,
which existeth out of the other six, there doth <hi>not</hi>
stand the whole perfect knowledge of the other six
spirits; for it <hi>cannot</hi> search or dive into their deep
Birth or Geniture, in that they are its <hi>Father,</hi> and
generate it out of themselves.</p>
            <p>20. No more doth the whole full and <hi>perfect
knowledge</hi> of God stand in the <hi>Angelical</hi> Body, but
in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is generated in the Heart, which
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61095:196"/>
goeth forth from the Light, which qualifieth or
operateth also with the heart and spirit of God,
wherein the whole full and <hi>perfect knowledge</hi> of God
standeth: but the Body cannot apprehend that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
or soulish spirit; as also the seventh Nature-spirit
comprehendeth not the <hi>deepest birth</hi> or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God.</p>
            <p>21. For when the seventh Nature-spirit is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
then it is dryed by the astringent Quality, and
is as it were staid and kept by its Father, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>go back</hi> again into the Deep, that is, into the
Center of the Heart, where the Sonne is generated,
and from whence the Holy Ghost goeth forth, but
must hold still as a <hi>Generated</hi> Body, and must give
way to the qualifying or fountain Veins, that is,
to the <hi>spirits,</hi> to qualifie work and labour the rein as
they Please.</p>
            <p>22. For it is the proper house and habitation of
the six spirits, which they continually build accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their pleasure, or as a Garden of delight, into
which, the Master of it, <hi>soweth</hi> all manner of Seeds
according to his pleasure, and then enjoyeth the
fruit thereof.</p>
            <p>23. Thus the other six spirits continually erect
this garden of delight and pleasure, and <hi>sowe</hi> their
fruits thereinto, and seed upon it to strengthen their
Mig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t and joy: and this is the Garden, in which the
Angels dwell, and walk up and down in, and <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
the heavenly fruit groweth.</p>
            <p>24. But the wonderfull proportion or variety of
Harmony which appeareth in the growths or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and figures or forms in this Garden, ariseth
from the <hi>qualification</hi> or operation, and from the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
wrestling or strugling of the other spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:61095:196"/>
25. For that which is predominant or chief in the
striving, Imageth or formeth the growth and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
according to its kind, and the other alwayes
<hi>help</hi> to promote it; one while one is at it, by and by
the other, then the third, and so on.</p>
            <p>26. And <hi>therefore</hi> also there arise so many several
growths vegetations and figures, as are altogether
insearchable and incomprehensible to the <hi>Bodily Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of the Angels; but to the animated or <hi>soulish
Reason</hi> of the Angels, they are wholly fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
comprehensible.</p>
            <p>27. And this is also wholly hidden as to my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but <hi>not</hi> as to my animated or soulish spirit, for
so long as it qualifieth or worketh with and in God,
it comprehendeth the same, but when it falls into
<hi>Sin,</hi> then the Door is shut against it, and the Devill
bolteth it up fast, and it must be set open again with
great labour and industrie of the <hi>spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28. I know very well, that the wrath of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
will mock and scoff in the hearts of wicked men,
at <hi>this Revelation.</hi> For he is mightily ashamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of this revelation, he hath also given my soul
many a Pang and Crush for it: but I leave it to Gods
direction, that will have it so; I cannot resist him,
though my earthly Body should go to wrack for it,
yet my God will <hi>glorifie me</hi> in my knowledge.</p>
            <p>29. The Glorification of <hi>this</hi> my knowledge, I
desire, and no other; for I know, that when this my
spirit in my new body, which I shall get at the Day
of my <hi>Resurrection,</hi> out of this my now <hi>corrupted</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
shall arise, that it will appear like the Deity,
as also like the holy Angels.</p>
            <p>30. For the triumphing Joyous Light in my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
sheweth me it sufficiently, in which I have also
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61095:197"/>
               <hi>searched,</hi> into the depth of the Deity, and described
it rightly according to my gifts, and the impulse of
the spirit, though in great <hi>feeblenesse</hi> and weaknesse,
in that my <hi>original</hi> and <hi>actual sins</hi> have often bolted
the Door against me, and the Devil hath danced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, as a whorish woman, and rejoyced at my
Captivity and anguish; yet that will bring <hi>very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
profit to his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>31. Therefore I must now look for no other then
his fierce wrath, <hi>but my stay trust and
Refuge is the Champion in the
Fight,</hi> who hath often delivered me from his
Bands, in whom I will <hi>fight</hi> against him, till my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
out of this Life.</p>

is an <hi>Emnity</hi> against God and his Angels; and so he

               </p>
               <p>35. The <hi>Learned</hi> have had many Disputations
Questions Conceits and Opinions concerning the
fierce malignity and evil that is in all the Creatures,
even in the very Sun and Stars in this world; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
there are some so very poisonous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous
Beasts, Worms and Vegetables in this
world, that thereupon Rational men have justly
<hi>wondred,</hi> and some have concluded peremptorily,
<hi>That God must needs have also
willed the Evill,</hi> being He hath Created
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61095:198"/>
so much that is Evil: And some have laid the blame
and fault thereof upon the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and some
have imputed it to the work and doings of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
               <p>36. But being all the Creatures and vegetables
were created <hi>before</hi> the Time of man, therefore the
fault ought <hi>not</hi> to be laid upon man: for man gat
not the <hi>beastial Body</hi> in his creation, but it first came
to be so in his Fall.</p>
               <p>37. Neither hath man brought the malignity
poison and venom into the Beasts, Birds, Worms,
and Stones, for he <hi>had not</hi> their Body, otherwise if
he had brought malignity and fiercenesse or wrath
into all Creatures, then he could <hi>never</hi> have looked
for mercy at Gods Hands, no more then the Devill.</p>
               <p>38. Poor Man did not fall out of a resolved pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
will, but through the poisonous venomous <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
of the Devil, else there had been no Remedy
for him.</p>
               <p>39. Now this true information thou wilt find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
here following, not from a zeal, to vilifie any
body thereby, but <hi>in Love,</hi> and as a humble infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and instruction from the Abysse of my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and for an assured comfort to the poor sick old
<hi>Adam,</hi> which now lyeth at the point of his <hi>Last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture</hi>
from hence out of this world.</p>
               <p>40. For <hi>in Christ</hi> we are all one Body, therefore
also this spirit would heartily fain have it so, that
its fellow Members might be <hi>refresh'd</hi> with a draught
of the precious Wine of God <hi>before</hi> their departure
from hence, whereby they might encounter and
stand in the great fight with the Devil, and obtain
the <hi>Victory,</hi> that the victory of the Devill in this
modern Drunken world might be disappointed and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61095:198"/>
destroyed, and the great Name of the LORD might
be Sanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now behold!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41. When King <hi>Lucifer</hi> together with his Angels
so gloriously beautifully and divinely created, as
a Cherubin and King in God, then he suffered his
bright beautious form to <hi>befool</hi> him, in that he saw
how noble, glorious and fair a Spirit <hi>rose up</hi> in
him.</p>
               <p>42. Then <hi>his</hi> seven qualifying or fountain spirits
thought they would elevate and kindle themselves,
and so they also would be as fait, glorious and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as the animated or <hi>soulish spirit,</hi> and thereby
would domineer, by their own Power and Authority
in the <hi>whole</hi> Court Circumference Dominion or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
as a New God.</p>
               <p>43. They saw very well, that the animated or
<hi>soulish spirit,</hi> qualified mixed or operated with the
Heart of God, and thereupon they were resolved,
they would elevate and <hi>Kindle</hi> themselves, hoping to
be as bright illustrious, deep, and Almighty as the
<hi>deepest Ground</hi> in the Center of the Heart of God.</p>
               <p>44. For they thought to elevate the natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which was compacted together or incorporated
out of the Nature spirit of God, up into the <hi>hidden
Birth</hi> or Geniture of God, that their seven qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain spirits might thus be as high, and as
<hi>all comproh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>sible</hi> as the animated or soulish spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>45. And the animated or soulish spirit should
<hi>triumph</hi> over the Center of the Heart of God, and the
Heart of God should be subjected under it; and so
the seven Spirits of God should Image frame and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:61095:199"/>
form all, by <hi>their</hi> animated or soulish spirit.</p>
               <p>46. And this High mind, and self-will, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and <hi>wholly</hi> against the Birth or Geniture of
God: for the Body of the Angels should abide and
remain in its seat, and <hi>be</hi> Nature, and as an humble
mother, hold still and be quiet, and should not have
the Omniscience and own self rational comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of the Heart, or of the deepest Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>holy Trinity;</hi> but the seven spirits should
generate themselves in their Natural Body, as is
done in God.</p>
               <p>47. And their comprehensibility should not be
in the <hi>hidden kernel,</hi> or in the innermost Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
of God, but the animated or soulish spirit,
which they generate in the Center of their Heart;
should <hi>qualifie</hi> mix or operate with the innermost
Birth or Geniture of God, and <hi>help</hi> to form all
figures shapes and Images, according to the pleasure
delight and will of the seven spirits, whereby in
the Divine pomp, all might be but <hi>One</hi> Heart, and
<hi>one</hi> will.</p>
               <p>48. For the Birth or Geniture of God also is thus;
the seventh Nature-spirit doth not <hi>reach back</hi> into its
Father, which generateth it, but holdeth still and is
quiet as a Body, and letteth the Fathers Will, which
is, the other six spirits, to form and image in it, how
<hi>they</hi> please.</p>
               <p>49. Neither doth any one spirit particularly and
severally reach with its corporeal Being, after the
Heart of God, but includeth closeth or <hi>joyneth</hi> its
will with the other, in the Center, to the Birth or
Geniture of the Heart, so that the Heart and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Spirits of God are <hi>One</hi> will.</p>
               <p>50. For this is the Law of the <hi>comprehensibility,</hi>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:61095:199"/>
that it do not elevate it self up into the <hi>incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility:</hi>
for the power, which in the Center or midst,
is compacted together or incorporated out of all
the seven spirits; is incomprehensible and unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but <hi>not</hi> invisible, for it is not the power of one
spirit alone, but of all seven.</p>
               <p>51. Therefore one spirit in its own Body, besides
and distinct from its<note n="†" place="margin">Instehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buhrt.</note> instanding or innate instant
Birth or Geniture, <hi>cannot</hi> reach into the whole Heart
of God, and examine try and search all, for it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends,
besides and distinct from its instanding
Birth or Geniture, onely its <hi>own</hi> Birth or Geniture
in the heart of God; but <hi>all</hi> the seven spirits <hi>joyntly</hi>
together comprehend the whole heart of God.</p>
               <p>[<q>And so also in Man, but understand it as to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="k"/>
Image of God, viz. in the Soul's spirit, not
in the fiery Essence of the soul, but in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the <hi>Light,</hi> wherein the <hi>Image</hi> of God
standeth:</q>]</p>
               <p>52. But in the instanding or innate Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the spirits, where the one still generateth the
other, there <hi>every</hi> spirit generateth all the seven spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
but yet only in the rising flash of the life.</p>
               <p>53. But the Heart, when it is generated, is singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
or distinct, <hi>viz. a peculiar Person;</hi> and yet not
separated from the Spirits, but the spirits cannot
transmute or <hi>change themselves</hi> in their first Birth or
Geniture one into another.</p>
               <p>54. Also the second cannot change it self into the
third, which is the <hi>exit</hi> of the spirit; but every Birth
or Geniture abideth in its seat, and yet all the Births
or Genitures together, are but the <hi>One</hi> Only <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:61095:200"/>
55. But being the Body of <hi>Lucifer</hi> was created out
of Nature and the most <hi>outward</hi> Birth or Geniture,
therefore it was unjustly done, that he should ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
himself into the <hi>innermost</hi> and deepest, which
he could not do<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>or</hi> Jure Divino.</note> in the Divine Right, but must so
elevate and kindle himself onely, that thereby the

the sharpest penetrating and <hi>Infecting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>56. I verily suppose indeed, that thou fair Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer,
hast changed thy self to purpose; and
mayest well teach men also <hi>thy Black Art,</hi> that they
perhaps might also become such potent Gods, as <hi>thou</hi>
art.</p>
               <p>57. Ye blind and proud Necromancers, Jugglers
and Sorcerers, your Art consisteth in your changing
the <hi>Elements</hi> of your Body by your conjurations and
Instruments of the Qualities or qualifying Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which you make use of to that purpose, and ye
think ye have <hi>Right</hi> so to do; but is it not against the
Birth or Geniture of God? If you think so, make
that appear.</p>
               <p>58. How can you well suppose, that you can
change your selves into <hi>another form?</hi> Indeed you
suffer the Devill thus to play the Ape with you, and
<hi>cheat</hi> you: and all this while you are but <hi>blind</hi> in
your own skill, though you have learned your Art
never so well, yet you do not know the Scope it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
at; for the Pith and Heart therein, is the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
or altering of the qualifying or fountain-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did, when he would needs be God.</p>

               <p>How can that be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>59. Behold, when the corporeall qualifying or
fountain spirits set their will into Sorcery or Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
then the animated or soulish spirit, which
they generate, and which, in the <hi>Astral Elementary</hi>
Quality ruleth in the hidden and deepest Center;
is clearly already a Sorcerer or Witch, and hath
changed transformed or metamorphosed it self into
Sorcery or <hi>Witchcraft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>60. But the Bestial Body cannot follow so sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and nimbly, but must be charmed to it, by <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters</hi>
and <hi>Conjurations,</hi> and some instruments for that
purpose, whereby the animated or soulish spirit
maketh the bestial Body invisible, and changeth it
into such a form, as the will of the quaifying or
fountain spirits <hi>was,</hi> at the beginning of its purpose
to a <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> or Transmutation.</p>
               <p>61. The Bestial flesh cannot well <hi>change</hi> it self, or
put it self into another Birth or Geniture, but is
brought into a slender and inferiour Base form, as of
a Beast, of Wood, or such like thing, which hath its
Body qualifying or boyling in the <hi>Elements,</hi> as in
their fountain.</p>
               <p>62. But the Astral spirits can well cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in another form or shape, but that continueth
<hi>onely so long,</hi> as the Birth or Geniture of Nature above
their Pole or Zenith permitteth them.</p>
               <p>63. For when it changeth it self with its <hi>wheeling</hi>
and penetrating, so that another qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61095:201"/>
spirit becomes chief or predominant, then their
Art lyeth down upon the ground; and <hi>their Deity</hi> in
the first qualifying or fountain spirit, in which they
had begun their Art, hath an <hi>End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>64. Now if it be to last <hi>any longer,</hi> then it must be
made again <hi>afresh</hi> according to the qualifying or
fountain spirit then ruling at that Present, or the
<hi>Devill</hi> with his animated or soulish spirit must be in
the astra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l spirits of the Body, which instantly and
suddenly changeth it, or else <hi>his Art</hi> is here at an
End also.</p>
               <p>65. For Nature will <hi>not</hi> suffer it self to be Juggled
with, at all times and houres, as the spirits would
<hi>have</hi> it, but all must be done, according to that
spirit, which then at that present time is Lord and
chief or <hi>predominant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>66. It is <hi>not</hi> that Spirit of God which is Lord and
chief in Nature, which <hi>causeth</hi> or maketh the Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but it is made, in the <hi>fiercenesse</hi> of the <hi>Salitter,</hi>
which Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> hath kindled with his elevation,
which is <hi>his</hi> eternal Kingdom.</p>
               <p>67. But when the power or might of that spirit
is allayed, then the kindled fire can be <hi>no more</hi> useful
to the Juggler.</p>
               <p>68. For the wrath-fire in Nature, is not, during
this Time of the world, the Devils <hi>own</hi> house of his
power; for the love standeth <hi>hidden</hi> in the Center of
the wrath-fire, and <hi>Lucifer,</hi> together with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
lyeth imprisoned in the <hi>outward</hi> wrath-fire even
untill the Judgment of God: then, he will have the
wrath-fire separated from the Love, for an eternall
Bath or Lake, and doubtlesse he will wash his Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
Head and Face withall.</p>

69. This I set thee down here for a <hi>warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
that thou mayst know, what manner of
<hi>Ground</hi> Sorcery or Witchcraft hath, not in such a
way as if I would write any heathenish forcery or
witchcraft, neither have I studied any; but the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
or soulish spirit beholdeth their Juggling,
which in the <hi>Body</hi> I do not understand.</p>
               <p>70. But being it runneth counter clean contrary
to the Love and Meeknesse of the Birth or Geniture
of God, and is a contrary or <hi>opposite</hi> will in the Love
of God, so that he is loath without pressing necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
driveth him to it to hurt Man; therefore will the
spirit have the <hi>wrath-Bath</hi> or Lake of Nature, set
apart to be an Eternal Parching or drying place, for
Jugglers, perverters or changers of Gods Ordinance
or Order: And therein they may practise and shew
forth <hi>their</hi> new Deity.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Kindling of the Wrath-Fire.</head>
               <p>71. Now when King <hi>Lucifer,</hi> together with all
his Angels, kindled himself, then the wrath-fire rose
up <hi>instantly</hi> in the Body, and the gracious amiable
and blessed <hi>Light</hi> was extinguisht in the animated
or soulish spirit, and became a fierce furious Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Spirit, all according to the <hi>kindling</hi> and will of
the qualifying or fountain spirits.</p>
               <p>72. Now this animated or soulish spirit was
bound or united with the Deity, in Nature, and
could qualifie mix or operate in and with the same,
as if it were one and the same thing: and that now
<hi>stung forth</hi> out of the Bodies of the Devills into the
Nature of God, like a Theef and a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> that
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61095:202"/>
desired to Rob murther and spoil all, and bring all
under its power, and so kindled all the Seven spirits
in Nature, and then there was nothing else but an
Astringent, Bitter, fiery and cracking <hi>burning</hi> tearing
and raging.</p>
               <p>73. Thou must <hi>not think,</hi> that the Devill hath
thus powerfully and mightily overcome the Deity:
No; but he hath kindled the wrath of God, which
indeed had otherwise <hi>rested Eternally</hi> in secret, and
so he hath made the <hi>Salitter</hi> of God to be a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Denne;</hi> for if fire be cast into a heap of straw
and kindled, it will <hi>burn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>74. Moreover, the wrath-fire of God doth <hi>not
reach</hi> in Nature into the innermost kernel of the
Heart, which is the Sonne of God; much lesse into
the Secret glory or Holinesse of the Spirit; but into
the Birth or Geniture of the six qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spirits, in the <hi>place</hi> where the seventh is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>75. For in that place or in this Birth or Geniture
is Lord <hi>Lucifer become</hi> a <hi>Creature,</hi> and his dominion
did reach no further or deeper then so: but if he had
continued in the <hi>Love,</hi> then his animated or soulish
spirit had reach'd even to the <hi>Center</hi> of the Heart of
God, for Love presseth or penetrateth <hi>through</hi> the
whole Deity.</p>
               <p>76. But when his Love was extinguisht, then the
animated or soulish spirit could <hi>no more</hi> reach into
the heart of God, and so his attempt was in vain,
but he raved and raged in nature, that is, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
qualifying or fountain spirit of God.</p>
               <p>77. But being the power of all the seven spirits
stood <hi>in this One;</hi> therefore also all the seven were
kindled in the wrath, but yet only in the <hi>outward</hi> and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61095:202"/>
                  <hi>comprehensible</hi> qualification or constitution.</p>
               <p>78. For the Devill could not touch the heart,
neither could he touch the <hi>innermost</hi> Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the qualifying or fountain spirits; for his
<hi>Glory</hi> of the seven spirits was already mortified in
the first flash of kindling, and was presently held
captive and imprisoned in the first <hi>exit</hi> of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
or soulish Spirit.</p>
               <p>79. In <hi>this Hour</hi> King <hi>Lucifer</hi> prepared for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the Hell and eternal Perdition, which now
standeth in the <hi>outermost</hi> qualifying or fountain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Nature of God, or in the outermost Birth
or Geniture of this world.</p>
               <p>80. But when <hi>Nature</hi> kindled it self thus horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
then the house of joy came to be a house of
trouble affliction and misery: for the astringent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
became kindled in <hi>its own</hi> House, which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hard cold and dark Being, like a cold hard frosty
Winter, which only attracted the <hi>Salitter</hi> together,
and dryed it up, so that it became rugged cold and
sharp like Stones, wherein the heat was captivated
imprisoned and also attracted together, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or framed into a hard cold, dark Being.</p>
               <p>81. When this was done, the Light in Nature
was extinguish'd in the outermost Birth or Geniture
also, and all became very dark perished and <hi>spoiled;</hi>
the water became very cold and thick, and staid
here and there in the <hi>Clefts:</hi> this is the original of
the Elementary Water on Earth.</p>
               <p>82. For before the Times of the world the water
was very Thin or rarified like Ayr, and then the life
was generated therein also, which <hi>water</hi> is now so
<hi>mortal</hi> corrupted perished and spoiled, and so rolleth
and runneth to and fro.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:61095:203"/>
83. The Gracious amiable and blessed Love,
which rose up in the flash of the life, became a fierce
and bitter venom or Poison, a very murtherous
Denne, <hi>a Sting of Death:</hi> the Tone or Tune became
like the hard knocking or Loud <hi>Rumbling</hi> of stones,
and a house of Lamentation.</p>
               <p>84. Briefly, all was a meer dark and miserable
Being in the whole Circumference Extent or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
in the outermost birth or Geniture of the
Kingdom of <hi>Lucifer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>85. But thou must not think, that Nature was
thus <hi>corrupted</hi> and kindled even to the innermost
ground, but only the outermost Birth or Geniture;
but the innermost, in which the seven qualifying or
fountain spirits generate themselves; retain'd its
own Right to it self, being the <hi>kindled</hi> Devill could
<hi>not</hi> reach into it.</p>
               <p>86. But now the inner Birth or Geniture hath the
Fanne or Casting-shovel in its Hand, and will one
Day <hi>purge</hi> its floor, and give the Chaffe or husks to
the Kingdom of <hi>Lucifer</hi> for Eternal food.</p>
               <p>87. For if the Devil <hi>could</hi> have reach'd into the
innermost Birth or Geniture, then instantly the
whole Circumference Court or Extent of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
would have been the kindled <hi>burning Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>88. But now he must lye <hi>captivated</hi> and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
in the outermost Birth or Geniture even till
the last Judgment Day, which is at hand, and very
near <hi>to be Expected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>89. But <hi>Lucifer</hi> hath kindled <hi>his qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spirits</hi> even in the innermost Birth or Geniture,
and now <hi>his</hi> qualifying or fountain spirits generate
an animated or soulish <hi>Devills</hi> spirit, which is an
eternal Enemy of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:61095:203"/>
90. For when God was angry in <hi>his</hi> outermost
Birth or Geniture in Nature, then it was not his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>determinate</hi> will, to be kindled, neither hath
he effected that kindling: but he hath drawn the
<hi>Salitter</hi> together, and thereby hath prepared an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Lodging</hi> for the Devil.</p>
               <p>91. For he cannot be expell'd <hi>quite out</hi> away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
God, into another Kingdom of Angels; but a
place must be <hi>reserved</hi> to him for a Habitation.</p>
               <p>92. Neither would God <hi>presently</hi> give him the
kindled <hi>Salitter</hi> for an eternal Habitation, for the
<hi>internal</hi> Birth or Geniture of the spirits stood yet
<hi>hidden</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>93. For God intended to do somewhat <hi>else</hi> with
it, and so King <hi>Lucifer</hi> should be kept a <hi>Prisoner,</hi>
till another Angelical Hoast or Army, out of the
same <hi>Salitter,</hi> should come in <hi>his</hi> stead; which are
<hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>94. Now come on ye Atturneys Lawyers and
Advocates of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> maintain the Cause of your
King now, and shew whether he hath done Right,
in kindling of the <hi>wrath-fire</hi> in Nature: if not, then
he must <hi>burn</hi> therein eternally, and your <hi>Lies</hi> against
the Truth must burn with him.</p>
               <p>95. These are the Seven kinds species forms or
manners of Sin's beginning and eternal <hi>Emnity</hi> against
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:61095:204"/>
Now followeth briefly concerning the <hi>Four new little
Sonnes</hi> of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> which he hath generated in
himself in his corporeal Regiment: for which
he was expell'd from his Place, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>the Horriblest Devill.</hi>

               <p>Now it may be asked:
What <hi>moved</hi> Lucifer to this? that he <hi>would</hi>
needs be above God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>96. Here thou must know, that <hi>without</hi> distinct
from himself he had no impulse at all to his Pride,
but his Beauty and brightnesse <hi>deceived</hi> him; when
he saw that he was the fairest and beautifullest
Prince in Heaven, then he <hi>despised</hi> the friendly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
mixing Operating and generating of the
Deity, and thought with himself that he would <hi>rule</hi>
with his Princely power in the whole Deity, all
must stoop and bow to <hi>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>97. But when he found, that he could not effect
it, then he kindled himself, intending to do it <hi>some
other</hi> way, and so then, the Sonne of Light became
a Sonne of Darknesse; for he <hi>himself</hi> consumed the
power of his sweet water, and made it to be a sowr
stinck.</p>

               <p>98, The second Will was <hi>Covetousnesse,</hi> which

that he would <hi>reign</hi> over all Kingdoms, as a
Sole God; all should bow to him, he would form
and frame <hi>all</hi> with his own power; and besides also
his <hi>beauty</hi> so deceived him, that he thought he would

               <p>99. This Modern World should do well to spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate

Pride thought and said to it self, Surely thou art

thought, and said to it self, All must be <hi>Thine;</hi> and
Envy thought and said to it self, Thou must <hi>kill</hi> all

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:61095:205"/>
and thus it Stung at the other Gates of Angels, but
all was in vain, for its power and might reach'd <hi>no

must in this Place fight hourly with the Devill.</p>
               <p>112. For the Devill <hi>hath</hi> power in the outermost
Birth or Geniture of Man, for his seat is there, the
murtherous Denne of Perdition, and the House of
misery and <hi>woe:</hi> wherein the Devill <hi>whetteth</hi> the
Sting of Death, and through his animated or <hi>soulish</hi>
spirit, he reacheth in into the Heart of Man in his
outermost Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:61095:206"/>
113. But when the Astrall Spirits are <hi>enlightned</hi>
from the animated or soulish spirit, which in the
Light uniteth with God, then they grow <hi>fervent</hi> and
very Longing and desirous of the light: on the other
side, the animated or soulish spirit of the Devil
which ruleth in the outermost Birth or Geniture of
Man, is very terrible and angry, and of a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
or <hi>opposite</hi> will.</p>
               <p>114. And then there riseth up the striving or
<hi>fighting fire</hi> in Man, just as it rose up in Heaven with
<hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and so the poor Soul comes to
be miserably crushed <hi>stretched,</hi> tormented, and put
upon the Wrack.</p>
               <p>115. But if it get the victory <hi>with its piercing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration;</hi>
then it bringeth its light and knowledge
into the outermost Birth or <hi>Geniture</hi> of <hi>Man:</hi> for it
presseth back with force through the seven Spirits of
Nature which I <hi>call</hi> here the Astrall Spirits, and as
an assessor governeth also in the <hi>councill</hi> of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>116. And then man first knoweth what the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
is, how much an Enemy he is to him, and how
<hi>great</hi> his power is; also how he must fight with
him, very <hi>secretly</hi> every day hour and Moment.</p>
               <p>117. Which thing <hi>Reason,</hi> or the outward Birth
or <hi>Geniture</hi> of Man, without the experience of
this fight or battle <hi>cannot</hi> comprehend: for the
Third or outermost Birth or Geniture in Man, which
is the <hi>carnal</hi> or fleshly Birth, and which man,
through the first Fall in his Lust, hath raised and
prepared for himself, is the Devils Castle or <hi>Fort</hi> of
Prey or Robbery and dwelling house, wherein the
Devill, as in a <hi>Bull-wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> fighteth with the Soul; and
giveth it many a Hard thump upon its Breast, which
goes to the very Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:61095:207"/>
118. Now this Birth of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> is <hi>not</hi> the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
House of the soul; but in its strife it goeth in
with its Light into the <hi>Divine</hi> power, and fighteth
against the Murther of the Devil.</p>
               <p>119. On the other side, the Devil with his Poison
shooteth and <hi>darteth</hi> at the seven qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spirits, which generate the soul, intending to
destroy and to <hi>kindle</hi> them, that thereby he may get
the whole Body for his own propriety.</p>
               <p>120. Now if the soul would fain bring its light
and knowledge into the <hi>Humane</hi> Mind, then it must
fight and strive hard and stoutly, and yet hath a
very <hi>narrow</hi> passage to enter in at, it will be often
knockt down by the Devill, but it must stand to it
here, like a <hi>Champion</hi> in the battel. And if it now
gets the <hi>Victory,</hi> then it hath conquered the Devill;
but if the Devil prevails and gets the better, then
the soul is <hi>captivated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>121. But being the fleshly Birth or Geniture is
not the soul's <hi>own</hi> proper House, and that it cannot
possesse it as an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> as the Devil doth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fight and Battel lasteth so long, as the
House of Flesh lasteth.</p>
               <p>122. But if the House of Flesh be once destroyed,
and that the Soul is not <hi>yet</hi> conquered or vanquished
in its House, but is free and unimprisoned; then
the fight is <hi>ended,</hi> and the Devil must be gone from
this spirit <hi>Eternally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>123. Therefore this is a very difficult <hi>Article</hi> to
be understood; nay it cannot be understood at all
unlesse it be by experience in <hi>this</hi> fight: though I
should write <hi>many</hi> Books thereof, yet thou wouldst
understand <hi>nothing</hi> of it, unlesse thy spirit stand in
<hi>such</hi> a Birth of Geniture, and that the knowledge be
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:61095:207"/>
generated in thy self; otherwise thou canst neither
comprehend <hi>nor believe</hi> it.</p>
               <p>124. But if thou comprehendest this, then also
thou understandest the strife or the Fight, which the
<hi>Angels</hi> held with the Devils: for <hi>the Angels have not
Flesh nor Bones,</hi> no more have the Devills.</p>
               <p>125. For their Bodily or <hi>Corporeal</hi> Birth standeth
onely in the seven qualifying or fountain spirits, but
the animated or <hi>soulish</hi> Birth in the Angels, uniteth
mixeth or operateth with God; but it is <hi>not</hi> so in the
Devils.</p>
               <p>126. Therfore thou must here know, that the Angels
with their animated or <hi>soulish</hi> Birth, in which they
qualifie and unite with God, have striven and fought
in <hi>Gods power</hi> and Spirit against the kindled Devills,
and turn'd them out from the Light of God, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them together into a <hi>Hole,</hi> that is, into a narrow
Court Quarter or Compasse, like a Prison, which
is the place or space in upon and above the Earth
up to the Moon, who is a Goddesse of the Earthly
Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>127. So far reacheth their Extent now, till the
Last Day, and then they will get a House in that
Place, where the <hi>Earth</hi> now is and standeth,—</p>
               <p>[<q>That is, in the outermost Birth in the Darknesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="l"/>
wherein they reach not the second Principle
and source or fountain of the <hi>Light:</hi>
                  </q>]</p>
               <p>—and this will be called <hi>the burning
Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>128. Lord <hi>Lucifer,</hi> wait for it, and in the mean
while take this for an assured Prophesie concerning
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61095:208"/>
it: for thou wilt get the kindled <hi>Salitter</hi> in the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Birth or Geniture, which thou thy self hast so
prepared and fitted, to be thy <hi>Eternall House</hi> to dwell
in.</p>
               <p>129. But not in such a form as it now standeth,
but all will be <hi>separated</hi> in the kindled wrath-fire,
and the dark, hot, cold, rugged, hard, bitter, stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
relicks dregs or drosse, will be <hi>left thee</hi> for an
eternal Inne and Lodging.</p>
               <p>130. And thou wilt be such an Eternal Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God therein, as a <hi>Prisoner</hi> in a deep Prison or

the Eternall light of God: But the kindled bitter
wrath of God will be thy <hi>Grate</hi> Bolts and bounds,
out of which thou canst never Get.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the lamentable and miserable State and Condition
of the Corrupt perished Nature, and Original
of the four Elements, instead of the Holy
Government of God.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1.
ALthough God be an Eternal Almighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or Governour, whom none can resist,
yet <hi>Nature,</hi> in its kindling, hath now got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a very monstrous strange government,
such as was <hi>not,</hi> before the times of the wrath.</p>
            <p>2. For the six qualifying or fountain spirits did
generate the seventh Nature-spirit before the Times
of the wrath, in the Place of this world; very meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61095:208"/>
and <hi>pleasantly,</hi> as is now done in heaven, and not
so much as the least spark of Wrath or Anger did
rise up therein.</p>
            <p>3. Moreover, all was very Bright and light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
neither was there need of any <hi>other</hi> Light; but
the fountain or well-spring of the Heart of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
<hi>all,</hi> and was a light in all, which did shine
every where all over incessantly without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle:
For Nature was very rarified and thin or
Transparent, and all stood meerly in power, and was
in a very pleasant <hi>lovely</hi> Temper.</p>
            <p>4. But as soon as the fight began, <hi>in Nature,</hi> with
the proud Devil; then in the seventh Nature-spirit,
in the Court Region or Extent of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> which is
the place of this world, all gat <hi>another</hi> form and
operation.</p>
            <p>5. For Nature gat a Twofold source, and the
outermost Birth or Geniture in Nature, was kindled
in the wrath-fire, which<note n="†" place="margin">Nature-Fire, Gods Anger, Hell.</note> fire, now, is called the
<hi>wrath of God,</hi> or <hi>the burning Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Here is required, most Inward Sense or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to understand this; for the place, where the
Light is generated in the heart, only comprehendeth
it, the <hi>outward</hi> Man doth not comprehend it at
all.</p>
            <p>7. But behold! when <hi>Lucifer</hi> with his Hoast or
Army stirred or <hi>awakened</hi> the wrath-fire in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, so that God was moved to anger in
Nature in the place of <hi>Lucifer;</hi> then the outermost
Birth or Geniture in Nature gat <hi>another</hi> quality,
which was very Fierce, Astringent, Cold, Hot, Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:61095:209"/>
8. The moving or Boyling spirit, which <hi>before</hi>
qualified or operated very meekly in Nature, that
became in its outermost Birth or Geniture very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
and <hi>terrible,</hi> which now in the outermost
Birth is called the <hi>Wind,</hi> or the Element of
<hi>Ayr,</hi> in regard of its elevation or expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>9. For when the seven spirits kindled themselves
in their outermost Birth or Geniture, then they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
such a <hi>violent</hi> moving spirit; and so the
sweet water, which before the times of the wrath
was very rarified and thin and incomprehensible,
grew very thick and elevated and swelled, and the
astringent quality grew very sharp and Cold-firie, or
fierce-cold, for it got a strong attracting together,
like <hi>Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. For the Salt-water or<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Salt-Peter.</hi>
               </note> Salt, which still to
this Day is found in the Earth, hath its original and
descent from the <hi>first kindling</hi> of the Astringent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
and so the Stones also have their beginning and
descent from thence, as also the Earth.</p>
            <p>11. For the astringent quality now, attracted the
<hi>Salitter</hi> very strongly together, and dryed it, whence
the <hi>bitter</hi> Earth is proceeded, but the Stones are from
the <hi>Salitter,</hi> which at that Time stood in the power
of the Tone or Tune.</p>
            <p>12. For, as Nature with the working, wrestling,
and rising up of its Birth or Geniture, stood in the
time of the kindling, Just <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Matter</hi> attracted it
self together.</p>
            <pb n="389" facs="tcp:61095:209"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it may be Asked:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How then is a comprehensible or palpable Sonne
come to be out of an incomprehensible
Mother?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. Thou hast a <hi>Similitude</hi> of this, in that the
Earth and Stones are proceeded out of the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility.</p>
            <p>14. For behold the Deep between Heaven and
Earth is also incomprehensible, and yet the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Qualities at <hi>sometimes</hi> generate living compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
flesh, therein, as Grashoppers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Flyes and
Worms or creeping things.</p>
            <p>15. Which is caused by the <hi>strong</hi> attracting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of the qualities, in which attracted <hi>Salitter,</hi>
the life is suddenly generated; For when the heat
kindleth the astringent Quality, then the life riseth
up, for the Bitter quality stirreth it self, which is the
original of life.</p>
            <p>16. So in like manner the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> have
their descent; for when the <hi>Salitter</hi> kindled it self
in Nature, then all became very rugged thick and
dark, like a thick dark Mist or Cloud, which the
astringent quality dryed up hard with its cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>17. But, being the Light in the outermost Birth
was extinguished, the Heat also was captivated in
the Comprehensibility or palpability, and could <hi>no
more</hi> generate its Life: from thence <hi>Death</hi> did come
into Nature, so that Nature or the corrupt Earth
could no more help it, and thereupon <hi>another</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:61095:210"/>
of Light must needs follow, or else the Earth
would have been an <hi>Eternal</hi> undissolvable Death,
but now the Earth generateth or bringeth forth fruit
in the power and kindling of the <hi>created</hi> Light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now one might ask:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the condition then of this <hi>Two-fold</hi> Birth or
Geniture? Is God then extinguisht in the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the wrath-fire, in the place of this
world, so that nothing is there else but
a <hi>meer</hi> wrath-fire? or is the <hi>One</hi>
onely God become a <hi>Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. Thou canst not better comprehend appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
or understand this then in and by thy <hi>own Body,</hi>
which through the first fall of <hi>Adam</hi> with all its
Birth or Geniture, fitnesse faculties and will, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
just such a House.</p>
            <p>19. First, thou hast the <hi>Beastial</hi> Flesh, which is
come to be so through the Lustfull longing Bit of the
Apple: for it is the House of <hi>Corruption;</hi> For, when
<hi>Adam</hi> was made out of the corrupted <hi>Salitter</hi> of
the Earth, that is, out of the Seed or<note n="*" place="margin">Text Massa.</note> Masse or Lump,
which the Creator extracted out of the corrupted
Earth; he was not then at first, such flesh; else
his Body had been created <hi>Mortall,</hi> but he had
<hi>an Angelicall powerfull Body,</hi>
in which, he should subsist Eternally, and should
eat Angelical fruit, which did grow for him in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
before his fall; <hi>before</hi> the LORD cursed the
Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:61095:210"/>
20. But being the Seed, or Masse or Lump, out of
which <hi>Adam</hi> was made, was somewhat infected with
the corrupt disease or malady of the Devill, <hi>Adam
therefore</hi> long'd after his Mother, that is, to eat of
the fruit of the corrupted Earth, which then in its
outward comprehensibility was become so Evil, and
in the wrath-fire was become so hard palpable and
comprehensible.</p>
            <p>21. But being <hi>Adams spirit</hi> long'd after that fruit,
which was, of the Quality of the corrupted Earth,
<hi>therefore</hi> also Nature formed or framed such a Tree
for him, as was <hi>like</hi> the corrupted Earth.</p>
            <p>22. For <hi>Adam</hi> was the Heart in Nature, and
therefore his animated or soulish spirit did <hi>help</hi> to
Image fashion or frame <hi>this Tree,</hi> of which he would
fain eat.</p>
            <p>23. But when the Devill saw, that the <hi>Lust</hi> was
in <hi>Adam,</hi> then he stung lustily and briskly at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litter</hi>
in <hi>Adam,</hi> and infected the <hi>Salitter,</hi> out of which
<hi>Adam</hi> was made, <hi>yet</hi> more and more.</p>
            <p>24. And now then <hi>it was time,</hi> that the Creator
should frame a <hi>wife</hi> for him, which afterward set the
<hi>Sinne on work,</hi> and did eat of the evill or corrupt
fruit: Else if <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten of the Tree, <hi>before the
woman</hi> had been made out of him, then it would
have been far <hi>worse</hi> then it is.</p>
            <p>25. But being this requireth a high and deep
Description, as also requireth much Room, therefore
seek for it concerning the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> where you
will find it largely described.</p>
            <p>So, now I return to the forementioned Similitude.</p>
            <p>26. Now when <hi>Adam</hi> did eat of the fruit, which
was Good and Evill, then he suddenly gat <hi>such a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
also: The fruit was corrupt or perished and palp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:61095:211"/>
as to this day all fruits now on Earth are, and
so such a flesly and palpable or comprehensible
Body <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> gat instantly.</p>
            <p>27. But now the flesh is <hi>not</hi> the whole Man: for
this flesh cannot comprehend or apprehend the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
else the flesh were not Mortal and corruptible, or
fading and transitory; for Christ saith, <hi>John</hi> 6. 63.
<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>or</hi> The Spirit is the Life.</note> 
               <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the flesh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28. For <hi>this flesh</hi> cannot inherit the Kingdom of
heaven neither, but is only a <hi>Seed</hi> which is sowen
into the Earth, out of which will grow an impalpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or incomprehensible Body, such as the <hi>first</hi> was,
before the Fall. But the Spirit is eternal life, which
uniteth qualifieth or mixeth with God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
the <hi>internal</hi> Deity in Nature.</p>
            <p>29. Now as Man in his <hi>outward</hi> Being is <hi>corrupted,</hi>
and as to his fleshly Birth or Geniture, is in the
wrath of God, and is moreover also an <hi>Enemy</hi> of
God, and yet is but one Man, and not Two: and on
the other side, in his spiritual Birth or Geniture he
is a Child and <hi>Heir of God,</hi> which ruleth and liveth
with God, and qualifieth mixeth or uniteth with the
innermost Birth or Geniture of God: Thus also is
the Place of this world come to be.</p>
            <p>30. The outward comprehensibility or<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse.</hi>
               </note> Palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the whole Nature of this world, and of all
things which are therein, standeth all in the <hi>wrath-fire</hi>
of God: for it is become thus through the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Nature; and Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> with his Angels,
hath his dwelling now in the same outward Birth or
Geniture which standeth in the wrath-fire.</p>
            <p>31. But now the Deity is <hi>not separated</hi> from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Birth or Geniture, so, as if they were <hi>Two</hi>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:61095:211"/>
things in this world; if so, Man could have <hi>no Hope,</hi>
and then this world did not stand in the Power and
Love of God.</p>
            <p>32. But the Deity <hi>is</hi> in the outward Birth, hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and hath the Fanne or Casting shovel in its
hand, and will one Day cast the chaffe and the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
<hi>Salitter</hi> upon a Heap, and will draw away from
it its inward Birth or Geniture, and give them to
Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his <hi>Crew</hi> of followers for an Eternal
House.</p>
            <p>33. In the <hi>mean while</hi> Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> must lye <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
and Imprisoned in the outermost Birth in the
Nature of this world, in the <hi>kindled</hi> wrath-fire: and
therein he hath great Power, and can reach into the
<hi>Heart</hi> of all Creatures with his animated or soulish
spirit in the outermost Birth or Geniture, which
standeth in the wrath-fire.</p>
            <p>34. <hi>Therefore</hi> the Soul of man must fight and

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Creation of Heaven and Earth;
and of the first Day.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1.
<hi>MOses</hi> writeth in his first Book <hi>as if</hi> he had been
<hi>Present,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Genesis 1.</note> and had beheld all with his Eyes;
but without doubt he received it in writing
from his Forefathers: it may be, <hi>He</hi> might have
well discerned somewhat <hi>more</hi> herein in the Spirit
then his Forefathers.</p>
            <p>2. But because at that time, when God created
Heaven and Earth, there was <hi>yet no Man</hi> which saw
it, therefore it may be concluded, that <hi>Adam</hi> before
his Fall, while he was yet in the deep knowledge of
God, did know it in the Spirit only.</p>
            <p>3. But yet when he fell, and was set into the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Birth or Geniture he knew it no more; but had
onely a <hi>Remembrance</hi> of it, as of a dark and secret
<hi>Action</hi> or <hi>History,</hi> and <hi>so left</hi> it to his Posterity.</p>
            <p>4. For it is manifest, that the first World before
the Deluge or Flood, knew <hi>as little</hi> of the qualities
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:61095:212"/>
and Birth or Geniture of God, as this last world
wherein we now live: for the external fleshly Birth
or Geniture could <hi>never</hi> apprehend or <hi>understand</hi> the
Deity, otherwise somewhat more would have been
written of it.</p>
            <p>5. But being through the <hi>Divine Grace</hi>
in this High Article, this Great Mystery hath been
somewhat revealed to <hi>me,</hi> in <hi>my spirit</hi> according to
the inward Man, which qualifieth mixeth and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
with the Deity, therefore I <hi>cannot</hi> forbear to
describe it according to my <hi>Gifts:</hi> And I would have
the Reader faithfully admonished, not to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the Author.</p>
            <p>6. For I do it not out of a desire of <hi>Boasting</hi> and
vain-glory, but in a humble information to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that thereby the works of God might be <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi>
better known, and the Devils Kingdom revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and laid open, being this present Modern world
moveth and liveth in all malice wickednesse and
<hi>Devillish</hi> vicious Blasphemies, that it might once see;
in what kind of power impulse or driving it liveth,
and in what kind of <hi>Inne</hi> it taketh up its Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>7. And try, whether I may happily with the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted</hi>
Talent get gain of Usury, and not return it to
my God and Creator again singly and empty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
improvement, like the <hi>lazie</hi> servant, who had
stood idle in the vineyard of the Lord, and would
require his wages without having laboured at all.</p>
            <p>8. But if the Devil should raise Mockers and
despisers, who would say; It doth not become me
to climb so <hi>high</hi> into the Deity, and to dive so <hi>deeply</hi>
thereinto:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:61095:213"/>
9. To all of them, I give this for an Answer: That
I am not climbed up into the Deity, neither is it
Possible for such a mean man, as I am, to do it; but
the Deity is climbed up into me, and from <hi>its Love</hi>
are these things revealed to me, which otherwise I
in my half-dead fleshly Birth or Geniture must needs
have let alone altogether.</p>
            <p>10. But being I have such an impulse upon me, I
let <hi>him</hi> act and move in me, who knoweth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
what it is, and whose pleasure it is that
I should do it; I poor man of Earth, Dust and Ashes,
could <hi>not</hi> do it. But the spirit inviteth and Citeth
all such mockers and despisers before the <hi>innermost</hi>
Birth or Geniture of God in this world, to desist
from their wickednesse and malice: If not, then they
shall be spewed out as <hi>Hellish chaffe</hi> into the <hi>outermost</hi>
Birth or Geniture in the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. When God was now moved to Anger in the
<hi>Third</hi> Birth or Geniture in the Court Quarters or
Region of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> which was all the space and room
or Extent of this world, then the light was <hi>extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd</hi>
in the third Birth or Geniture, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Darknesse, and the <hi>Salitter</hi> in the third Birth
or Geniture was rough, wild, hard, bitter, sowr,
and in some parts stinking, <hi>Muddy</hi> and Brittle, all
according to the Birth or Geniture of the qualifying
or fountain spirits, then at that time working.</p>
            <p>12. For in that place wherein the <hi>astringent</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was predominant, there the <hi>Salitter</hi> was attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together and dryed, so that hard dry <hi>Stones came
to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but in those places, where the astringent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:61095:213"/>
and the bitter were equally alike predominant,
there sharp small Gravel and <hi>Sand</hi> came to be, for
the raging bitter spirit brake the <hi>Salitter</hi> all to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>13. But in those places, where the <hi>Tone</hi> together
with the astringent spirit, were predominant in the
water, there Copper, Iron, and such like rocky Oar
of Minerals came to be, but where the <hi>water</hi> was
predominant, together with all the spirits joyntly
and equally; there the wild Earth came to be, and
the water was here and there like a cloud or vapour
held <hi>captive</hi> in the Clefts and veins or spaces of the
Rocks: for the astringent spirit, as the Father of
corrupted Nature, held it captive with its sharp <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting</hi>
together.</p>
            <p>14. But the <hi>Bitter</hi> spirit is the chiefest cause of
the black Earth, for through its fierce bitternesse the
<hi>Salitter</hi> became kill'd in its outermost Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
from whence existed the wild or <hi>Barren</hi>
Earth.</p>
            <p>15. But the <hi>Heat</hi> in the astringent spirit chiefly
helped to make the Hardnesse; but where that came
to be, there it generated the noblest and <hi>pretiousest
Salitter</hi> in the Earth, as Gold, Silver, and Pretious
Stones.</p>
            <p>16. For when the <hi>shining Light</hi> by reason of the
hard, dry and rough matter became extinguish'd,
then it was together dryed up and incorporated in
the Heat, which is the Father of the Light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet you must understand it, thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. <hi>Viz.</hi> where the Hot spirit in the <hi>sweet water</hi>
was predominant in Love; there the astringent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
attracted the matter together, and so thereby the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:61095:214"/>
noblest Oar of minerals and Pretious Stones were
generated.</p>
            <p>18. But concerning Pretious Stones, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles,
Rubies, Diamonds, Smaragds or Emerauds,
Onixes and the like, which are of the <hi>best</hi> Sort, they
have their Original where the <hi>flash</hi> of the light rose
up in the Love. For that Flash becometh generated
in the meeknesse, and is the Heart in the Center of
the qualifying or fountain spirits; therefore those
Stones also are Meek, full of vertue, delightsome
pleasant and lovely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it might be Asked:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, Man in this world is so in love above all
other things, with Gold, Silver, and Pretious
Stones, and useth them for a<note n="†" place="margin">Eccles. 7. 12. with Money and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as with a shield.</note> Defence
or Protection, and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his Body?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. Herein lyeth the <hi>Pith</hi> or kernel; for Gold,
Silver and Pretious Stones, and all bright Oars of
Minerals, have their Original from the <hi>Light,</hi> which
did shine before the Times of wrath in the outermost
Birth or Geniture of Nature; that is, in the <hi>seventh</hi>-Nature-spirit:
And so now seeing every Man, is,
as the whole House of this world is, therefore all his
qualifying or fountain spirits love the <hi>kernel</hi> or the
best thing that is in the corrupted Nature, and that
they use for the defence protection and<note n="†" place="margin">or Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of themselves.</p>
            <p>20. But the innermost kernel, which is the Deity,
that they can no where comprehend, for the <hi>wrath</hi> of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:61095:214"/>
the fire lyeth before it, as a strong<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>or</hi> Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark.</note> wall,
<hi>and this wall must be broken down
with a very strong storm or assault,
if the Astrall spirits will see into
it.</hi> But the Door standeth Open to the Animated
or Soulish spirit, for it is withheld by Nothing, but
is as God himself is in his innermost Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now then it might be asked:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How shall I then understand my self in or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Threefold Birth or
Geniture in Nature?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Depth!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. Behold, the <hi>First</hi> innermost aud deepest Birth
or Geniture standeth in the Center, and is the <hi>Heart</hi>
of the Deity, which is generated by the qualifying
or fountain spirits of God; and this Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the <hi>Light,</hi> which though it be generated out
of the qualifying or fountain spirits; yet no quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
or fountain spirit of it self alone can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it, but every qualifying or fountain spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
only its own instanding innate place or
seat in the light, but <hi>all</hi> the seven spirits joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
comprehend the whole Light, for they are
the Father of the Light.</p>
            <p>22. Thus also the qualifying or fountain spirits of
<hi>Man</hi> do not <hi>wholly</hi> comprehend the innermost Birth
or Geniture of the Deity, which standeth in the
light, but every qualifying or fountain spirit reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:61095:215"/>
with <hi>its</hi> animated or <hi>soulish</hi> Birth or Geniture
into the Heart of God, and uniteth qualifieth or
mixeth in that Place <hi>therewith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. And that is the hidden Birth or Geniture in
Nature, which no Man by his own Reason, wit, or
<hi>capacity</hi> can comprehend; but the <hi>Soul</hi> of that Man,
which standeth in the Light of God onely compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
it, and <hi>no</hi> other.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Second Birth or Geniture in Nature, are
the seven Spirits of Nature.</head>
               <p>24. This Birth or Geniture is more <hi>intelligible</hi> and
comprehensible, but yet also only to <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of this Mysterie;</hi> the Plow-man
doth not understand it, though he seeth, smelleth,
tasteth, heareth, feeleth it, yet he looks on it, but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="n"/> knoweth not <hi>how</hi> the Being thereof is.</p>
               <p>[<q>By this is meant or understood the corrupt <hi>Reason</hi> in
its own wit ingenuity or capacity, without the
Spirit of God: The <hi>Doctor</hi> as well as the
<hi>Plow-man</hi> is here meant, the one is as blind
concerning the <hi>Deity,</hi> as the other, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Peasant or Plowman <hi>exceeds</hi> the
Doctor in knowledge, if he cleave close to God:</q>]</p>
               <p>25. Now these are the Spirits, wherein all things
stand both in Heaven and in this world, and from
these the <hi>third</hi> and outermost spirit is generated,
wherein corruptibility standeth.</p>
               <p>26. But<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>or</hi> third Spirit.</note> this Spirit, or this Birth hath <hi>seven</hi>
kinds or species, <hi>viz.</hi> the Astringent, the Sweet, the
Bitter, the Hot; these four generate the <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi>
in third Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>27. The fifth Spirit is the Love, which existeth
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61095:215"/>
from the Light of the life, which generateth <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
and <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. The sixth Spirit is the Tone, which genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the <hi>sound</hi> and Joy, and is the spring or source
rising up through all the spirits.</p>
               <p>29. In this sixth Spirit now standeth the spirit of
life, and the will, or Reason and <hi>Thoughts</hi> of all the
Creatures; and all Arts, Inventions, Formings and
Imagings of all that which standeth in the <hi>Spirit</hi> in
the <hi>incomprehensibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30. The seventh Spirit is Nature, in which stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the corporeal Being of all six spirits, for the six
spirits generate the seventh. In this spirit, standeth
the corporeal being of Angels, Devils and Men, and
is the <hi>Mother</hi> of all the six spirits, in which they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
themselves, and in which they also generate
the light, which is the Heart of God.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Third Birth or Geniture.</head>
               <p>31. Now the third Birth or Geniture is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibility
or palpability of Nature, which was
rarified and Transparent lovely pleasant and Bright,
<hi>before</hi> the time of Gods wrath, so that the qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain spirits could see <hi>through</hi> and <hi>through</hi>
all.</p>
               <p>32. There was neither Stone nor Earth therein,
neither had it need of any such created or contracted
Light, as now, but the light generated it self <hi>every
where</hi> in the Center, and all stood in the Light.</p>
               <p>33. But when King <hi>Lucifer</hi> was created, then he
excited or awakened the wrath of God in this <hi>third</hi>
Birth or Geniture; for the Bodies of the Angels
came to be <hi>Creatures</hi> in this Third Birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:61095:216"/>
34. Now then seeing the Devils kindled their
own Bodies, intending thereby to domineer over the
whole Deity, <hi>therefore</hi> the Creator also in his wrath
kindled this <hi>third</hi> spirit, or this third Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in Nature, and imprisoned the Devill therein,
and made an eternal Lodging therein for him, that
he might not be <hi>higher</hi> then the <hi>whole</hi> God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="o"/>[<q>Understand, in the outward sources or Qualities:
for, the outermost of all, is also the Innermost of
all:</q>]</p>
               <p>35. But seeing the Devils kindled themselves out
of Pride <hi>wantonnesse</hi> and wilfulnesse, <hi>therefore</hi> they
were quite thrust out from the Birth or Geniture of
the Light, and they can neither lay hold of, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it, <hi>Eternally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>36. For the Light of their Heart, which qualified
mixed or united with the heart of God, they have
extinguisht <hi>that</hi> themselves, and instead <hi>thereof</hi> have
generated a fierce, hot, astringent, bitter, and hard
stinging Devillish Spirit.</p>
               <p>37. But now thou must <hi>not think,</hi> that thereupon
the whole Nature or Place of this world is become
a meer bitter wrath of God. No; here lyeth the
Point: the <hi>wrath</hi> doth not comprehend the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Birth or Geniture in Nature, for the <hi>Love</hi> of
God is yet hidden in the Center, in the whole place
of this world, and so the House, which Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi>
is to be in, is <hi>not fully</hi> separated, but there is still in
all things of this world, both Love and wrath <hi>one in
another,</hi> and they alwaies wrestle and strive one with
another.</p>
               <p>38. But the Devils cannot lay hold on the wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:61095:216"/>
of the Light, but only on the wrestling of the
Wrath, wherein they are <hi>Executioners</hi> or Hangmen,
to execute the Justice or Law, which was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in Gods wrath, against <hi>all</hi> wicked Men.</p>
               <p>39. Neither <hi>ought</hi> any man to say, that he is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in the wrath-fire of the totall corruption or
perdition, <hi>out of Gods predestinate purpose.</hi> No: the
corrupted Earth doth not stand, <hi>neither,</hi> in the totall
wrath-fire of God, but only in its <hi>outward</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
or palpability wherein it is so hard, dry
and bitter.</p>
               <p>40. Whereby every one may perceive, that this
Poison and <hi>fiercenesse</hi> doth not belong to the Love of
God, in which there is nothing but <hi>Meeknesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41. Yet I do not say this, as if every Man were
<hi>Holy</hi> as he cometh from his mothers womb, but as
the Tree is, so is its Fruit. Yet the Fault is not Gods,
if a <hi>Mother</hi> beareth or bringeth forth a child of the
Devil; but the Parents wickednesse.</p>
               <p>42. But if a wild twigg be planted in a Sweet
Soyl, and be <hi>ingrafted</hi> with some other of a better
and sweeter Kind, then there groweth a Mild Tree,
though the twig were <hi>wild.</hi> For here all is possible;
as soon is the good changed into Evill, as the Evill
into Good.</p>
               <p>43. For every Man is <hi>free,</hi> and is as <hi>a God</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
he may <hi>change</hi> and alter himself in this life ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into wrath or into light: such Cloaths or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as a man puts on, such is his ornament or
lustre: and what manner of Body soever man <hi>soweth</hi>
into the Earth, such a Body also groweth up from it,
though in another form clarity and Brightnesse: yet
all according to the quality of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>44. For if the Earth were <hi>quite</hi> forsaken of God,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:61095:217"/>
then it could never bring forth <hi>any</hi> Good Fruit, but
meer bad and Evil Fruit. But being the Earth stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
yet in Gods Love, therefore his wrath will not
burn therein Eternally, but the Love <hi>which hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
will spew out the wrath-fire.</p>
               <p>45. And then will the burning Hell begin, when
the Love and the wrath shall be <hi>separated.</hi> In this
world the Love and the wrath is one in another in
<hi>all</hi> creatures, and that which overcometh in the
wrestling, inheriteth the House of or by Right, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the Kingdom of Hell or of Heaven.</p>
               <p>46. I do not speak so as if the Beasts in their Birth
or Geniture, were to inherit the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<hi>No;</hi> for they are like the corrupted Earth,
Evil and good; but if they be sown again into their
mother the Earth, then they are Earth.</p>
               <p>47. But the <hi>Salitter</hi> in a good Beast shall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be left to the Devil for a propriety, but will in
the separated part, in the Nature of God, Eternally
blossom—</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="p"/>[<q>That is, their <hi>Figure</hi> will stand as a Shadow upon

<hi>Salitter</hi> of the Beast<note n="†" place="margin">from or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to.</note> of Gods wrath will in the
wrath of God bear eternal <hi>Hellish</hi> Fruits.</p>
               <p>48. For if the Earth be once kindled, then in the
wrath, burneth the Fire; and in the love, the Light:
and then <hi>all</hi> will be separated, for the one cannot
comprehend the other <hi>any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>49. But in this Time every thing hath a <hi>Twofold</hi>
source and quality; whatsoever thou buildest and
sowest here in the <hi>spirit,</hi> be it with words, works or
Thoughts, <hi>that</hi> will be thy Eternal House.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:61095:217"/>
50. Thus thou seest and <hi>understandest,</hi> out of what
the Earth and Stones are come to be: but if that
kindled <hi>Salitter</hi> should have continued to be thus in
the whole Deep of this world, then the whole place
thereof would have been a <hi>dark valley,</hi> for the Light
was imprisoned together also with and in the <hi>Third</hi>
Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>51. Not that the Light of the Heart of God in its
<hi>innermost Birth,</hi> is imprisoned; No, but that Lustre
and the shining thereof in the <hi>third</hi> Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was together incorporated or compacted in the
<hi>outermost</hi> comprehensibility, and therefore it is that
Men are in Love with all those things, which stand
in <hi>that Salitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>52. But being the whole Deep in the third Birth
or Geniture was very dark in regard of the <hi>corrupted
Salitter</hi> of the Earth and Stones, <hi>therefore</hi> the Deity
could not endure it to be so, but created and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
the Earth and Stones together as in <hi>one Lump,</hi>
or as on a Heap.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning which, Moses writeth thus:</hi>

                     </gap>e according to the Language of Nature, may be understood.</note> what they are. For the word (<hi>Am</hi>) conceiveth it
self in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and goeth forth to the <hi>Lips,</hi> but
there is captivated and goeth back again sounding,
till it come to the place from whence it went forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:61095:218"/>
54. And this signifieth now, that the<note n="†" place="margin">Voyce of God.</note> Sound
went forth from the Heart of <hi>God,</hi> and encompassed
the whole place or Extent of this world, but when
<note n="*" place="margin">the place of this world.</note> it was found to be <hi>Evil,</hi> then the Sound return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again into its own place.</p>
               <p>55. The word or syllable (<hi>An-</hi>) thrusteth it self
out from the Heart and <hi>presseth forth</hi> at the Mouth,
and hath a long following<note n="†" place="margin">or murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Sound.</note> pressure; but when it
is spoken forth, then it <hi>closeth</hi> it self up in the midst
or Center of its Seat with the<note n="*" place="margin">or Palate.</note> upper Gums, and
is <hi>half</hi> without, and <hi>half</hi> within.</p>
               <p>56. And this signifieth, that the Heart of God
had a Loathing against the <hi>corruption,</hi> and so thrust
away the corrupted Being from himself, but <hi>laid hold</hi>
on it again in the midst or Center at the Heart.</p>
               <p>57. And as the Tongue breaketh off or divideth
the word or syllable, and keeps it half without, and
half within: so the Heart of God would <hi>not wholly</hi>
reject the kindled <hi>Salitter,</hi> but the malignity malice
and malady of the Devill, and the other part should
be re-edified or built again <hi>after</hi> this Time.</p>
               <p>58. The word or syllable (<hi>-fang</hi>) goeth <hi>switfly</hi> from
the heart out at the mouth, and is <hi>staid</hi> also by the
hinder part of the Tongue, and the Gums; and when
it is let loose, it maketh <hi>another</hi> swift pressure from
the Heart, out at the Mouth.</p>
               <p>59. And this signifieth the suddain <hi>Rejection</hi> at the
riddance and thrusting out of the Devils, together
with the corrupted <hi>Salitter:</hi> for the strong and swift
spirit thrusteth the breath <hi>strongly</hi> away from it, and
<hi>retaineth</hi> the true Tone of the word, or the expression,
with it at the hindermost Gumme, and that is, the
true spirit of the word or syllable.</p>
               <p>60. And this signifieth, that the corrupted <hi>fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:61095:218"/>
is thrust out eternally from the light of God,
but the inward spirit, which is <hi>loaden</hi> therewith
against its will, shall be set again in its first
House.</p>
               <p>61. The last following pressure (<hi>-ang</hi>) signifieth,
that the innermost spirits in the corruption are not
<hi>altogether</hi> pure, and therefore they need a sweeping
away, <hi>purging,</hi> or consuming of the wrath, in the
fire, which <hi>will</hi> be done at the End of this Time.</p>
               <p>62. The word (<hi>Schuff</hi>) conceiveth it self <hi>above</hi>
and <hi>under</hi> the Tongue, and shutteth the Teeth in the
upper and lower gummes, and so presseth it self <hi>close</hi>
together, and being held together, and spoken forth
again, then it openeth the Mouth again swiftly, like
<hi>a Flash.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>63. And this signifieth the astringent spirit's <hi>strong</hi>
driving together of the corrupted <hi>Salitter</hi> as a Lump
on a Heap.</p>
               <p>64. For the Teeth <hi>retain</hi> the word, letting the
spirit go forth <hi>leisurely</hi> between the Teeth: And this
signifieth, that the astringent quality holdeth the
Earth and Stones <hi>firmly</hi> and fast together; and yet
for all that, <hi>letteth</hi> the spirits of the Earth spring up,
grow and bear Blossoms out of the astringent spirit:
which signifieth the <hi>Regeneration or
Restitution of the spirits of the
Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>65. But that the Mouth is swiftly opened again
<hi>after</hi> the word is Ended, it signifieth concerning
the Deep above the Earth; that God the Lord will
neverthelesse dwell there, and <hi>reserve</hi> his Regiment
for himself, and hold the Devil as a Prisoner in the
wrath-fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:61095:219"/>
66. The word (<hi>GOTT</hi>) conceiveth it self in the
<hi>midst</hi> or Center upon the Tongue, and is thrust thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of the Heart, and leaveth the Mouth <hi>open,</hi>
and stayeth sitting on its Royall Seat, and soundeth
without and within: but when it is spoken forth,
then it maketh <hi>another</hi> pressure between the upper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Teeth
and the Tongue.</p>
               <p>67. And this signifieth; that when God created
Heaven and Earth, and all the Creatures, he <hi>never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse</hi>
remained in his Divine, Eternal, Almighty
Seat, and <hi>never</hi> went away from it at all, and that
HEE alone is ALL. The Last pressure, signifieth
the sharpnesse of his spirit, whereby in a Moment
he <hi>effecteth</hi> all in his whole Body.</p>
               <p>68. The word (<hi>Himmel</hi>) conceiveth it self in the
Heart, and is thrust forth to the Lips, there it is <hi>shut</hi>
up, and the syllable (<hi>-mel</hi>) setteth the Lips open
again, and is held on the middle of the Tongue, and
so the Spirit goeth forth on <hi>both Sides</hi> of the Tongue
out of the Mouth.</p>
               <p>69. And this signifieth, that the <hi>innermost</hi> birth is
become shut up from the outermost, by the horrible
Sins, and is incomprehensible to the outward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>70. But being it is a word with a <hi>Twofold</hi> syllable,
and that the second syllable <hi>-mel</hi> openeth the mouth
again, it signifieth, that the <hi>Gates</hi> of the Deity are
become opened again.</p>
               <p>71. But that by the word or syllable <hi>-mel</hi> it is
conceived again upon the Tongue, and held fast with
the upper Gumms, and that in the mean while the
spirit <hi>slippeth</hi> forth on both sides of the Tongue.</p>
               <p>72. This signifieth, that God would again
give to this corrupted Kingdome or Place in
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61095:219"/>
God, a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Great</hi> Prince, who should
open again the innermost Birth or Geniture of the
clear and Bright <hi>Deity,</hi> and thereby the Holy Ghost
should go forth on both sides, that is, out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost
Depth of the Father and of the Sonne, and
should go forth <hi>again</hi> into this world, and should
new regenerate this world again, through the
<hi>New King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>73. The word, <hi>und,</hi> conceiveth it self in the
Heart, and is staid and compacted or <hi>incorporated</hi> by
the Tongue on the upper Gummes; but when it is
<hi>let loose,</hi> it maketh another pressure from the Heart,
out at the Mouth.</p>
               <p>74. Now this signifieth the difference or <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
between the Holy and the Earthly Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.
This syllable cometh indeed from the Heart,
but is staid by the Tongue on the upper Gummes,
so that one cannot <hi>yet</hi> perceive what kind of word it
is: And this signifieth, that the earthly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Birth or Geniture, cannot lay hold on, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the innnermost Birth or Geniture, but is
foolish and silly<note n="†" place="margin">a foolish or silly Virgin.</note>.</p>
               <p>75. The last pressure from the Heart, signifieth,
that<note n="*" place="margin">the Earthly Birth.</note> it will indeed qualifie mix or <hi>unite</hi> with the
<hi>innermost</hi> Birth or Geniture in its sensibility percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Thoughts, but <hi>cannot</hi> apprehend it in its Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
therefore this syllable or word alone by it self is
Dumb, and hath no signification or understanding
in it alone, but is used onely for distinction sake,
with some <hi>other</hi> word.</p>
               <p>76. The word <hi>Erden,</hi> is thrust forth from the
Heart, and is conceived on the <hi>hinder</hi> part upon the
Tongue at the hinder Gummes, and <hi>trembleth:</hi> the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:61095:220"/>
Tongue is used about the first syllable <hi>Er-</hi> yet not
steadily, but it<note n="†" place="margin">or staggers.</note> recoiles inward at the neather
gummes, and <hi>croucheth</hi> as it were before an enemy
trembling.</p>
               <p>77. The other syllable <hi>-den,</hi> is conceived by the
Tongue and the <hi>upper</hi> Gumms, and leaveth the
Mouth open, and the spirit of formation goeth forth
at the <hi>Nostrills,</hi> and will not go forth together in this
word out at the <hi>Mouth;</hi> and though it carrieth forth
somewhat indeed along with it, yet the true Tone or
Noise of the true spirit goeth onely forth through
or at the Nostrils, or Organ of Smelling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is a great Mysterie:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>78. The word or syllable <hi>Er-</hi> signifieth the <hi>kindled</hi>
astringent and bitter quality, the earnest <hi>severe</hi> wrath
of God, which trembleth at the hinder part of the
Gummes, before which the Tongue is as it were
afraid, and croucheth at the neather gums, and flieth
as it were from an Enemy.</p>
               <p>79. The word or syllable, <hi>den,</hi> conceiveth it self
<hi>on</hi> the Tongue again, and the spirit attracteth the
power and vertue out of the word, and therewith
goeth forth <hi>another way</hi> at the Nostrills, and so goeth
therewith up into or <hi>towards</hi> the Brain before the
Royal Seat. And this signifieth, that the outermost
<hi>Salitter</hi> of the Earth is <hi>eternally</hi> rejected from Gods
Light and <hi>Holinesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>80. But, that the Spirit layeth hold on the <hi>power</hi>
and vertue of the word, and goeth another way
through the Nostrills into the Brain before the
Throne of the Senses or <hi>Thoughts;</hi> it signifieth, that
God will <hi>extract</hi> the Heart of the Earth from the
wrath of wickednesse, and <hi>use</hi> it to his eternal Royal
Praise.</p>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:61095:220"/>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>81. He will extract from the Earth the <hi>Kernel,</hi>
and the Best or the Good Spirit, and will <hi>Regenerate</hi>
it anew, to his honour and Glory.</p>
               <p>82. <hi>Here, O Man, consider
thy self well,</hi> and mind, What manner of
seed thou sowest into the Earth, the very same will
spring up, and bear Blossoms and fruit <hi>for ever,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Love or in the Wrath.</p>
               <p>83. But when the good shall be separated from
the Evil, then thou wilt live in <hi>that part,</hi> which thou
hast laboured for, here, be it either in Heaven or in
Hell-fire.</p>
               <p>84. In<note n="†" place="margin">Whether Heavenly or Hellish, Good or Evil matter or thing.</note> what soever thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavourest,
Labourest and actest
here, into that thy Soul goeth,

               <p>85. Or dost thou think, that my spirit hath suck'd
this which I have set down here out of the corrupted
Earth, or out of an Old Felt Hatt, or Old Shoe?</p>
               <p>86. Truly no; for the spirit at this Time of my
description and setting it down did <hi>unite</hi> and qualifie
or mix with the deepest Birth or Geniture of God;
in <hi>that,</hi> I have received my knowledge, and from
thence it is sucked, not in great Earthly Joy, but in
the anxious Birth or Geniture, <hi>perplexity</hi> and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>87. For what I did hereupon undergo suffer and
endure from the Devill and the Hellish quality,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:61095:221"/>
which as well doth rule in my <hi>outward</hi> Man, as in
all Men whatsoever: this thou canst not apprehend,
unlesse thou also <hi>Dancest</hi> in this Round.</p>
               <p>88. Had not our Philosophers and Doctors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

               </p>
               <p>91. When God had driven the corrupted <hi>Salitter</hi>
of Earth and Stones, which had generated it self in
the outermost Birth, by the <hi>kindling,</hi> together on a
Heap as in a Lump, then, for that cause, the third
Birth or Geniture in Nature in the <hi>Deep,</hi> above the
Earth, was not pure and Bright, because the wrath
of God did <hi>yet burn</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:61095:221"/>
92. And though the innermost Birth or Geniture
was light and Bright, yet the outermost, which stood
in the wrath-fire, could not <hi>comprehend</hi> it, but was
altogether dark.</p>
               <p>93. For <hi>Moses</hi> writeth, in <hi>Genesis</hi> 1.
<q>
                     <l>Und es war Finster auff der Tieffe:</l>
                     <l>And it was Dark on the Deep:</l>
                  </q>
The word (<hi>auff) <hi>on,</hi>
                  </hi> signifieth the <hi>outermost</hi> Birth or
Geniture, and the word (<hi>in</hi>) signifieth the <hi>innermost</hi>
Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>94. But if the innermost Birth had been dark, then
the wrath of God had <hi>rested</hi> in this world Eternally,
and it would never have been Light: but the wrath
hath <hi>not</hi> thus touched or reached the Heart of God.</p>
               <p>95. Therefore He is a sweet, friendly, Bounteous,
Good, Meek, Pure and <hi>Mercifull</hi> God, according to
his Heart in the <hi>innermost</hi> Birth or Geniture in the
place of this world, and still continueth to be so:
and his meek Love presseth forth from his Heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

quencheth the same, and therefore <hi>Sprach Er, he said,

               </p>
               <p>96. The word (<hi>Sprach</hi>) or <hi>said,</hi> is spoken after
the manner of Men: Ye Philosophers, open your
Eyes, I will in my simplicity teach you, the
<hi>[Sprach Gottes]</hi> the Speech Speaking or Language
of God, as, when he saith a thing; and indeed, it
<hi>must be</hi> so.</p>
               <p>97. The word, <hi>Sprach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> conceiveth itself <hi>between</hi>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:61095:222"/>
the Teeth, for they bite or joyn <hi>close</hi> together, and
the spirit hisseth forth through the Teeth, and the

its forepoint, as if it did listen after the hissing,
and were <hi>afraid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>98. But when the spirit conceiveth the word,

in the bitter and astringent Quality.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>This is a great Mysterie,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>101. Here observe the sense and meaning, if thou
apprehendest it, then thou <hi>understandest</hi> the Deity
a right, if not, then thou art yet blind in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>102. <hi>Judge not,</hi> else here thou run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
counter against a strong Gate, and wilt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd:
if the wrath-fire catcheth thee, then thou
wilt remain <hi>eternally</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>103. Thou Child of Man: Behold now, how
great a <hi>Gate</hi> of Heaven, of Hell, and of the Earth,
as also of the whole Deity, the spirit openeth to
thee.</p>
               <p>104. Thou shouldest <hi>not</hi> think, that God at that
time did speak in that way as Men do, and that it
was but a <hi>weak</hi> impotent word, like <hi>Mans</hi> word.</p>
               <p>105. Indeed Mans word conceiveth it self just in
such a <hi>form,</hi> manner, proportion, quality, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency;
onely the <hi>half dead</hi> Man doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it: And this understanding is very noble
dear and pretious, for it is generated onely in the
knowledge of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>106. But Gods Word, which He spake then in
power, hath encompassed Heaven and Earth, and
the heaven of heavens; yes, and the <hi>whole</hi> Deity
also.</p>
               <p>107. But it frameth ann conceiveth it self first
between the Teeth closed or <hi>clapp'd</hi> together, and
<hi>hisseth,</hi> which signifieth, that the Holy Ghost at
the beginning of the Creation went through the
firmly closed <hi>wall</hi> of the Third and outermost Birth
or Geniture, which standeth in the <hi>wrath</hi>-fire in this
world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:61095:223"/>
108. For it is written, <hi>And it was dark on the
Deep, and the Spirit of God moved on the water.</hi> The
<hi>Deep</hi> signifieth the <hi>innermost</hi> Birth or Geniture; and
the <hi>darknesse</hi> signifieth the <hi>outermost</hi> corrupt Birth or
Geniture, in which the wrath burned. The <hi>water</hi>
signifieth the allaying or <hi>Mitigation</hi> of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>109. But that the spirit doth <hi>hisse</hi> through the
Teeth, it signifieth, that the spirit <hi>is gone forth</hi> from
the heart of God through the wrath: but, that the
Teeth remain <hi>closed</hi> together, whilest the spirit his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and do not open themselves, it signifieth, that
the wrath <hi>hath not</hi> comprehended or reached the
Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>110. But that the Tongue doth <hi>crouch</hi> towards the
neather gums, and is sharp at the point, and will
not be used about the hissing; it signifieth, that the
<hi>outward Birth</hi> or Geniture, together with all the
Creatures which are therein,<note n="†" place="margin">The Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive the things of God. Query the Text.</note> 
                  <hi>cannot</hi> comprehend
or reach to apprehend the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> which goeth
forth out of the innermost Birth or Geniture out from
the Heart of God, neither can they hinder him by
their power.</p>
               <p>111. For he goeth and penetrateth through <hi>all</hi>
shut or closed Doors, Closets and Births, and needs
no Opening of them; as the Teeth cannot stay or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the spirit or <hi>breath</hi> from going or <hi>passing</hi> through
them.</p>
               <p>112. But that the Lips stand open, when it is
come hissing through the Teeth, it signifieth, that
<note n="*" place="margin">the Holy Ghost.</note> he with his going forth out of the Heart of God, in
the Creation of this world, hath <hi>opened</hi> again the
<hi>Gates</hi> of heaven, and is gone through the Gates of
Gods wrath, and hath left the <hi>wrath</hi> of God strongly
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:61095:223"/>
shut and bolted up, and hath left the Devil his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
kindled wrath-house <hi>close</hi> locked up, out of
which he cannot come Eternally.</p>
               <p>113. It further signifieth, that the Holy Ghost in
like manner hath an <hi>open Gate</hi> in the wrath-house of
this world, where he may drive and perform his
work, <hi>incomprehensibly</hi> as to the Gates of Hell, and
where he gathereth or congregateth a <hi>holy Seed</hi> to
his eternal Praise, against or without the will of
the strong fast shut hellish Gates, and altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibly
as to <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>114. But as the spirit effecteth his going forth,
and his conceived or intended will, through the
Teeth, and yet the <hi>Teeth</hi> do not stir; <hi>nor can</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the will of the spirit: so the Holy Ghost
also, without the apprehension or comprehension,
either, of the <hi>Devill</hi> or of the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, buildeth
or erecteth continually a holy Seed and Temple in
the house of <hi>this</hi> world.</p>
               <p>115. But that the whole word <hi>Sprach</hi> [said]
formeth or conceiveth it self at the <hi>hinder</hi> gummes
on the Tongue in the <hi>hollow</hi> hole in the Center of the
astringent and bitter quality, and <hi>snarleth;</hi> it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
that God hath conceived or framed the place
of this world at the heart in the midst or Center of
it, and hath built to himself again a house to his
praise, against all the grumbling murmuring and
<hi>snarling</hi> of the Devill; in <hi>which</hi> he ruleth with his
Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>116. And as the spirit goeth forth from the heart
through the grumbling murmuring and snarling of
the bitter and astringent quality very <hi>strongly</hi> and
powerfully, and with its going forth ruleth in the
astringent and bitter quality, incomprehensibly as
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:61095:224"/>
to the astringent and bitter quality as a potent King:
so also the Spirit of God ruleth in the <hi>outermost</hi> Birt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or Geniture of this world (in the wrath-house) <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,</hi>
and generateth to himself a Temple therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibly
as to the wrath-house.</p>
               <p>117. But that the astringent and bitter spirit doth
so <hi>grumble</hi> and murmur, when the spirit from the
Heart goeth through its House, and ruleth power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
it signifieth, that the wrath of God, together
with the Devils, are in the house of this world, <hi>set</hi>
in opposition to the Love, so that <hi>both</hi> these, all the
time of this world, must fight and <hi>strive</hi> one against
the other, as two Armies in the Field; <hi>from
whence also wars and fightings
among Men, and among Beasts,
and All Creatures have their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>118. But, that the astringent and bitter quality
conceive themselves <hi>together</hi> with the word, and
unite and agree one with another, and yet the spirit
of <hi>the Heart onely</hi> speaketh forth the word at the
Mouth: it signifieth, that <hi>all</hi> Creatures, which were
onely produced and put forth by the word, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Beasts, Fowls, Fishes, Worms, Trees, Leaves, Herbs
and Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse, were formed from the <hi>whole</hi> Body, being
Good and Evill.</p>
               <p>119. And that, in all these, there <hi>would stand</hi> both
the angry and corrupt quality, and also the love of
God; and yet all would be <hi>driven on</hi> by the spirit of
Love, though those two would disturb, rub, plague,
squeeze and <hi>vex</hi> one another.</p>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:61095:224"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi>
               </p>
               <p>120. Whereby then, in many a Creature the
wrath-fire would be so very <hi>hard kindled,</hi> that the
Body together with the spirit, will afford and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an Eternal wrath-<hi>Salitter</hi> in Hell.</p>
               <p>121. For, the spirit, which is generated in the
Heart, must in its Body walk through the midst or
Center of the <hi>Hellish</hi> Gates, and may very <hi>easily</hi> be
kindled, they are as wood and fire, which will burn,
if thou pourest no water in among them.</p>
               <p>122. O man, thou wert not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together with and as the
Beasts, by the word, from Good
and Evill; and if thou hadst not
eaten of good and Evil, then the
Wrath-fire would not have been
in thee, but by that means thou
hast also gotten a bestial Body:
It is done, The Love of God take
pity, and have Mercy in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
               <p>123. But, that <hi>after</hi> the conceiving and compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word together in the astringent quality at
the hinder gums upon the Tongue, the Mouth <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
it self <hi>wide,</hi> and the compacted and united spirit
goeth forth together at the Mouth, which Spirit is
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:61095:225"/>
generated <hi>both</hi> ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Heart, and also out of the
astringent and bitter quality: it signifieth, that the
creatures would live in great anguish and <hi>adversity,</hi>
and would not be able to generate through one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but through <hi>Two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>124. For the Astringent and bitter quality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the power from the spirit out of the Heart, and
infecteth or affecteth it self therewith: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is Nature now become <hi>too weak</hi> in the spirit of
the heart, and is not able to elevate its own inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Birth of the Heart, and <hi>for that cause</hi> Nature
hath brought forth a Male and a Female.</p>
               <p>125. Thus it denoteth also the Evil and Good
will, in the whole or <hi>universall</hi> Nature, and in all
the Creatures; that there would be a continuall
wrestling fighting and destroying, from whence this
world is <hi>rightly called</hi> a valley of Misery, full of
Crosses, Persecutions, Toyles and Labours. For
when the spirit of Creation entred into the midst
and <hi>interposed</hi> its power, it was fain to make and
for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Creation in the <hi>midst</hi> or center of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Hell.</p>
               <p>126. And now seeing the outermost Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
in Nature, is <hi>Two-fold,</hi> that is, both Evill and
Good, <hi>therefore</hi> it is that there is a <hi>perpetual</hi> torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
squeezing, lamenting and howling; and the
Creatures in this life are subject to torments, and
afflictions, so that <hi>this Evill World is
justly call'd a murtherous Denne
of the Devill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>127. But, that the astringent and bitter spirit <hi>sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
still</hi> in its seat at the hinder gums on the Tongue,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:61095:225"/>
and <hi>thrusteth</hi> forth the word at the Mouth, and yet
cannot get away from thence; it signifieth, that the
Devil and the wrath of God <hi>would</hi> indeed be domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
in all the Creatures, yet should not have
<hi>full power</hi> in them, but must <hi>stay</hi> in Prison, and there
would belch forth or blow into all the creatures,
and plague them, but should <hi>not</hi> overcome them,
unlesse the Creatures themselves are minded to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
there, in that place: or love to live in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and be of the conditions of the Devill, and
wrath of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>128. Just as the <hi>Meek</hi> spirit of the Heart goeth
througb the astringent and bitter quality, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
it; and though it be indeed infected with
the astringent and bitter spirit, yet it <hi>teareth</hi> and
breaketh thorough, as a Conquerour: but if it should
<hi>wilfully</hi> sit still in the hollow hole in the astringent
and bitter spirit, and suffer it self to be taken captive,
and <hi>would not</hi> fight, then the fault were its own.</p>
               <p>129. And thus it is also with those Creatures,
which will continually <hi>sowe</hi> and <hi>reap,</hi> in the Hellish
fire, especially <hi>that man,</hi> who liveth in a
<hi>continual desire</hi> of Pride, Covetousnesse, Envy and
Wrath, and will at <hi>no time</hi> fight and strive against
them with the spirit and fire of <hi>Love;</hi> such a one
himself <hi>pulleth</hi> the wrath of God, and the burning
hellish fire, upon his Body and Soul.</p>
               <p>130. But, that the Tongue doth <hi>crouch</hi> so much
towards the neather gums when the word goeth
forth, it signifieth and denoteth the animated or
<hi>soulish</hi> spirit of the Creatures, especially of <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>131. The word, which conceiveth it self at the
upper Gums, and which qualifieth or uniteth with
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:61095:226"/>
the astringent and bitter spirit, signifieth the <hi>seven
spirits of Nature,</hi> or the Astrall Birth or Geniture, in
which the Devill ruleth, and the Holy Ghost <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth</hi>
him therein, and overcometh the Devill.</p>
               <p>132. But the Tongue signifieth the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is
generated from the seven spirits of Nature, and is
their <hi>Sonne:</hi> and so now when the seven spirits will,
<hi>then</hi> the Tongue must stirre, and must perform their
<hi>demands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>133. If the Astrall spirits <hi>would not</hi> prove false,
and would not wooe the Devill to commit adultery
with him, then they would <hi>hide</hi> the animated or
<hi>soulish</hi> spirit, and hold it fast in their <hi>Bands</hi> as a
Treasure, when <hi>they fight</hi> with the Devill: Just as
they hide and cover the Tongue; when they wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
with the astringent and bitter quality; as their
best Jewel.</p>
               <p>134. Thus you have a short and <hi>real</hi> Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning the word, which God hath spoken;
rightly described in the knowledge of the <hi>Spirit</hi>
faithfully imparted according to my Gifts, and the
<hi>Talent,</hi> I am entrusted with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now it may be Asked:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then is it that God <hi>Spake,</hi> when He said;
<hi>Let there be light, and
there was Light?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Depth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>135. The <hi>Light</hi> went forth from the innermost
Birth or Geniture, and kindled it self in the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:61095:226"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It <hi>gave</hi> again to the outermost, a <hi>natural</hi> peculiar
Light of its own.</p>
               <p>136. Thou must <hi>not think,</hi> that the Light of the
Sun and of Nature is the Heart of God, which shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in secret. No; thou oughtest not to <hi>worship
the</hi> Light of Nature, it is not the Heart of God, but
it is a <hi>Kindled Light</hi> in Nature; whose Power and
Heart standeth in the unctuosity or <hi>fatnesse</hi> of the
sweet water, and of all the other spirits in the <hi>third</hi>
Birth or Geniture; and is <hi>not</hi> called God.</p>
               <p>137. And though it be generated <hi>in</hi> God and <hi>from</hi>
God, yet it is but the <hi>instrument</hi> of his handy-work
which cannot apprehend and <hi>reach back</hi> again to the
clear Deity in the deepest Birth or Geniture, as the
flesh cannot apprehend or reach the Soul.</p>
               <p>138. But it must <hi>not</hi> so be understood, as if the
Deity were <hi>separated</hi> from Nature; no, but the are
as Body and Soul: <hi>Nature</hi> is the Body, and the
<hi>Heart of God</hi> is the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now a Man might Ask:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What kind of Light then was it, which was
kindled; was it the Sun and Stars?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>139. No: the Sun and Stars were <hi>first</hi> created
but on the Fourth Day, out of <hi>that</hi> very Light:
there was a Light arisen in the seven spirits of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which had no peculiar distinct <hi>seat</hi> or place,
but did shine every where all over, but was <hi>not
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:61095:227"/>
bright</hi> like the Sun, but like an azure Blew and Light,
according to the kind and manner of the qualifying
or fountain spirits; till afterwards the right Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and kindling of the <hi>fire</hi> in the water in the
astringent spirit, followed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun.</p>

<hi>viz.</hi> in Wood, Stones, Earth, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as also in Men and Beasts.</p>
               <p>7. Moreover, I considered the little spark of
light, <hi>Man,</hi> what he should be Esteemed for, with
God in <hi>comparison</hi> of this great work and fabrick of
Heaven and Earth?</p>
               <p>8. But finding that in all things there was Evill
and Good, as well in the <hi>Elements</hi> as in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and that it went as <hi>well</hi> in this world with the
wicked, as with the vertuous honest and Godly, also
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:61095:228"/>
that the <hi>Barbarous</hi> People had the best Countries in
their possession, and that they had <hi>more Prosperity</hi> in
their wayes, then the vertuous honest and Godly
had.</p>
               <p>9. I was <hi>thereupon</hi> very Melancholy <hi>perplexed</hi> and
exceedingly troubled, no Scripture could <hi>Comfort</hi> or
satisfie me, though I was very well acquainted with
it, and <hi>versed</hi> therein; at which time the Devil would
by no means stand Idle, but was <hi>often</hi> beating into
me, many Heathenish Thoughts, which I will here
be silent in.</p>
               <p>10. But when in this <hi>affliction</hi> and trouble I ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
my spirit, which, then I understood very little
or nothing at all what it was, I <hi>earnestly</hi> raised it up
into God, as with a great storm or onset, wrapping
up my whole Heart and Mind, as also all my
<hi>Thoughts</hi> and whole will and resolution, <hi>incessantly</hi> to
wrestle with the Love and Mercy of God, and not
to give over, unlesse he blessed me, that is, unlesse
he <hi>enlightened me with his holy Spirit,</hi> whereby I might
<hi>understand</hi> his will, and be rid of my sadnesse.
<hi>And then the spirit did break
thorough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. But when, in my resolved zeal, I gave so
hard an assault storm and onset upon God, and upon
all the Gates of Hell, as if I had had more reserves
of vertue and power ready, with a <hi>resolution</hi> to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
my life upon it, which assuredly were not in
my ability, <hi>without</hi> the assistance of the Spirit of
God; <hi>suddenly</hi> after some violent Storms made, my
spirit <hi>did break thorough</hi> the Gates of Hell, even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the innermost Birth or Geniture of the Deity,
and there I was <hi>embraced</hi> with Love, as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:61095:228"/>
embraceth his dearly beloved Bride.</p>
               <p>12. But the greatnesse of the triumphing that
was in the spirit, I <hi>cannot expresse</hi> either in speaking
or writing: neither can it be compared with any
thing, but with <hi>that,</hi> wherein the life is generated in
the midst of Death, and it is <hi>like</hi> the Resurrection
from the Dead.</p>
               <p>13. In this light my spirit suddenly saw through
all, and <hi>in and by</hi> all the Creatures even in Herbs
and Grasse it knew God, Who he is, and How he is,
and What his will is: and suddenly in that light my
will was set on by a Mighty <hi>impulse,</hi> to describe
<hi>the Beeing of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. But because I could not presently apprehend
the <hi>deepest</hi> Births of God in their <hi>Beeing,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them in my <hi>Reason,</hi> there passed almost
<hi>Twelve</hi> years, before the exact understanding thereof
was given me.</p>
               <p>15. And it was with me as with a young Tree,
which is planted in the Ground, and at first is young
and <hi>tender,</hi> and flourishing to the Eye, especially if
it comes on lustily in its growing: But doth not bear
fruit <hi>presently;</hi> and though it blossometh, they fall off;
also many a cold wind, frost and snow, puffe upon
it, <hi>before</hi> it comes to any growth, and bearing of
Fruit.</p>
               <p>16. So also it went with this spirit: the first fire
was but a <hi>Seed,</hi> and not a constant lasting Light:
<hi>since that time</hi> many a cold wind blew upon it: but
the Will never extinguished.</p>
               <p>17. This Tree was also often tempted to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it would bear Fruit, and shew it self with Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms;
but the <hi>Blossoms</hi> were struck off till this very
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:61095:229"/>
time, wherein it standeth in its <hi>first</hi> Fruit in the
growth or vegetation.</p>
               <p>17. <hi>From this Light now it is,
that I have my knowledge,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
my <hi>will impulse and driving,</hi>
and therefore I will set down this knowledge in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
according to my Gift, and let God work his
will; and though I should <hi>Irritate</hi> or enrage the
whole world, the Devill, and all the Gates of Hell,
I will look on and wait what the LORD intendeth
with it.</p>
               <p>18. For I am too too <hi>weak</hi> to know his Purpose;
and though the spirit affordeth in the <hi>Light</hi> to be
known some things, which are <hi>to come,</hi> yet, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the outward man I am too weak to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the same.</p>
               <p>19. But the animated or <hi>soulish</hi> spirit, which qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth
or uniteth with God, that comprehends it
well, but the <hi>bestial Body</hi> attains onely a Glimpse
thereof, Just as if it lightned: for this is the posture
of the innermost Birth or Geniture of the soul, when
it teareth through the <hi>outermost</hi> Birth or Geniture in
the elevation of the Holy Ghost, and so breaketh
through the Gates of Hell; but the outermost Birth
presently <hi>shuts</hi> again: for the <hi>wrath</hi> of God bolteth
up the firmament, and holds it captive in its
Power.</p>
               <p>20. And then the knowledge of the outward Man
is <hi>gone,</hi> and he walketh up and down in an <hi>afflicted</hi>
and anxious Birth or Geniture, as a woman with
child, who is in her travel, and would <hi>alwaies fain</hi>
bring forth her child, but <hi>cannot,</hi> and is full of
Throes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:61095:229"/>
21. Thus it goeth also with the bestial Body, when
it hath <hi>once tasted</hi> of the sweetnesse of God, then it
continually hungreth and thirsteth after it: But
the <hi>Devil</hi> in the power of Gods wrath opposeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
and so a Man in such a course must <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually</hi>
stand in an anxious Birth or Geniture, and so
there is nothing but fighting and warring in his
Births or Genitures.</p>
               <p>22. I write not this for mine own glory, but for
a <hi>comfort</hi> to the Reader, so that if perhaps he be
minded to walk with me upon my <hi>Narrow</hi> Bridge,
he should not suddenly be discouraged dismayed
and distrustfull, when the Gates of Hell and Gods
wrath meet him, and <hi>present</hi> themselves before
him.</p>
               <p>23. When we shall come together <hi>over</hi> this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Bridge of the fleshly Birth or Geniture, to be in
yonder green Medow, to which the wrath of God
doth <hi>not</hi> reach or come, then we shall be fully <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited</hi>
for all our damages and hurts we have sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
though indeed at present the world doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
us for <hi>fooles,</hi> and we must suffer the Devill
in the power of Gods wrath, to Domineer, Rush and
roar over us: It should not trouble us, for it will
be more excellent <hi>Reputation</hi> to us in the other life,
then if in this Life we had worn a Royal Crown:
and there is so very <hi>short a time</hi> to get thither, that
it is not worth the being called a <hi>Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>24. If thou fixest thy Thoughts concerning Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and wouldst <hi>fain conceive</hi> in the Mind What it
is, and Where it is, and How it is; thou <hi>needest</hi> not
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:61095:230"/>
to swing or cast thy Thoughts many thousand Miles
off, for, that Place or that Heaven is <hi>not thy</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>25. And though indeed that is united with thy
Heaven, as <hi>one</hi> Body, and so together is <hi>But the One</hi>
Body of God, yet thou art not in that very place,
which is become a <hi>Creature</hi> aloft many hundred
thousand Miles off, but thou art in the <hi>Heaven</hi> of
this world, which containeth also in it just such a
Deep, as is not of any Humane Number, [or is Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscriptive].</p>
               <p>26. For, the <hi>true Heaven</hi> is every where, even in
that very Place where thou standest and goest, and
so when thy spirit apprehendeth the innermost
Birth or Geniture of God, and presseth in <hi>through</hi> the
astral and fleshly geniture, then it is <hi>clearly</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>27. But that there is assuredly a <hi>pure</hi> glorious
Heaven in all the three Births or Genitures aloft
above the Deep of this world, in which Gods Being
together with that of the holy Angels riseth or
<hi>springeth up,</hi> very purely, brightly beautiously and
joyfully, is <hi>undeniable</hi> and he is <hi>not</hi> born of God that
denyeth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thou must know,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. That the place of this world with its inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Birth or Geniture uniteth or qualifieth with
the Heaven aloft <hi>above us,</hi> and so there is one Heart,
one Being, one Will, <hi>one God, All in All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>29. But that the place of this world, is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Heaven, and that there is a firmament or fast
inclosure between the <hi>upper</hi> Heaven above us; it
hath this understanding or meaning, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:61095:230"/>
30. The upper Heaven compriseth the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
that of <hi>Michael</hi> and that of <hi>Uriel,</hi> and of all
the holy Angels, which are <hi>not fallen</hi> with <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
and that Heaven <hi>continueth</hi> as it was from Eternity,
before the Angels were created.</p>
               <p>31. The Other Heaven is this world, in which
<hi>Lucifer</hi> was a King, who kindled the outermost
Birth or Geniture in Nature, and that now is the
<hi>wrath</hi> of God, and cannot be called God or Heaven,
but <hi>Perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. Therefore the upper Heaven includeth it self
up so far in its outermost Birth or Geniture,
and reacheth so far as the <hi>wrath</hi> of God reacheth,
and so far as the Government or Dominion of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi>
hath reached, for the corrupted or perished
Birth or Geniture cannot comprehend the <hi>Pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>33. That is, the outermost Birth or Geniture of
this world cannot comprehend the outermost Birth
or Geniture of Heaven <hi>aloft</hi> above this world, for
they are one to the other as the Life and the Death,
or as a <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>a Stone</hi> are one to the other.</p>
               <p>34. And therefore there is a strong firmament or
inclosure between the <hi>outermost</hi> Birth or Geniture of
the upper Heaven, and that of this world: for the
firmament between them is <hi>Death,</hi> which ruleth
and reigneth every where in the outermost birth in
<hi>this</hi> world, and this world is so bolted up therewith,
that the <hi>outermost</hi> Birth of the <hi>upper</hi> Heaven cannot
come into the outermost Birth of this world, there
is a great Cliff or Gulph between them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in our outermost Birth or Geniture we cannot
<hi>see</hi> the Angels, neither can the Angels dwell with
us in the <hi>outermost</hi> Birth of this world, but in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost</hi>
they dwell with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:61095:231"/>
36. And so when we fight with the Devill, they
keep off his Blowes in the innermost Birth, and are
the Defence and Protection of the <hi>holy</hi> Soul.</p>
               <p>37. Therefore we can neither see nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the holy Angels: for the outermost Birth of
<hi>their Body</hi> is incomprehensible to the outermost Birth
or Geniture of this world.</p>
               <p>38. The second Birth of this world standeth in
the life, for it is the <hi>Astral</hi> Birth, out of which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
the <hi>third</hi> and holy Birth or Geniture, and
therein Love and wrath <hi>strive</hi> one with the other.</p>
               <p>39. For the second Birth standeth in the seven
qualifying or fountain spirits of this world, and is
in all places, and in all the Creatures, as also in
Man: But the Holy Ghost also ruleth and reigneth
in the <hi>second</hi> birth, and helpeth to generate the <hi>third</hi>
holy Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>40. But this third Birth or Geniture is the clear
and <hi>holy Heaven,</hi> which qualifieth or uniteth with
the Heart of God without distinct and above all
Heavens, as one Heart; also they are the one Heart,
which holdeth and <hi>beareth up</hi> or sustaineth the place
of this world, and holdeth the Devil Captive in the
outermost birth in the Anger fire, as <hi>an Almighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible</hi>
God.</p>
               <p>41. And out of this Heart, <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS
CHRIST</hi> the Sonne of
God, in the Womb or Body of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> went into all the
three Births or Genitures, and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61095:231"/>
assumed them really, that He
might through and with his inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Birth or Geniture, take the
Devill Death and Hell Captive
in the outermost Birth, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the wrath of God as a King
and Victorious Prince; and in the
power of his Geniture or Birth
in the flesh, presse thorough all
Men.</p>
               <p>42. And so by this entring of the innermost Birth
of the Heart of the Heaven of this world, into the
<hi>Astrall</hi> and outermost, is JESUS CHRIST the
Sonne of God and of <hi>Mary,</hi> become the <hi>Lord</hi> and
<hi>King</hi> of this our Heaven and Earth, who ruleth
and <hi>reigneth</hi> in all the three Births or Genitures over
Sin, the Devil, Death, and Hell, and so <hi>we with him,</hi>
presse through the sinful corrupted and outermost
dead Birth or Geniture of the flesh, <hi>through Death</hi> and
<hi>the wrath of God</hi> into our Heaven.</p>
               <p>43. <hi>In this Heaven</hi> now <hi>sitteth Our
King</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>at the right hand of God,</hi>
and encompasseth or surroundeth all the three Births,
as <hi>an almighty Sonne of the Father,</hi>
who is present in and throughout all the three Births
in this world in all Corners and Places, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth,
holdeth, and beareth up or sustaineth
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:61095:232"/>
all, as a new Born Sonne of the Father, in the power
and upon the Seat or <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>once</hi> Great migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Potent, and <hi>now expell'd,</hi> accursed, and Damned;
King <hi>Lucifer</hi> the Devill.</p>
               <p>44. Therefore thou child of man, be not discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
be not so timorous and pusillanimous: for if
thou sowest in thy zeal and earnest sincerity <hi>the seed
of thy Teares,</hi> thou dost not sow it in Earth, but in
<hi>Heaven;</hi> for in thy astral Birth, thou sowest, and
in thy animated or soulish Birth, thou reapest, and
in the Kingdom of heaven thou, possessest and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
it.</p>
               <p>45. While thou livest in this strugling or <hi>striving</hi>
Birth or Geniture, thou must Buckle and suffer the
Devil to ride upon thee: but so hard as he striketh
thee, so hard thou must strike him again, if thou
wilt defend thy self. For when thou fightest against
him, thou <hi>stirrest</hi> up his wrath-fire, and destroyest
his Nest, and this is then, as a great <hi>combustion,</hi> and
as a great strong Battel maintained against him.</p>
               <p>46. And though thy Body perhaps is put hard to
it and suffers pain in misery, yet it is much worse
with him when he is vanquished, for then he roareth
like a Lion, which is <hi>robbed</hi> of her young whelps, for
the fiercenesse and wrath of God <hi>tormenteth</hi> him: but
if thou lettest him Lodge <hi>within</hi> thee, then he grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
fat and <hi>wanton,</hi> and will <hi>vanquish thee,</hi> in
Time.</p>
               <p>47. Thus thou hast a real description of <hi>Heaven:</hi>
And though perhaps <hi>thou</hi> canst not in thy Reason
conceive it: Yet <hi>I can</hi> very well Conceive it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consider Rationally and seriously upon it:
What God is.</p>
               <p>48. Thou seest in this world Nothing but the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:61095:232"/>
                  <hi>Deep,</hi> and therein the Stars, and the Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Elements: now wilt thou say, God is <hi>not</hi>
there? 'pray then what was there in that place <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
the time of the world? Wilt thou say, there
was Nothing: then thou speakest <hi>without</hi> Reason,
for thou must <hi>needs</hi> say, that God was there, or else
nothing would there have come to be.</p>
               <p>49. Now if God were <hi>there</hi> then, who hath thrust
him <hi>out</hi> from thence, or vanquished him, that he
should be there <hi>no</hi> more? But if God be there, then
he is indeed in his <hi>Heaven,</hi> and moreover, in his <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>50. But the Devil hath kindled the Bath or Lake
of wrath, whence the Earth and Stones, also the
Elements, are become so fluctuating, as also cold
bitter and hot, and so hath<note n="†" place="margin">killed <hi>or</hi> murthered.</note> 
                  <hi>destroyed</hi> the outermost
Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>51. Whereupon now this Treatise and my whole
purpose is to describe, how it is come to be living
and <hi>revived</hi> again, and how it regenerateth it self
again. And from<note n="*" place="margin">the wrath Bath.</note> thence also in the Creatures the
<hi>beastial Flesh</hi> is come to be, but <hi>Sin</hi> in the Flesh is
the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Question, which is chiefly treated of in this
Book, is this, viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where then shall the Wrath of God become?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>52. Here the spirit answereth, that at the <hi>End</hi> of
the Time of <hi>this</hi> corrupted Birth or Geniture <hi>after</hi>
the Resurrection from the Dead, this place or space,
where the Earth now is, will be given to the <hi>Devill</hi>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:61095:233"/>
for a propriety or Possession and <hi>House of wrath,</hi> yet
<hi>not</hi> through and in all the three Births or Genitures,
but onely in the <hi>outermost,</hi> in which he <hi>now</hi> standeth:
But the innermost will hold him Captive in its
might and strength, and use him for a <hi>footstool,</hi> or as
the Dust under its foot, which innermost Birth he
will never be able either to comprehend or to
<hi>touch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>53. For it hath <hi>not</hi> this understanding or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the wrath-fire should be <hi>extinguished,</hi> and
be no more; for then the Devils also must become
<hi>Holy</hi> Angels again, and live in the holy Heaven: but
that <hi>not</hi> being so; a Hole Burrough or Dungeon in
this world must remain, to be <hi>their</hi> Habitation.</p>
               <p>54. If Mans Eyes were but <hi>opened,</hi> he should see
God every where in his Heaven; for Heaven stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the innermost Birth or Geniture every where.</p>
               <p>55. Moreover <hi>when Stephen saw the Heaven opened,
and the Lord JESUS at the right hand of God,</hi> there his
spirit did not first swing it self up aloft into the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Heaven, but it penetrated or pressed into the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost</hi>
Birth or Geniture, wherein Heaven is every
where.</p>
               <p>56. Neither must thou think, that the <hi>Deity</hi> is
such a kind of Being as is <hi>onely</hi> in the upper Heaven,
and that the Soul when it departeth from the Body,
goeth up <hi>aloft</hi> into the upper Heaven many hundred
thousand Miles off,</p>
               <p>57. It <hi>needeth</hi> not do that, but it is set or put into
the innermost Birth, and there it is with God, and <hi>in</hi>
God, and with all the holy Angels, and can sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be above, and suddenly beneath, it is not <hi>hindred</hi>
by any thing.</p>
               <p>58. For in the innermost Birth, the upper and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61095:233"/>
neather Deity is <hi>one Body,</hi> and is an open Gate: the
Holy Angels converse and walk up and down in the
innermost Birth of this world <hi>by</hi> and <hi>with</hi> our King
JESUS CHRIST, as well as in the uppermost

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>70. Yes: the Life presseth thorough Death: the
<hi>outermost</hi> Birth is the Death: the <hi>second</hi> is the Life,
which standeth in the wrath-fire and in the Love;
And the <hi>Third</hi> is the Holy Life.</p>

               <p>71. The outward Earth is a bitter stinck, and is
dead, and that every man understandeth to be so.
But the <hi>Salitter</hi> is destroyed or killed through Death:
for thou canst not deny, but that <hi>Gods wrath</hi> is in the
Earth, otherwise it would not be so astringent, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

it engender such poisonous venomous Evill worms

thou knowest Nothing, be <hi>silent</hi> and attentive.</p>
               <p>37. Before the Times of the Creation He sate in
the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the Earth, when it was yet Thin or
Transparent, and stood in a heavenly holy Birth or
Geniture, and was in the <hi>whole</hi> Kingdom of this
world, therein it was neither Earth nor Stones, but
a heavenly <hi>Seed,</hi> which was generated out of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
qualifying or fountain spirits of Nature; for
therein sprung up heavenly fruits forms and Ideas,
which were a pleasant <hi>delightfull food</hi> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>74. But when the <hi>wrath</hi> did <hi>burn</hi> therein, then it
was killed and destroyed in Death: Yet not so to be
understood, as if it were therefore altogether <hi>quite</hi>
dead: For <hi>how</hi> can any thing in God dye <hi>totally,</hi> that
hath had its Life from eternity?</p>
               <p>75. But I. the <hi>outermost</hi> Birth or Geniture was
burnt up, frozen, drown'd, stupified, chilled, and
stark benummed.</p>
               <p>76. But II. the <hi>Second Birth</hi> or Geniture gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
the Life again in the outermost.</p>
               <p>77. And III. the <hi>Third</hi>

the <hi>Holy</hi> Life, which standeth in the power
of the Love.</p>
               <p>78. And in this same Birth or Geniture shall <hi>those</hi>
Dead arise who have sown a <hi>holy</hi> Seed, and <hi>those</hi> who
have sown in the <hi>wrath,</hi> will arise in the Wrath-fire:
for the Earth will <hi>revive</hi> and be living again: seeing
the Deity in <hi>Christ</hi> hath regenerated <hi>it</hi> a new again
through his <hi>Flesh,</hi> and exalted <hi>it</hi> to the right hand of
God: but the wrath-fire <hi>abideth</hi> in its own Birth or

                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:61095:235"/>
79. But if thou sayst, that there is <hi>no</hi> Life in the
Earth, thou speakest as one that is <hi>blind;</hi> for thou
mayst see plainly, that Herbs and Grasse grow out
of it:</p>
               <p>80. But if thou sayst, it hath but <hi>one</hi> kind of
Birth or Geniture: thou speakest again also like one
that is <hi>blind:</hi> for the Herbs and Wood, which grow
out of it, are <hi>not</hi> Earth, neither is the <hi>fruit</hi> which
groweth upon a Tree, wood; so also the power and
<hi>vertue</hi> of the Fruit is <hi>not</hi> God, neither; but<note n="†" place="margin">Note how God is in all things, yet no Creature is He.</note> God is

               <p>
                  <hi>Another Question is,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then is the Earth so Mountainy, Hilly,
Rocky, Stony, and uneven?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>81. The Hills came to be so in the driving toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or <hi>Compaction:</hi> for the <hi>corrupted Salitter</hi> was
more abounding in one place, then in another; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
as the wheel of God was, as to its innate
instanding or instant qualifying or fountain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>82. For in <hi>those</hi> Places, where the sweet water in
the standing wheel of God was chief or <hi>predominant,</hi>
there much Earthly comprehensible or <hi>palpable</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came to be.</p>
               <p>83. But where the astringent Quality in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61095:236"/>
in <hi>Mercurius</hi> was chief or predominant,
there much <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> came to be.</p>
               <p>84. But where the Heat in the Light was chief
or predominant, there much <hi>Silver,</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> as also
some fair <hi>clear Stones,</hi> in the flash of the <hi>Light</hi> came
to be; but especially where the Love in the Light
was chief or predominant, there the most <hi>pretious
Stones</hi> or Jewels, as also the best purest and <hi>finest
Gold</hi> came to be.</p>
               <p>85. But when the Lump of the Earth was press'd
and compacted together, then thereby the water
came to be <hi>squeezed</hi> and pressed forth: but where
it was <hi>inclosed</hi> and press'd in with the astringent
quality by hard Rocks, there it is yet in the Earth
still, and hath since that time worn and made some
great Holes or <hi>Veins</hi> for its passage.</p>
               <p>86. In those places, where there are great Lakes
and <hi>Seas,</hi> there the <hi>water</hi> was chief or predominant
over that place in that Zenith or <hi>Elevatien</hi> of the
Pole; and there not being much <hi>Salitter</hi> in that
place, there came to be as it were a Dale or Valley,
wherein the water remained standing.</p>
               <p>87. For the thin water seeketh for the valley, and
is an <hi>humility</hi> of the life, which did not elevate it
self, as the astringent, bitter and fire's Quality hath
done in those Creatures the <hi>Devils:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>88. Therefore it alwaies seeketh the <hi>Lowest</hi> Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Earth; which rightly signifieth or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
the spirit of <hi>meeknesse,</hi> in which the life is Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated:
as you may read concerning the Creation
of Man, as also before, concerning the Species or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Water, Meeknesse, and such Qualities.</p>

               <p>99. <hi>The Writer</hi> Moses <hi>saith,</hi> Gen. 1. God sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the Light from the Darknesse, and called the Light
Day, and the Darknesse, Night, so out of Evening and
Morning, the first Day came to be.</p>
               <p>100. But being these words, <hi>Evening,</hi> and <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
are contrary to the Current of Philosophie and
Reason, therefore it may be conceived, <hi>that Moses</hi> was
not the sole Original Author thereof, but that it was
derived down to him from his Forefathers, who
reckoned <hi>all</hi> the <hi>six</hi> Dayes of the Creation in one
<hi>continued course,</hi> and preserved and kept the memory
of the Creation, from <hi>Adam,</hi> in an <hi>obscure</hi> word, and
<hi>so left</hi> it to posterity.</p>
               <p>101. For Evening and Morning were <hi>not</hi> before the
Time of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> which most certainly and
really were first created but on the <hi>Fourth Day,</hi> which
I shall demonstrate from an assured certain ground,
concerning the Creation of the Sun and Stars.</p>
               <p>102. But there was <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night,</hi> which I will
here declare according to my knowledge: Thou
must here <hi>once</hi> more open the Eyes of thy spirit
wide, if thou intendest to understand it; if <hi>not,</hi> then
thou wilt remain <hi>blind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>103. <hi>And though</hi> this great work in Man hath
remained <hi>hidden</hi> till this very day, yet God be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
it will now <hi>once be Day,</hi> for the Day-spring or

Now thou Objectest:</hi>

               <p>105. But there was not a <hi>twofold</hi> Creation of Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>107. But when it cometh forth upon the Tongue,
then the Tongue and the upper Gums <hi>close</hi> the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61095:238"/>
mouth, but when the spirit thrusteth at the Teeth,
and will go forth, then the Tongue <hi>openeth the mouth</hi>
at the Teeth, and will go forth before the word, and
doth as it were <hi>leap</hi> for Joy <hi>forth</hi> at the mouth.</p>
               <p>108. But when the word breaketh thorough, then
the Mouth <hi>within</hi> openeth wide, and the word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
it self <hi>once more</hi> with its sound behind the
astringent and bitter qualities, and rouzeth them up,
as if they were <hi>lazy</hi> sleepers in the Darknesse, and
goeth forth <hi>suddenly</hi> out at the Mouth.</p>
               <p>109. And then the astringent quality <hi>drayleth</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it as a drowzie Man, which is awakened from
sleep: but the bitter spirit which goeth forth from
the fire flash, lyeth <hi>still,</hi> and heareth or regardeth
<hi>not, neither</hi> doth move.</p>
               <p>These are very great things,
and not so slight matters, as the
Country-Man supposeth.</p>
               <p>110. Now, that the spirit first conceiveth it self
at the heart, and breaketh through all <hi>Watches</hi> and
Guards till it come upon the Tongue, unperceived,
or unobserved: it signifieth, that the Light Brake
forth out of the Heart of God, through the <hi>corrupted,</hi>
outermost, fierce, <hi>dead,</hi> bitter and astringent Birth
or Geniture in the <hi>Nature</hi> of this world, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibly
both as to Death and the Devill, together
with the wrath of God, as it is written in the Gospel
of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1. Chap. verse 5. <hi>The Light
shone in the Darknesse, and the
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:61095:239"/>
Darknesse comprehended it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>111. But that the Tongue and the upper Gums
<hi>close</hi> the Mouth, when the spirit cometh upon the
Tongue: it signifieth, that the seven qualifying or
fountain Spirits of Nature in <hi>this</hi> world, at the time
of the Creation were <hi>not mortified</hi> and Dead through
the wrath of God, but were <hi>lively</hi> active and <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi>
For the Tongue signifieth or denoteth the life
of Nature, in which standeth the animated <hi>Soulish</hi>
and Holy Birth or Geniture: for it is a<note n="†" place="margin">Prefiguration or Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</note> Type of the
Soul.</p>
               <p>112. But that the Spirit suddenly <hi>affecteth</hi> the
Tongue, when it cometh upon it, whereupon it
leapeth for Joy, and will go <hi>before</hi> the Spirit forth at
the Mouth; it signifieth, that the seven qualifying
or fountain spirits of Nature, which are called the
<hi>Astrall</hi> Birth: when the Light of God, which is
called the <hi>Day,</hi> rose up in them, they suddenly gat the
<hi>Divine</hi> Life and Will, and so highly rejoyced, as the
Tongue in the Mouth here doth.</p>
               <p>113. But that the <hi>fore</hi> Gums widen <hi>inward,</hi> and
give room for the spirit to do as it pleaseth: it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
that the <hi>whole</hi> Astral Birth yielded it self very
friendly and Courteously to the <hi>will</hi> of the Light, and
did not awaken the fiercenesse in it.</p>
               <p>114. But that the spirit, when it goeth forth at the
Mouth, conceiveth it self yet <hi>once more</hi> behind the
astringent quality upon the Tongue at the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
gums, and awakeneth or rouzeth up the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality, being as it were <hi>asleep,</hi> and then goeth
suddenly forth at the Mouth;</p>
               <p>115. It signifieth, I. that the <hi>astringent</hi> spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
must hold preserve and Image or frame all in
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:61095:239"/>
the whole Nature, but it is <hi>after</hi> the spirit of the
<hi>Light</hi> hath <hi>first</hi> formed it, and that then first the
Light awakeneth the <hi>astringent</hi> spirit, and giveth all
into the Hands <hi>thereof</hi> to hold or preserve it.</p>
               <p>116. And that must be, because of the outermost
comprehensibility or <hi>Palpability,</hi> which must be held
and sustained by the <hi>astringent</hi> fiercenesse, else no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would subsist in its <hi>Body,</hi> neither could the
compressed Compacted Earth and Stones subsist;
but would be again a broken Thick muddy and
<hi>dark Salitter,</hi> such as at first <hi>moved</hi> in the whole
Deep.</p>
               <p>117. It signifieth also, 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> that this <hi>Salitter,</hi> at last,
when the spirit hath done with its <hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>work,</hi>
in this world; shall be rouzed up and <hi>revived</hi> at the
Last Judgment Day.</p>
               <p>118. But, that the spirit conceiveth it self <hi>behind</hi>
the astringent quality, and not <hi>in</hi> the astringent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and so awakeneth or rouzeth it up: it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that the astringent Nature will <hi>not comprehend</hi>
the Light of God in its <hi>own</hi> proper Way, but shall
<hi>rejoyce</hi> in the Light of the <hi>Grace,</hi> and be awakened
or raised up thereby, and <hi>perform</hi> the <hi>will</hi> of the
Light, as the beastial Body of Man effecteth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
the will of the spirit, and yet these are <hi>not
two</hi> severed Things.</p>
               <p>119. But why the bitter spirit <hi>lyeth still,</hi> and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heareth nor comprehendeth or apprehendeth
the work of the spirit, it signifieth, that the bitter
wrath-fire, which existeth in the flash of fire, at the
time of the Birth or Geniture of the <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>still
also,</hi> is not awakened by the Light, also doth not
comprehend it, but lyeth <hi>Captive</hi> imprisoned in the
outermost Birth or Geniture, and must give leave
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:61095:240"/>
to the spirit of Light, to do its work in Nature, how
it <hi>pleaseth,</hi> and yet can neither see, hear nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the <hi>work</hi> of the Light.</p>
               <p>120. Therefore <hi>no Man</hi> ought to think, that the
Devill is <hi>able</hi> to tear the works of the Light, out of
his Heart, for he can neither see nor comprehend
them: And though he rageth and raveth in the
outermost Birth in the <hi>Flesh</hi> as in his Castle of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
or Fort of Prey; be not discouraged or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd:
onely take heed <hi>thou thy self</hi> bring not the
works of wrath into the <hi>Light</hi> of thy Heart, and then
thy soul will be <hi>safe enough</hi> from the <hi>deaf</hi> and <hi>dumb
Devill,</hi> who is <hi>blind</hi> in the Light.</p>
               <p>121. Thou shouldst not suppose, that which I write
here, to be as a <hi>doubtful</hi> Opinion, questionable whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be so or no: For, the Gate of Heaven and
Hell standeth open to the spirit, and in the light
presseth through them <hi>both,</hi> and beholdeth them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
proveth or Examineth them: for the Astrall Birth
or Geniture liveth <hi>between</hi> them both; and must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be squeezed.</p>
               <p>122. And though the Devil <hi>cannot</hi> take the Light
from me, yet he <hi>hideth</hi> or <hi>eclipseth</hi> it often with the
outward and fleshly Birth or Geniture, so that the
Astrall Birth or Geniture is in <hi>anxiety,</hi> and in a
straight, as if it were captivated or imprisoned.</p>
               <p>123. And these onely are his <hi>Blowes</hi> and <hi>Strokes,</hi>
whereby the Mustard Seed is overwhelmed, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and obscured: Concerning which also the Holy
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>that a great Thorn was given
him in his Flesh, and he besought the Lord earnestly,
to take it from him, Whereupon the Lord answered, Let
my Grace be sufficient for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. v. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:61095:240"/>
124. For he was also <hi>come</hi> to <hi>this</hi> place, and would
fain have had the Light without obstruction or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
as <hi>his own in the Astrall Birth</hi> or Geniture. But
<hi>it could not be:</hi> for the <hi>wrath</hi> resteth in the <hi>fleshly</hi> Birth,
and must bear or endure the corruption or putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the flesh: but if the fiercenesse should be
<hi>quite</hi> taken away from the Astrall Birth or Geniture,
then in that, he would be like God, and know all
things, as God himself doth.</p>
               <p>125. Which now at<note n="†" place="margin">in this Life.</note> present <hi>that Soul</hi> onely
knoweth, which qualifieth operateth or <hi>uniteth</hi> with
the <hi>Light</hi> of God, but cannot <hi>perfectly</hi> bring it back
again into the <hi>Astral</hi> Birth or Geniture; for it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Person.</p>
               <p>126. Just as an Apple on a Tree <hi>cannot</hi> bring its
Smell and Taste back again into the Tree or into the
Earth, though it be indeed the sonne of the Tree; so
it is also in <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>127. The <hi>Holy Man</hi> Moses <hi>was</hi> so high and deep
in this Light, that the <hi>Light</hi> glorified <hi>Clarified</hi> or
Brightned the Astrall Birth also, whereby the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Birth of the <hi>Flesh</hi> in his <hi>Face</hi> was clarified
brightned or Glorified; and he also desired to see
the Light of God <hi>perfectly</hi> in the Astrall Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.</p>
               <p>128. But it could <hi>not</hi> be; for the Barre or Bolt of
the <hi>wrath</hi> lyeth before it: for even the whole or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Nature of the Astral Birth in this world <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
comprehend the Light of God, and therefore the
Heart of God is <hi>hidden</hi> and concealed, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<hi>dwelleth</hi> in all places, and comprehendeth
All.</p>
               <p>129. Thus thou seest, that the <hi>Day</hi> was created
before the time of the Sun and Stars: for when God
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:61095:241"/>
said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. v. 3. <hi>Let there be Light:</hi>
there the Light brake thorough the Darknesse, but
<hi>the Darknesse did not comprehend it,</hi> but remained sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in its Seat.</p>
               <p>130. Thou seest also, how the Wrath of God in
the <hi>outermost Birth</hi> of Nature lyeth hid, and resteth,
and <hi>cannot</hi> be awakened, unlesse men <hi>themselves</hi>
rouze or awaken it, who with their fleshly Birth or
Geniture qualifie operate or unite with the wrath in
the <hi>outermost</hi> Birth of Nature.</p>
               <p>131. Therefore if any one should be <hi>Damned</hi> into
Hell, he ought <hi>not</hi> to say; that God hath done it, or
that he <hi>willeth</hi> it to be so; but <hi>Man</hi> awakeneth or
stirreth up the wrath-fire in <hi>himself,</hi> which if it
groweth <hi>burning,</hi> afterward qualifieth mixeth or
uniteth with Gods wrath, and the hellish fire, as
one thing.</p>
               <p>132. For when thy Light is extinguisht, then
thou standest in the Darknesse, and in the Darknesse
the <hi>wrath</hi> of God is <hi>hidden,</hi> and so if thou awakenest
it, then it <hi>burneth</hi> in thee.</p>
               <p>133. There is fire even in a Stone, but if you do
not strike upon it, the fire remaineth <hi>hidden,</hi> but if
you strike it, then the fire <hi>Springs forth;</hi> and then if
any combustible matter be near it, that will take fire
and burn, and so it cometh to be a Huge fire: and
thus it is also with <hi>Man,</hi> when he kindleth the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrath-fire, which is otherwise at <hi>Rest.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>134. The word (<hi>Nacht</hi>) conceiveth it self first
at the Heart, and the spirit <hi>grunteth</hi> with or in the
astringent Quality, yet not wholly comprehensible
to the astringent Quality; afterward it conceiveth
it self upon the tongue: But <hi>all the while</hi> it grunteth
at the Heart, the Tongue <hi>shuts</hi> the Mouth, till the
spirit cometh, and conceiveth it self upon the tongue,
but then it openeth the Mouth suddenly, and lets the
spirit <hi>go forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>135. And now, that the word conceiveth it self
first at the Heart, and <hi>grunteth</hi> with or in the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Quality, it signifieth, that the Holy Ghost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it self <hi>in the Darknesse</hi> upon the Heart of God
in the Astrall Birth or Geniture of the seven qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain spirits: But that it <hi>grunteth</hi> within
or at the astringent Quality, it signifieth, that the
Darknesse was a contrary or <hi>opposite</hi> will against the
Holy Ghost, at or against which, the spirit was <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>136. But that it goeth likewise through the <hi>dark</hi>
way or Passage, it signifieth, that the spirit goeth
forth also through the Darknesse, which is <hi>yet</hi> in a
quiet Rest, and generateth it to be Light, if it hold
still, and doth <hi>not</hi> kindle the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi>
               </p>
               <p>137. Here is cause for the Judging world to see,
and consider; who <hi>condemn Man in
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:61095:242"/>
his Mothers Body or Womb,</hi>
whereas they do not know, whether the wrath-fire
of the <hi>Parents</hi> be <hi>fully</hi> kindled in the fruit, or not:
and seeing that the Spirit of God moveth also in the
Darknesse which standeth yet in Quiet Rest, and
can easily generate the Darknesse to be Light: And
moreover the <hi>Hour</hi> of Mans Birth or <hi>Nativity</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>helpful</hi> and profitable for it: but in many it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>hurtfull</hi> and obstructive, but not <hi>compulsive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>138. But that the Mouth shutteth, when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
conceiveth it self upon the Heart, and that the
astringent quality grunteth against and <hi>with</hi> or <hi>in</hi> it,
it signifieth, that the whole Court Extent or Place
of this world was <hi>very dark</hi> in the Astrall, and also
in the outermost Birth or Geniture, and by the <hi>strong</hi>
going forth of the spirit, became Light.</p>
               <p>139. But that the bitter spirit is not <hi>awakened,</hi>
whilest the spirit goeth through its Place, it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
that the <hi>dark Night</hi> in the outermost Birth or
Geniture of this world hath <hi>never</hi> comprehended
the Light, also <hi>never shall</hi> comprehend it in all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>140. Hence it is, that the Creatures see onely
the <hi>Astrall Light</hi> with their Eyes, else if the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
were not yet in the outermost Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then the Astrall spirit could see <hi>through</hi> Wood
and Stones, as also <hi>through</hi> the <hi>whole Earth,</hi> and could
not be hindred by any thing; Just as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>141. But, now the Darknesse is separated from
the Light, and <hi>abideth</hi> in the outermost Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
wherein the wrath of God resteth till the
Last Judgment Day, but then the wrath will be
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:61095:242"/>
kindled, and the darknesse will be the House or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of Eternal <hi>Perdition,</hi> wherein Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi>
together with all wicked Men, which have sowen
into Darknesse into the soyl of the wrath, shall have
their eternal Dwelling and <hi>Residence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>142. But the Astrall Birth, in which the natural
Light now standeth, and wherein the <hi>holy</hi> Birth is
Generated, shall be <hi>also</hi> kindled at the End of this
Time, and the wrath and the <hi>holy</hi> Birth shall be <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi>
asunder, for the wrath shall not comprehend
the holy Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>143. But the wrath in the Astrall Birth shall be
given to the House of Darknesse for a Life, and
<hi>the Wrath shall be called the
Hellish fire:</hi> And <hi>the House of
darknesse,</hi> which is the outermost Birth,
<hi>shall be called Death:</hi> And <hi>King
Lucifer</hi> shall be the <hi>God therein,</hi>
and his Angels and all Damned Men shall be his
Ministers Officers and Servants.</p>
               <p>144. In this Devouring <hi>Gulf</hi> or Throat will rise
up all manner of <hi>Hellish Fruits</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the hellish quality and kind; as in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
there spring up <hi>Heavenly fruits</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the heavenly quality and kind.</p>
               <p>145. Thus you may understand, what the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Heaven and Earth, signifieth and is, also
what God made on the <hi>first Day.</hi> Though indeed
the first Three Dayes were not <hi>distinguisht</hi> or severed
asunder by Evening and Morning, but a Time is to
be reckoned and accounted as of Twenty four
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:61095:243"/>
Hours, as there is on high above the <hi>Moon,</hi> such a
Time and Day.</p>
               <p>146. Secondly, it is also therefore counted for a
Humane Day, because doubtlesse the <hi>Earth</hi> instantly
<hi>began</hi> its Revolution, and did turn Round about, once
in such a period of Time, while God was separating,
and so till he had separated, the Light from the
darknesse, and thus<note n="*" place="margin">the Earth.</note> it performed and finished its
course the first Time.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Second Day.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>1.
IT is written thus, concerning the second Day:</hi>
And God said; Let there be a Firmament in the
midst of the waters, and let it be a distinction or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
between the waters: so there God made the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
and divided the waters under the firmament,
from the waters above the firmament: and it was so done.
And God called the firmament, Heaven; and so out of the
Evening and the Morning the second day came to be,
<hi>Gen. 1. v.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>2. This description sheweth once more, that the
Dear Man <hi>Moses</hi> was not the Original Authour
thereof; for it is written very Obscurely, and not
fnlly expressed, though indeed it hath a very <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
understanding and meaning.</p>
            <p>3. And without Doubt the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> would not
have it revealed, lest the Devill should know all
the Mysteries in the Creation. For the Devil, doth
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:61095:243"/>
not know the Creation of the <hi>Light,</hi> viz. how Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is made out of the midst or Center of the water.</p>
            <p>4. For he can neither see nor comprehend or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Light and holy generation or producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which standeth in the water of the Heaven, but
the Generation or production only which standeth
in the Astringent, Bitter, Sowr, and Hot Quality,
from whence existed the <hi>outermost</hi> Birth or Geniture,
which is his Royall Fort or Castle.</p>
            <p>5. The meaning is <hi>not,</hi> that he hath <hi>no</hi> power in
the Elementary water, to possesse it; for the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
corrupted Birth or Geniture in the Elementary
water <hi>belongeth also</hi> to the wrath of God, and <hi>Death</hi>
is also therein, as well as in the Earth.</p>
            <p>6. But the spirit in <hi>Moses</hi> meaneth here, quite
another <hi>sort</hi> of water, which the Devill can neither
understand, nor comprehend: But if it should have
been <hi>declared</hi> so long a time ago, then the Devill
would have <hi>learned</hi> it from Man, and had without
doubt strowed his hellish chaff <hi>also</hi> into it.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Therefore</hi> the Holy Ghost hath kept it hidden
<hi>almost</hi> till the last Hour before the <hi>Evening,</hi> wherein
his <hi>Thousand yeares are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
and then he must be let
loose again for a little season,</hi>
as is to be read in the Revelat. ch. 20. v. 3.</p>
            <q>[After that <hi>Summer,</hi> cometh the Last <hi>Winter:</hi>
but the <hi>Sun</hi> will shine warm yet, before that
Time:]</q>
            <p>8. But being he is <hi>now loose</hi> from the chains of
Darknesse, God causeth Lights to be set up every
where in this world, whereby Men might learn to
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:61095:244"/>
know him and <hi>his feats</hi> and wiles, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of him.</p>
            <p>9. Whether he be <hi>loose</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> I offer it to every
one to Consider; view but the world in the clear
Light, and thou wilt find, that at present the <hi>four</hi>
new Sonnes, which the Devill generated, when he
was thrust out of Heaven; <hi>do govern</hi> the world, <hi>viz.</hi>
1. Pride, 2. Covetousnesse, 3. Envy, 4. Wrath;
These rule the world at present, and are the <hi>Devills</hi>
Heart, his animated or <hi>soulish</hi> spirit.</p>
            <p>10. Therefore view the world very well, and then
thou wilt find, that it <hi>fully</hi> qualifieth uniteth and
Co-worketh with these <hi>four new Sonnes</hi> of the Devil.
Therefore men have cause to look circumspectly to
themselves. For <hi>this is the Time,</hi> of
which, all the Prophets have prophesied: and
Christ in the Gospel, saying: <hi>Thinkest thou,
that the Sonne of Man will find
any faith, when he shall come
again to Judge the world,</hi> Luke
18. v. 8.</p>
            <p>11. The world supposeth, that it flourisheth now,
and standeth in its <hi>Flower,</hi> because the clear Light
hath moved over it; But the spirit sheweth to me,
that it standeth in the <hi>midst</hi> or Center of <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. For it forsaketh the Love, and hangeth on
Covetousnesse, Extortion and Bribery; there is <hi>no
Mercy at all</hi> therein: Every one cryeth out, if I had
but <hi>Money!</hi> Those that are in Authority and power
<hi>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k</hi> the very Marrow from the Bones of Men of low
Degree and Rank, and feed upon the sweat of their
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:61095:244"/>
Browes. Briefly, there is nothing else but Lying,
Cozening, robbing and murthering, and so may
very justly be called the Devils <hi>Nest</hi> and dwelling
House.</p>
            <p>13. The <hi>Holy Light</hi> is now adayes accounted a
meer History and bare knowledge, and that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<hi>will not work</hi> therein; and yet they <hi>suppose,</hi> that
is Faith, which they professe with their <hi>Mouthes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. O thou blind and foolish world! full of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
It is <hi>not</hi> Faith, to know, that Christ dyed for
thee, and hath shed his Blood for thee, that thou
mightest be <hi>saved:</hi> This <hi>in thee</hi> is but a meer Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
and knowledge, The Devil also knoweth as
much, but it profiteth him <hi>Nothing:</hi> so thou also,
thou foolish world, goest <hi>no further,</hi> but contentest
thy self with the <hi>bare</hi> knowledge, and therefore this
thy knowledge will <hi>Judge</hi> thee.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>But if thou woudlst know, what the</hi> true
Faith is, <hi>then observe:</hi> Thy heart must
not qualifie or co-operate with the
four Sonnes of the Devill, in
Pride, Covetousnesse, Envy,
Wrath, Extortion, Oppression,
Lying, Deceiving, Murther, and
tearing the Bread out of thy
neighbours Throat, studying day
and night to do mischief, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
subtile Devices and designs to
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:61095:245"/>
Effect, that thou mayst give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to the Proud Covetous
Envious and wrathful Devils, to
Court them, and exercise thy self
in worldly pleasures and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
            <p>16. For thus saith the spirit in its zeal or in the
Jealousie of Gods wrath in this world: while thy
<hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>will</hi> qualifieth or co-operateth with and in
the four Abominations of the Devill, thou art not
one spirit with God: and saith the spirit, though
thou presentest me every Hour with thy Lips, and
<hi>Prayest,</hi> and <hi>bowest thy knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me,</hi> yet I will accept none of thy Labour:
Is not thy breath however continually before me?
whar shall thy Incense be to me in my fierce wrath?
dost thou think, I will recive the Devil into my self?
<hi>or exalt Hell into Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. Convert! Convert! and <hi>strive against
the malice and wickedness of the
Devill,</hi> and incline thine heart towards the
LORD thy GOD, and <hi>walk in his will,</hi>
Heart will incline to me, saith the spirit, then will I
also incline to thee: or dost thou think, that I am
false and wicked as thou art?</p>
            <p>18. <hi>Therefore</hi> I say now, if thy heart doth not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:61095:245"/>
mix or Co-operate with <hi>God</hi> in thy knowledge:
out of a true Purpose of <hi>Love,</hi> then thou art a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler,
Lyar, and Murtherer in the sight of God:
for God doth not <hi>hear</hi> any mans <hi>Prayer,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
his Heart be fully directed and bent, in <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to God.</p>
            <p>19. Wouldst thou fight against the Wrath of
God? then thou must put on the Helmet of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
and of <hi>Love,</hi> otherwise thou wilt not break tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough;
and if thou dost not break thorough, then
thou fightest in <hi>vain,</hi> and remainest to be a Servant
or Minister of the Devil in one way as well as in the
other.</p>
            <p>20. What will thy <hi>knowledge</hi> do thee Good, if
thou wilt not strive and <hi>fight</hi> therein? It is Just as
if one knew of a great Treasure, and would not go
for it, but though he knoweth he might have it,
would rather <hi>starve</hi> for hunger in the <hi>bare</hi> knowing
of it.</p>
            <p>21. Thus saith the spirit, <hi>many Heathens,</hi>
who have not thy knowledge, and yet strive or fight
against the wrath, <hi>will enter into the
Kingdome of Heaven before thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. For who shall Judge them, if their Heart do
qualifie unite or operate with God? For, though
they do <hi>not</hi> know him, and yet work and labour in
his spirit, in Righteousnesse and in the <hi>purity</hi> of their
Heart, in <hi>true Love</hi> one to another; <hi>they testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
assuredly, that the Law of God
is in their Heart?</hi> Rom. 2. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="462" facs="tcp:61095:246"/>
23. But being thou knowest it, and dost it <hi>not,</hi> and
the other know it not, but yet <hi>do</hi> it, they with their
Doing judge thy knowledge; and thou art found to
be a hypocrite, dissembler, and an unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who wert put into the Vineyard of the Lord,
and <hi>wilt not work</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>24. <hi>What dost thou suppose, the Master of the
House will say to thee, when he shall require and
demand his</hi> Talent, <hi>which he entrusted thee with,</hi>
thou having buried it in the Earth? <hi>will he not say,</hi> thou
Perverse wicked servant, why didst thou not put my Talent
out upon use, and then I could have demanded the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
and the Interest <hi>or profit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. Note: And so the <hi>sufferings of Christ</hi> will be
quite taken from thee, and will be given to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
who had but <hi>One Talent,</hi> and yet made <hi>Five</hi>
good, for it, to the Master of the House; and thou
must <hi>howl with the Dogs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. Now if we will rightly consider, How God
separated the <hi>water under</hi> the Firmament, from the
water <hi>above</hi> the Firmament, then great Things are
to be found herein.</p>
            <p>27. For the water, which <hi>resteth on the Earth,</hi> is as
a corrupt perished and mortal or Dead Being or
Thing as the Earth is, and belongeth also to the <hi>ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost</hi>
Birth, which with its comprehensibility, or
as to its palpability standeth in <hi>Death,</hi> even as the
Earth and Stones do.</p>
            <p>28. The meaning is <hi>not,</hi> that it is <hi>quite</hi> reprobated
rejected or thrust out from God: for the <hi>Heart</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
belongeth yet to the Astrall Birth or Geniture, out
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:61095:246"/>
of which the <hi>holy</hi> Birth becometh Generated.</p>
            <p>29. But Death standeth in the outermost Birth,
and <hi>therefore</hi> is the palpable water <hi>separated</hi> from
the impalpable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now thou wilt Ask:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>30. Behold the water, in the Deep <hi>above</hi> the
Earth, which qualifieth mixeth or uniteth with the
<hi>Elementary</hi> Ayr and Fire, that, is the water of the
<hi>Astrall</hi> Birth or Geniture, wherein standeth the <hi>Astral
life,</hi> and wherein <hi>especially</hi> the Holy Ghost moveth,
and through which the <hi>Third</hi> and innermost Birth
doth generate <hi>incomprehensibly</hi> as to the wrath of
God therein: and that water to our Eyes seemeth
like the Ayr.</p>
            <p>31. But, that Water, Ayr, and Fire, are <hi>one in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi>
in the Deep above the Earth; every intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
Man may see and understand.</p>
            <p>32. For thou seest that often the whole Deep is
very <hi>clear</hi> and pure, and in <hi>a quarter of an Hour</hi> is
covered with watery Clouds, that is, when the Stars
from <hi>above,</hi> and the water upon the Earth from <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath</hi>
kindle themselves, and so water is suddenly
there also generated; which would <hi>not be,</hi> if the
wrath did not also stand in the Astral Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</p>
            <p>33. But being <hi>all</hi> is corrupted, therefore must the
upper water in the wrath of God, come to help the
Astringent, Bitter, and Hot quality of the Earth, and
allay mitigate and <hi>quench</hi> its fire, so that the life may
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:61095:247"/>
alwayes be generated, and that the holy Birth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Death and the wrath of God, may be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
also.</p>
            <p>34. But, that also the Element of <hi>Fire</hi> is, and doth
rule, in the Deep of the Air and Water; thou seest
in Tempests of Lightning: also thou perceivest, how
the Light of the <hi>Sun</hi> kindleth the Element of Fire
on the Earth with its <hi>reflection,</hi> although many
times aloft in the upper Region towards the <hi>Moon</hi>
it is very cold.</p>
            <p>35. But now, God separated the palpable water
from the impalpable, and placed the palpable on
the Earth, and the impalpable remained still in the
Deep in its own Seat as it had been from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>36. But being the wrath also is in <hi>that</hi> water in the
Deep above the Earth, therefore constantly through
the kindling of the Stars and of the water in the
<hi>wrath,</hi> such palpable water generateth it self, which
with its outermost Birth standeth in Death.</p>
            <p>37. Which, being it qualifieth or <hi>uniteth</hi> with its
innermost Birth of the Astrall Birth or Geniture, it
cometh to help the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the <hi>corrupted</hi> Earth, and
quencheth its wrath, whereby in the Astrall Birth
or Geniture all standeth in the Life, and so the
Earth generateth the <hi>Life</hi> through the <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Gate of the Mystery.</head>
               <p>38. But, that there is a <hi>Firmament,</hi> between the
Waters; which Firmament is called <hi>Heaven;</hi> it
hath this <hi>understanding</hi> or meaning.</p>
               <p>39. The whole Deep, from the <hi>Moon</hi> to the <hi>Earth,</hi>
standeth all with its working in the wrathfull and
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:61095:247"/>
comprehensible or palpable Birth or Geniture: for
the <hi>Moon</hi> is the Goddesse of the palpable Birth, and
so the House of the Devills of Death and of Hell is
in the circuit orb or Extent between the Moon and
the Earth.</p>
               <p>40. Where <hi>therefore</hi> the fierce <hi>wrath</hi> of God in the
outermost Birth or Geniture in the Deep becometh
daily kindled and blown up by the <hi>Devills</hi> and <hi>all
wicked</hi> Men, through the Great Sins of Man, which
still qualifie mix unite or co-operate with the <hi>Astral</hi>
Birth or Geniture in the Deep.</p>
               <p>41. Now Therefore God hath made the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is call'd Heaven, <hi>between</hi> the outermost
and innermost Birth, and that is a <hi>Partition</hi> or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
between the outermost and innermost Birth or
Geniture.</p>
               <p>42. For, the outermost Birth of the water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend the innermost Birth of the water,
which is called Heaven, and which is made out of
the midst or Center of the water.</p>
               <p>[<q>Heaven is the Firmament, viz. the fire-Sea, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="q"/>
Sea-of-Fire out of the seven spirits of Nature,
out of which, the Stars as a Quintessence were
concreted incorporated or created by the word
<hi>FIAT:</hi> And it hath or containeth both fire
and water, and hangeth in it self inwardly on
the first Principle, and shall bring its wonders,
with or as to the figure of them, into the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
but its Birth or Geniture fadeth or passeth
away:</q>]</p>
               <p>43. Now the innermost Birth of Heaven <hi>reflects
strongly</hi> upon the Earth, and holdeth the outermost
water upon the Earth, together with the Earth also,
strongly <hi>captive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:61095:248"/>
44. And if that were not, then with the <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Globe of the Earth the water would be
divided or dissolved again; also then would the
Earth Crumble, break, and moulder away in the
Deep, [and all would be a <hi>Chaos</hi> again.]</p>
               <p>45. But now therefore that Firmament between
the outermost palpable water and the Inward; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the <hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>palpable</hi> water Captive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now thou mayst Ask:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What? is the fire then a <hi>Firmament</hi> of that
Heaven, which I can neither see nor
apprehend?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>46. Yes; It is the Firmament <hi>between</hi> the clear
Deity and the corrupt Nature, which thou must
break through, when thou intendest to come to
God; and it is that very Firmament, which doth
not <hi>quite</hi> stand in the wrath, neither is it altogether
or perfectly pure: concerning which it is written,
<hi>the very Heavens are not pure in
the sight of God, as in Job</hi> 15. 15.
and at the last Judgment Day the wratn will be
purged from them. For it is written, <hi>Heaven and
Earth shall passe away, but my word shall not passe away,
saith Christ, Matth. 24. 35. Mark</hi> 13. 31.</p>
               <p>47. <hi>Now that</hi> impurity <hi>in that Heaven is
the</hi> wrath, <hi>but the</hi> purity <hi>is the</hi> word
<hi>of God, which he once spake, saying;</hi> Let the water
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:61095:248"/>
under the Firmament be separated from the water above
the firmament, Gen. 1.</p>
               <p>And that Word standeth, and is <hi>comprised,</hi> in the
firmament of the water; and holdeth the outward
water together with the Earth, captive or <hi>fixed.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Gate of the Deitie.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here the hidden Mystery of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48. When thou beholdest the Deep above the
Earth, thou oughtest <hi>not</hi> to say, that it is <hi>not</hi> the
Gate of God, where God in his <hi>holinesse</hi> dwelleth:
No, no, think not so: For the <hi>whole</hi> holy <hi>Trinity</hi> God
the Father Sonne and Holy Ghost, dwelleth in the
Center under the Firmament of Heaven, but that
very Firmament cannot comprehend him.</p>
               <p>49. Indeed all is as it were <hi>one</hi> Body, the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
and inhermost Birth, together with the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of heaven, as also the Astrall Birth <hi>therein,</hi> in
and with which the wrath of God also qualifieth
mixeth and uniteth; but yet they are one to another
as the Government frame or constitution in <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>50.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi> Three sorts of Births or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitures in Man.</note> The <hi>Flesh</hi> signifieth, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The outward Birth
or Genitute, which is the House of Death. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The
second Birth or Geniture in Man is the <hi>Astrall,</hi> in
which the <hi>Life</hi>-standeth, and wherein Love and
wrath wrestle one with another: And <hi>thus far</hi> Man
himself knoweth himself: for the Astrall Birth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth
the Life in the outermost, that is, in the
<hi>dead</hi> Flesh: 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Third Birth, is generated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Astrall and outermost, and that is called
the animated or <hi>soulish</hi> Birth or Geniture, or the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:61095:249"/>
Soul: and is as Large as the <hi>whole</hi> Man.</p>
               <p>51. And that Birth or Geniture, the outward
Man <hi>neither knoweth nor comprehendeth,</hi> neither doth
the Astrall comprehend it, but every qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain spirit comprehendeth only its <hi>innate</hi>
or instant <hi>Root,</hi> which signifieth, or resembleth the
Heaven.</p>
               <p>52. And that animated or soulish Man must
presse through the Firmament of Heaven to God,
and <hi>live</hi> with God, else the whole man <hi>cannot</hi> come
into Heaven to God.</p>
               <p>53. For every Man, that desireth to be saved,
must with his innate instant Births, or Genitures, be,
as the <hi>whole</hi> Deity with all the three Births in this
world, is.</p>
               <p>54. Man cannot be absolutely or <hi>wholly pure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wrath and sin,</hi> for the Births of the Depth in this
world are not fully pure before the Heart of God,
<hi>Job 15. v.</hi> 15. but alwayes Love and wrath <hi>wrestle</hi>
one with another, whence God is called <hi>an angry
zealous God,</hi> Exod. 20. 5. Deut. 5. 9.</p>
               <p>55. Now as man is, in the Government or Order
of his <hi>Nativity</hi> Birth or Geniture: Just <hi>so</hi> also is the
whole Body of God in or of this world; but in the
<hi>water</hi> standeth the <hi>meek</hi> Life.</p>
               <p>56. As, I. First in the outward Body of God, in
or of this world, there is the congealed, astringent
bitter and Hot <hi>Death,</hi> in which the palpable water
is also congealed and Dead.</p>
               <p>57. And therein now is the <hi>Darknesse,</hi> wherein
King <hi>Lucifer</hi> with his Angels, as also all <hi>fleshly</hi> or
carnal wicked Men lye captive even with or in their
<hi>living</hi> Bodies, as also the <hi>Separated</hi> spirits of <hi>damned</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:61095:249"/>
58. This birth can neither see, hear, feel, smell
nor comprehend the <hi>Heart</hi> of God: but is<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Folly</hi>

Virgin; which King <hi>Lucifer</hi> in his Pride hath

               <p>59. And II. The second Birth is the Astrall,
which thou must understand to be the <hi>Life</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
qualifying or fountain spirits, wherein <hi>now</hi> the
Love and the wrath is against one another, and
therein standeth the <hi>upper</hi> water, which is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the life, and therein, or <hi>between</hi> is the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Heaven, which is made out of the midst or
Center of the water.</p>
               <p>60. Now this Birth or Geniture presseth through
the outward congealed Birth <hi>quite through</hi> Death,
and the Astral Life in the death, that is, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
Earth, Water, and Flesh, of the Beasts and
of Men, also of the Fowls, Fishes, and Worms, or
Creeping things.</p>
               <p>61. And the Devil can reach <hi>half</hi> into this Birth,
so far as the wrath comprehendeth or reacheth, and
no deeper, and thus far goeth his dwelling, and no
Deeper; therefore the devill <hi>cannot know,</hi> how the
other Part in this Birth hath a Root. And so far
Man is come in his knowledge from the Beginning
of the world to this time, since his Fall. But the
other <hi>Root,</hi> called the Heaven, the spirit hath kept
that hidden and concealed from Man, till this Time,

               <p>62. This <hi>other Part</hi> of the Astrall Birth, which
standeth in the Love in the sweet water, is the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
of Heaven, which holdeth the kindled
wrath together with all the Devils, <hi>captive.</hi> For

they cannot enter thereinto, and in that Heaven
dwelleth the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which goeth forth from the
Heart of God, and striveth or fighteth against the
fiercenesse, and generateth to himself a Temple in
the <hi>midst</hi> in the fiercenesse of the wrath of God.</p>
               <p>63. And in this Heaven dwelleth the Man, that

Body: for that Heaven is as well in Man, as in the
Deep above the Earth; And as the Deep above the
Earth is, so is Man also both in love and wrath, <hi>till</hi>
after the departure of the soul: but then when the
soul departeth from the Body, then it <hi>abideth</hi> either
only in the Heaven of Love, or only in the Heaven of
Wrath.</p>
               <p>64. That Part which it here hath comprehended
in its <hi>departure,</hi> that is now its Eternal permanent

16. 26.</p>
               <p>65. And in this Heaven the Holy Angels dwell
amongst us: and the Devils in the other Part: And
in this Heaven, Man liveth <hi>between</hi> Heaven and Hell,

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:61095:250"/>
He that teacheth otherwise, doth <hi>not</hi> know, what he
teacheth, for his doctrine hath no foot ground or
foundation, and his heart alwaies tottereth waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and doubteth and knoweth not what it should
do.</p>
               <p>68. For his <hi>spirit</hi> alwaies seeketh for <hi>Rest,</hi> but
findeth it not, for it is impatient, and alwaies seeketh

findeth somewhat, it <hi>tickleth</hi> it self therewith, as if

               <head>The Holy Gate.</head>
               <p>71. III. The Third Birth or Geniture in the Body
of God in or of this world, is under the firmament
of Heaven, hidden or concealed; and the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of heaven qualifieth mixeth or uniteth there.
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:61095:251"/>
with, but yet not fully <hi>Bodily,</hi> but <hi>creaturely,</hi> as the
Angels, and the Soules of Men do.</p>
               <p>72. And this Third Birth or Geniture is the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>
and <hi>Holy</hi> Heart of God, wherein our King
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> with his natural Body <hi>sitteth at the right
hand of God,</hi> as a King and Lord of the whole Body
or place of this world, who encompasseth holdeth
and preserveth <hi>all,</hi> with his Heart.</p>
               <p>73. And this Firmament of Heaven is his
Throne or footstool, and the qualifying or fountain
spirits of his natural Body <hi>rule</hi> in the whole Body of
this world, and all is tyed bound or united with
them, whatsoever standeth in the Astral Birth in the
Part of <hi>Love:</hi> The other part of this world is tyed
bound and united with the <hi>Devill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>74. Thou must <hi>not think,</hi> as <hi>Johannes Calvus</hi> or <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus,</hi>
thought, which was, that the Body of Christ
is <hi>not an Almighty Being,</hi> and that it comprehendeth
or reacheth <hi>no further</hi> then a little Circumscribed
Place wherein it is.</p>
               <p>75. No; thou child of Man, thou errest, and
dost not <hi>rightly</hi> understand the <hi>Divine</hi> Power; Doth
not every man in his Astrall qualifying or fountain
Spirits <hi>comprehend</hi> the whole place or Body of this
world, and the place <hi>comprehendeth</hi> Man? it is all but
<hi>one Body,</hi> onely there are distinct Members.</p>
               <p>76. Why then should not the qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spirits in the naturall Body of Christ qualifie
mix or unite with the qualifying or fountain spirits
of <hi>Nature?</hi> Is not his Body also out of the qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain spirits of Nature, and his heart ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
or become soulish from or out of the <hi>third</hi>
Birth or Geniture, which is the Heart of God, which
comprehendeth all Angels and the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
even the <hi>whole Father.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="473" facs="tcp:61095:251"/>
77. Ye Calvinists, desist from your Opinion, and
do not <hi>Torment your selves</hi> with the comprehensible
or palpable Being; for <hi>God is a Spirit;</hi> John 4. 24.
and in the comprehensibility or palpability standeth
<hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>78. The Body of Christ is no more in the hard
comprehensibility or palpability, but in the Divine
comprehensibility or Palpability of Nature, like the
Angels.</p>
               <p>79. For our Bodies also at the Resurrection will
have no more such hard Flesh and Bones, but be like
the Angels; and though indeed all <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>powers</hi>
shall be therein, and all <hi>faculties</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> even
to the Privy Parts, and these shall be in another
manner of form, and so also the Entralls and Guts,
and yet we shall <hi>not</hi> have the <hi>hard</hi> comprehensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Palpability.</p>
               <p>80. For Christ saith to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in <hi>Joseph's</hi>
Garden at the Sepulcher, after his resurrection:
<hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet
ascended to my God and to your
God,</hi> Joh. 20. v. 17. As if he would say,
I have <hi>not</hi> now the <hi>Bestial Body</hi> any more, although
I shew my self to thee in my form or shape which <hi>I
had,</hi> otherwise, thou, in thy bestial couldst <hi>not see
me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>81. And so during the Fourty Dayes after his
Resurrection he did <hi>not</hi> alwaies walk <hi>vifibly</hi> among
the Disciples, but <hi>invisibly;</hi> according to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and angelical Property; but when he would
speak or <hi>talk</hi> with his Disciples, then he shewed or
presented himself in a comprehensible or <hi>palpable</hi>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:61095:252"/>
manner and form, that thereby he might speak na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
words with them, for the <hi>corruption</hi> cannot
comprehend or apprehend the Divine [words or
things].</p>
               <p>82. Also it sufficiently appeareth, that his Body
was of an angelical kind, in that he went to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>through the Doors being shut,</hi>
John 20. 19.</p>
               <p>83. Thus, thou must know now, that his Body
qualifieth mixeth or uniteth with all the seven spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in Nature in the Astrall Birth in the part of
<hi>Love,</hi> and holdeth Sin, Death, and the Devill cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in its <hi>wrath-Part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>84. And thus thou now understandest, what God
made on the <hi>Second Day,</hi> when he separated the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under the Firmament, from the water above the
Firmament. Thou seest also, How thou art in this
world <hi>every where</hi> in Heaven and also in Hell, and
dwellest between Heaven and Hell in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>85. Thou seest also, <hi>how</hi> Heaven is <hi>in</hi> a Holy man,
and that <hi>every where,</hi> wheresoever thou standest, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
or lyest, if thy spirit do but qualifie or co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with God, then as to <hi>that Part,</hi> thou art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and thy <hi>Soul</hi> is in God. Therefore also saith
Christ; <hi>My Sheep are in my Hands, no man can pull
them away from me,</hi> John 10.</p>
               <p>86. In like manner thou seest also, How thou art
alwaies in Hell among all the Devils, as to the <hi>wrath,</hi>
if thy Eyes were but open, thou wouldst see <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
things, but thou standest between Heaven and
Hell, and canst see neither of them, and walkest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a very <hi>Narrow Bridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:61095:252"/>
87. Some Men have many Times, according to
or in the Sidereal or Astral spirit, entred in thither:
being ravished in an <hi>Extasie,</hi> as men call it: and
have presently known the Gates of Heaven and of
Hell, and have told shewed and declared how that
many men dwell in Hell <hi>with</hi> or <hi>in</hi> their living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or with their Bodies alive: And such indeed
have been scorned derided or laugh'd at, but with
great ignorance and indiscretion; for it is Just so as
<hi>they declare:</hi> which I will describe also more at large
in its due place, and shew in what manner and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
it is with them.</p>
               <p>88. But that the water hath a <hi>Twofold</hi> Birth, I
will here prove it also with or by <hi>the Language of
Nature.</hi> For that is the <hi>Root</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the
Languages, which are in this world; and therein
standeth the whole <hi>perfect</hi> knowledge of <hi>all</hi>
things.</p>
               <p>89. For when <hi>Adam</hi> Spake at the first, he gave
Names to all the Creatures, according to their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and innate Instant Operations, vertues or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
And it is the very Language of the totall
universal Nature, but is not known to every One.
For it is a hidden secret Mystery, which is imparted
to me by the Grace of God from the Spirit, which
hath a Delight and Longing towards me.</p>
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:61095:253"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>90. The word <hi>Wasser <hi>[water]</hi>
                  </hi> is thrust forth from
the Heart,<note place="margin">Was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.</note> and <hi>closeth</hi> the Teeth together, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<hi>over</hi> the astringent and Bitter qualities and
toucheth them not, but goeth forth <hi>through</hi> the
Teeth, and the Tongue contracteth and rouzeth up
it self together with the spirit, and <hi>helpeth</hi> to hisse,
and so qualifieth mixeth or <hi>uniteth</hi> with the Spirit,
and the spirit presseth very forcibly through the
Teeth. But when the spirit is <hi>almost</hi> quite gone
forth, then the Astringent and Bitter spirit contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and rouzeth up it self, and afterwards first qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth
with the word, but yet it sitteth still in its seat,
and afterwards <hi>jarreth</hi> mightily and strongly in the
syllable-<hi>ser.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>91. But now, that the Spirit conceiveth it self at
the Heart, and cometh forth, and closeth the Teeth
together, and <hi>hisseth</hi> with the Tongue through the
Teeth; it signifieth, that the <hi>Heart of God</hi> hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it self, and made a <hi>closure</hi> round about it, which
is the <hi>Firmament</hi> of <hi>Heaven:</hi> Also, as the Teeth do
shut and <hi>close</hi> together; and then the Spirit goeth
through the Teeth: so also the spirit goeth forth
from the heart into the <hi>Astrall</hi> Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>92. And as the Tongue <hi>frameth</hi> it self for the his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and qualifieth mixeth or uniteth with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and moveth therewith: so the soul of Man <hi>co-Imageth</hi>
or frameth it self with the Holy Spirit, and
qualifieth operateth or uniteth therewith, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
joyntly together in the power thereof, <hi>through
Heaven,</hi> and ruleth together also therewith in the

               <p>
                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:61095:253"/>
93. But that the Astringent and Bitter quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
awaken <hi>behind</hi> afterwards, and co-image af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to the framing of the word: it signifieth,
that indeed all is as it were <hi>one</hi> Body, but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and the Holy Spirit together with the Heart of
God, hath its <hi>proper</hi>

                  </note> Seat to it self, and the Devill
together with the wrath of God, can neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Holy Spirit, nor the Heaven; but the
Devill together with the wrath, <hi>hangeth in</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Birth in the <hi>word,</hi> and the wrath helpeth to
Image all in the outermost Birth in this world,
whatsoever standeth in the comprehensibility or
palpability: Just as the astringent and bitter qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<hi>rouze</hi> themselves behind <hi>afterwards</hi> to the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the word, and qualifie operate or unite
therewith.</p>
               <p>94. But that the spirit <hi>first</hi> goeth over the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and bitter qualities unperceived; it signifieth,
that the <hi>Gate of God</hi> is every where in this world <hi>all
over,</hi> wherein the Holy Ghost ruleth, and that the
Heaven standeth open every where, even in the
midst or center of the Earth: And that the Devill
<hi>no where</hi> can either see comprehend or apprehend
the Heaven, but is a <hi>grumbling</hi> and snarling Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hound,
which afterwards first cometh out from
behind, when the Holy Ghost <hi>hath</hi> built or raised to

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Third Day.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1.
ALthough <hi>the Spirit</hi> in the Writings of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
hath kept the <hi>Deepest</hi> Mysteries secret
hidden and concealed in the <hi>Letter,</hi> yet all
is so very regularly described, that there is
<hi>no Defect</hi> at all in the Order thereof.</p>
            <p>2. For when God through the Word had created
Heaven and Earth, and had <hi>separated</hi> the Light from
the Darkness, and had given a place to each of them,
then presently <hi>each began</hi> its Birth or Geniture, and
qualifying or working.</p>
            <p>3. On the <hi>First Day,</hi> God drave together [or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted]
the Corrupt <hi>Salitter</hi> which came to be so in
the kindling of his wrath: I say, God then drave it
together or Created it through the <hi>strong</hi> spirit; for
the word <hi>Schuff <hi>[created]</hi>
               </hi> signifieth here, a Driving
together, [or Compaction].</p>
            <p>4. In this driving together or <hi>compaction</hi> of the
corrupted wrath-<hi>Salitter,</hi> was King <hi>Lucifer</hi> also, as
an Impotent Prince together with his Angels, <hi>driven</hi>
into the Hole of the wrath-<hi>Salitter</hi> into that place,
where the outward <hi>half</hi> dead comprehensibility is
generated, which is the place or Space between the
Nature-Goddesse the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the Dead <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Now when this was done, the Deep became
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:61095:254"/>
clear, and with the hidden or concealed Heaven, the
Light was <hi>separated</hi> from the Darknesse, and the
Globe of the Earth in the great <hi>wheel</hi> of Nature was
rolled or turned <hi>once about;</hi> and accordingly there
pass'd the Time of<note n="*" place="margin">the Diurnal motion of the Earth 24 Hours.</note> 
               <hi>one Revolution,</hi> or of One Day,
which containeth Twenty Four Hours.</p>
            <p>6. In the Duration of the <hi>Second Day,</hi> began the
sharp separation; and the <hi>incomprehensible Cliff</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Wrath and the Love of Light was made,
and so King <hi>Lucifer</hi> firmly strongly or fast <hi>bolted up</hi>
into the House of Darknesse, and was <hi>reserved</hi> to the
final Judgment.</p>
            <p>7. And so also the water of Life was <hi>separated</hi> from
the water of Death, yet in that manner as that they
<hi>hang</hi> one to another in this Time of the world, <hi>as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Soul,</hi> and yet neither of them comprehend the
other; but the <hi>Heaven</hi> which was made out of the
midst or center of the water, is the <hi>Cliffe</hi> between
them, so that the comprehensible or palpable wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is a Death, and the incomprehensible or impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
is the Life.</p>
            <p>8. Thus now the incomprehensible spirit, which
<hi>is God,</hi> ruleth every where in this world, and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
or <hi>filleth all,</hi> and the comprehensible hangeth
or dependeth on him, and dwelleth in the Darkness,
and can neither see, hear, smell, nor feel the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
one, but seeth the works thereof, and is
a <hi>Destroyer</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>9. And now when God had bound up the Devill
in the Darknesse through the <hi>closure</hi> of the Heaven,
which Heaven is every where in all places; then
HEE began again his wonderful Birth or Geniture
in the <hi>seventh</hi> Nature-spirit, and all generated again
as it <hi>had done</hi> from Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="480" facs="tcp:61095:255"/>
10. <hi>For</hi> Moses <hi>writeth thus:</hi> And God said, Let the
Earth send forth Grasse and Herbs that yield a Seed, and
the fruit Tree yielding or bearing fruit after its kind, and
which hath its own seed in it self upon the Earth, and it
was so done. And the Earth sent forth grasse, and the
herb that yieldeth seed each after its kind, and the tree
yielding fruit, and which hath its seed in it self, every one
according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.
And so out of Evening and Morning the Third Day came
to be, <hi>Gen. 1. v.</hi> 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>11. This indeed is very rightly and properly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,</hi>
but the true ground sticketh <hi>hidden</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
in the Word, and hath <hi>never</hi> been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by Man. For Man since the Fall could never
comprehend or <hi>apprehend</hi> the inward Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to perceive, How the heavenly Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is: but his <hi>Reason</hi> lay captivated in the outward
comprehensibility or <hi>palpability,</hi> and could not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
and presse through Heaven, and see the inward
Birth or Geniture of God, which also is in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Earth and <hi>every where</hi> in all Places.</p>
            <p>12. Thou must <hi>not</hi> here think, that God hath
made some <hi>New</hi> thing, which <hi>never</hi> was before. For
if that were so, then there had been <hi>another</hi> God,
which is not possible to be. For without, or <hi>besides,</hi>
this one onely God, nothing is at all, for the Gates
of Hell are <hi>not any where</hi> without beyond or <hi>absent</hi>
from this one onely God; onely there is a <hi>Partition</hi> or
distinction between the love in the light, and the
kindled wrath in the Darknesse, so that the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend the other, and yet hang one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
as <hi>one</hi> Body.</p>
            <p>13. The <hi>Salitter,</hi> out of which the Earth is come
to be, <hi>was</hi> from Eternity, and stood in the seventh
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:61095:255"/>
qualifying or fountain spirit, which is the <hi>Nature</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirit,
and the other six have generated the seventh
continually, and are incompassed or surrounded
<hi>therewith,</hi> or lie captivated or inclosed therein as in
their Mother, and are the power and life of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
just as the <hi>Astrall</hi> Birth is, in the Flesh.</p>
            <p>14. But when King <hi>Lucifer</hi> had stirred the wrath
in this Birth or Geniture, and had with his <hi>loftinesse</hi>
brought the Poison and Death into it, then in the
wrathful Birth, in the fiercenesse, or <hi>Sting</hi> of Death,
such Earth and Stones were Generated.</p>
            <p>15. And upon this now ensued the <hi>Spewing out</hi>
thereof: for the Deity could not endure such a
Birth or Geniture in the Love and Light of God, but
the corrupted <hi>Salitter</hi> must be <hi>driven together</hi> in a
Lump, and Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> also with it, so then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
the innate Light in the corrupted <hi>Salitter,</hi>
went out or extinguished, and the <hi>closure</hi> of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
between the Wrath and the Love was made,
that so such <hi>Salitter</hi> might be generated <hi>no</hi> more,
and that Heaven might hold the Wrath in the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
Birth or Geniture in Nature captive in the
Darknesse, and be an <hi>Eternal</hi> Partition or separation
between them.</p>
            <p>16. But this being accomplished in the Two
Dayes, then on the <hi>Third Day</hi> the Light rose up in
the Darknesse, and the Darknesse together with the
Prince thereof, could not comprehend it:</p>
            <p>17. For there, out of the Earth sprung up Grasse
and Herbs, and Trees, and there now also it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
written thus: <hi>Each according to its
kind,</hi> Gen. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 12. In these words lyeth
the <hi>Kernel</hi> of the eternal Birth or Geniture hidden
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:61095:256"/>
or concealed, and cannot be comprehended or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by or with Flesh and Blood, but the Holy
Ghost through the animated or soulish Birth, must
kindle the <hi>Astrall</hi> man, otherwise he is blind <hi>herein,</hi>
and understandeth nothing but concerning Earth
and Stones, also Grasse, Herbs, and woodden
Trees.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>But now is it written here;</hi> God
<list>
                  <item>sprach,</item>
                  <item>said,</item>
               </list>
Let the Earth bring forth Grasse, and Herbs, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Trees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe here:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. The word <hi>Sprach, [Said]</hi> is an <hi>Eternal</hi> word,
and <hi>was</hi> before the times of the wrath; from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<hi>in</hi> this <hi>Salitter,</hi> when it stood <hi>yet</hi> in the heavenly
form and life, and now also it is <hi>not quite</hi> dead in
its Center, but only in the comprehensibility or <hi>pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. But now when the Light rose up again in the
outward comprehensibility, or in Death, then the
Eternal Word stood in its <hi>full</hi> Birth, and generated
the <hi>life</hi> through and out of Death, and the corrupted
<hi>Salitter</hi> brought forth fruit again.</p>
            <p>21. But being the eternal <hi>word</hi> must qualifie mix
or unite with the corruption in the Wrath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the fruits were Evill and Good.
For the outward Birth or Geniture of the fruits must
be out of or from the <hi>Earth</hi> which is in Death; And
the spirit or life must be out of the <hi>Astral</hi> Birth, which
standeth in Love and Wrath.</p>
            <p>22. For thus stood the Birth or Geniture of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Time of the <hi>Kindling,</hi> and was thus toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incorporated in the Earth, and must also in such
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:61095:256"/>
a Birth spring up again: For it is written; <hi>that the</hi>
dead <hi>Earth should let the Grasse and Herbs, and Trees
spring up, each according to its kind,</hi> Gen. 1. 12. that
is, according to the kind and quality, as it <hi>had been</hi>
from eternity, and as it had been in the heavenly
quality, kind and form. For that is called <hi>its
own</hi> kind, which is received in the mothers Body
or Womb, and is its <hi>own</hi> by right of Nature, as its
own peculiar Life.</p>
            <p>23. Thus also the Earth brought forth <hi>no</hi> strange
Life, but even that which <hi>had been</hi> in it from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
And as before the time of the wrath it had
brought forth heavenly fruit, which had a <hi>holy</hi> pure
heavenly Body, and were the food of Angels: so
now it brought forth fruits, according to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
palpable hard, Evil, wrathful, poisonous,
venomous, <hi>half</hi>-dead kind: for as the Mother was,
so were her children.</p>
            <p>24. <hi>Not</hi> that the fruits of the Earth are thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>wholly</hi> in the wrath of God: for the incorporated
or compacted Word, which is immortal and <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,</hi>
which was from eternity in the <hi>Salitter</hi> of
the Earth, sprung up again in the Body of death, and
brought forth fruit out of the <hi>dead</hi> Body of the
Earth: but the Earth comprehended <hi>not</hi> the Word,
but the Word comprehended the Earth.</p>
            <p>25. And now as the whole Earth was, together
with the Word; so was the fruit also, but the word
remained in the Center of the <hi>Heaven,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in this place, hiddenly; and this Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>caused</hi> the seven qualifying or fountain spirits,
out of or from the outermost, corrupt and dead Birth
or Geniture <hi>to form</hi> the Body; and it self, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:61095:257"/>
Word or Heart of God remained in its heavenly
seat sitting on the Throne of <hi>Majestie,</hi> and filled the
Astrall and also the mortal Birth or Geniture, but to
them was the holy life <hi>altogether</hi> incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>26. Thou must not think, that thereupon the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
dead Birth or Geniture of the Earth hath
gotten <hi>such</hi> a Life through the risen word that sprung
up, so that it is <hi>no more</hi> a Death: No; that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be, for that which is <hi>once</hi> dead in God, that, is
really dead, and in its <hi>own power</hi> can never be living
again, but the Word, which qualifieth mixeth or
uniteth with the Astrall Birth in the Part of the
Love, that generateth the <hi>Life</hi> through the astrall
Birth or Geniture; through the Death.</p>
            <p>27. For thou seest plainly, How all the Fruits of
the Earth, whatsoever it bringeth forth, must <hi>putrifie</hi>
and Rot; also they are a Death.</p>
            <p>28. But, that the Fruits get <hi>another</hi> Body, then the
Earth is; which is much fuller of vertue, fairer, or
more beautifull; also of a better taste relish and
smell: it is, <hi>because</hi> the Astrall Birth or Geniture
receiveth power or vertue from the Word, and
formeth or frameth <hi>another</hi> Body, which standeth
half in the Death, and half in the Life, and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>hidden</hi> between the Wrath of God, and the
Love.</p>
            <p>29. But, that the Fruits upon the Body, are much
pleasanter lovelier sweeter and milder, and with a
Good Taste and relish: that, is even the <hi>Third Birth</hi>
out of the Earth; according to which the Earth shall
be <hi>purged</hi> and cleansed at the End of this time, and
shall be set or put again into its <hi>first</hi> Place, but the
Wrath will abide in Death.</p>

               <p>32. And that <hi>he did not,</hi> but reached back from

befell him, and so he brought himself with his ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost

of his mother, and with his <hi>life</hi> he brought himself

against whom the Devil <hi>warreth</hi> fighteth and striveth
continually, that he might either banish him out of

               <p>And what is Now his Hope?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now it might be Asked:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From or Out of what matter or power and <hi>Vertue</hi>
then did the Grasse, Herbs, and Trees spring
forth? what manner of substance or
condition or Constitution hath
this kind of Creature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>60. The simple saith, <hi>God made All things out of
Nothing:</hi> but He knoweth not, That God; neither
doth he know, what He is: for when he beholdeth
the <hi>Earth,</hi> together with the <hi>Deep</hi> above the Earth,
he thinketh, verily, all this is <hi>not</hi> God, or else he
thinketh, God is <hi>not there.</hi> He alwaies Imagineth
with himself, that God dwelleth onely <hi>above</hi> the
Azure Heaven of the Stars, and ruleth as it were,
with some Spirit which <hi>goeth forth</hi> from him into
this world; and that <hi>his Body</hi> is not present here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth, nor in the Earth.</p>
               <p>61. And just such Opinions and Tenents I have
read also in the Books and Writings of Doctors (<hi>der</hi>

                  <hi>Doctoren):</hi> and there are also very many <hi>Opinions</hi>
Disputations and Controversies arisen about this
very thing among the <hi>Learned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>62. But seeing God openeth <hi>to me</hi> the Gate of his
Being in his great Love, and remembreth the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
which he hath with Man, therefore I will faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:61095:261"/>
and earnestly according to my Gifts, <hi>unshut</hi> and
set wide Open <hi>All the Gates of God,</hi> so far as God will
give me leave.</p>
               <p>63. It is <hi>not</hi> so to be understood, as that I am <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi>
enough in these things, but only so far as I am
able to comprehend.</p>
               <p>64. For, the Being of God, is like a Wheel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
many wheeles are made <hi>one in another,</hi> upward,
downward, crosse-ways, and yet continually turn
all of them together.</p>
               <p>65. Which indeed when a man beholdeth the
<hi>wheel,</hi> he highly marvaileth at it, and cannot <hi>at once</hi>
in its turning learn to conceive and <hi>apprehend</hi> it: but
the more he beholdeth the wheel, the more he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
its Form or frame; and the more he learneth,
the greater Longing he hath to the Wheel; for he
continually seeth somewhat, that is more and more
wonderfull, so that a man can neither behold it or
learn it <hi>Enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>66. Thus, I also, what I do not <hi>enough</hi> describe in
one place concerning this Great Mystery, that you
will find in another place: and what I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
in this book in regard of the Largenesse of the
Mystery, and my Incapacity, that you will find in
the <hi>other</hi> following.</p>
               <p>67. For <hi>this Book</hi> is the first sprouting, or vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Twigg, which springeth or groweth
Green in its Mother, and is <hi>as a Child,</hi> which is learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to go, and is not able to run a Pace at the
<hi>First.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>68. For though the Spirit seeth the Wheel, and
would fain comprehend its form or frame in <hi>every</hi>
Place, yet it cannot do it exactly enough, because of
the turning of the wheel: But when it cometh about
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:61095:262"/>
again, so that the spirit can see the first apprehended
or conceived form again, then <hi>continually</hi> it learneth
more and more, and alwaies delighteth and loveth
the wheel, and longeth after it <hi>still</hi> more and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>69. The Earth hath just such qualities and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
or fountain spirits, as the Deep above the
Earth, or as <hi>Heaven</hi> hath, and all of them together
belong to one only Body: and the whole or <hi>universal</hi>
God is that one onely <hi>Body:</hi> but that thou dost not

the cause,</hi> with and by which, thou in this

<hi>Flesh,</hi> and the power or vertue of the <hi>Deitie</hi>
is <hi>hidden</hi> from thee, even as the <hi>marrow</hi> in the Bones
is hidden from the <hi>Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>70. But if thou in the spirit breakest through the
Death of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Flesh, then thou seest the hidden God.
For as the Marrow in the Bones penetrateth presseth
or breaketh thorough, and giveth vertue power and
strength to the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and yet the Flesh cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
or apprehend the Marrow, but onely the

the hidden Deity in thy Flesh, but thou receivest
its <hi>power,</hi> and understandest <hi>therein</hi> that God dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>71. For the dead or <hi>mortal</hi> Flesh belongeth not

                  </note> to the Birth of <hi>life,</hi> as that it can receive or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

               <p>72. For this Body is but a <hi>Shell,</hi> from which the

               <p>[<q>The new Body groweth out of the heavenly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="y"/>

               <p>As it is, with a <hi>Grain</hi> of wheat in the Earth. The

in Death and in Hell.</p>
               <p>73. Therefore, Man carrieth about with him
here upon Earth, <hi>in</hi> his Body the Devil's Eternall
Dwelling house. O thou fair excellent Goddesse!
mayst thou not well Prance and Trick thy self <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
and in the mean while <hi>invite</hi> the Devill into
the new Birth for a Guest, will it not profit thee
very much; take heed, thou dost not Generate a
New Devill, who will remain in his <hi>own</hi> House.</p>
               <p>74. Behold the Mystery of the Earth, As that
Generateth or bringeth forth, so must thou Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
or bring forth. The Earth <hi>is not</hi> that Body,
which groweth or sprouteth forth, but is the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of that Body, As also thy Flesh is not the spirit,
but the <hi>Flesh</hi> is the Mother of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>75. But now in Both of them, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Earth
and in thy Flesh, there is the <hi>Light</hi> of the clear Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hidden, and it breaketh thorough, and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to it self a Body according to the kind of <hi>each</hi>
Body, for Man according to his Body; and for the
Earth, according to its Body; for as the Mother
is, so also is the <hi>child.</hi>

76. Mans Child, is the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is generated
out of the Astral Birth from or out of the Flesh; and
the Earths child is the <hi>Grasse,</hi> the Herbs, the Trees,
Silver, Gold, and all mineral Oars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now thou Askest:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How then shall I do, that I may understand
somewhat concerning the Birth or
Geniture of the <hi>Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>77. Behold! the Birth of the Earth standeth in
its Birth or Geniture, as the <hi>whole Deitie</hi> doth, and
there is no difference at all, but onely as to the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>
in the wrath, wherein comprehensibility or
palpability standeth: that <hi>only</hi> is the difference or
distinction, and is <hi>the Death</hi> between God and the
Earth.</p>
               <p>78. Thou must know, that all the seven spirits of
God are <hi>in</hi> the Earth, and Generate, as they do in
Heaven: For, the Earth is in God, and God never
Dyed, but the outermost Birth or Geniture is <hi>dead,</hi>
in which the wrath resteth, and is reserved, for
King <hi>Lucifer;</hi> to be a House of Death and of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and to be an eternal Prison or Dungeon.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the seven Spirits of God, and of their
operation in the Earth.</head>
               <p>79. The <hi>First</hi> is the astringent Spirit, and that
contracteth or draweth together in the Astral Birth
of the seven qualifying or fountain spirits, a <hi>Masse</hi> or
Lump in the Earth, through the kindling of the
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:61095:263"/>
superiour Birth or Geniture <hi>above</hi> the Earth, and
dryeth that up with its sharp <hi>coldnesse,</hi> just as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth
or draweth the water together, and maketh
<hi>Ice</hi> thereof, so it also contracteth or draweth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>water</hi> in the Earth, and maketh thereof a
dry Masse or Lump.</p>
               <p>80. Then next, the <hi>Bitter</hi> spirit, which existeth
in the fire-flash, is also in the <hi>Matter</hi> or Masse, and
that cannot endure to be captivated or imprisoned
in the dryed <hi>exficcated</hi> Matter, but rubs it self against
the astringent spirit in the dryed Masse or Lump,
so long till it <hi>kindleth</hi> the fire; and so when that is
done, then the Bitter spirit is terrified, and getteth
its life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conceive this here aright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>81. In the Earth, thou canst not perceive, find, or
search out any thing, <hi>besides</hi> the Herbs Plant or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
and Metals, <hi>more</hi> then Astringency, Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and water: But the water now therein is
<hi>sweet,</hi> opposite to the other two Qualities: Also it
is thin or Transparent, and the other two are Hard,
Rough and Sowr, and alwaies the one is <hi>against</hi> the
other. Thereupon there is a perpetual struggling
fighting and wrestling, but in the struggling of these
<hi>three,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> doth not yet stand: but they are a dark
valley, and they are three things which can never
endure one another, but there is an eternal struggling
amongst them.</p>
               <p>83. And from hence <hi>mobility</hi> taketh its Originall,
also Gods wrath which resteth in the hidden se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie,
taketh its original from hence: and so also
the <hi>Original</hi> of the Devil, of Death and of Hell, it
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:61095:264"/>
ariseth from hence; as you may read thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Fall of the Devill.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Depth in the Center of the Birth
or Geniture.</head>
               <p>84. Now when these <hi>three,</hi> viz. the Astringency,
Bitternesse and Sweetnesse rub themselves one
against another, then the astringent quality grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
predominant, for it is the strongest, and <hi>forcibly</hi>
attracteth or draweth the sweetnesse together, for
the Sweetnesse is <hi>meek</hi> and extensive in respect of its
<hi>Supplenesse,</hi> and must yield to be captivated or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned.</p>
               <p>85. And so when that is done, then the Bitternesse
is also together captivated or imprisoned in the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
of the sweet water, and becometh also together
dryed up, and then the Astringent sweet and bitter
are one in another, and struggle so strongly in the
<hi>dryed</hi> Masse or Lump, till the Masse be quite dry:
For the Astringent quality alwaies contracteth it
together, and dryeth it more and more.</p>
               <p>86. But when the sweet water can defend it self
<hi>no</hi> longer, then (<hi>anguish</hi>) riseth up in it, just as in
Man, when he is <hi>Dying,</hi> when the spirit is departing
from the Body, and so the Body yieldeth it self cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
as a Prisoner to Death: just so the <hi>water</hi> also
yieldeth it self captive as a Prisoner.</p>
               <p>87. And in this (anxious rising up) an anguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heat is generated, whereby a<note n="*" place="margin">Humour <hi>or</hi> moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</note> 
                  <hi>Sweat</hi> presseth
forth, as it doth in a dying Man; and that sweat
qualifieth mixeth or uniteth with the astringent and
bitter qualities, for it is their sonne, which <hi>they</hi> have
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:61095:264"/>
generated out of the sweet water, which they had
<hi>kill'd</hi> and brought to Death.</p>
               <p>88. Now when that is done, then the Astringent
and Bitter qualities <hi>rejoyce</hi> in their sonne, understand
in the Sweat, and each of them giveth to it their
power vertue and Life, and stuffe it, like a greedy
Gurmandizing Hogg, so that it <hi>soon</hi> comes to grow
<hi>full</hi> and swelled: For the astringent quality, as also
the bitter, alwaies draw the sap out of the Earth,
and stuffe it into <hi>their</hi> young sonne.</p>
               <p>89. But the Body, which was <hi>first</hi> contracted or
drawn together out of the sweet water, remaineth
dead or Mortal, and the<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>or</hi> Juice of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> 
                  <hi>Sweat</hi> of the body, which
qualifieth mixeth or uniteth with the astringent and
bitter qualities, hath the <hi>house</hi> therein, where it
spreadeth it self forth, groweth Grosse<note n="*" place="margin">Fat, Lus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious.</note> full and
Lusty or <hi>Wanton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>90. But now the Two Qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> the Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and Bitter cannot leave their contention and
opposition or contrary will, but wrestle <hi>continually</hi>
one with another: The astringent is strong, and
the bitter is <hi>swift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>91. And so now when the astringent grapleth
with the bitter, then the bitter <hi>leaps</hi> aside, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the sonne's sap along with it; And then the
astringent every where presseth hard after it, and
would <hi>fain</hi> captivate it, then the Bitter rusheth out
from the Body, and extendeth it self so far as it can.</p>
               <p>92. But then when the Body begins to be <hi>too
straight</hi> or narrow for it, that it can extend or stretch
it no more, and that the contention be too great,
then the bitter must yield it self captive. Yet for
all that, the astringent <hi>cannot kill</hi> the bitter, but
only holds it captive, and so the strife in them is so
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:61095:265"/>
great, that the bitter <hi>breaks out</hi> of the body in
<note n="*" place="margin">Fibrae.</note> strings like <hi>Thrids,</hi> and taketh some of the Sonnes
sap or Body along with it.</p>
               <p>And this now is the vegetation or
growing and incorporating or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodying
of a Root in the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now thou Askest:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How can God be, in that Birth or Geniture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>93. Behold! that is the Birth or Geniture of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
and so now, if in these three qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> the
astringent, bitter and sweet, the wrath-fire were not
kindled, then thou wouldst <hi>plainly</hi> see, where God
is.</p>
               <p>94. But now the wrath-fire is in all Three: for
the astringent is <hi>too very</hi> cold, and contracteth or
draweth the Body <hi>too hard</hi> together, and the sweet is
<hi>too very thick</hi> and dark, which the astringent soon
catcheth, and holds it captive, and dryeth it <hi>too
much:</hi> and then the bitter is <hi>too stinging,</hi> murtherous
and raging; and so they cannot be reconciled to
agree.</p>
               <p>95. Else if the Astringent were not so much <hi>kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled</hi>
in the cold fire, and the water not so thick, also
the bitter not so <hi>swelling</hi> rising and Murtherous, then
they <hi>Might</hi> kindle<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>or,</hi> that Fire.</note> the <hi>fire,</hi> from whence the <hi>Light</hi>
would Exist, and from the light the <hi>Love,</hi> and so out
of the fire flash, the <hi>Tone</hi> would Exist: and then
thou shouldst <hi>see</hi> plainly, whether there would not
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:61095:265"/>
be a heavenly Body there; wherein the light of God
would and doth <hi>shine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>96. But being the astringent is too cold, and <hi>dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
the water too much, thereupon it captivateth
the <hi>Hot</hi> file in its coldnesse, and killeth or destroyeth
the Body of the <hi>sweet</hi> water, and so the bitter capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateth
it, and dryeth it up.</p>
               <p>97. And so in this <hi>ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iccation</hi> or drying up, the
unctuousnesse or <hi>fatnesse</hi> in the sweet water is killed
or destroyed, in which the fire kindleth it self, and
so out of that unctuosity or fatnesse an astringent and
<hi>bitter</hi> spirit comes to be. For when the unctuousnesse
or fat in the sweet water <hi>dyeth,</hi> then is it turn'd into
an <hi>anguishing sweat,</hi> in which the astringent and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
do qualifie mix or unite.</p>
               <p>98. The meaning is not, that the water dyeth
<hi>quite;</hi> no, that cannot be, but the astringent spirit
taketh the sweetnesse or the unctuosity and <hi>fatnesse</hi>
of the water captive in its <hi>cold</hi> fire, and qualifieth
mixeth or uniteth therewith, and maketh use <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi>
for its Spirit: Its own spirit being wholly <hi>benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
and in Death, therefore it maketh use of the
water for its Life, and draweth out its unctuosity or
<hi>fatnesse</hi> to it self, and bereaveth it of its power.</p>
               <p>99. And then the water becometh an <hi>anguishing
sweat,</hi> which standeth between Death and Life, and
so the fire of the Heat <hi>cannot</hi> kindle it self: For the
unctuosity or <hi>fatnesse</hi> is captivated in the cold fire,
and so the <hi>whole</hi> Body remaineth a dark Valley,
which standeth in an anguishing Birth or Geniture,
and cannot comprehend or reach the life. For the
<hi>life</hi> which standeth in the Light, cannot elevate it
self in the hard, bitter, and astringent Body: for it
is <hi>captivated</hi> in the cold fire, but <hi>not</hi> quite dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:61095:266"/>
100. And thou must see, that <hi>all this</hi> is really so:
for Example, take a Root which is of a <hi>Hot</hi> quality,
put it in <hi>warm</hi> water; or take it into <hi>thy</hi> Mouth, and
make it warm and supple or moist; and then thou
wilt soon <hi>perceive</hi> its life, and <hi>active</hi> or operative
quality: But so long as it is without or <hi>absent</hi> from
the Heat, it is captivated in Death, and is <hi>cold</hi> as
any other Root or piece of <hi>wood</hi> is.</p>
               <p>101. And then thou seest, that the Body upon the
Root is <hi>dead</hi> also: for when the vertue is gone out
of the Root, then the Body is but a dead <hi>Carcasse,</hi> and
can operate or Effect Nothing at all: and that is,
<hi>because</hi> the astringent and bitter spirit hath <hi>killed</hi> or
destroyed the Body of the water, and attracted the
<hi>fatnesse</hi> or unctuosity thereof to it self; and thus they
have drawn<note n="†" place="margin">Bred or hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched up their spirit in the dead Body.</note> or sucked up the Spirit thereof, into
the <hi>dead Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>102. Otherwise, if the sweet water <hi>could</hi> keep
its unctuosity or <hi>fatnesse</hi> in its own <hi>power,</hi> and that
the astringent and the bitter spirit did rub them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
one with another very <hi>gently</hi> in the sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then they would kindle the unctuosity or fatnesse
in the sweet water, and then the <hi>Light</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
generate it self in the water, and would <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten</hi>
the astringent and the bitter quality.</p>
               <p>103. Whereupon they would get their true Life,
and would be satisfied by the <hi>Light,</hi> and rejoyce
highly therein, and from that <hi>living Joy,</hi> Love would
arise up, and then the <hi>Tone</hi> would rise in the fire-flash,
through the <hi>rising up</hi> of the Bitter quality in
the astringent. And if that were done, there it would
be a <hi>Heavenly</hi> Fruit, just as it springeth up in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>104. But thou art to know, that the <hi>Earth</hi> hath
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:61095:266"/>
all the qualifying or fountain spirits: for through
the Devils kindling, the spirits of Life were incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
or compacted together also in <hi>Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and as
it were captivated, but <hi>not</hi> quite murthered.</p>
               <p>105. The <hi>first three,</hi> viz. the Astringent, Sweet,
and bitter, belong to the Imaging or framing of the
Body, and therein standeth the mobility and the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
or Corporeity: and these now have the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
or palpability, and are the Birth of the
<hi>outermost</hi> Nature.</p>
               <p>106. The <hi>other three,</hi> viz. the Heat, Love, and
Tone stand in the incomprehensibility, and are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
out of the first Three; and this now, is the
inward Birth, wherewith the <hi>Deity</hi> qualifieth mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or uniteth.</p>
               <p>107. And now, if the first three were <hi>not</hi> congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or benumm'd in Death, so that they <hi>could</hi> kindle
the Heat, then thou wouldst soon see a bright shining
heavenly Body, and thou wouldst see plainly, <hi>where</hi>
God is.</p>
               <p>108. But being the first Three qualities of the
Earth are congealed or benummed in death, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they <hi>remain</hi> also a Death, and cannot elevate
their life into the <hi>Light,</hi> but remain a dark valley,
in which, there <hi>standeth</hi> Gods Wrath, Death, and
Hell, as also the Eternal Prison, and Source or Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Devils.</p>
               <p>109. <hi>Not that</hi> these three qualities of the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Birth, in which the wrath-fire standeth, are
<hi>rejected</hi> and reprobated even to the innermost; no,
but onely the outward palpable Body, and therein
the <hi>outward</hi> hellish source quality or Torment.</p>
               <p>110. Here thou seest once more, how the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God and the Kingdom of Hell hang one to
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:61095:267"/>
another, as <hi>one</hi> Body, and yet the one cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the other. For the <hi>second Birth,</hi> viz. the
Heat, Light, Love and the Sound or Tone, is hidden
in the outermost, and maketh the outward <hi>moveable,</hi>
so that the outward gathereth it self together, and
generateth a Body.</p>
               <p>111. And though the Body standeth in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
palpablenesse, yet is it formed according to
the kind and <hi>manner</hi> of the inward Birth, for in the
Inward Birth or Geniture standeth the <hi>Word,</hi> and the
Word is the Sound or Tone, which riseth up in the
Light in the fire-flash through the bitter and the
astringent quality.</p>
               <p>112. But being the <hi>Sound</hi> of Gods Word must
rise up through the astringent bitter Death, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
a Body in the half-dead water, thereupon
that Body is Good and also Evill, dead and living;
for it must instantly attract the sapp of <hi>Fiercenesse,</hi>
and the Body of Death, and stand in such a body
and power, as the Earth its Mother doth.</p>
               <p>113. But that the Life lyeth <hi>hid</hi> under and in the
Death of the Earth, as also in the children of the
Earth; I will here demonstrate <hi>it</hi> to you.</p>
               <p>114. Behold! Man becometh weak faint and
sick, and if <hi>no remedy</hi> be used, then he soon falls into
Death. The sicknesse <hi>caused</hi> either by some bitter
and astringent Herb, which groweth out of the
Earth, or else <hi>caused</hi> by an evil mortiferous deadly
water, or by severall mixtures of earthly Herbs, or
by some evil stincking and rank flesh or Meat, and
surfet from thence to <hi>Loathing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>115. Now if a Learned Physitian inquireth from
the sick Person from what his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Disease is <hi>proceeded,</hi>
and taketh that which is the <hi>cause</hi> of the Disease,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:61095:267"/>
whether it be Flesh, Water, or Herbs, and <hi>distills</hi>
or <hi>burneth</hi> it to powder, according as the <hi>Matter</hi> is,
and so burneth away the outward Poison thereof,
which standeth in <hi>Death;</hi> then, <hi>in that</hi> distill'd Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or burnt Powder the Astral Birth remaineth in
its <hi>Seat,</hi> where life and death wrestle o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and are <hi>both</hi> capable of being raised up; for

                     </gap>Body</hi> is gone.</p>
               <p>116. And so now, if thou minglest with this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or powder, some good <hi>Treacle</hi> or the like, which
holdeth <hi>Captive</hi> the rising up and the power of the
wrath in the Astrall Birth, and givest it to the sick
<hi>party</hi> or Patient in a little warm drink, be it Beer or
Wine; then operateth the <hi>innermost</hi> and hidden
Birth of the thing, which hath caused the <hi>Disease</hi> in
man through its outermost dead Birth.</p>
               <p>117. For when it is put into warm Liquor, then
the <hi>life</hi> in the <hi>thing</hi> becometh rising, and would fain
raise it self, and be kindled in the Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>118. But it can do thus much, <hi>viz.</hi>

away</hi> the Disease from a Man: for the Astral Life
riseth up through Death, and taketh away the <hi>power</hi>
from the Sting of Death: and so when that hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the <hi>victory,</hi> then the Party becometh sound again.</p>
               <p>119. Thus thou seest, how the power or <hi>vertue</hi>
of the Word and eternal life in the Earth and in its
<hi>children</hi> lyeth hidden in the center in Death, and
springeth up through Death, incomprehensibly as to
the Death, and continually travelleth in anguish to
the Birth of <hi>life,</hi> and yet cannot flourish or budd till
the Death be <hi>severed</hi> from it.</p>
               <p>120. But it hath its Life in its Seat, and that <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>

be taken from it, but Death hangeth to it in the
outermost Birth or Geniture, as also the wrath in
Death: for the <hi>Wrath</hi> is the life of Death and of the
Devill: and in the wrath standeth also the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Being or the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the Devils, but the dead
Birth or Geniture is their <hi>Eternall</hi> Dwelling House.</p>
               <p>The Depth in the Circle of the Birth
or Geniture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now one might Ask:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What manner of substance hath it, or what is the
condition thereof, that the Astral Birth of the <hi>Earth</hi>
did begin its qualifying operating and generating
one Day <hi>sooner</hi> then the Astral in the <hi>Deep</hi>
above the Earth: seeing the <hi>fire</hi> in the Deep
<hi>above</hi> the Earth is much sharper and easier
to be kindled, then the fire <hi>in</hi> the Earth:
and seeing also that the Earth must
be kindled by the fire in the Deep
<hi>above</hi> the Earth, else it can
Bear no fruit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>121. Behold! thou understanding Spirit; the
Spirit speaketh to <hi>thee,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> to the dead spirit of
the flesh: Open the Door of thy Astral birth wide,
and elevate that one Part of the astral Birth in the
<hi>light,</hi> and let the other in the <hi>wrath</hi> stand still, and
take heed also that thy animated or soulish spirit do
<hi>wholly</hi> unite with the Light.</p>
               <p>122. And so when thou standest in such a <hi>form,</hi>
then thou art as Heaven and Earth is, or as the whole
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:61095:268"/>
Deitie is with its Births or Genitures <hi>in this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>123. But now if thou art <hi>not thus,</hi> then thou art
blind herein, though thou wert the wittiest and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
Doctor, that <hi>ever</hi> could be found in the world.</p>
               <p>124. But if thou art <hi>Thus,</hi> then raise up thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and look through thy Art of Astrology, thy deep
sense, and measuring of Circles, and see if thou art
<hi>able</hi> to apprehend it? <hi>It must be born</hi> IN
THEE, Else thou gettest <hi>neither</hi> Grace nor Art</p>
               <p>125. If the Eyes of thy Spirit shall stand open,
then thou must generate <hi>thus,</hi> else thy Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is a Foolish Virgin, and it befalls thee as if a
<hi>Limner</hi> should offer to <hi>pourtray</hi> the Deity on a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and tell thee, It is made right, the Deity is just
so.</p>
               <p>126. Then the <hi>Believer</hi> and the Limner are <hi>both</hi>
alike, both of them see nothing but only wood and
Colours, and the one blind leadeth the other: <hi>sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
thou art not to fight here with Beasts, but with
Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>127. When the <hi>whole</hi> Deitie in this world mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it self to the <hi>Creation,</hi> then not onely the <hi>one</hi> part
did Move, and the other rest; but all stood joyntly
in the <hi>Mobility,</hi> Even the whole Deep, so far, as
Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> was King, and so far as the place of his
Kingdom <hi>reach'd,</hi> and so far as the <hi>Salitter</hi> in the
wrath-fire was <hi>kindled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>128. The motion of the three Births lasted the
length of <hi>six Dayes and Nights,</hi> wherein all the <hi>seven</hi>
Spirits of God stood in a <hi>full</hi> moving Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as also the <hi>Heart</hi> of the spirits; and the <hi>Salit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:61095:269"/>
of the Earth <hi>turn'd about</hi> in that while,
<hi>six times</hi> in the great wheel; which wheel is the seven
qualifying or fountain spirits of God; and at each
turning about, or Diurnal Revolution, there was
generated a several special fabrick or <hi>work,</hi> according
to the <hi>innate</hi> Instant qualifying or fountain spirits.</p>
               <p>129. For the <hi>First</hi> qualifying or fountain <hi>spirit</hi> is
the Astringent, cold, sharp and hard Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that <hi>belongeth</hi> to the <hi>first Day</hi> in the Astrall
Birth or Geniture, the Astrologers call it the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,</hi>
which was performed on the First Day. For
therein the hard dry sharp Earth and Stones came
to be: and were incorporated or compacted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
moreover then was also generated the <hi>strong</hi>
Firmament of Heaven; and the Heart of the seven
spirits of God stood hidden in the hard sharpnesse.</p>
               <p>130. Astrologers appropriate or attribute the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Day</hi> to <hi>Sol</hi> or the Sun, but it belongeth to <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
to speak of it Astrologically: for on the <hi>second</hi>
Day the Light brake forth out of the <hi>Heart</hi> of the
seven qualifying or fountain spirits through the
hard quality of the Heaven, and caused a mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or allaying in the hard water of the Heaven,
and the light became <hi>shining</hi> in that meeknesse and
allay.</p>
               <p>131. And then the meeknesse and the Hard wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>separated</hi> themselves asunder, and the hardnesse
remained in its hard place, as a hard Death, and
the meeknesse or softnesse penetrated through the
Hardnesse in the power of the Light.</p>
               <p>132. And this now is the <hi>water of Life,</hi> which is
generated in the Light of God out of the hard
Death. And thus the light of God in the <hi>sweet water</hi>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:61095:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Heaven brake through the astringent and hard
dark Death, and <hi>thus</hi> the Heaven is made out of the
midst or Center of the water.</p>
               <p>133. The hard Firmament is the astringent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the <hi>gentle</hi> Mild or meek firmament is the
water, in which the Light of Life riseth up, which
is <hi>the Clarity or Bright Light of
the Sonne of God.</hi> And in this manner or
form also the <hi>knowledge,</hi> and the light of life riseth
up in Man, and the whole light of God in this world
standeth in <hi>such</hi> a Form, Birth, and rising up.</p>
               <p>134. The <hi>Third Day</hi> is very rightly attributed to
<hi>Mars,</hi> because it is a bitter, and a <hi>furious</hi> raging
and stirring spirit. In the <hi>third</hi> Revolution of the
Earth the bitter quality rubb'd it self with the
astringent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Understand this thing rightly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>135. When the Light in the sweet water did <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate</hi>
through the astringent spirit, then the fire-<hi>flash</hi>
terrour or crack of the Light, when it kindled
it self in the water, rose up in the astringent and
hard dead quality, and made all <hi>stirring,</hi> from thence
existed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>136. Now I speak here not <hi>onely</hi> of the Heaven
above the Earth, but this stirring and Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
was also <hi>in</hi> the Earth and <hi>every where.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>137. But being the heavenly fruits before the
time of the wrath, sprung up <hi>onely</hi> in this stirring of
the seven qualifying or fountain spirits, and vanish'd
or <hi>passed away</hi> again by their stirring, and so changed
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:61095:270"/>
or <hi>altered</hi> themselves; <hi>therefore</hi> on the third Day of
the Birth or Geniture of the Creation, they sprung
up also through the stirring of the fire-flash in the
astringent quality of the Earth.</p>
               <p>138. And though indeed the <hi>whole Deity</hi> is in the
Center of the Earth <hi>hidden,</hi> yet the Earth could not
for all that bring forth heavenly fruit, for the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality had <hi>shut</hi> and barred the hard Bolt of
Death upon it, and so the Heart of the Deity <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained</hi>
hidden in its meek and Light Heaven.</p>
               <p>139. For the outermost Birth is <hi>Nature,</hi>
and that ought not to reach <hi>back</hi> into the Heart of
God, neither can it, but is the Body, in which the
qualifying or fountain spirits generate themselves,
and shew forth and manifest their Birth or Geniture
<hi>by their fruits.</hi>

children, for a <hi>witnesse</hi> and demonstration. And if
thou art rationall, then look round about thee, and
view thy self, also consider thy self aright, and then
thou wilt <hi>soon find</hi> from or out of what spirit I
write.</p>
            <p>3. For my part, I will obediently perform the
command of the spirit, onely have thou a care, and
suffer not thy self to be <hi>shut up</hi> by or in an open Door:
for here the Gates of knowledge stand open to thee.</p>
            <p>4. And though the spirit will indeed go against
the Current of some Astrologers, that is no great
matter to me, for I am bound to <hi>obey God rather then
Men:</hi> they are blind in or concerning the spirit, and
if they will not see, then they may remain blind
still.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Now when upon the <hi>Third Day</hi> the fire-flash
rose up out of the Light, which was shining in the
sweet water; which flash is the bitter quality, which
generateth it self out of the kindled <hi>terrour</hi> or crack
of fire in the water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="512" facs="tcp:61095:271"/>
6. Then the whole Nature of this world, became
springing boyling and moving <hi>in</hi> the Earth, as well
as above the Earth, and every where, and began to
generate it self again in all things.</p>
            <p>7. Out of the Earth <hi>sprung up</hi> Grasse, Herbs and
Trees, and in the Earth silver, gold, and all manner
of Oar came to be; and in the Deep above the Earth
sprung up the <hi>wonderfull forming</hi> of power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>8. But that thou mayest understand, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Substance</hi> and condition all these things and
Births or Genitures have, I will describe all orderly
one after another, that thou mayst rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>Ground</hi> of this Mystery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will treat,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Of the <hi>Deep</hi> above the Earth.</p>
            <p>3. Of the incorporating or compacting of the
Bodies of the <hi>Stars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Of the seven chief qualities of the <hi>Planets,</hi> and
of their Heart, which is the <hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Of the <hi>Four Elements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Of the outward comprehensible or palpable
Birth or Geniture, which existeth out of this
<hi>whole Regiment;</hi> or Dominion.</p>
            <p>7. Of the <hi>wonderful proportion</hi> and fitnesse or dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
of the whole wheel of Nature.</p>
            <p>9. Before this Looking Glasse I will now <hi>invite</hi>
all Lovers of the Holy and highly to be Esteemed
Arts, of <hi>Philosophy, Astrology, and Theology,</hi> wherein I
will Lay open the Root and <hi>Ground</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>10. And though I have not studied nor learned
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:61095:271"/>
               <hi>their</hi> Arts, neither do I know how to go about to
measure Circles and <hi>use</hi> their Mathematicall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
and Compasses; I take no great care
about that: However, they will have <hi>so much</hi> to
learn from hence, that many will not comprehend
the ground thereof <hi>all</hi> the dayes of their Lives.</p>
            <p>11. For I use not their Tables Formula's or
Schemes rules and wayes, for I have <hi>not learned</hi> from
them, but I have another Teacher, or School-master,
which is the whole or Totall NATURE.</p>
            <p>12. From that <hi>whole Nature,</hi> together
with its innate instant Birth or Geniture, have I stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
and learned my <hi>Philosophie, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi>
and <hi>Theologie,</hi> and not from Men,
or by Men.</p>
            <p>13. But being Men <hi>are Gods,</hi> and have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God the onely Father, from whom they are
proceeded or descended, and in whom they Live,
therefore I <hi>despise not</hi> the Canons Rules and Formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's
of <hi>their</hi> Philosophie, Astrologie and Theologie.
For I find, that for the most part they stand upon a
<hi>right Ground,</hi> and I will diligently <hi>endeavour,</hi> to go
according to their rules and Formula's.</p>
            <p>14. For I must needs say, that their Formula or
Scheme is <hi>my</hi> master, and I have my beginning and
<hi>first</hi> knowledge from their Formula or Positions:
neither is it my purpose, to go about to amend or
cry down theirs; for I cannot do it, neither have I
<hi>learned</hi> them, but leave them standing in their own
Place and Worth.</p>
            <p>15. But I will <hi>not</hi> build upon their Grounds, but
as a laborious carefull servant, I will <hi>digg</hi> away the
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:61095:272"/>
Earth from the Root, that thereby men may see the
whole Tree with its Root, Stock, Branches, Twiggs
and Fruits: And may see that also my writing is
<hi>no new</hi> thing, But that <hi>their</hi> Philosophie and <hi>my</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie
are <hi>one</hi> Body, one Tree, bearing one and the
<hi>same</hi> sort of fruit.</p>
            <p>16. Neither have I any <hi>command,</hi> to bring in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
against them, to condemn them, for any
thing, but for their wickednesse and Abominations,
as Pride, Covetousnesse, Envy and Wrath, <hi>against</hi>
which the spirit of Nature complaineth very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
and <hi>not I:</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r what can I do, that am <hi>poor
Dust and Ashes,</hi> also very weak, simple and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unable?</p>
            <p>17. Onely the Spirit sheweth thus much, that <hi>to
them</hi> is delivered and entrusted the <hi>weighty</hi> Talent,
and the Key; and they are <hi>drowned</hi> in the pleasures of
the flesh, and have <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ried</hi> their weighty Talent in
the Earth, and have <hi>lost</hi> the key in their proud Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse.</p>
            <p>18. The spirit hath a long time waited on them
and <hi>importuned</hi> them, that they would once open the
Door, for the <hi>clear D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> is at Hand, yet they walk up
and down in their Drunkennesse, seeking for the
Key, when they have it about them, though they
<hi>know it not;</hi> and so they go up and down in their
proud and covetous Drunkennesse, alwaies seeking
about like the Country man for his horse, who all
the while he went a seeking for him, was riding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Back</hi> of <hi>that very</hi> Horse he looked for.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>Thereupon</hi> saith the Spirit of
Nature, being they will not awake
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:61095:272"/>
from Sleep, and open the Door, I
vvill therefore do it my self.</p>
            <p>20. What could I simple vulgar <hi>Lay-Man</hi> teach
or write of their high Art, if it were not given to me
by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Nature, in whom I live and<note n="†" place="margin">subsist, or have my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> am?
I am in the Condition or state of a vulgar or Lay-Man,
and have no <hi>Salarie</hi> Wages or Pay for this
writing: and should I then oppose the Spirit, that
He should not <hi>begin</hi> to open, where and in whom
he pleaseth? <hi>I am not the Door,</hi> but an ordinary
woodden Bolt upon it: and now if the Spirit should
pluck me out from thence, and fling me into the
Fire, could I hinder it?</p>
            <p>21. But if I would be an <hi>unprofitable</hi> Bolt, which
stubbornly would resist to be pull'd out, and should
bolt up and <hi>hinder</hi> the Spirit in the opening, <hi>would</hi>
not the Spirit be angry with me, tear me off, and
cast me away, and provide a more profitable and a
<hi>fitter</hi> Bolt? Then I should lye on the ground and be
trampled under-foot, when as formerly I made so
fair a shew upon the Door: what should this wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Barre then serve for, but to be cast into the Fire
and <hi>burnt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. Behold! I tell thee a Mystery, so soon as the
Door is set <hi>wide</hi> open to its Angle, all uselesse fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nailed
sticking Bolts or Barres will be <hi>cast away,</hi> for
the Door will <hi>never</hi> be shut any more at all, but
standeth open, and then the <hi>Four winds</hi> will go in
and out at it.</p>
            <p>23. But the <hi>Sorcerer</hi> sitteth in the way, and will
make many <hi>so</hi> Blind, that they will not see the Door:
and then they return Home, and <hi>say;</hi> there is no
Door at all, but that it is a meer Fiction, and so they
go <hi>thither</hi> no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="516" facs="tcp:61095:273"/>
24. Thus men suffer themselves easily to be turn'd
away, and so live in their <hi>Drunkennesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. And now when this is done, then the Spirit
is angry, which hath opened the Gates, because
none will go OUT and IN at its Doors any more,
and then it flings the Door-Posts into the Abysse,
and then there is <hi>no more Time</hi> at all: those that are
<hi>within,</hi> remain within; and those that are <hi>without,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
without. AMEN.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it may be Asked:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What are the Stars?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. Moses <hi>writeth concerning them thus:</hi> And
God said; Let there be Lights in the Firmament of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to divide or distinguish the Day from the Night: and
let them give signs and seasons, Dayes and Years: and
let them be Lights in the firmament of Heaven to shine
or give light upon the Earth, and it was so done. And
God made two great Lights: the greater Light to rule the
Day, and the lesser Light to rule the Night; as also the
Stars. And God set them in the Firmament of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to shine or give Light upon the Earth: and to rule
Day, and Night, also to divide or distinguish the Light
from the Darknesse, and God saw that it was good, so out
of the Evening and the Morning the fourth day came to
be, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. v. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>27. This description sheweth sufficiently, that the
Dear man <hi>Moses</hi> was not the original author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
for the first writer thereof did <hi>not</hi> know either
the true God, or the Stars, what they were. And it
is very <hi>likely,</hi> that the Creation, before the Flood, was
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:61095:273"/>
               <hi>not described in writing,</hi> but was kept as a Dark word
in their memories, and so delivered from one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to another, till <hi>after</hi> the Flood, and till people
began to lead Epicurean Lives, in all <hi>voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28. And then the <hi>Holy Patriarchs,</hi> when they saw
<hi>that, they described</hi> the Creation, that it should not
be quite forgotten, and that the <hi>swinish</hi> Epicurean
world might have a Looking-Glasse in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein they <hi>might see,</hi> that there is a God, and
that this Beeing of the world did not <hi>so</hi> stand from
Eternity; whereby they might have a Glasse to look
into, and so <hi>fear the Hidden God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29. And it was the <hi>Chiefest</hi> Iustruction and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of the Patriarchs before and after the Floud,
that they <hi>led</hi> Men to the Creation: as <hi>the whole book
of</hi> Job <hi>also doth drive at</hi> That.</p>
            <p>30. After these Patriarchs came the <hi>wise Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
who went somewhat <hi>deeper</hi> into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Nature:</hi> and I must needs say, according to
the Ground of the Truth, that they in their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie
and Knowledge did come even before the
face or Countenance of God, and yet could <hi>neither</hi>
see nor know Him.</p>
            <p>31. Man was so altogether <hi>Dead</hi> in Death, and so
bolted up in the outermost Birth or Geniture in the
dead Palpability: or else they could have Thought,
that in this Palpability, there must <hi>needs be a Divine
power</hi> hidden in the Center, which had <hi>so</hi> created
this Palpability, and moreover preserveth uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and ruleth the same.</p>
            <p>32. Indeed they honoured prayed to or <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi>
the Sun and Stars for Gods, but knew not how
they were created or came to be; or out of what
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:61095:274"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey came to be: for they Might well have thought,
that they proceeded from somewhat, and that, <hi>That,</hi>
which created them, must needs be Older and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or Greater then <hi>all the Stars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>33. Besides, they had the Stones and the Earth
for an Example, to shew, that they <hi>must proceed</hi> from
somewhat, as also Men and all the Creatures upon
the Earth. For all <hi>give testimony,</hi> that there must
needs be in these things a mightier and greater <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
at hand which had so created all these things, in
that manner, as they are.</p>
            <p>34. But indeed why should I write much of the
<hi>blindnesse</hi> of the Heathens, are not <hi>our</hi> Doctors in
their Crowned Ornaments of Hoods and Corn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r'd-Caps,
<hi>as blind as they?</hi> They know indeed that there
is a God, who hath created all this, but they know
not, <hi>where</hi> that God is, or <hi>how</hi> he is.</p>
            <p>35. When they would write of God, then they
seek for him <hi>without,</hi> and <hi>absent</hi> from this world, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
above in a kind of Heaven, <hi>as if</hi> he were some
Image, that may be likened to <hi>somewhat:</hi> Indeed they
<hi>grant,</hi> that, That God ruleth all in this world, with
a Spirit; but his corporeal propriety or <hi>habitation</hi>
they will needs have in a certain Heaven aloft <hi>many
Thousand</hi> Miles off.</p>
            <p>36. <hi>Come on ye Doctors! if ye
are in the Right, then give answer
to the Spirit: I will ask you a few
Questions;</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. What do you think stood in
the <hi>Place</hi> of this world, before the Time of the world?
Or 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Out of what</hi> do you think the Earth and Stars
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:61095:274"/>
came to be? Or, 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>What</hi> do you think there is in
the <hi>Deep</hi> of the Earth? Or, 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. From <hi>whence</hi> did the
Deep exist? Or, 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>How</hi> do you think <hi>Man</hi> is the
Image of God, wherein God dwelleth? Or 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. What
do you suppose <hi>Gods wrath</hi> to be? Or, 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. What is
<hi>that</hi> in man which displeaseth God so much, that he
tormenteth and afflicteth man so, being <hi>he</hi> hath <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
him? And 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. that he <hi>imputeth Sinne</hi> to Man, and
condemneth him to eternal Punishment? 9<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Why
hath he created <hi>that,</hi> wherein or wherewith Man
committeth sin? Surely <hi>that thing</hi> must be far <hi>worse:</hi>
10<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Wherefore and <hi>out of what,</hi> is that come to be?
Or 11<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. What is the cause, or the beginning, or the
Birth and Geniture of <hi>Gods fierce wrath,</hi> out of or from
which, Hell and the Devil, are come to be? Or,
12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>How comes it,</hi> that all the creatures in this world
do bite, scratch, strike, beat and worry one another,
and yet sin is imputed <hi>onely to Man?</hi> Or, 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Out of
what</hi> are Poisonous and venomous Beasts and worms,
and all manner of Vermine come to be? Or 14<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Out
of what</hi> are the holy Angels come to be? And 15<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>What</hi>
is the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man? And lastly, 16<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>What is the
Great</hi> GOD <hi>Himself?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>37. Give your direct and <hi>fundamental</hi> answer to
this, and demonstrate what you say, and leave off
your Verbal Contentions.</p>
            <p>Now if you can demonstrate out of <hi>all</hi> your books
and writings, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. that <hi>you know</hi> the true and onely
God; and 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>How he is</hi> in Love and Wrath: Also,
3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>What</hi> that God is? and 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. if you can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
that God is <hi>not in</hi> the Stars, Elements, Earth,
Men, Beasts, Worms, Leaves, Herbs and Grasse, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in Heaven and Earth; also that <hi>all</hi> this is not God
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:61095:275"/>
Himself, and that <hi>my</hi> spirit is <hi>false</hi> and <hi>wicked;</hi> then
<hi>I</hi> will be the first, that will <hi>burn</hi> my book in the
Fire; and recall and recant <hi>all</hi> whatsoever I have
written, and will accurse it, and in all obedience
<hi>willingly</hi> submit my self to be instructed by <hi>you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>38. I do not say, that I cannot erre at all. For
there are some things, which are <hi>not sufficiently</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and are described as if it were from a <hi>Glimpse</hi> of
the great God, when the wheel of Nature whirl'd
about <hi>too swiftly,</hi> so that Man with his half dead and
dull capacity or apprehension cannot sufficiently
comprehend it; but what thou <hi>findest not sufficiently</hi>
declared in one place, thou wilt find it done in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
if not in this, yet in the other Books.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now thou wilt say:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It doth not become me, to ask <hi>such</hi> Questions:
for the <hi>Deitie</hi> is a Mystery, which no
man can search into?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>39. Hearken; If it doth not become <hi>me</hi> to ask, then
it doth not become <hi>thee</hi> to <hi>Judge mee.</hi>
Dost thou boast in the knowledge of the Light, and
art a <hi>Leader</hi> of the blind, and yet art <hi>blind</hi> thy
thy self? How wilt thou shew the way to the
blind? must ye <hi>not both</hi> fall, in your blindnesse?</p>
            <pb n="521" facs="tcp:61095:275"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But you will say:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not Blind: for we well see the way
of Light, though <hi>none</hi> can see
it rightly.</p>
            <p>40. Ye teach others the way, and you are <hi>alwaies</hi>
seeking after it your selves; And so you <hi>grope in the
dark,</hi> and discern it not! Or do you <hi>suppose,</hi> that it is
Sin, for any Man to <hi>ask</hi> after the way?</p>
            <p>41. O ye blind Men! leave off
your contentions, and shed not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood; also do not lay waste
Countries and Cities, to fulfill the
Devils will; but put on the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met

with Love one to another, and
practise Meeknesse: Leave off
Pride and Covetousnesse, Grutch
not the different forms of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
also suffer not the Wrath-fire
to kindle in you, but live in
Meeknesse, Chastity, Friendli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and Purity, and then you

Stars and the Earth, <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st</hi> thou say, that is <hi>not</hi> God,
or, there God is <hi>not?</hi> O, thou miserable corrupted
man! Be instructed; for in the Deep above the
Earth, where thou seest and knowest <hi>nothing,</hi> and
sayst, there is <hi>nothing,</hi> yet even <hi>there</hi> is the Light-Holy
God in his Trinitie, and is generating <hi>there,</hi> as
well as in the high Heaven aloft above this world.</p>
            <p>44. Or dost thou think, that he <hi>departed</hi> and went
away from his seat wherein he did sit from eternity,
in or at the time of the Creation of this world? O
no; that <hi>cannot</hi> be, for though He <hi>would</hi> himself do
so, <hi>He</hi> cannot do it, for he himself is All: And as
little as a member of the Body can be rent off from
it self, so little can God also be <hi>divided</hi> rent or <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi>
from Being <hi>Every where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>45. But that there are so many Formings figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
or framings in him, is caused by his Eternall
Birth or Geniture, which first is Threefold, and out
of or from that Trinitie, or Ternarie, it generateth it
self <hi>infinitely</hi> or immensely unconceiveably.</p>
            <p>46. Of <hi>these</hi> Births or Genitures I will here write,
and shew to the children of the last world, <hi>what
God is, not</hi> out of any Boasting or Pride, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to disgrace or reproach any body! No; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
will instruct thee meekly and <hi>friendly,</hi> as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the Flesh.</p>
            <p>47. In my <hi>own</hi> faculties or powers I am <hi>as blind a
Man,</hi> as ever was, &amp; am able to do nothing, but in the

            <p>48. Am I <hi>alone</hi> onely so? No, <hi>but All Men are so,</hi>
be they Christians, Jews, Turks or Heathens; in
<hi>whomsoever</hi> Love and Meeknesse is, in <hi>them</hi> is also the
Light of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou sayst, No, this is not so:
Consider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>49. Do not the Turks, Jews, and Heathens <hi>live</hi> in
the same Body, or Corporeity, wherein thou livest,
and make use of that power and <hi>vertue</hi> of the same
Body, which thou usest, moreover they have even
the same Body, which thou hast, and the <hi>same God,</hi>
which is thy God, is <hi>their God</hi> also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thou wilt say:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They know him not; also they

            <pb n="524" facs="tcp:61095:277"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>50. Yes Dear Man, now boast thy self that thou
hast hit it well! <hi>Thou knowest</hi> God indeed above
others. Behold thou blind Man, where ever Love
riseth up in Meeknesse, there the <hi>Heart of God</hi> riseth
up. For the Heart of God is generated in the meek
water of the kindled Light, be it in Man, or any
where else without Man, it is <hi>every where</hi> generated
in the Center, between the outermost and inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Birth or Geniture.</p>
            <p>51. And whatsoever thou dost but look upon,
<hi>there</hi> is God, but the <hi>comprehensibility</hi> standeth in this
world, in the wrath, which the Devil hath kindled;
and in the hidden kernel in the midst or center of
the wrath the light or Heart of God is generated, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibly</hi>
as to the wrath, and so <hi>each</hi> of them
remaineth in its Seat.</p>
            <p>52. Yet for all that, I do <hi>no way</hi> approve or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the <hi>Unbelief</hi> of the Jews, Turks and Heathens,
and their stiff-necked stubbornnesse, and their fierce
wrath, furious malice and <hi>hatred</hi> against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
No; these things are <hi>meer</hi> Snares of the
Devil, whereby he <hi>allureth</hi> Men to Pride, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Envy and Hatred, that <hi>he</hi> may kindle in them
the hellish fire: neither can I say, that these four
sons of the Devil are <hi>not</hi> domineering in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
nay <hi>indeed</hi> in every Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now thou sayst:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then is the <hi>difference</hi> between Christians,
Jews, Turks and Heathens?</p>
            <pb n="525" facs="tcp:61095:277"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>53. Here the Spirit openeth
both Doors and Gates; if thou wilt
not see, then be blind.</p>
            <p>54. The <hi>first</hi> I. difference is, which God hath
alwaies held and maintained; that all <hi>those,</hi> who
<hi>know,</hi> what God is, and how they should serve him,
that they should be <hi>able</hi> by their knowledge to <hi>presse
through</hi> the wrath into Gods Love, and <hi>overcome</hi> the
Devil: but if they do it not, then they are <hi>no better,</hi>
then those, that know it <hi>not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>55. But if he, that knoweth <hi>not</hi> the way, <hi>presseth
through</hi> the wrath into the Love, then is he <hi>like</hi> him,
who press'd thorough <hi>by</hi> his knowledge; but those
that persevere in the wrath, and <hi>wholly</hi> kindle it in
themselves, they are <hi>all alike</hi> one and other, be they
Christians, Jews, Turks or Heathens.</p>
            <p>Or what dost thou suppose it is, wherewith
Man can serve God?</p>
            <p>56. If thou wilt <hi>Dissemble</hi> with Him, and adorn
or magnifie thy Birth, then I suppose thee to be a
very fine Angel indeed: But He that hath <hi>Love</hi> in
his heart, and leadeth a <hi>mercifull</hi> meek and lowly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
life, and <hi>fighteth</hi> against malice and hatred,
and <hi>presseth through</hi> the wrath of God into the Light,
he liveth with God, and is <hi>One Spirit</hi> with God.</p>
            <p>57. For God needeth no other Service, but that
his creature, which is in <hi>His</hi> Body, do not slide back
from <hi>Him, but be Holy, as He is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="526" facs="tcp:61095:278"/>
58. Therefore also God gave the Law to the Jews,
that they should diligently study and endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>meek</hi> Holinesse and Love, that thereby all the
world might have them for their <hi>Looking-Glasse:</hi> But
when they grew proud, and boasted in their Birth,
<hi>instead</hi> of entring into Love, and turn'd the law of
Love into the sharpnesse of wrath, then God <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
their Candlestick and <hi>went</hi> to the Heathens.</p>
            <p>59. <hi>Secondly</hi> II. There is this Difference betwixt
the Christians, Jews, Turks and Heathens, that the
<hi>Christians know</hi> the Tree of Life, which is CHRISTUS,
CHRIST, who is the Prince of our Heaven and of
this world, and ruleth in all Births or Genitures as a
<hi>King</hi> in God his Father, and Men are <hi>his</hi> Members.</p>
            <p>60. And now Christians know, how they may,
<hi>by the power</hi> of this Tree, presse out from <hi>their</hi> Death
through <hi>his</hi> Death to him into his life, and raign and
live with him, wherein they also with their
<hi>pressing through</hi> with their <hi>new
birth,</hi> out from <hi>this Dead Body,</hi> may be and are
with him in Heaven.</p>
            <p>61. And though the dead Body is in the <hi>midst</hi> or
Center of Hell among all the Devils, yet for all
that, the <hi>new Man</hi> reigneth with God in Heaven,
and the Tree of life is <hi>to them</hi> a strong Gate, through
which they <hi>do</hi> enter into Life: But of this thou shalt
find more largely in its proper Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>62. Moses <hi>writeth, that God said;</hi> Let there be
Lights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Firmament of Heaven, which should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
give a Light to the Earth, and divide or distinguish
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:61095:278"/>
Day and Night, also make Years and Times or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>63. This description sheweth, that the first wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did <hi>not</hi> know, what the Stars are: But He took
hold on the Deitie <hi>at the Heart,</hi> and look'd upon or
had respect to the Heart, to consider <hi>what</hi> the Heart
and kernel of this Creation is, and the Spirit kept
the Astral and outermost Dead Birth or Geniture
<hi>hidden from him,</hi> and did onely drive him in <hi>Faith</hi>
to the Heart of the Deitie.</p>
            <p>64. Which is also the Principal Point, most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for Man: For when he layeth hold on <hi>true
Faith,</hi> then he presseth through the Wrath of God,
through Death into life, and reigneth with God.</p>
            <p>65. But being Men now at the
End of this time, do listen and
long very much after the Root of
the Tree, through which Nature
sheweth, that the time of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Tree is at hand:
therefore the Spirit will shew it
to them: and the whole Deitie
will reveal it self; which is the
Day-spring dawning, <hi>or Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Rednesse,</hi>
and the breaking
forth of the great Day of God, in
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:61095:279"/>
which, whatsoever is generated
from Death, to the Regeneration
of Life, shall be Restored and Rise
again.</p>
            <p>66. Behold, when God said, Let there be light,
<hi>then</hi> the light in the <hi>powers</hi> of Nature, or the seven
spirits of God rose up, and the Firmament of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which standeth in the <hi>Word,</hi> in the Heart of
the water, between the astrall and outermost Birth
or Geniture was <hi>closed</hi> or shut up by or with the
Word and Heart of the water, and the Astral birth
is the Place of the <hi>parting-mark</hi> or Limit which
standeth half in Heaven, and half in the Wrath.</p>
            <p>67. For from or out of that half Part of the <hi>wrath,</hi>
the Dead Birth generateth it self continually, and
out of the other half Part, which reacheth with its
innermost Degree even into the innermost Heart
and <hi>light</hi> of God, generateth it self now continually
through Death, and yet the Astrall Birth or Geniture
is <hi>not two,</hi> but <hi>One</hi> Body.</p>
            <p>68. But when in these <hi>two Dayes</hi> the Creation of
Heaven and of Earth was compleated, and that the
Heaven was made in the heart of the water, for a
difference or <hi>distinction</hi> between the Light of God,
and the Wrath of God, then on the <hi>Third Day,</hi>
through the terrour or crack of the fire-Flash, which
rose up in the heart of the water, and pressed through
Death, incomprehensibly as to Death, there <hi>sprung
up</hi> all manner of Ideas Forms and Figures, as was
done <hi>before</hi> the time of the kindled wrath.</p>
            <p>69. But being the water, which is <hi>the Spirit</hi> of
the Astral Life, stood in the midst or Center of wrath,
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:61095:279"/>
and also in Death, thereupon also every Body form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it self, as the Birth or Geniture to Life and mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Earth.</head>
               <p>70. But now, the Earth was the <hi>Salitter,</hi> which
was cast up out of the innermost Birth, and stood in
Death: but when the fire-flash, through the Word,
rose up in the water, then it was a terrour or <hi>crack,</hi>
from which existed the <hi>mobility</hi> in death, and that
Mobility in all the seven spirits, is now the <hi>Astrall</hi>
Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Depth.
Understand this aright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>71. Now when on the the <hi>Third Day</hi> the fire-flash
in the water of death had kindled it self, then the
Life pressed forth <hi>quite through</hi> the dead body of the
water and of the Earth.</p>
               <p>72. But yet the Dead water and Earth, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<hi>no more</hi> then the flash or terrour or crack of the
<hi>Fire,</hi> where-through their mobility existeth: But
the Light which riseth up very softly Gently or
meekly in the fire-flash, that, <hi>neither</hi> the Earth, nor
the dead water, <hi>can</hi> comprehend.</p>
               <p>73. But it retaineth its <hi>Seat</hi> in the kernel, which
is the unctuosity or <hi>fatnesse,</hi> or the water of life or
the Heaven; for it is the Body of Life, which the
Death <hi>cannot</hi> comprehend, and yet it riseth up in the
Death.</p>
               <p>74. Neither can the wrath take hold of it or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it, but the Wrath remaineth in the terrour
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:61095:280"/>
or crack of the Fire-Flash, and maketh the <hi>Mobility</hi>
in the dead body of the earth and the water.</p>
               <p>75. But the Light presseth in very gently after,
and formeth the Birth, which through the terrour or
crack of the fire-flash hath gotten its <hi>compacted</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Growths or Vegetables
of the Earth.</head>
               <p>76. When now the <hi>Wrathfull</hi> fire-flash awakened
and rouzed up the spirits of Nature, which stand in
Death in the Earth, by its fierce terrour or crack;
then the spirits began, according to their peculiar
<hi>Divine</hi> Right to generate themselves, as they <hi>had
done</hi> from eternity, and form figure or frame a Body
together according to the innate instant qualities of
<hi>that</hi> Place.</p>
               <p>77. Now that kind of <hi>Salitter</hi> which in the time
of the kindling of the wrath, <hi>dyed</hi> in Death, and as
it did qualifie or operate at that time, in the innate
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>or,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</note> instant Life of the seven spirits of God, so also it
<hi>did</hi> rise again in the Time of the Regeneration in the
Fire-Flash, and is not become any <hi>New</hi> thing, but
onely another form of the Body, which standeth in
the comprehensibility or <hi>palpability</hi> in Death.</p>
               <p>78. But now <hi>the Salitter</hi> of the Earth and of the
water is <hi>no more</hi> able to change or alter it self in its
dead Being, and shew forth it self infinitely, as it
did in the heavenly place or Seat; but when the
qualifying or fountain spirits form the Body, then it
riseth up in the power and vertue of the <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>79. And the <hi>Life</hi> of the Light breaketh through
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:61095:280"/>
the Death, and generateth to it another Body out of
Death, which is not <hi>conformable</hi> to, or of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the water, and the dead Earth; also doth not
get <hi>their</hi> taste and smell, but the power of the Light
presseth thorough, and tempereth or mixeth it self
with the power of the Earth, and taketh from Death,
its <hi>Sting,</hi> and from the wrath its poisonous veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
power; and presseth forth up together in the
midst or center of the Body in the growth or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as a <hi>Heart</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>80. And herein sticketh now
the kernel of the Deitie in the
Center in its Heaven, which stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
hidden in the water of Life:
if thou canst now, apprehend or lay
hold on it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Metalls in the
Earth.</head>
               <p>81. The <hi>Metals</hi> have the same substance, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Birth or Geniture, as the <hi>vegetables</hi> upon
the Earth have. For the Metalls or Mineral Oares
at the time of the kindling of the wrath in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
instant Wheel of the seventh nature-Spirit,
stood in the Fabrick <hi>work</hi> or operation of the Love,
wherein the meek beneficence or well-doing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
it self <hi>behind</hi> the Fire-Flash; wherein the
Holy Heaven standeth, which in this Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when the <hi>Love</hi> is predominant, presents or
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:61095:281"/>
sheweth forth it self in such a gracious amiable and
blessed Clarity or Brightnesse, and in such beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
colours, like Gold, Silver, and Pretious
Stones.</p>
               <p>82. But Silver and Gold in the dead Palpability
or Tangibility are but as a Dark stone in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Root of the heavenly Generating: but I
set it down here only, that thou mayst know, from
<hi>whence</hi> it hath its Original.</p>
               <p>83. But being it hath been, the <hi>excellentest</hi> rising
up and generating, in the holy heavenly Nature,
therefore also it is loved by man above all other in
this world. For Nature hath indeed <hi>written</hi> in Mans
Heart, <hi>that it is</hi> better, then other Stones and Earth,
but Nature could <hi>not</hi> reveal or manifest to him, the
ground thereof from whence it is come or proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>whereby</hi> now thou mayst Observe the Day-spring
or Morning-Rednesse.</p>
               <p>84. There are many several sorts of minerall
Oars, according as the <hi>Salitter</hi> in Natures Heaven
was <hi>predominant</hi> at its rising up, in the Light of Love:
For every qualifying or <hi>radical</hi> spirit in the heavenly
Nature containeth the property or kind of <hi>all</hi> the
qualifying or fountain spirits, for it is ever infected
or affected with the other, from whence the Life and
the unsearchable Birth or Geniture of the Deitie,
existeth: But yet is predominant as to <hi>one</hi> Power,
and that is its own Body, from whence it hath the
Name.</p>
               <p>85. But now every qualifying or fountain spirit
hath the property of the whole or Totall Nature,
and its Fabrick or <hi>Work</hi> at the time of the kindling
of the wrath was together also incorporated in
Death, and out of every Spirits fabrick or work,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:61095:281"/>
Earth, Stones, mineral Oars, and <hi>water</hi> came to be.</p>
               <p>86. Therefore also in the Earth there are <hi>found</hi>
according to the quality of Each Spirit, minerall
Oars, Stones, water, and Earth; and therefore it is
that the Earth is of so many <hi>various</hi> qualities, all as
Each qualifying or fountain Spirit with its innate
Instant Birth or Geniture, was, at the <hi>time</hi> of the
kindling.</p>
               <p>87. Nature hath likewise Manifested or <hi>revealed</hi>
so much to man, that he knoweth, how he may melt
away the strange or Heterogene matter from every
qualifying or fountain Spirits strange infected innate
Birth or Geniture: whereby that qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spirit might remain chief in its own Primacy.</p>
               <p>88. You have an <hi>Example</hi> of this in Gold and in
Silver, which you cannot make to be pure or fine
Gold or Silver, unlesse <hi>it be melted seven times in the
fire,</hi> Psal. 12. 7. But when that is done, then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
in the middle or <hi>Central Seat</hi> in the Heart
of Nature, which is the water, sitting in its own
quality and <hi>Colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <div n="1" type="subpart">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>89. First, the <hi>astringent</hi> quality, which holdeth

                  <p>91. Thirdly, the <hi>Bitter</hi> Quality, which existeth
in the kindling of the water fire-flash is melted
away, for that is a Rager Raver Tyrant and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
also no Silver nor Gold <hi>can</hi> subsist, if that be not
<hi>killed</hi> or mortified, for it maketh all dry and Brittle,

in the horrible anguish, and pangs of life, must be
also melted away, for it is a continued Father of the
<hi>Wrath,</hi> and out of or from that is generated the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>

<hi>kill'd,</hi> then the minerall Oary <hi>Salitter</hi> standeth in

the <hi>Love</hi>-spirit riseth up in the water through the

groweth somewhat <hi>harder,</hi> and then the <hi>Life</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
which is risen up in the Love, and stirreth it

for the Hard and dead beating or noise of the bitter

                  <p>97. In this sixth Melting I hold, to be the <hi>greatest</hi>
Danger for<note n="†" place="margin">den Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misten.</note> Chymists about the<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>making.</hi>

a very subtile fire for it, and it may soon be burnt
and made dead or Deaf; and it becometh very dim
or blind, if the fire be <hi>too</hi> cold.</p>
                  <p>98. For it must be a middle or mild fire, to keep
the spirit in the Heart from rising, it must be gently

sound, and continually rejoyceth, <hi>as if</hi> it should
now be kindled again in the Light of God.</p>
                  <p>99. But if the fire be <hi>too Hot</hi> in the Fifth and

it self in the Love in the rising up of the Lights

then there belongeth and is required yet a <hi>more</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
fire, for therein the life riseth up, and <hi>rejoyceth</hi> in
the Love, and will shew forth it self in infinity, as
it had done in Heaven <hi>before</hi> the Time of the wrath.</p>
                  <p>101. And in this motion it groweth <hi>unctuous</hi> or
fat and luscious or luxuriant, it increaseth and
spreadeth it self, and the highest depth generateth
it self very joyfully out of or from the <hi>Heart</hi> of the
Spirit, just as if it would begin an <hi>angelical Triumph,</hi>
and present or shew forth it self infinitely in <hi>divine</hi>
power and form according to the Right of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and thereby the Body getteth its greatest strength

its true vertue and colour, and there is onely <hi>one</hi>

with its <hi>Body</hi> into the Light, but must remain to be
a dead stone; and though indeed it be of <hi>greater</hi>
vertue, then other Stones, yet the <hi>Body</hi> remaineth in
Death.</p>
                  <p>103. <hi>And this now is the earthly
God of Blind men;</hi> which they Love and

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Deep above the Earth.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1.
VVHen Man beholdeth the <hi>Deep</hi>
above the Earth, he seeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Clouds</hi> of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and then he thinketh, Sure
there must be another place, where the Deitie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
or sheweth forth it self, together with the
<hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>Angelical</hi> Government: He will needs
have the Deep together with its regiment or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<hi>severed</hi> from the Deitie: for there he seeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but <hi>Stars,</hi> and the regiment or Dominion <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,</hi>
is Fire, Air and Water.</p>
            <p>2. Then presently he thinketh, God hath made
this thus out of or from his <hi>predestinate purpose, out of
Nothing;</hi> How then <hi>can</hi> God be in this Being? or,
<hi>Can</hi> that be God Himself? He continually Imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that this is onely a <hi>House,</hi> wherein God ruleth
and dwelleth by his <hi>Spirit:</hi> God cannot be such a
God, whose being consisteth in the power of <hi>this</hi>
government, or Dominion.</p>
            <p>3. Many will dare to say, what <hi>manner of God</hi>
would that Be, whose Body, Being, and Power or,
vertue standeth or, consisteth in Fire, Air, Water, and
Earth?</p>
            <p>4. Behold! thou unapprehensive Man, I will
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:61095:284"/>
shew thee the true <hi>ground</hi> of the Deitie: <hi>If</hi> this
whole or universal Beeing, be not God, <hi>then</hi> thou art
not Gods Image: If he be any other, or strange God,
then thou hast <hi>no Part</hi> in him: For thou art created
out of this God, and livest <hi>in</hi> this very God, and
this very God continually giveth thee power, or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Blessing, also meat and drink <hi>out of Himself,</hi>
also all thy knowledge standeth in this God, and
when thou <hi>dyest,</hi> then thou art <hi>Buried</hi> in this God.</p>
            <p>5. Now, if there be any <hi>other</hi> or strange God
without and besides this God, who then shall make
<hi>thee</hi> living again out of this God, in whom thou shalt
be departed and turned to <hi>dust?</hi> How shall that
strange God, out of whom thou art <hi>not</hi> created, and
in whom thou didst <hi>never</hi> Live, bring thy Body and
spirit <hi>together again?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Now if thou art<note n="*" place="margin">or, of any other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls.</note> of any <hi>other</hi> Matter, than
God himself, <hi>how</hi> canst thou then be his Child? or
<hi>how</hi> can the <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>King</hi> Christ be <hi>Gods</hi> Bodily or
corporeal Sonne, whom he hath generated or begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
out of his <hi>Heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Now, if his Deitie be <hi>another</hi> Beeing substance
or thing, than his Body; then there must be a two-fold
Deitie in him, his Body <hi>would</hi> be of or from the
God of this world, and his Heart would be of or
from the <hi>unknown God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. O, thou Child of Man! open
the Eyes of thy Spirit, for I will
shew thee here, the right and reall
proper Gate of the Deitie, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:61095:285"/>
that very One onely God
will have it.</p>
            <p>9. Behold! <hi>that</hi> is the true One only God, out of
whom thou art created, and <hi>in whom thou Livest:</hi> and
when thou beholdest the Deep and the Stars, and
the Earth, then thou beholdest thy God, and in that
same thou Livest, and also art or <hi>hast thy Beeing</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and that same God governeth or ruleth thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and out of or from that same God also thou hast
<hi>thy Senses,</hi> and thou art a Creature out of or from
Him and in him; else thou hadst been <hi>Nothing,</hi> or
wouldst never have been.</p>
            <p>10. Now perhaps thou wilt say; I write Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenishly.</p>
            <p>Hearken and behold! Observe the distinct un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<hi>How</hi> all this is so: for I write <hi>not</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenishly
or Babarously, but Philosophically; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
am I a Heathen, but I have the <hi>Deep</hi> and <hi>true</hi>
knowledge of the One onely great God, who is
ALL.</p>
            <p>11. When thou beholdest the Deep, the Stars,
the Elements and the Earth, then thou <hi>comprehendest
not</hi> with thy Eyes, the bright and clear Deitie,
though indeed it is <hi>there</hi> and <hi>in them;</hi> but thou seest
and comprehendest with thy Eyes, First, Death, and
then, the Wrath of God, and the Hellish fire.</p>
            <p>12. But if thou raisest thy <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<hi>where</hi> God is, then thou apprehendest the Astral
Birth or Geniture, where Love and Wrath move
one against another; but when thou drawest up the
<hi>Faith</hi> in God, who ruleth in <hi>holinesse</hi> in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Dominion, then thou breakest thorough
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:61095:285"/>
Heaven, and apprehendest or layest hold on God at
his <hi>holy</hi> Heart.</p>
            <p>13. Now when this is done, then thou art as the
whole or <hi>totall</hi> God is, who <hi>himself</hi> is Heaven, Earth,
Stars, and the Elements, and hast also such a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Dominion in thee, and art also such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as the <hi>whole God,</hi> in the place of this world, is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now thou sayst:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How shall I <hi>understand</hi> this: for the Kingdom of God
and the Kingdom of Hell and of the Devill are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi>
one from another, and <hi>cannot</hi> be one Body?
Also the Earth and Stones are <hi>not</hi> God? nor the
Heaven, Stars and Elements: <hi>much lesse</hi> can
a Man be God: for if so, he could not
be <hi>rejected</hi> by God.</p>
            <p>Here I will tell thee the ground of all by <hi>degrees,</hi>
one thing after another: therefore keep the Question
in Mind.</p>
            <p>Of the Astral Birth or Geniture,
and of the Birth or Geniture
of God.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Before</hi> the Times of the created Heavens, the
Stars and the Elements, and before the creation of
<hi>Angels</hi> there was <hi>no</hi> such wrath of God, no Death,
no Devil, no Earth nor Stones, neither were there
any Stars, but the Deitie generated it self very <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and lovingly, and formed framed and figured it
self in Ideas shapes and Images, which were incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:61095:286"/>
according to the qualifying or fountain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in their generating, <hi>wrestling</hi> and rising up, and
<hi>passed away again</hi> also through their wrestling; and
figured or framed themselves into another form or
condition, all according to the primacy or <hi>predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy</hi>
of each qualifying or fountain spirit, as you
may read before.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>But observe here rightly,</hi>
the earnest and <hi>severe</hi> Birth or Geniture, out of
which the wrath of God, Hell and Death are come
to be; which indeed have <hi>been</hi> from Eternity in
God, but<note n="†" place="margin">not kindled or Dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> 
               <hi>not accensible nor ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. For the whole or Totall <hi>God</hi> standeth in
<hi>seven</hi> Species or Kinds; or in a sevenfold Form or
Generating: and if these Births or Genitures were
not, then there would be neither God nor Life, nor
Angel, nor any Creature.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>And</hi> these <hi>Births or Genitures have</hi> no Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>but have so generated themselves from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and as to this Depth,</hi> God Himself
knoweth not what He is: For He
knoweth no Beginning of himself,
also he knoweth not anything that
is like Himself, as also he knoweth
no End of himself.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>These seven</hi> Generatings <hi>in all</hi> are <hi>none of them</hi>
the first, the second, or the Third, or Last, but they
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:61095:286"/>
are all Seven every one of them, both the first second
third, fourth and last: yet I must set them down
one after another according to a <hi>creaturely</hi> way and
manner, otherwise thou couldst not understand it:
For the <hi>Deity</hi> is as a Wheel with seven wheels made
one in another, wherein a man seeth <hi>neither</hi> Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
nor End.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe:</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>19. <hi>First,</hi> there is the <hi>Astringent</hi> quality, which
is <hi>alwaies</hi> generated from the other six Spirits, which
in <hi>it self</hi> is hard, cold, sharp like Salt, and yet <hi>farre</hi>
sharper. For a Creature cannot sufficiently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
its sharpnesse, seeing it is not <hi>singly</hi> and alone
<hi>in</hi> a creature; but according to the manner and kind
of the kindled Hellish quality, I know <hi>How</hi> it is:
This astringent sharp quality attracteth or draweth
together, and in the Divine Love holdeth or <hi>retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
the forms and Images, and <hi>dryeth</hi> them so, that
they subsist or are <hi>fixed.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>20. The <hi>Second</hi> Generating is the <hi>Sweet water,</hi>
which is generated <hi>also</hi> out of all the six spirits: for
it is the Meeknesse, which is generated out of the
other six, and presseth it self forth <hi>in</hi> the astringent
Birth or Geniture, and <hi>alwaies</hi> kindleth the astringent
again, and then quencheth and <hi>matigateth</hi> it, that it
be not too much astringent, as it might be in its own
sharpnesse, if it were <hi>not</hi> for the water.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <pb n="544" facs="tcp:61095:287"/>
               <head>III.</head>
               <p>21. The <hi>third</hi> Generating is the <hi>Bitternesse,</hi> which
existeth out of the fire <hi>in</hi> the water: for it rubbeth
and vexeth it self in the astringent and sharp cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and maketh the coldnesse moveable, from
whence <hi>mobility</hi> existeth.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="part">
               <head>IIII.</head>
               <p>22. The <hi>Fourth</hi> Generating is the fire, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isteth
from the mobility or rubbing in the astringent
spirit, and that is now sharp <hi>burning,</hi> and the bitter
is stinging and raging. But when the fire-spirit rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
it self thus ragingly in the astringent coldnesse,
then there is an anxious <hi>horrible</hi> quaking Trembling
and sharp opposite contentious generating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe here the Depth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>23. I speak here as to the kind
and manner of the Devil, as if the
Light of God had <hi>not</hi> yet kindled
it self in these four kinds: and as
if the Deitie had a beginning, I
can no other or nearer way offer it
to your Judgment that you may
understand it.</p>
               <p>24. In this Fourth rubbing is a very hard and
most horrible sharp and <hi>fierce</hi> coldnesse, like a refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
melted and very cold salt-water, which yet is
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:61095:287"/>
                  <hi>not</hi> water, but such a hard kind of power and vertue
as is like Stones.</p>
               <p>25. There is also <hi>therein</hi> a raging raving stinging
and burning, and that water is continually as a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man, when Body and Soul are parting asunder,
a most <hi>horrible anxiety,</hi> a woful painful Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.</p>
               <p>26. O man! here consider thy
self, here thou seest, from whence
the Devil, and his fierce Wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Malice hath its original, as
also Gods Wrath, and the Hellish
fire, also Death and Hell, and
eternal Damnation.
Ye Philosophers observe that!</p>
               <p>27. Now when <hi>these four</hi> Generatings rub them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
one upon another, then <hi>heat</hi> gets the Primacy
and predominancy, and kindleth it self in the sweet
water, and then instantly the Light riseth up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Understand this rightly:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. When the Light kindleth it self, then the fire-terrour
or <hi>crack</hi> cometh forth <hi>first,</hi> as when you strike
upon a Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the fire-crack is first, and then the

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ceiveth it self from the fire-crack.</p>
               <p>29. Now the <hi>fire-crack</hi> in the water goeth through
the astringent quality, as maketh it moveable, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> light generateth it self in the <hi>water,</hi> and becomes
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:61095:288"/>
                  <hi>shining</hi> Light, and is an impalpable meek and most
richly loving Being, which neither I nor any other
Creature can sufficiently write or speak of, but I
<hi>stammer</hi> only like a Child, which would fain learn to
Speak.</p>
               <p>30. That same Light is generated in the midst or
<hi>Center</hi> out of these four <hi>Species</hi> out of the unctuosity
or fatnesse of the sweet water, and replenisheth the
whole Body of this Generating. But it is such a
meek, pleasing, <hi>well-doing,</hi> well-smelling and well-tasting
Relish, that I know <hi>no similitude</hi> to liken it to,
But where Life is generated in the midst or Center
of Death; or as if a Man did sit in a huge scorching
hot flaming fire, and were suddenly snatched out
from thence, and set in such a very exceeding easie
place of refreshment, where instantly all the smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
scalding pains which he felt afore by the <hi>burning</hi>
of the Fire should suddenly passe away, and he be
put into such a pleasing temper and <hi>soundnesse:</hi> Just
so the Generating of the 4. Kinds or Species are set
or put into such a <hi>soft</hi> and meek well-doing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment,
<hi>assoon</hi> as the Light riseth up in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou must understand me
here aright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. I write and mean it in a creaturely kind and
manner, as if a Man had been the Devils Prisoner,
and were <hi>suddenly</hi> removed out of the Devils <hi>fire</hi> into
the <hi>Light</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>32. For the Light hath had no beginning in the
generating of God, but hath shined or given Light
<hi>so</hi> from eternity in the Generating, and God <hi>himself</hi>
knoweth no beginning therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:61095:288"/>
33. <hi>Only the Spirit here setteth
Open for thee the Gates of Hell,</hi>
that thou mayst see, what is the condition of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
and of Hell, and what the condition of Man is,
when the divine Light <hi>extinguisheth</hi> in him, so that
he sitteth in the wrath of God, and then he <hi>liveth</hi> in
such a Generating in such an anguish, Smarting
Pains, woe and misery.</p>
               <p>34. <hi>Neither can I declare it unto thee in any other
manner: for I must write so,</hi> as if the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
or Geniture of God had or
took a beginning, when things
came to be thus; but I write here
very, really true, and Pretious
dear words, which the Spirit alone
understandeth.</p>

               <head>Now Observe:
The Gates of God.</head>
               <p>35. The <hi>Light,</hi> which generateth it self from the

or filleth the whole Geniture, and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
it, and mitigateth it, <hi>that, is the true

36. For the Generating or Geniture of the Father
<hi>cannot</hi> catch or comprehend the Light, and use it to
its Generating, but the Light <hi>standeth</hi> by it self, and
is not comprehended by any Geniture, and it reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth

the onely begotten Sonne of the

or the Birth or Geniture, which qualifieth mixeth
or uniteth with this animated or soulish Birth or
Geniture of God; and <hi>herein</hi> is Mans soul <hi>one

            <div type="part">
               <head>V.</head>
               <p>37. The <hi>fifth</hi> Generating in God, is, when this
<hi>Light</hi> thus very gently mildly and amiably presseth
through the first four Births or Generatings, and
then it bringeth along with it the Heart and most
pleasant <hi>lovely</hi> power and vertue of the sweet water,
and so when the sharp Births or Genitures taste of
it, then are they very meek and <hi>richly full</hi> of Love, and
is as if continually the life did rise up in and from
Death.</p>
               <p>38. <hi>There</hi> each spirit tasteth of the other, and
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:61095:289"/>
getteth meer <hi>new</hi> strength and power, for the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
quality groweth now very pliable and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because it is mitigated by the power of the
Light that springeth out of the sweet water, for it
<hi>warmeth</hi> the coldnesse, and the sweet water maketh

               </p>
               <p>39. And so in the sharp and fiery Births or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratings
there is nothing but a meer <hi>longing</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi>
a tasting, friendly affecting, gratious amiable and
blessed Generating, there is nothing but meer Love,
and all wrath and Bitternesse in the Center is <hi>Bolted
up</hi> as in a strong Hold. This generating is a very
meek beneficiall well-doing, and the bitter spirit
now is the <hi>Living</hi> Mobility.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>VI.</head>
               <p>40. Now the <hi>Sixth</hi> Generating in God, is, <hi>when</hi>
the <hi>Spirits</hi> in their Birth or Geniture thus <hi>taste,</hi> one
of another, for then they become very full of <hi>Joy:</hi>
For the fire-flash or the sharpnesse out of or from
the Birth or Geniture riseth up aloft, and moveth as
the Ayr in this world doth.</p>
               <p>41. For when one power or vertue <hi>toucheth</hi> the
other, then they taste one another, and become very
full of Joy; for the Light becometh generated out
of all the powers, and presseth again through all the
powers; whereby and wherein the <hi>rising Joy</hi>
generateth it self, from whence the <hi>Tone</hi> or<note n="*" place="margin">melody or Musick.</note> 
                  <hi>Tune</hi>
existeth.</p>
               <p>42. For from the touching and moving the living
Spirit generateth it self, and that same Spirit pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
through all-Births or Generatings, very <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveably</hi>
and incomprehensibly to the Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

sharpnesse, like melodious sweet Musick.</p>
               <p>43. And now when the Birth generateth, then it
<hi>conceiveth</hi> or apprehendeth the Light, and speaketh
or inspireth it again into the Birth or Geniture
through the moving Spirit.</p>
               <p>And this moving Spirit is the
Third Person in the Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
of God, and is call'd God

            <div type="part">
               <head>VII.</head>
               <p>44. The <hi>seventh</hi> Generating is, and keepeth its
Birth or Geniture, and <hi>Forming</hi> in the Holy Ghost,
and so when that goeth through the sharp Births
or Genitures, then it goeth forth with the Tone, and
so formeth and <hi>Imageth</hi> all manner of Figures, all
according to the wrestling of the sharp Births or
Genitures one with another.</p>
               <p>45. For they wrestle in the Birth or Geniture
<hi>continually</hi> one with another like a loving Play or
Scene, and according as the Birth or Geniture is with
the <hi>colours</hi> and taste in the rising up, so are the <hi>figures</hi>
also Imaged.</p>
               <p>46. <hi>And this Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
now is called,</hi> GOD <hi>the
Father Sonne and Holy Ghost:</hi>
and neither of them is the First, and neither of them
is the Last: though <hi>I make</hi> a distinction, and set the
one after the other, yet neither of them is the first or
the last, but they have all been from Eternity thus
seated in the same <hi>Equality</hi> of Beeing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="551" facs="tcp:61095:290"/>
47. I must write by <hi>this</hi> way of <hi>distinction,</hi> that the
Reader may understand it: for I cannot write meer
heavenly words, but must write humane words.
Indeed all is rightly truly and faithfully described;
<hi>But the Beeing of God consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
only in Power, and the Spirit
only comprehendeth it, and not the
dead or mortal Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48. And thus thou mayst un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
what manner of Being
the <hi>Deitie</hi> is, and how the three
Persons of the Deitie are: thou
must not liken the Deitie to any
Image; for the Deity is the Birth
or Geniture of all things. <hi>And if
there were not in the First four Species or kinds the
sharp Birth or Generating, then there would be no
mobility, neither could the Light kindle it self, and
generate the Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>49. But now this sharp Birth or Geniture is the
<hi>original</hi> of mobility and of Life, as also of the Light,
from whence existeth the <hi>Living and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
spirit,</hi> which distinguisheth formeth
and Imageth all in this Generating.</p>
               <p>50. For the astringent cold Birth or Geniture is
the <hi>beginning</hi> of all things, which, is astringent, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
contracting and retentive, and formeth and
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:61095:291"/>
contracteth the Birth together, and maketh the Birth
thick or solid, so that out of it <hi>Nature</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to <hi>Bee:</hi> and hence Nature and comprehensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
hath its original in the whole Body of God.</p>
               <p>51. Now <hi>this Nature</hi> is as a <hi>dead</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intellectual
Being, and standeth or consisteth not in
the power of the Birth or Geniture, but is a Body,
wherein the power generateth.</p>
               <p>52. But it is the Body of God, and hath all power
as the whole Geniture hath, and the generating spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
take their strength and power out of or from the
<hi>Body</hi> of Nature, and continually generate again, and
the astringent spirit continually compacteth or
draweth it together, and dryeth it; and thus the
Body subsisteth, and the generating spirits also.</p>
               <p>53. Now the other Birth or Geniture is <hi>the
Water,</hi> which taketh its original in the Body
of <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>54. Now when the Light shineth <hi>thorough</hi> the
astringent contracted Body, and mitigateth it, then
the mild beneficient <hi>well-doing</hi> generateth it self in
the Body, and then the hard power groweth very
mild, and melteth as Ice in the Heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
is <hi>extenuated</hi> or rarified as water is in the Ayr; and
yet the stock of Nature as to the heavenly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
<hi>remaineth</hi> standing.</p>
               <p>55. For the astringent and fire-spirit holdeth it
fast, and the meek water, which melteth from the
Body of Nature in the kindling of the Light, that
goeth through the <hi>severe</hi> and earnest, cold and fiery
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:61095:291"/>
Birth or Geniture, and is very sweet pleasant and
lovely.</p>
               <p>56. Whereby now the earnest and <hi>austere</hi> Birth
or Geniture is refreshed; and when it tasteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
it groweth capable to be raised up, and <hi>rejoyceth,</hi>
and also is a joyful rising up, wherein the life of
Meeknesse generateth it self.</p>
               <p>57. For <hi>this is the water of Life,</hi>
wherein the Love, in God, as also in Angels and Men,
generateth it self: For it is all of one sort of Power
Vertue and Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>58. And now when the Births or Genitures of
the powers taste the water of Life, then they quake
or Tremble for very Love and Joy, and that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
or moving, which riseth up in the midst or
center of the Birth or Geniture, is <hi>Bitter.</hi> For it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
up swiftly out of the Birth, when the water of
life cometh into the Birth or Geniture; like a Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
leaping or springing up of the Birth.</p>
               <p>59. But being it riseth up so swiftly, that the
Birth elevateth it self so suddenly <hi>before</hi> it be fully
affected with the water of life, thereupon that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
or crack keepeth its bitternesse which it hath
out of or from the <hi>austere</hi> Birth: for the beginning
or incaptive Birth or Geniture is very austere, cold,
fiery and astringent.</p>
               <p>60. Therefore also is the terrour or Crack now so
<hi>swelling</hi> and trembling; for it moveth the whole
Birth, and rubbeth it self therein, till it kindleth the
fire in the hard fiercenesse, from whence the Light
taketh its original: And then the trembling crack
becometh enlightned with the <hi>Meeknesse</hi> of the
Light, and goeth in the Birth or Geniture up and
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:61095:292"/>
down, and crosse-wayes both upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
like a wheel made with <hi>seven</hi> wheels one in
another.</p>
               <p>61. In this pressing through and turning about
existeth the <hi>Tone,</hi> according to the Quality of each
spirit, and alwaies one power affecteth the other, for
the powers are as <hi>loving Brethren</hi> in one Body, and
the meeknesse riseth up, and the spirit generateth
and sheweth it self infinitely.</p>
               <p>62. For that power, which in the <hi>turning about</hi>
sheweth it self the strongest in the generating, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that power, manner and colour the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> also imageth shapeth or frameth the figures in
the Body of <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>63. <hi>Thus thou seest,</hi> that <hi>none</hi> of the powers is the
first, also none the second, third, fourth or Last: but
the last generateth the First as well, as the first the
Last, and the middle most taketh its original from
the Last as also from the First, as well as from the
Second, Third, or any of the rest.</p>
               <p>64. Thou seest also, that Nature cannot be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd</hi>
from the powers of God, but is all one
Body.</p>
               <p>65. The Deitie, that is, the holy power of the
Heart of God is generated <hi>in Nature,</hi> and so also the
Holy Ghost existeth or goeth forth out of the Heart
of the Light <hi>continually,</hi> through all the powers of
the Father, and figureth all, and Imageth or frameth
All.</p>
               <p>66. This Birth or Geniture is now in <hi>Three</hi> distinct
<hi>Parts,</hi> every one being several and <hi>Totall,</hi> and yet
<hi>neither</hi> of them is divided asunder from the other.</p>

               <p>68. But if in a Creature or in any Place the light
be <hi>extinguisht,</hi> then is the austere Birth or Geniture
<hi>there,</hi> which lyeth hid in the Light in the innermost

               </p>
               <p>69. <hi>The second part or the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

enlightneth again all the powers of the <hi>Father,</hi> and
hath the fountain of all powers. But is therein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
from the Father as a <hi>singular Person,</hi> in
that it cannot comprehend the Birth or Geniture of
the Father, and yet is the Fathers <hi>Sonne,</hi> which is
alwaies generated from or out of the Father: An
instance whereof you have in all the kindled <hi>Fires,</hi>
in this world, do but consider of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="556" facs="tcp:61095:293"/>
70. And the <hi>Father</hi> loveth this his onely begotten
or innate <hi>Sonne</hi> therefore so heartily, <hi>because</hi> he is the
Light and the meek beneficent well-doing in <hi>his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
through whose power the Fathers <hi>Joy</hi> and Delight
riseth up.</p>
               <p>71. <hi>Now these are two Persons,</hi>
and neither of them can apprehend retain or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the other, and the One is <hi>as great</hi> as the
other; and if either of them were not, the other could
not be neither.</p>
               <p>72. Observe here ye Jews, Turks

               <p>74. <hi>This I write in the power

third Person in the Being of God
is the moving Spirit,</hi> which existeth
from the rising up in the terrour or Crack, where

from the dead or mortal <hi>Reason,</hi> but my spirit qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth
mixeth or uniteth with God, and proveth or
searcheth the <hi>Deitie</hi> how it is in all its Births or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitures
in its taste and smell: and I find, that the
Deitie is a very simple, <hi>pure,</hi> meek, loving and Quiet
Beeing; and that the birth of the <hi>Ternarie</hi> of God
generateth it self very meekly, friendly, lovingly
and unanimously, and the <hi>sharpnesse</hi> of the innermost
Birth, <hi>can never</hi> elevate or swell it self into the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Ternarie, but remaineth <hi>hidden</hi> in the
Deep.</p>
               <p>84. And the sharpness in the hidden secresie is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God's WRATH, and the Being of meeknesse in the
Ternarie or <hi>Trinity,</hi> is called GOD. Here nothing
goeth out of or forth from the sharpnesse, which
<hi>perisheth,</hi> or which doth kindle the wrath, but the
spirits Play very <hi>gently</hi> one with another, like little
children, when they rejoyce one with another, where
every one hath his work, and so they <hi>play</hi> one with
another, and lovingly kisse and court one another.</p>
               <p>85. Such a work also the Holy Angels <hi>exercise</hi>
themselves in, and in the <hi>Ternarie</hi> of God there is a
very meek, pleasant, and sweet beeing, where the
Spirit alwaies elevateth it self in the<note n="*" place="margin">Tune me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody or Musick.</note> Tone, and the
one power toucheth the other, as if there were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Melodious Hymnes or Songs and <hi>consorts</hi> of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
Instruments plaid upon.</p>
               <p>86. And as the rising up of the spirits, in every
place is, so the Tone also formeth it self, but very
<hi>meekly,</hi> and incomprehensibly to the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the
Angels, but very comprehensibly to the animated
or soulish Birth or Geniture of Angels: and as the
Deitie presenteth it self in each place, so the Angels
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:61095:295"/>
also present themselves: For the Angels were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of <hi>this Being,</hi> and have among them their
Princes of the qualifying or fountain spirits of God,
as they are in the Birth or Geniture of God.</p>
               <p>87. Therefore as the Beeing of God presents or
sheweth forth it self in the Birth or Geniture, so do
the <hi>Angels</hi> also, and that power, which at any time
hath the <hi>primacie</hi> in the Birth or Geniture of God,
and rejoyceth out of the Heart of God in the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> that Power's Prince of the Angels beginneth
also his Hymn, and Jubilateth with his Hoast or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>88. But when the <hi>Heart</hi> of God sheweth forth it
self with its Clarity or Brightnesse, then there riseth
up the whole Hoast or Army of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>three</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms

               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe further:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>95. When God created the Angels, all of them
were created wholly out of this Birth or Geniture
of God, their Body was <hi>compacted</hi> or incorporated
out of Nature, therein their <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
themselves, as the Deitie generated it self.
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:61095:296"/>
And as the qualifying or fountain spirits of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
took their power and strength out of or from
the <hi>Body</hi> of Nature, so the Angels also, they took
their power and strength alwaies out of or from the
Nature of God.</p>
               <p>96. And as the Holy Ghost in Nature formeth
and Imageth or frameth <hi>all,</hi> so the spirit of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
also qualified or united with the Holy Ghost,
and did <hi>help</hi> to form frame and Image <hi>all,</hi> that all
might be One Heart and will, and a meer delight
and Joy: For the Angels are the Children of the
Great God, which He hath generated in his Body of
<hi>Nature</hi> for the multiplying of the divine Joy.</p>
               <p>97. But here thou must know, that the <hi>Bodies</hi> of
Angels cannot apprehend the Birth or Geniture of
God, neither doth their Body <hi>understand</hi> it, their <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
onely understandeth it, but the Body holdeth
still, as the <hi>Nature</hi> in God doth, and lets the spirit
co-work and Labour with God, and Play lovingly.</p>
               <p>98. For the Angels Play before and in God, as
little children play before their <hi>Parents,</hi> whereby the
Divine Joy is increased.</p>
               <p>99. But when the mighty potent Prince and King
<hi>Lucifer</hi> was created, he would <hi>not</hi> do so, but eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and swelled himself, and would be God alone,
and kindled the wrath-fire in himself, and so did all
<hi>his</hi> Angels also.</p>
               <p>100. But when that was done, he roared with his
kindled fire-spirit, abroad into the <hi>Nature</hi> of God,
and then the whole Body in the Nature of God, as
far as his Kingdom and Dominion <hi>reach'd,</hi> was
kindled: But being his light was <hi>instantly</hi> extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd,
he could no more qualifie or unite with his
Spirit in the <hi>two</hi> Births or Genitures, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Sonne
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:61095:297"/>
of God, and of the Holy Spirit of God, but remained
standing in the <hi>sharp</hi> Birth or Geniture of God.</p>
               <p>101. For the light of God and the Spirit of God,
<hi>cannot</hi> comprehend the sharp Birth or Geniture, and
<hi>therefore</hi> they are <hi>two distinct Persons:</hi> And so Lord
<hi>Lucifer</hi> could no more touch, see, feel or taste the
Heart of God and the Holy Spirit of God, with his
<hi>austere,</hi> cold, and hard fire-Birth, but was <hi>Spewed</hi>
out with his fire-spirit, into the outermost Nature,
wherein he <hi>had kindled</hi> the wrath-fire.</p>
               <p>102. And <hi>that</hi> Nature is indeed the Body of God,
wherein the Deitie generateth it self, but the Devils
cannot apprehend the <hi>meek Birth</hi> of God, which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
up in the Light: For their Body is <hi>dead</hi> to the
Light, and liveth in the outermost and austere Birth
or Geniture of God, wherein the Light <hi>never</hi> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth
it self again any more.</p>
               <p>103. For their unctuousnesse or fatnesse in the
sweet water is <hi>burnt</hi> up, and that water is turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a sowr <hi>stinck,</hi> wherein the Light of God can no
more kindle it self, and the Light of God can no
more enter into it.</p>
               <p>104. For the qualifying or fountain spirits of the
<hi>Devils</hi> are shut up in the hard wrath, their Bodies
are a hard <hi>Death,</hi> and their spirits are a fierce <hi>Sting</hi>
of the wrath of God, and their qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spirits generate themselves continually in the
innermost sharpnesse, according to the sharp<note n="*" place="margin">right <hi>or</hi> Order.</note> Law
of the Deitie.</p>
               <p>105. For otherwise they cannot generate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
neither can they dye or passe away, vanish
and be no more, but they <hi>stand</hi> in the most anguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

NOw when the <hi>whole Body</hi> of Nature in the

the Stars from or out of Nature out of the

<hi>moved</hi> it self <hi>again,</hi> as it <hi>had done</hi> from eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="554" facs="tcp:61095:298"/>
2. Indeed it had moved on the <hi>First Day,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the Birth or Geniture in the Body of the <hi>corrupt</hi>
Nature: for on the <hi>first</hi> Day, the life <hi>separated</hi> it selfe
from the Death, and on the <hi>second</hi> Day a firmament
was Created <hi>between,</hi> and on the <hi>third</hi> Day the Life
<hi>brake forth</hi> through Death. For there the light
brake <hi>forth</hi> through the Darknesse, and made the
dead body of Nature to spring flourish and to be
stirring and agile.</p>
            <p>3. For on the <hi>third Day</hi> the Body of Nature did
travell <hi>so</hi> hard in anxietie, till the <hi>Love fire</hi> had kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
it selfe in the Death, and till the Light of life was
broken forth through the <hi>congealed</hi> Body of Death;
and sprung up out of Death; but on the third Day
it stood onely in the <hi>Fire crack,</hi> from whence mobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>4. On the <hi>fourth Day</hi> the Light rose up, and made
its seat in the house of death, and yet <hi>Death</hi> could
not, nor cannot comprehend it: As <hi>little</hi> as the austere
Birth of God, which standeth in the innermost

the meeknesse, and the light of the meeknesse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Spirit in the meeknesse; <hi>so little</hi> also can
the dead Darknesse of this world comprehend the

            <p>5. But the light shineth through Death, and hath
made its <hi>Royall</hi> seat in the midst or center in the

               <hi>Body</hi> of God, out of the house of

            <p>How shall I understand this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. I <hi>cannot</hi> at all write it in thy Heart, for it is not
for every Mans capacity, understanding and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
especially where the Spirit standeth in
the <hi>House of wrath,</hi> and doth <hi>not</hi> qualifie operate or
unite with the Light of God. But I will shew it to
thee in an Earthly <hi>similitude,</hi> that thou mightst if po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible
get a little into the <hi>deep</hi> Sence.</p>
            <p>7. Behold and consider a <hi>Tree,</hi> on the outside it
hath a hard grosse <hi>Rind</hi> or <hi>Bark</hi> which is Dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numm'd,
and without Vegetation, yet it is not <hi>quite</hi>
Dead, but in a faintnesse or imbecillity, and there
is a great difference between it and the Body, which
groweth next under the Rind or Bark. But the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hath its Living Power, and breaketh forth
through the <hi>Withered</hi> Rind, and generateth many
faire <hi>young</hi> Bodys or <hi>Twigs,</hi> all which stand in the
<hi>old Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. But the <hi>Rind</hi> is as it were dead, and cannot
comprehend the <hi>Life</hi> of the Tree, but only hangs to
it, and is a <hi>Cover</hi> to the Tree in which worms doe
Harbour, which in the End destroy the Tree.</p>
            <p>9. And <hi>thus</hi> also is the whole House of this world:
the <hi>outward</hi> Darknesse is the House of Gods Wrath,
wherein the Devils dwell, and it is rightly the
House of Death, for the Holy Light of God hath
<hi>dyed</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>[<q>Understand, it stepp'd into its principle, and is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="bb"/>
outward substantiality in God, as it were dead

               <pb n="568" facs="tcp:61095:299"/>
10. But the Body of this great House, which lyeth
hid under the <hi>Shell</hi> or Rind of darknesse, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibly
to darknesse, <hi>that</hi> is the house of Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Love and Wrath <hi>wrestle</hi> one with another.</p>
            <p>11. Now the Love alwaies breaketh <hi>through</hi> the
House of Death, and generateth <hi>holy</hi> heavenly Twigs
in the great Tree; which Twiggs stand in the Light:
For they spring up through the shell or <hi>skin</hi> of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as the Twiggs do through the shell or Bark of
the Tree, and are <hi>One Life</hi> with God.</p>
            <p>12. And the wrath springeth up also in the House

            <p>What are the Stars? or out of what are
they come to be?</p>
            <p>14. They are the <hi>power</hi> of the seven Spirits of
God: for when the wrath of God, was kindled by
the Devil, in this world, then the <hi>whole House</hi> of this
world in Nature or the outermost Birth or Geniture
was as it were benumm'd or <hi>chilled</hi> in Death, from
whence the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> are come to be. But
when this hard drosse or <hi>Scum</hi> was driven together
into a Lump or Heap, then the <hi>Deep</hi> was clear'd, but
was very dark, for the light therein was dead in the
<hi>wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. But now the Body of God, as to this world,
could not <hi>remain</hi> in Death, but God moved himself
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:61095:299"/>
with his seven qualifying or fountain spirits to the
<hi>Birth</hi> or Geniture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thou must understand this high thing rightly:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. The <hi>Light</hi> of God, which is the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God,
as also the Holy Ghost, <hi>died not,</hi> but the Light, which
is gone forth from or out of the heart of God <hi>from
eternity,</hi> and hath enlightned Nature, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
out of the seven spirits, that is <hi>departed</hi> or gone
away from the hard <hi>corrupted</hi> Nature; from whence
it is that the Nature of this world with its compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
or palpability hath <hi>remained</hi> in Death,
and cannot apprehend the Light of God, but is a
dark House of Devils.</p>
            <p>17. Upon this On the <hi>fourth</hi> Day of the Creation
God <hi>regenerated</hi> anew the whole House of this world
with the qualities thereof, and hath <hi>placed</hi> or set the
qualifying or fountain spirits in the House of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that he might generate to himself again out
of that, a <hi>new Body,</hi> to his praise honour and Glory.</p>
            <p>18. For his purpose was to create <hi>another</hi> Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Hoast or Army, out of this House; which was thus
to be done: He would create an Angel, which was
<hi>Adam,</hi> who should generate out of himself Creatures
<hi>like</hi> himself, which should possesse the House of the
New Birth, and in the middle of Time, <hi>their King</hi>
should be generated or born out of a Humane Body,
and possesse the new-born Kingdom as a King of these
Creatures, instead of the <hi>corrupted</hi> and expell'd Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer.</p>
            <p>19. And at the <hi>fulnesse</hi> or accomplishment of this
Time, God would adorn and Trim this House with
its qualities, as a Royal Government, and let those
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:61095:300"/>
very qualifying or fountain spirits <hi>possesse</hi> the whole
House, that they might in that House of darknesse
and of Death, bring forth Creatures and Images
again, as they <hi>had done</hi> from eternity, till the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
or fulfilling of the whole Hoast or Army
of the new created Angels, which were Men: And
<hi>Then,</hi> God would bolt and barr up the Devil in the
House of darknesse in an eternal Hole, and then
kindle the whole House in its own Light again, <hi>all
but</hi> the very Hole Hell or Dungeon of the Devils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it may be Asked:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why did not God bolt him up instantly, and then
he had <hi>not</hi> done so much mischief?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. Behold! this was Gods <hi>purpose,</hi> and that must
stand, <hi>which is,</hi> he would re-edifie out of the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nature of the Earth, or build again to himself
an Angelical Hoast or Army: Understand, <hi>viz.</hi> a
true Body, which should <hi>Subsist</hi> eternally in God.</p>
            <p>21. It was not Gods intention at all to let the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<hi>have</hi> the whole Earth for an eternal dwelling
house, but onely the Death and <hi>fiercenesse</hi> of the
Earth, which the Devil had brought into it.</p>
            <p>22. For <hi>what</hi> sin hath the <hi>Salitter</hi> committed
against God, that it should stand totally in <hi>Eternal</hi>
shame? None; It was onely a Body, which must
hold still, when the Devil elevated or swelled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
therein.</p>
            <p>23. Now if He should have instantly <hi>left</hi> it to the
Devil for an Eternal dwelling House, then out of
<hi>that</hi> place a New Body could <hi>not</hi> have been built.
Now what Sin had that space place or <hi>Room</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:61095:300"/>
against God, that it should stand in eternal
Shame? None: and therefore that were <hi>unequall</hi> to
be so.</p>
            <p>24. Now the purpose of God was, to make a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
excellent Angelical Hoast or Army out of the
<hi>Earth,</hi> and all manner of Ideas forms or Images.
For, in and upon that all should Spring, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themselves <hi>anew,</hi> as we see in mineral Oares,
Stones, Trees, Herbs and Grasse, and all manner of
Beasts; after a <hi>heavenly</hi> Image or Form.</p>
            <p>25. And though those Imagings were <hi>transitory,</hi>
being they were not pure before God, yet God would
at the End of this time, <hi>extract</hi> and draw forth the
Heart and the kernel, out of the new Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and <hi>separate</hi> it from Death and Wrath, and
the new Birth should Eternally spring up in God,
without, <hi>distinct</hi> from this place, and bear Heavenly
fruits <hi>again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. But the death of the Earth and the wrath
therein should be Lord <hi>Lucifers</hi> eternal House, after
the accomplishing of the new Birth or Geniture: in
the mean while Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> should lie <hi>captive</hi> in the
Darknesse in the Deep above the Earth; and there
he is now, and may <hi>very shortly</hi> expect his Portion.</p>
            <p>27. And that this New Birth or Geniture might
be accomplished, whether the Devil will or <hi>no,</hi> the
Creator hath therefore in the Body of this world ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
himself, as it were <hi>creaturely</hi> in his qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or fountain spirits, and all the Stars are nothing
else but Gods <hi>powers,</hi> and the whole Body of this
world consisteth in the seven qualifying or fountain
spirits.</p>
            <p>28. But that there are so many Stars of so manifold
different effects and operations, it is from the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitenesse,</hi>
               <pb n="572" facs="tcp:61095:301"/>
which is in the<note n="*" place="margin">Infection or Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> efficiency of the seaven
spirits of God, in one another, which generate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
infinitely.</p>
            <p>29. But that the Birth or the <hi>Bodys</hi> of the Starrs
doe not change or alter in their <hi>seat,</hi> but do as they
did from eternitie, it signifyeth that there shall be a
<hi>constant</hi> continued Birth or Geniture, whereby the
<hi>benumm'd</hi> Body of the Earth should continually and
<hi>constantly,</hi> in one <hi>uniform</hi> operation, which yet stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the infinitenesse, be kindled againe, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it selfe a new, and so also should the House of
darknesse of the Deep above the Earth; whereby
the new Body might continually and constantly be
generated out of Death, till time should be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
and the whole new borne Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now thou wilt object and say.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then sure the Starrs are God, and they must
be honoured and worshipp'd as God?</p>
            <p>30. The wise Heathen also came to this who indeed
in their sharp or acute understandings far <hi>excelled</hi>
our Philosophers, but the <hi>right</hi> Door of knowledge
hath remained yet <hi>hidden</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>13. Behold! the Starrs are plainly incorporated
or <hi>compacted</hi> out of or from God, but thou must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the difference between them: for, they are
<hi>not</hi> the Heart, and the meek pure Deitie, which man
<hi>is to honour</hi> and worship as God, But they are the
innermost and sharpest <hi>Birth</hi> or Geniture, wherein
all things stand in wrestling and <hi>fighting,</hi> wherein the
Heart of God alwaies generateth it self, &amp; the Holy
Ghost <hi>continually</hi> riseth up from the rising of the Life</p>
            <p>32. But the sharp Birth or Geniture of the Starrs
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:61095:301"/>
               <hi>cannot</hi> apprehend the Heart of God again, nor the
Holy Ghost; but the Light of God, which riseth up
in the <hi>anxiety,</hi> together with the moving of the Holy
Ghost remaineth <hi>free</hi> to it self as the Heart, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in the mid'st or center of the <hi>Closure</hi> of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Heaven, which is from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r out of the Water of
Life.</p>
            <p>33. For from the Heaven the Starrs have their
<hi>first kindling,</hi> and are onely as an <hi>instrument,</hi> which
God useth to the Birth or Geniture.</p>
            <p>It is Just such a Birth, as is in <hi>Man;</hi> the Body is even
the <hi>Father</hi> of the soule, and when the Body standeth
in the anguishing Birth or Geniture of God, as the
Starrs doe, and not in the fierce hellish Birth, then
the soul of Man qualifieth mixeth or <hi>uniteth</hi> with
the pure Deitie, as a Member in or of his Body.</p>
            <p>35. Thus also is the Heart or Light of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
generated in the Body of this world, and that
generated Heart is <hi>one Heart</hi> with the eternal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
lesse infinite Heart of God, which is in and
above all Heavens.</p>
            <p>36. It is <hi>not only</hi> generated in and from the Starrs,
but in the <hi>whole</hi> Body of this world, but the Starrs
alwaies kindle the Body of this World, that the
Birth or Geniture may subsist <hi>every</hi> where:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here thou must well observe this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>37. The light or the Heart of God taketh <hi>not</hi> its
original, barely from the wild rough Starrs, where
indeed Love and wrath are one in another, but out of
or from the <hi>Seat</hi> where the meek water of Life is
continually generated.</p>
            <p>38. For that water, at or in the kindling of the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:61095:302"/>
wrath was not apprehended by <hi>Death,</hi> but subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from eternity to eternity, and reacheth to all
the Ends and Parts of or in this world, and is
<hi>the water of Life,</hi> which breaketh through
Death, out of which the new Body of God in this
world is <hi>built.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>39. But it is <hi>in</hi> the Stars as well as in all Ends
corners and places, but not in any place, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
or <hi>palpable,</hi> but filleth or replenisheth all
alike at once: It is also in the Body of Man, and he
that thirsteth after this water, and <hi>drinketh</hi> thereof,
<hi>in him the light of life kindleth it
self,</hi> which is the heart of God, and there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
springeth forth, the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now thou Askest:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How then do the Stars subsist in Love
and Wrath?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40. Behold! the Stars are risen or proceeded out
of the <hi>Kindled House</hi> of Gods wrath, as the<note n="†" place="margin">the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward stirring of Life in the Child.</note> mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or stirring of a <hi>Child</hi> in the Mothers Body or
Womb in Three<note n="*" place="margin">as Gen. 38. 24.</note> Months: But now they have
attained their kindling from the eternal benummed
water of Life, for that water in Nature was <hi>never</hi>
dead.</p>
            <p>41. But when God moved himself in the Body of
this world, then on the <hi>third Day</hi> the anxiety, in the
birth of this world rubbed it self, from whence the
fire-flash existed, and the light of the Stars kindled
it self in the water of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="575" facs="tcp:61095:302"/>
42. For till the <hi>third</hi> Day from the time of the
kindling of Gods wrath in this world, Nature in the
anxiety was a <hi>dark</hi> valley, and stood in Death, but
on the third Day the life brake through Death, and
the <hi>New Birth</hi> began.</p>
            <p>43. For so long, and not an hour longer, <hi>the
new born King and Grand Prince
of this world,</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>rested
in Death,</hi> and hath born or generated the
<hi>first three</hi> Dayes of the Creation of Nature, and
that very Time; in Death to Light again, that this
time might again be <hi>one</hi> Time with the <hi>Eternal</hi> Time,
and that no Day of Death might be <hi>between:</hi> and
that the Eternal Love, and the new born or Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Love out of the new Body of Nature might
be <hi>one</hi> Eternal <hi>Love,</hi> and that there might be <hi>no</hi>
difference between the eternal Love, and the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
or regenerated Love, but that the new-born
Love might reach into the Being or Substance, which
was from Eternity, and <hi>it self</hi> also be in Eternity.</p>
            <p>44. Thus the new-born Love, which rose out of
the water of Life in the light <hi>in</hi> the Stars, and <hi>in</hi> the
whole Body of this world, is wholly bound and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the eternal beginning lesse infinite Love, so
that they are <hi>one</hi> Heart and <hi>one</hi> Spirit, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
and preserveth all.</p>
            <p>45. In this kindling of the Light in the Stars and
Elements, the Birth of Nature did not thereupon
<hi>wholly transmute</hi> or change it self into the holy Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as it was before the Time of the wrath, <hi>so
that</hi> the Birth of Nature is now altogether holy and
<hi>pure;</hi> No, but it standeth in its sharpest, austerest,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:61095:303"/>
and most anxious Birth, wherein the wrath of God
<hi>uncessantly</hi> springeth up like hellish-Fire.</p>
            <p>46. For if Nature had <hi>fully</hi> chang'd it self with
its sharp Birth into Love, according to the heavenly
Right Law or Manner, then were the Devils again
in the <hi>Seat</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>47. And this thou mayst very well perceive and
understand in <hi>Extream</hi> Heat and Cold, as also by the
Poison, Bitternesse and Sowrnesse in this world; all
which stand in the Birth or Geniture of the <hi>Stars,</hi>
wherein the Devil lyeth <hi>Captive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>48. The Stars are onely the kindling of the great
House: for the whole house is benumm'd in Death,
as the Earth is, for the outermost Birth or Geniture
is <hi>dead</hi> and benumm'd, as the Rind Shell or Bark of a
Tree: but the Astral birth is the <hi>Body</hi> in which the
Life riseth up.</p>
            <p>49. But it is in its Body very sharp, yet the new
Birth, which riseth up in the water of Life, and
presseth through Death, <hi>mitigateth</hi> it. But it cannot
<hi>alter</hi> the <hi>kernel</hi> of the sharp Birth, but is generated
out of it, and <hi>keeps</hi> its holy new life to it self, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
through the angry Death, and the angry Death
comprehendeth it <hi>not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>50. Now this love and wrath is indeed one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but the water of Life is the heaven of <hi>Partition</hi>
between them, so that the Love doth not receive or
comprehend the Wrath, nor the wrath the Love, but
the Love <hi>riseth up</hi> in the water of Life, and receiveth
into it self from the Earth and austere Birth, the
<hi>power,</hi> which is in the Light, which is generated out
of the Wrath; so that, the New Body is born out
of the Old.</p>
            <p>51. For the <hi>old</hi> Body, which standeth in the <hi>austere</hi>
               <pb n="577" facs="tcp:61095:303"/>
Birth, belongeth to the Devil for a House, and the
<hi>new</hi> belongeth to the Kingdom of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it may be Asked:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not all the Three Persons of the Deitie in
the Birth or Geniture of Meeknesse, in
this World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>52. <hi>Yes,</hi> they are all three in this world in the
<hi>full</hi> Birth or Geniture of Love, meeknesse, Holinesse
and purity, and they are alwaies generated in such
a substance and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing, as <hi>was done</hi> from Eternity.</p>
            <p>53. Behold! God the Father Spake to the People
of Israel on Mount Sinai, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en he gave the Law to
them, saying, <hi>I am an angry zealous
or Jealous God to those, that hate
me,</hi> Exod. 20. 5. Deut. 5. 9.</p>
            <p>54. Now thou canst not make of this <hi>One</hi> onely
Father, who is both Angry and also full of Love,
<hi>two</hi> Persons, but he is one onely <hi>Father,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
generateth his heartily beloved <hi>Sonne,</hi> and
from both these the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> goeth forth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe the depth in the Center.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>55. The <hi>Father</hi> is the One onely being, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is ALL; who continually generateth his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
beloved <hi>Sonne</hi> from eternity, and <hi>in both</hi> of them
the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is continually standing in the Flash,
wherein the Life is Generated.</p>
            <p>56. But now from the austere and <hi>earnest</hi> Birth or
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:61095:304"/>
Geniture of the qualifying or fountain spirits of the
Father, wherein the Zeale or Jealousy and the wrath
standeth, the <hi>Body</hi> of Nature alwaies cometh to be,
wherein the <hi>Light</hi> of the Sonne, viz: of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Heart standeth, incomprehensibly as to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>57. For the light is in the Midst or Center of the
Birth or Geniture, and is the place of <hi>Life,</hi> wherein
the meek Life of God is generated from or out of <hi>all</hi>
the powers of the Father, and in the same place the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> goeth forth from the Father and the
Sonne.</p>
            <p>58. Now those powers of the Father, which stand
in the <hi>kindling</hi> of the Light, are <hi>the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the meek Father, and
the pure Birth or Geniture of
God,</hi> and the Spirit, which riseth therein, is the
holy Ghost; but the sharp Birth or Geniture is the
Body, wherein this <hi>Holy Life</hi> is continually genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>59. But when the Light of God shineth through
this sharp Birth or Geniture, then it becometh very
meek, and is as it were like a Man that is a sleep, in
whom the Life <hi>still moveth,</hi> and the Body is in a
sweet quiet rest.</p>
            <p>60. And in this Body of nature now was the
<hi>kindling</hi> made, for out of this Body the Angels also
were created; and if <hi>they had not</hi> elevated and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
themselves in their Highmindednesse; then
their Body might have stood eternally in a <hi>stillnesse</hi>
and in an incomprehensible meeknesse, as it is in the
<hi>other</hi> Principalities of Angels that are without, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:61095:304"/>
from this world, and their spirit had genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it self eternally in <hi>their</hi> Body of meeknesse, as the
holy <hi>Trinitie</hi> doth in the Body or Corporeity of God,
and their inborn or <hi>innate</hi> spirit had been one Heart,
one Will, and one Love with or in the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for to <hi>that end</hi> also they were created in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of God, to be a <hi>joy</hi> to the Deitie.</p>
            <p>61. But Lord <hi>Lucifer,</hi> would <hi>himselfe</hi> be the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, and kindled his Body, and excited or stirred
up therein the <hi>sharp</hi> Birth of God, and opposed the
Light or bright Heart of God, intending to rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
with his sharpnesse, which was a thing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be done.</p>
            <p>62. But being he elevated and kindled himself
<hi>against</hi> the Right of the Deitie, thereupon the sharp
Birth in the Body of the Father <hi>rose up</hi> against him:
and took him as an angry Sonne Prisoner or <hi>Captive,</hi>
in the sharpest Birth, and therein now is his eternall
<hi>Dominion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>63. But now when the Father kindled himself in
the Body of the sharpnesse, he did <hi>not</hi> for all that
<hi>kindle</hi> the holy source, wherein his most loving Heart
generateth it self, and so thereupon his Heart should
sit in the source of wrath. No! that is impossible
that it should be, for the sharp Birth <hi>cannot</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the holy and pure Birth, but the holy and
pure presseth <hi>quite</hi> through the sharp, and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to it self a new Body, which standeth again in
meeknesse.</p>
            <p>64. And that new Body is <hi>the water of
Life</hi> which is generated when the light presseth
<hi>through</hi> the wrath, and the holy Ghost is the Former

<pb n="580" facs="tcp:61095:305"/>
love and wrath, and is the seat, wherein the
wrath is transmuted or changed into Love.</p>
            <p>65. Now when thou beholdest the Sun and Stars,
thou must <hi>not</hi> think, that they are the <hi>Holy</hi> and pure
God, and thou must <hi>not offer</hi> to pray to them or aske
any thing of them, for they are not the Holy God,
but are the kindled <hi>austere</hi> Birth or Geniture of <hi>his</hi>
Body, wherein Love and Wrath <hi>wrestle</hi> one with
another.</p>
            <p>66. But the holy God is <hi>hidden</hi> in the <hi>Center</hi> of all
these things in his Heaven, and thou canst neither see
nor comprehend him, but the <hi>soul</hi> comprehendeth
him, and the Astral Birth but half, for the Heaven
is the Partition between Love and Wrath: That
Heaven is every where, even in thy selfe.</p>
            <p>67. And now when thou worshippest or prayest to
the <hi>Holy God</hi> in his Heaven then thou worshippest or
prayest to <hi>him,</hi> in <hi>that</hi> heaven, which is <hi>in</hi> thee, and
that same God with his light; and therein the holy
Ghost <hi>breaketh</hi> through in <hi>thy</hi> Heart, and generateth
thy <hi>Soul</hi> to be<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>or</hi> New Divine Body</note> a New Body of God, which ruleth
and raigneth with God in <hi>his</hi> Heaven.</p>
            <p>68. For the earthly Body, which thou bearest, is
one Body with the whole kindled Body of this world
and thy body qualifyeth mixeth or uniteth with the
whole body of this world; and there is no difference
between the Stars and the Deep, as also the Earth
and thy Body; it is all one Body: This is the only
difference; thy Body is a <hi>Sonne</hi> of the whole; and
is in it self as the whole Being it selfe, is.</p>
            <p>69. And now as the new Body of this world ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth
it selfe in <hi>its</hi> Heaven, so the new man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
generateth himselfe in <hi>his</hi> Heaven, for it is all
but <hi>one</hi> Heaven, wherein God dwelleth, and therein
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:61095:305"/>
thy new man dwelleth, and they <hi>cannot</hi> be divided
asunder.</p>
            <p>70. But if thou art wicked, then thy Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
is <hi>not capable</hi> of Heaven, but of the wrath, and
remaineth in the other part of the Astral Birth or
Geniture, wherein the earnest and <hi>austere</hi> fire-source
riseth up, and bolts it up into <hi>Death,</hi> so long, till
thou breakest through Heaven, and <hi>livest</hi> with
God.</p>
            <p>71. For instead of thy heaven thou hast the wrath-Devil
sitting there; but if thou breakest thorough,
then <hi>he</hi> must get him gone, and the Holy Ghost ruleth
and reigneth in <hi>that</hi> Seat, and in the other Part <hi>viz.</hi>
the fiercenesse, the Devil <hi>tempteth thee,</hi> for it is his
Nest, and the Holy Ghost <hi>opposeth</hi> him, and the new
man lyeth in his own Heaven <hi>hidden</hi> under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Holy Ghos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the Devil knoweth not
the New man, for he is not in <hi>his</hi> House, but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in the Firmament of God.</p>
            <p>72. This I write as a Word,
which is Generated in its Heaven,
where the Holy Deity alwaies ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth
it self, and where the
moving spirit riseth up in the
Flash of Life, even there this
Word and this knowledge is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and risen up in the Love-fire
through the Zealous spirit of
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="582" facs="tcp:61095:306"/>
73. I know very well, what the Devil intendeth;
for, <hi>that Part</hi> of the earnest and austere Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
wherein Love and wrath are set opposite one
to another, <hi>seeth</hi> into <hi>his</hi> very Heart. For when he
cometh with his fierce and hellish Temptation, like
a <hi>fawning</hi> Dogg, then he setteth upon us with his
wrath in that part, wherein the austere Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
standeth, and <hi>therein</hi> the Heaven is set in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to him, and there the fair <hi>Bride</hi> is known.</p>
            <p>74. For he stingeth through the <hi>Old</hi> Man, with
an intent, to spoyl or destroy the <hi>New;</hi> but when the
new riseth against him, then the Hell-Hound reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and then the new Man <hi>feeleth</hi> very well, what
device the Hell-hound hath darted or spit into the
astral Birth, and then is it time to Purge and scour
it out.</p>
            <p>75. But I find, that the <hi>cunning'st</hi> Devill is set
against me, he will raise scorners and mockers, who
will say, that I intend by mine <hi>own conceit</hi> to grope,
dig deep and search out the <hi>Deitie.</hi> Yes, Mr. Scorner,
thou art indeed an <hi>obedient</hi> son to the Devil, thou
hast great cause to mock Gods children, <hi>as if I</hi> were
able in mine <hi>own</hi> power to fathom the depth of the
Deitie; No! but the Deitie searcheth the Ground
<hi>in me:</hi> Or, dost thou think, that I am strong enough
to stand against it?</p>
            <p>76. Indeed thou <hi>proud</hi> Man, God is a very meek,
simple and quiet still Beeing, and groapeth not in
the Bottom of Hell and Death, but <hi>in his</hi> Heaven,
where there is nothing, but an Unanimous meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
therefore it is not <hi>meet</hi> for me to do <hi>so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>77. But behold! it is <hi>not</hi> I that have made way
for this, but thy desire and highly raised lofty Lust,
hath moved the <hi>Deitie,</hi> to <hi>reveal</hi> to thee the desire of
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:61095:306"/>
thy Heart in the highest <hi>simplicity</hi> in the <hi>greatest depth,</hi>
that it may be a witnesse against thee, and denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of the earnest severe Day of God;</p>
            <p>78. This I speak to thee as a

God, which is generated or born
in the Flash of Life.</p>

            <p>1.
THe learned and highly experienced <hi>Masters</hi>

that they know the <hi>course</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of the

and Adversity, Life and Death, and all the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
and <hi>agitations,</hi> in this world.</p>
            <p>2. And indeed it hath a <hi>true</hi> foundation which I
know in the spirit, to be <hi>so,</hi> but their knowledge
standeth onely in the House of Death in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
comprehensibility or palpability, and in the
beholding with the Eyes of the <hi>Body;</hi> but the root
of <hi>this Tree</hi> hath hitherto remained hidden <hi>to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Neither is it my purpose, to write of the
<hi>Branches</hi> of the Tree, and to invert or disprove their
knowledge, neither do I build upon <hi>their</hi> Ground,
but I leave their knowledge to <hi>sit</hi> in its own seat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I have not studyed it: but I write in the spirit of
<hi>my knowledge</hi> concerning the root stock Branches and
Fruits of the Tree; as an industrious and laborious
Servant to <hi>his</hi> Master; in discovering the <hi>whole</hi> Tree
of this world.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Not</hi> with an intent to set any new thing on
foote, for I have <hi>no</hi> command to do so, but my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
standeth in this Birth or Geniture of the Stars, in
the Midst or Center, where the <hi>Life</hi> is generated, and
breaketh through Death, and where the <hi>moving spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
existeth and breaketh thorough, and in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
and moving <hi>thereof,</hi> I also write.</p>
            <p>5. Also I know very well, that the Children of
the flesh will <hi>scorne</hi> and mock at me, and say, I
should <hi>look</hi> to my own <hi>Calling,</hi> and not trouble my
Head about these things, but rather be diligent to
bring in <hi>food</hi> for me and my familie: and let those
meddle with <hi>Philosophy</hi> that have studyed it, and are
<hi>called</hi> and appointed to it.</p>
            <p>6. With such an attempt the Devill hath given
me so many assaults, and hath so <hi>wearyed</hi> me, that I
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:61095:307"/>
have <hi>often</hi> resolved to let it alone, but my former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was too hard for me. For when I took care for
the <hi>Belly,</hi> and to get my <hi>Living,</hi> and resolved to <hi>give
over</hi> this businesse in hand, then the Gate of Heaven
in my knowledge, was <hi>bolted</hi> up.</p>
            <p>7. And then my soul was so <hi>afflicted</hi> in anxiety,
as if it were captivated by the Devill, whereby <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
gat so many checks and assaults, as if the Body
were presently to fall to the ground, and the spirit
would <hi>not</hi> give over, till it brake thorough againe
through the Dead or <hi>Mortall</hi> Reason, and so hath
broke open to peeces, the <hi>Door of darknesse,</hi> and hath
gotten its seat again, in the stead thereof.</p>
            <p>8. Whereby I understand, that the <hi>spirit</hi> must be
<hi>tryed</hi> through the <hi>Crosse</hi> &amp; <hi>Affliction,</hi> and I have not
failed of bodily Temptation, but was faine alwayes
to stand <hi>ready</hi> for an encounter, so much hath the
Devill set himself against <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. But when I perceived, that my Eternal <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was concerned therein, and that through my
negligence the Gates of the Light would be shut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
mee, which yet was the very <hi>Firmament</hi> and
<hi>Fort</hi> of my Heaven, wherein my soul did <hi>hide</hi> it self
from the storms of the Devill, which I took in, and
<hi>gained</hi> with great toyle and many hard assaults, and
stormings through the <hi>Love</hi> of God, by the breaking
through of my <hi>Redeemer and King</hi> JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS
CHRIST, and therefore I
leave my care to God, and will take my fleshly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>Captive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. And I have chosen the Gate of knowledge of
the Light, and will follow after the impulse and
knowledge of the spirit, though my <hi>bestial Body</hi>
               <pb n="586" facs="tcp:61095:308"/>
should be brought to beggery or quite fall to the
ground, I regard none of these things: but will say
with the royal prophet David (<hi>Psa. 73. 26.)
though my Body and Soul should
faint and faile, yet thou O God art
my Salvation, my comfort, and the
refuge of my Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. In <hi>thy</hi> Name I will venture it, and will not
strive against <hi>thy</hi> Spirit: though the flesh be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and must endure miserie, yet <hi>faith</hi> in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Light, must move and soare <hi>above</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>12. And I know also very well that it is not fit for
the disciple to fight against <hi>his Master,</hi> and I know
that the high experienced Masters of Astrologie do
<hi>far exceed</hi> me <hi>in their</hi> way. But I labour in <hi>my</hi> calling,
and they in <hi>theirs,</hi> lest I should be found a Lazy Idle
Servant to my Lord, at his coming, when he shall
demand the <hi>Talent</hi> he hath entrusted me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
but that I may present into him with usury, or
profit and gaine.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>Therefore I will not</hi> bury his Talent in the Earth
<hi>but lend it</hi> out upon usury or interest, lest he should say to
me at that time, of his requiring it of me, Thou wicked
sloathfull Servant, why hast thou hid my Talent <hi>in the
Darknesse,</hi> and did'st not put it out upon use, and so now
I might have received it with usury, gain and profit? and
so then he will take it quite away from me, and give it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
who hath gained many Talents with his one. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will sow, let him water it, I leave the care to
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="587" facs="tcp:61095:308"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. The whole House of this World, which
standeth in a visible and comprehensible or <hi>Palpable</hi>
being, is the <hi>old House of God,</hi> or the Old Body, which
stood before the time of wrath in a <hi>Heavenly</hi> claritie
and <hi>brightnesse:</hi> But when the Devill stirred up the
wrath therein, then it became a House of darknesse
and of <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. Therefore then also the holy Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, as a special Body of it selfe; <hi>separated</hi> it
self from the wrath, and made the Firmament of
Heaven, between the Love and the Wrath, so that
the Birth or Geniture of the Stars standeth in the
<hi>middle:</hi> understand it thus; <hi>viz:</hi> with its outward
comprehensibility and <hi>visibility</hi> it standeth in the
wrath of Death, and with the New Birth, rising up
therein, which standeth in the middle or central
seate, where the <hi>closure</hi> of Heaven is, it standeth in
the meeknesse of the Life.</p>
            <p>16. For Meeknesse moveth against the wrath, and
the wrath against the Meeknesse, and so <hi>both</hi> are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi>
Kingdoms in the <hi>one</hi> onely Body of this World.</p>
            <p>17. But being the Love and Meeknesse of God
would not leave the Body or place of this kindled
wrath world, sticking in eternal wrath and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
<hi>therefore</hi> he generated the whole old Body of this
world <hi>againe</hi> into a rectified reformed Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
life did rule in a <hi>divine</hi> manner and way, <hi>though</hi>
in the kindled wrath, yet it must subsist according to
the<note n="*" place="margin">Law and Order.</note> Right of the Deitie, <hi>that</hi> out of it, a New Body
might be generated, which should subsist in holinesse
and purity, <hi>in Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="590" facs="tcp:61095:309"/>
18. For which cause there is appointed in God,
a <hi>Day of separation,</hi> on which, Life and Wrath shall
be separated <hi>asunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. Now when thou beholdest the Stars, and the
Deep, together with the Earth, then thou seest with
thy bodily Eyes, nothing else but the <hi>old</hi> Body in the
wrathfull Death, thou canst not see Heaven with <hi>thy
Bodily</hi> Eyes; for the Blew or Azure Sphere which
thou seest aloff, is <hi>not the Heaven,</hi> but is only the old
Body, which may be justly called <hi>the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. But that there <hi>seemeth</hi> to be a Blew or Azure
Sphere <hi>above</hi> the Stars, whereby the place of this
world is closed and shut out from the <hi>holy</hi> Heaven,
as Men have thought <hi>hitherto:</hi> yet it is <hi>not so,</hi> but it is
<hi>the superiour water of Nature,</hi>
which is much brighter then the water below the
<hi>Moon:</hi> And now when the <hi>Sun</hi> shineth through
the Deepe, then it is as it were of a Light-Blew or
Azure colour.</p>
            <p>21. But how deepe or how large the place of this
world is, <hi>no Man</hi> knoweth, though some <hi>Natural</hi>
Phylosophers Mathematicians Astronomers or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologers
<hi>have</hi> undertaken to measure the Deepe
with their Measures of Circles; their measuring is
but conjecturall or a measuring of somwhat that is
<hi>comprehensible</hi> or Palpable: as if a Man would grasp
the wind in his Fist.</p>
            <p>22. But the true Heaven is every <hi>where</hi> all over, to
this very time, and till the last Judgment Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the Wrath House of Hell and of Death is also in this
world <hi>every where,</hi> even to the last Judgment day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="591" facs="tcp:61095:309"/>
23. But the dwelling of the Devills is <hi>now</hi> from
the Moon to the Earth, and in the deep Caves and
Holes thereof: especially in Wildernesses and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart
Places, and where the Earth is full of Stones and
Bitternesse.</p>
            <p>24. But their Kingly Regiment or Government is
in the Deep in the four Coasts or Quarters of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
Line or Circle, of which I will write in <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
place.</p>
            <p>25. But here I will shew thee, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. How the
<hi>Body</hi> of this World came to be, and 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. How <hi>it is</hi>
at present, and then 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> how the Regiment or <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therein,</hi> is.</p>
            <p>26. The whole Body of this world is as a Mans
Body, for it is surrounded in its utmost Circle with
the Stars and arisen powers of <hi>Nature,</hi> and in that
Body the <hi>seaven</hi> spirits of Nature, Governe, and the
Heart of Nature standeth in the Midst or Center.</p>
            <p>27. But the <hi>Stars</hi> in generall are and signifie the
wonderfull proportion or changing <hi>variety</hi> of God:
For when God Created the Stars, he created them
out of the rising up of the <hi>infinity,</hi> out of the Old-Body
of God, <hi>then</hi> further kindled.</p>
            <p>28. For, as the seaven spirits of God, had <hi>before</hi> the
time of the wrath, generated themselves infinitely
by their rising up and <hi>Effectings,</hi> whence rose up so
many several varieties of figures and Heavenly Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
or vegetations: So also the Holy God formed his old
body of <hi>this corrupted Nature,</hi> into as many and <hi>various</hi>
powers as ever stood in the Birth or Geniture in the
Holynesse.</p>
            <pb n="590" facs="tcp:61095:310"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Understand this high thing rightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29. Every Star hath a several peculiar propertie,
which thou maist perceive by the curious <hi>Ornament</hi>
of the budding blossoming Earth; And the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
hath <hi>therefore</hi> rebuilt and revived againe the
old kindled Body into so many &amp; <hi>various</hi> powers, that
<hi>through</hi> this Old Life in the wrath, such a new life
might generate it self therein, through the <hi>closure</hi> of
Heaven, that, that <hi>New Life</hi> might have all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
&amp; operations, that ever the old had before the
times of wrath, that it might qualifie mixe or unite
with the <hi>pure</hi> Deitie distinct from this world, and
that <hi>it</hi> might be <hi>One</hi> holy God, together with the
Deitie without, distinct from this World.</p>
            <p>30. Also the <hi>New Birth</hi> blossom'd in the time of
the Creation, when Man <hi>had not</hi> spoiled or corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, but by him Nature was still <hi>more</hi> corrupted
and so God cursed the Ground. But being Man
took hold of the <hi>fruit</hi> of the <hi>old</hi> Body, thereupon the
<hi>fruit</hi> of the <hi>new</hi> Body was hidden in its Heaven, and
Man must now behold it <hi>with</hi> the new Body, and
cannot partake of it with the natural Body.</p>
            <p>31. Of which I have a great longing to eate, but I
<hi>cannot reach</hi> to it, for Heaven is the closure or <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
between the old and new Body. And therefore
I must let it alone till I come into the <hi>other Life,</hi> and
must give my bestial Body, <hi>Mother Eve's
Wrath-Apples to Eate.</hi>

               <hi>Concerning</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The kindling of the Heart or
Life, of this World.</p>
            <p>32. When God had brought the Body of this
world, in <hi>two Dayes</hi> into a right forme; and had made
the Heaven for a <hi>Partition</hi> betweene the Love &amp; the
Wrath, then on the <hi>Third</hi> Day <hi>the Love</hi> press<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through the Heaven and through the wrath, and
then instantly the old Body in Death stirr'd and <hi>mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it selfe</hi> to the Birth or Geniture.</p>
            <p>33. Eor the <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>hot,</hi> and that kindled the
fire-source or quality, and that rubb'd it selfe in the
astringent and cold quality of benumm'd Death, till
the astringent qualitie was <hi>heated</hi> on the <hi>third</hi> Day,
whereby the mobilitie or the astringent Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
moveable.</p>
            <p>54. For all stood in the fire-crak till the <hi>fourth
Day,</hi> and then the Light of the<note n="*" place="margin">SOL</note> 
               <hi>Sun</hi> kindled it self
for the whole Body stood in anguish or <hi>Paine</hi> in the
Birth, as a woman in Travell.</p>
            <p>35. The Astringent qualitie was the encompasser
or <hi>incloser</hi> of the life, in it now; the Heat was anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
which was kindled through the Love of God,
and did <hi>thrust forth</hi> the astringent qualitie as a dead
Body, but the Heat reteined its seat in the mid'st or
center of the Body, and so pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d through.</p>
            <p>36, But when the Light of the <hi>Sun</hi> kindled it self,
then the <hi>nex</hi> Circle or Orb above the <hi>Sun,</hi> stood in
the fire-crak, for the Sun or the Light was shining
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:61095:311"/>
in the Water, and the bitternesse ascended also in the
<hi>fire-crack</hi> out of the water: But the light made very
great <hi>haste</hi> after it, and laid hold on the fire crak, and
there it remained standing as a <hi>Captive,</hi> and became
corporeal.</p>
            <p>37. In this Revolution the Planet<note n="*" place="margin">MARS</note> 
               <hi>Mars</hi>
came to be, whose power standeth in the Bitter fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crak,
for it is a Tyrant, Rager, Raver and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
like a <hi>fire-crak,</hi> moreover it is <hi>Hot,</hi> and a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
venomous enemie of Nature, through whose
rising up and Birth or Geniture in the Earth all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Poisonous Venomous evill Wormes and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
are come to be.</p>
            <p>38. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being the Heat in the middle point or center
of the Body was <hi>so Mighty</hi> Great, thereupon it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it self so very largely, and opened the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Death so wide before its kindling of the Light,
that it, the SUN, is the Greatest Star.</p>
            <p>39. But assoon as the Light kindled it self in the
heat, so instantly was that Hot place <hi>caught</hi> in the
Light, and then the Body of the <hi>Sun</hi> could grow <hi>no</hi>
bigger: For the light mitigated the Heat, and so
the Body of the <hi>Sun</hi> remained there <hi>standing</hi> in the
mid'st or center as a <hi>Heart,</hi> for the Light is the
Heart of Nature; <hi>not</hi> the Heat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here thou must observe exactly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40. As far as the middle point or center hath
kindled it selfe, <hi>Just</hi> so bigg is the <hi>Sun;</hi> for the <hi>Sun</hi> is
nothing else but a kindled <hi>poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in the Body of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>41. Thou must not thinke, that there is any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:61095:311"/>
power or vertue in it or belonging to it, then
there is in the whole Deep of the <hi>Body</hi> every where,
all over.</p>
            <p>42. For should the Love of God, through its Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
kindle the whole body of this world <hi>through the
Heate,</hi> it would be every where all over as Light as
it is now in the Sun.</p>
            <p>43. And now if the <hi>great Heat</hi> were taken away
from the <hi>Sun,</hi> then it would be <hi>One</hi> Light with God:
but seeing that cannot bee in this time, therefore it
remaineth a <hi>King</hi> and Regent in the <hi>old</hi> corrupted
and kindled Body of Nature: and the clear Deitie
remaineth hidden in the meek Heaven.</p>
            <p>44. But the light of the meeknesse of the Sun qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth
mixeth or <hi>uniteth</hi> with the pure Deitie, but
the <hi>Heat</hi> cannot comprehend the light, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
also the place of the Sun remaineth in the Body
of <hi>Gods wrath,</hi> and thou must <hi>not</hi> worship, pray to or
honour the <hi>Sun</hi> as God, for its place or Body <hi>cannot</hi>
apprehend the water of Life, because of its <hi>Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Highest ground of the <hi>SUN</hi>
and of <hi>ALL</hi> the <hi>PLANETS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>45. And here I shall have <hi>adversaries</hi> enough who
will be ready to censure mee, for they will not have
regard, to consider <hi>the Spirit,</hi> but will mind their <hi>old
Rules,</hi> and say: Astrologers understand it better, who
have written of <hi>such matters:</hi> and they will look On
<hi>this Great open Gate,</hi> as a Cow looks
on a new Barn Doare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="594" facs="tcp:61095:312"/>
46. Deare Reader, I understand the <hi>Astrologers</hi>
meanings and sayings full well, and I have <hi>perused</hi>
their writings also, and taken notice, how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the course of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> neither do I
despise it, but hold that for the <hi>most part</hi> to be good
and <hi>right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>47. But that I write otherwise then they in <hi>some</hi>
things, I do it not out of self will or conceipt and
<hi>supposition,</hi> doubting, whteher it be so or <hi>no:</hi> I dare
not make any <hi>doubt herein, neither</hi> can any man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
mee herein.</p>
            <p>48. I have <hi>not</hi> my knowledge by <hi>Study,</hi> indeed I
have read the order and <hi>Position</hi> of the <hi>Seaven Planets</hi>
in the Books of Astrologers: and find them to be <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
right, but the Root, how they came to be, &amp; from
what they are proceeded, I cannot learne it from <hi>any</hi>
Man; for they know it <hi>not,</hi> neither was I present, when
God created them.</p>
            <p>49. But being the Doores of the Deep, and the
Gates of wrath, and the <hi>Chambers</hi> of Death also are
set open <hi>in my</hi> spirit through the Love of God; the
spirit, <hi>therefore,</hi> must needs look thorough them.</p>
            <p>50. And accordingly I find, that the Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
of Nature standeth to this Day, and generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it selfe just fo as it first took its beginning, and
<hi>whatsoever riseth</hi> up in this world, whether Men,
Beasts, Trees, Herbs, Grasse Minerall Oars, or what it
will, all riseth up in such a <hi>qualitie</hi> manner &amp; forme,
also every Life be it good or bad, taketh its original
thus.</p>
            <p>51. For this is the <hi>Right</hi> or Law of the Deitie,
that every Life in the body of God, should generate
it selfe in <hi>one</hi> manner or uniforme way, though it be
done through many <hi>various</hi> Imagings, yet the <hi>Life
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:61095:312"/>
hath</hi> one uniform way, and Original, in all.</p>
            <p>52. I see not this knowledge with my <hi>fleshly</hi> Eyes,
but with those Eyes, wherein life generateth it self
<hi>in me,</hi> in that seat the Gates of Heaven and Hell
stand open to me, and the <hi>new Man</hi> Speculateth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the midst or center of the Astral Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to him the inner and outermost Gate stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Open.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>53. While he yet sticketh in the <hi>Old</hi> Man of
Wrath and Death, and sitteth also in his Heaven;
he seeth through <hi>both,</hi> in such a manner also he seeth
the Stars and Elements: For <hi>in God</hi> there is no place
of hinderance: <hi>for the Eye of the</hi>
LORD <hi>beholdeth all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>54. Now if my spirit did not see thorough <hi>his</hi>
spirit, then I were but a blind Stock, but being I see
the <hi>Gates</hi> of God in <hi>my</hi> spirit, and have the impulse
to do it, I will therefore write <hi>directly</hi> according as
I have <hi>seen</hi> it; and will not regard any <hi>Mans Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>55. Thou must not conceive it so, as if <hi>my</hi> Old
man were a <hi>living Saint</hi> or Angel. <hi>No,</hi> friend, He
sitteth with all Men in the house of Wrath and of
Death, and is a <hi>constant</hi> Enemy to God, and sticketh
in his Sins Wickednesse and Malice, as all Men do,
and is full of faults defects and <hi>Infirmities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>56. But thou must know this, that he sticketh in
a continual <hi>anxious</hi> Birth or Geniture, and would
fain be rid of the wrath and wickednesse, and <hi>yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not:</hi>
For he is as the whole house of this world,
wherein alwayes love and wrath wrestle one with
another, and the new Body alwaies generateth it self
in the midst or center of the <hi>anguish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For so it must
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:61095:313"/>
be, if thou wilt be born anew, otherwise no man
<hi>can reach</hi> the Regeneration.</p>
            <p>57. Man is <hi>alwaies</hi> seeking <hi>here</hi> for soft Dayes of
Ease for the Flesh, and after Riches beauty and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and knoweth <hi>not,</hi> that he sitteth therewith in
the <hi>chamber</hi> of Death, where the Sting of wrath dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into Him.</p>
            <p>58. Behold! I tell this to thee,
as a word of Life, which I receive
in the knowledge of the Spirit in
the midst or center in the Birth or
Geniture of the new Body of this
World, over which the Man
JESUS CHRIST is Ruler and
King, together with his Eternall
Father.</p>
            <p>59. Also I receive it from <hi>before</hi> the Seat of his
Throne, where all Holy Soules of men stand before
him, and rejoyce before him: <hi>That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of the flesh in soft pleasing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to be Rich, to be Handsom,
Beautiful &amp; Fair, or to be Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Potent, is a very Bath or
Lake of hellish Wrath,</hi> into which thou
crowdest and runnest, as if thou wert drawn in with
Cartropes: for there is very great danger therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="597" facs="tcp:61095:313"/>
60. But if thou wouldst know, how it is, behold
I will tell thee in a Parable or similitude: When
thou art pressed according to the <hi>desire</hi> of thy Heart,
into Riches and Power, then is it with thee, as if thou
<hi>stoodst</hi> in a deep water, where the water alwaies
standeth up to thy very mouth, and thou feelest <hi>no
ground</hi> under thy Feet, but thou swimmest with thy
Hands, and struggling waverest thy self; suddenly
thou art deep in water, suddenly above water again,
yet alway in a great Terrour and danger, Expecting
to sinck down to the bottom; the water coming of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>into thy Mouth,</hi> alwaies expecting Death by
being Drowned.</p>
            <p>61. Just in this manner thou sittest and no other,
when thou art in the <hi>pleasures</hi> of the flesh, if thou
<hi>wilt not Fight,</hi> thou canst not look for any Victory,
but thou wilt be <hi>murthered</hi> in thy soft Bed of Down:
For man hath a continual Hoast or <hi>Army</hi> before him;
which fighteth with him continually; if he will not
<hi>defend</hi> himself, then he is taken captive and slain.</p>
            <p>62. But how can he defend himself, that <hi>swimmeth</hi>
in a Deep water, he hath enough to do, to keep
himself <hi>up</hi> struggling and wavering in the water,
and yet neverthelesse he is there also assaulted and
<hi>stormed</hi> by the Devils.</p>
            <p>63. O Danger upon Danger!
<hi>as our King Christ also saith;</hi> It is very hard
for a Rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven; a Camel
will easier go through the Eye of
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:61095:314"/>
a Needle, then a Rich man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Kingdom of Heaven
<hi>Math. 19. 24. Mark.</hi> 10. 25.</p>
            <p>64. But if any will bee new born again, he must
<hi>not yeeld</hi> himself to be a servant to Cove toufnesse,
Pride, State and self-power, to take <hi>delight</hi> in the
will or desires of his Flesh, but he must struggle and
fight against <hi>himself,</hi> against the Devill, and against
all the <hi>Lusts</hi> of the Flesh, and he must think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that he is but a <hi>Servant</hi> and Pilgrim on Earth,
which must wander through many miserable Seas of
danger into another world; and <hi>there</hi> he will be a
LORD, and his dominion will consist in power and
perfect delight beauty and brightnesse, <hi>this I
tell as the word of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>65. The<note n="*" place="margin">Sol.</note> SUN hath its own Royall place to it
self, and <hi>doth not goe away</hi> from that place, where it
came to be at the first; as <hi>some suppose,</hi> that it runeth
round about the Globe of the Earth in a Day &amp; a
Night; and <hi>some</hi> of the Astrologers also <hi>write so,</hi> and
some have undertaken to measure, how far its Orb
and Circumference of its <hi>supposed</hi> Motion, is.</p>
            <p>66. This opinion or supposition is <hi>not right,</hi> but
the <hi>Earth roueth</hi> it selfe about; and <hi>runneth</hi> with the
other Planets, as in a wheele, <hi>round</hi> about the <hi>Sun.</hi>
The Earth doth <hi>not</hi> remaine <hi>staying</hi> in one Place, but
runneth round in a yeare, <hi>once</hi> about the <hi>Sun</hi> as the
<note n="*" place="margin">Venus Mercury</note> other Planets next the Sun, but<note n="†" place="margin">Saturne Jupiter Mars</note> Saturne and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61095:314"/>
as also Mars by reason of their great Orb cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
and great height <hi>cannot do it,</hi> because
they stand so high above and far distant from the
<note n="*" place="margin">Sol.</note> SUN.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>How it may be asked,
what is the SUN, and what are the other
PLANETS? or how are they
come to be?</head>
               <p>67. Behold! the <hi>other Planets</hi> are peculiar Bodys
of their own which have a corporeal proprietie of
themselves, and are <hi>not bound</hi> to any setled or fixed
place, but only to their <hi>Circle</hi> Orb or Sphere where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they runne their course. But the SUN is not such
a Body, but is only a place or Locality kindled by
the <hi>Light</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Understand it aright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>68. The place, where the SUN is, is such a
place, as you may choose or suppose <hi>any where</hi> above
the Earth: and if God should kindle the Light by
the Heat, then the <hi>whole</hi> world would be such a meer
SUN; for that same power, wherein the <hi>Sun</hi> standeth,
<hi>is every where,</hi> all over; and <hi>before</hi> the time of wrath,
it was every where all over in the place of <hi>this world,</hi>
as Light as the <hi>Sun</hi> is now, but not <hi>so</hi> intollerable.</p>
               <p>69. For that heat was not so <hi>great</hi> as in the <hi>Sun,</hi>
and therefore the light also was very <hi>meek,</hi> and thus
in respect of the horrible fiercenesse of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the
<hi>Sun</hi> is differenced or distinguisht from the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God. So that Man should <hi>not dare</hi> to say:
that the <hi>Sun</hi> is an open Gate of the light of God: but
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:61095:315"/>
is as the Light in a <hi>Mans Eye,</hi> whereas also the place
of the Eye belongeth to the Body, but the Light is
different or <hi>distinct</hi> from the Body.</p>
               <p>70. And though indeed it existeth by the <hi>Heate</hi>
in the water of the Body, yet it is a peculiar distinct
thing, which the body <hi>cannot</hi> comprehend; and such
a distinct difference there is <hi>also</hi> between God the
Father and the Sonne.</p>
               <p>71. Thus on the <hi>Fourth Day</hi> in the anxious Birth
or Geniture of this world in the middle point or
Center of this World, the SUN is Sprung up and
<hi>standeth still</hi> in its Eternal <hi>Corporeal</hi> place, for it <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
rise up in <hi>one</hi> place, and set in <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>72. For it is the onely and <hi>Sole</hi> natural Light of
this world, and besides it there is <hi>no more</hi> any true
Light in the House of Death, and though it seemeth
as if the other Stars did <hi>shine</hi> Bright and give <hi>Light</hi>
also, yet it is <hi>not so,</hi> but they take all their lustre and
shining Light from the <hi>Sun;</hi> as hereafter presently
followeth.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The true Birth or Geniture and descent of
the Sun and of the other Planets
Is just thus as followeth.</head>
               <p>73. Now when the Heaven was made for a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi>
or partition between the Light of God and
the <hi>kindled corruption</hi> of the Body of this world: then
was the Body of this world a <hi>dark</hi> valley, and had
no light that could have shone forth in the <hi>outward</hi>
Body besides the Heaven, there stood all powers as
it were captivated in Death, and were in great <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,</hi>
till they had heatt themselves in the mid'st
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:61095:315"/>
or center of the Body.</p>
               <p>74. But when this was <hi>done,</hi> so that the anxious
Birth or Geniture stood so severely in the <hi>Heat,</hi> then
the Love in the Light of God brake through the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the <hi>Partition,</hi> and kindled the Heat.</p>
               <p>75. And there rose up the shining light in the
Heat, in the water, or in the fat or oylinesse of the
water, and the Heart of the water kindled it selfe,
and this was done in the <hi>twinckling</hi> of an Eye.</p>
               <p>76. For assoon as the Light had rightly laid hold
on the Body, the Body was captivated in the <hi>Light;</hi>
and the Heat was captivated, and was changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>competent</hi> Meeknesse, and could stand or extend
<hi>no</hi> further in such Anguish.</p>
               <p>77. But being the Heat was so terrified by the
Light, thereupon its horrible fire-source was <hi>allayed</hi>
and so could kindle it selfe no further, and so also
the breaking through of the Love in the Light of
God through the Heaven at this time, with its
breaking thorough, extended or stretched it selfe <hi>no</hi>
further out of or from Gods predestinated purpose:
therefore also the <hi>SUN</hi> came to be no bigger.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Planet Mars.</head>
               <p>78. But when the <hi>Sun</hi> was kindled, then the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
fire-crack went forth <hi>upward</hi> from the Place of
the <hi>Sun,</hi> distant from the Place of the Sun, as a
horrible Tempestuous <hi>Flash,</hi> and in its corporeall:
Being took along with it the fiercenesse of the fire,
<hi>whereby</hi> the water became very bitter, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the kernel or stock of the <hi>Crack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="602" facs="tcp:61095:316"/>
79. Now the Astrologers write, that the Planet
<hi>Mars</hi> standeth aloft about 15750, Miles off from
the <hi>Sun:</hi> which I contradict <hi>not,</hi> because I meddle <hi>not</hi>
with the measuring of Circles: And so farr that
fire-crack went on a <hi>suddain</hi> from its own Place, till
the light also laid hold on it, and then <hi>it</hi> also was
captivated by the Light, and staid, and took possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Place.</p>
               <p>80. But that the Light could lay <hi>no sooner</hi> hold of
it; was caused by the earnest fiercenesse and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
flash, for it was not taken hold of by the <hi>Light
before</hi> the Light had wholly or throughly affected or
possessed it.</p>
               <p>81. And there it is now as a Tyrant Rager and
Stirrer of the whole Body of <hi>this</hi> world: for that is
its very Office, that with its <hi>Revolution</hi> in the wheele
of Nature it moveth and stirreth all, from whence
every life taketh its Original.</p>

               <head>Of the Planet Jupiter</head>
               <p>82. Now when the bitter firecrack was captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Light,</hi> then the light in its own power
pressed yet <hi>higher</hi> in the Deepe, till it reach'd into
the <hi>hard</hi> and cold seate of Nature. And there the
power of the first going <hi>forth</hi> or rising up from the
<hi>Sun</hi> could not get Higher, but fitting stayed there
corporeally, and took possession of that <hi>Place</hi> for a
Habitation.</p>
               <pb n="603" facs="tcp:61095:316"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thou must understand this thing aright:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>83. It was the power of the Light, which <hi>stayed</hi> in
this place, which is a very Meek, friendly, gracious,
amiable blessed, and sweet Being. The Astrologers
write, that <hi>this</hi> Planet is distant aloft above Mars,
about 7875 Miles: But it is the <hi>Mitigator</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
furious Raging Raving <hi>Mars,</hi> and an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of the Meeknesse in every Life, an original also
of the water, from which the life generateth it self,
as I shall mention hereafter.</p>
               <p>84. Thus farr the power of the Life <hi>reached</hi> forth
from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> higher, but the lustre or <hi>shine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
thereof which hath its power also; reacheth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the <hi>Stars,</hi> and through the whole Body of this
world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thou must understand this exactly, from whence these
two Planets are come to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>85. When the power of the Heart of God press<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth out of the eternal <hi>inexhaustible</hi> fountain of
the water of life through the Heaven of the Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and kindled the water in the place of the Sun;
then the flash, understand the fire-flash did shoot
forth or went forth out of the water, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
terrible and bitter, out of which, Mars came to
be.</p>
               <p>86. After this Flash the power of the Light <hi>shot</hi>
nimbly after it, like a meek elevated life, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the fire crack, and mitigated it, so that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
somwhat <hi>weaker,</hi> and could breake no farther
through the deepe, but stayed trembling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="604" facs="tcp:61095:317"/>
87. But the power that was gone forth in the
Light had <hi>more</hi> strength then the fire-crack, and so it
rose up higher then then the fire-crack, <hi>Mars,</hi> till it came
very deep into Natures austerenesse, and there it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>feeble</hi> also, and <hi>stayd</hi> there.</p>
               <p>88. From or out of this power the Planet <hi>Jupiter</hi>
came to be, and not out of or from that <hi>place,</hi> where
he is, but it alwaies kindleth that very place with
its power, but it is as one of the <hi>Household</hi> Servants
in that place, who must alwaies walk about in the
place of its office and service. But the <hi>Sun</hi> hath a
house of its Own, but <hi>no other</hi> Planet hath any House
of its Own.</p>
               <p>89. If we will rightly search into
the Original of the Stars Birth
and Geniture or their beginning,
then we must exactly know the
Birth or Geniture of the Life,
viz: How the Life generateth
it selfe in a Body; for these
all are one kind of Birth or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.</p>
               <p>90. He that doth not know nor understand <hi>this,</hi>
he doth not at all know the Birth of the Stars, for, <hi>all</hi>
concrete together, is <hi>one</hi> Body. Every Creature, when
life is once generated in it, then afterwards its <hi>Life</hi>
standeth or subsisteth in its Body, <hi>as</hi> the Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the natural Body of this world doth, for every
Life must be generated according to the right Law or
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:61095:317"/>
Ordinance of the <hi>Deitie,</hi> as the Deitie generateth it
self continually.</p>
               <p>91. If this be rightly considered, which indeed,
cannot be done, without a <hi>special illumination</hi> of the
holy God; then first of all a Man findeth the astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
cold and austere Birth or Geniture which is
the cause of the <hi>Corporeal</hi> Nature, or of the imaging
fashioning or <hi>framing</hi> of a thing.</p>
               <p>92. Now if it were not for this severe and cold
sharp contracting, compacting power, there would
be <hi>no natural</hi> or corporeall being, neither could the
Birth or Geniture of <hi>God</hi> subsist, and all would be
insearchable.</p>
               <p>93. But in this hard, severe and cold power stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the corporeall being, or the <hi>Body,</hi> wherein the
spirit of life is generated, and out of that <hi>same</hi> spirit
the light and <hi>understanding</hi> is generated whereby
then the senses and Tryal or Probation of all powers,
doth exist.</p>
               <p>94. For when the <hi>Light</hi> is generated, it is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in the midst or <hi>Center</hi> of the Body, as a Heart or
spirit out of all powers, and there it standeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
in the place where it had its beginning,
and goeth forth <hi>thorough</hi> all the powers.</p>
               <p>97. For as it is generated out of all powers, and
hath the <hi>fountain</hi> of all powers, so with its shining
lustre also it bringeth the Fountain of all powers <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
each power, from <hi>whence</hi> then existeth the tast and
smell, also seeing, feeling, and hearing; as also Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and understanding.</p>
               <p>96. Now as the originall and beginning of the
life, in a Creature, is; so is the <hi>first Regeneration</hi> of the
Nature of the <hi>new</hi> Life in the <hi>corrupted</hi> Body of this
world: And he that <hi>denyeth</hi> it, he hath <hi>not</hi> the true
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:61095:318"/>
understanding, nor any knowledge of Nature, and so
his knowledge is not generated in God, but he is a
<hi>Mocker</hi> of God.</p>
               <div n="1" type="subpart">
                  <head>I</head>
                  <p>97. For, first behold! thou <hi>canst not</hi> deny it, that
the <hi>Life</hi> in a creature existeth in the <hi>Heate</hi> of the
Heart, and in that Life also standeth the Light of
the animated or <hi>soulish</hi> Birth or Geniture.</p>
                  <p>98. Now the Heart signifyeth the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is
the beginning of Life in this outward Body of this
world: and now thou canst not say, that the animated
or soulish Birth goeth away or <hi>departeth</hi> from the
<hi>Heart,</hi> whil'st the Body standeth in the mobilitie
or <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>99. No more doth the <hi>Sun</hi> go away or depart
from <hi>its seat,</hi> but retaines and keeps its own place,
as a Heart, to it selfe, and shineth forth as a Light or
as a spirit of the <hi>whole</hi> Body.</p>
                  <p>100. For its Birth also, hath a beginning out of all
powers; and therefore with its Light and Heate it is
againe <hi>one spirit</hi> and Heart in the <hi>whole</hi> Body of this
world.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="subpart">
                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>101. And secondly thou canst not deny neither, but
that the <hi>Gall</hi> in a Creature, is <hi>not</hi> existed from the
Heart, and yet is the <hi>mobilitie</hi> or stirring of the Heart,
by a <hi>Vein</hi> that goeth from the Gall to the Heart, from
whence the <hi>Heate</hi> existeth. But it hath its first ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
from the <hi>flash</hi> of Life, and so when the life ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth
it selfe in the Heart, and the Light
riseth up in the water, then the <hi>fire-crack</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
before, which riseth up out of the anxietie of the
water in the Heate.</p>
                  <p>102. For when heat, is so <hi>anxious</hi> in the cold in the
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:61095:318"/>
astringent qualitie that the Light kindleth it selfe
through the <hi>hidden Heaven</hi> of the hart in the corporei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then the anxious Death in the wrath of God is teri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,
and <hi>departeth</hi> as a crack or flash from the Light,
and climeth upward very terribly trembling and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morously,
&amp; the Light of the Heart <hi>hastneth</hi> after it and
affecteth or possesseth it, and then it remaineth <hi>sitting</hi>
still.</p>
                  <p>103. And this, is &amp; signifyeth the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> for
thus it is become a Being, &amp; its <hi>own quality</hi> is nothing
else but a Poisonous <hi>Venomous</hi> bitter fire-crack
which is risen up from the Place of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>104. But now it is alwaies a kindler of the <hi>Sun,</hi>
just as the Gall of the Heart, whence the <hi>Heate,</hi> both
in the <hi>Sun</hi> and in the Heart, existeth; and whence the
Life taketh its Original in <hi>all things.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="subpart">
                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>105. Thirdly, thou canst not deny, but that the
<hi>Braine</hi> in the Head in a Creature is the <hi>power</hi> of the
Heart, for from the Heart all powers rise up into the
Brayne, from whence, in the Brayne, the <hi>senses</hi> of
the Heart exist: The <hi>Brayn</hi> in the <hi>Head</hi> taketh
its original from the power of the Heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observe:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>106. After the fire-crack of the Gall, or <hi>Mars,</hi>
was departed from the Light of Life, then the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
pressed out of the Heart of Life <hi>after it,</hi> even
into the Head into the <hi>austere</hi> quality, and when the
power can rise up no higher, then it is stayed or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
by the austere Birth, and is <hi>dryed</hi> up by the
cold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="608" facs="tcp:61095:319"/>
107. Now here it stayeth, and qualifieth, mixeth
or uniteth with the spirit of life in the Heart, and is a
<hi>Royal seate</hi> of the spirit of the Heart, for thus far the
spirit of the Heart's power presseth forth, and there
is it <hi>approved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>108. For the Brayne sitteth in the severe Birth or
Geniture, and in its <hi>own Body</hi> it is the meek power of
the Heart, and signifieth the <hi>new Birth</hi> which is new
regenerated in the midst or center of the austerenesse
of Death and wrath, in <hi>its</hi> Heaven, and presseth
forth through Death into Life.</p>
                  <p>109. For there the spirit or the <hi>Thoughts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a whole creaturely Person againe through the
affecting or proving of all powers, which in Man I
call the animated or <hi>Soulish</hi> Birth.</p>
                  <p>110. For when the new spirit in the Braine is
well settled, then it goeth to its <hi>Mother</hi> againe, into
the Heart, and then it standeth as a perfect spirit or
will, or as a new born Person, which, in Man, is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>111. Now behold! as the Braine in Man is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and <hi>product,</hi> so is the Planet <hi>Jupiter</hi> also, a being
and product: for it hath his original from the rising
up of Life, from the power, which is risen up out of
the <hi>water</hi> of Life out of the <hi>Place</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> through
the Light.</p>
                  <p>112. And that power is risen up so high, that it is
<hi>caught</hi> or captivated againe in or by the austere, hard
and cold power, and there it remaineth <hi>at a stand,</hi> and
by the first <hi>Revolution,</hi> or going forth is become cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,
and became exsiceated or dried by the
austere and cold power.</p>
                  <p>113. And is rightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Braine in the <hi>corporeall</hi>
Government of this World, from whence the senses
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:61095:319"/>

<hi>wisdom</hi> in Naturall things, but the right and <hi>holy</hi>
spirit in Man, is generated in the <hi>hidden</hi> Heaven in
<hi>the water of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>114. The outward <hi>Jupiter</hi> is onely the Meeknesse
and understanding in the outward comprehensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or <hi>palpable</hi> things: but the <hi>holy</hi> fountain or well-spring
is incomprehensible and unsearchable

            <head>The Six and Twentieth
Chapter.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Of the Planet, Saturnus.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1.
<hi>SAturn;</hi> that cold sharp austere and astringent
Regent, takes its beginning and Original, <hi>not</hi>
from the <hi>Sun;</hi> for it hath, in its Power, the
<hi>chamber</hi> of Death, and is a dryer up of all powers,
from whence <hi>Corporeity</hi> existeth.</p>
            <p>2. For as the <hi>Sun</hi> is the Heart of the Life, and
an original of all spirits in the Body of this world:
so <hi>Saturn</hi> is a beginner of all corporeity and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibilitie
or palpability, and in the power of <hi>these
two</hi> Planets standeth the whole Body of this world:
and there cannot be <hi>any Creature</hi> or imaging, nor any
mobilitie, without the power of <hi>these two,</hi> in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Body of this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61095:320"/>
3. But <hi>Saturnes</hi> original is the earnest <hi>astringent</hi>
and austere anxietie of the whole Body of this
world: for as in the time of the kindling of the wrath
the Light in the outermost Birth or Geniture of this
world, was <hi>extinct;</hi> which Birth or Geniture is the
<hi>Nature</hi> or comprehensibilitie or the rising up of the
Birth of all qualifying or fountain spirits;<note place="margin">Naturlig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keit.</note> so also the
<hi>astringent qualitie</hi> stood in its sharpnesse and severest
Birth or Geniture,<note place="margin">Naturalnessa</note> and attracted or contracted most
<hi>strongly</hi> and eagerly, the whole work or effect of the
qualifying or fountain spirits.</p>
            <p>4. From whence then the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> came
to be, and were very rightly the House of Death,
or the enclosing or shutting up of the Life, wherein
King <hi>Lucifer</hi> was captivated.</p>
            <p>5. But when, on the first day, the Light <hi>somwhat</hi>
brake forth again, through the word or Heart of
God in the Root of the Nature or Body of this world,
as a <hi>choosing</hi> or appropriating of the <hi>Day</hi> or beginning
of the mobilitie of Life, then the severe and astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Birth or Geniture obtained againe a <hi>glimpse,</hi> or
rising up of the life in the Birth or Geniture.</p>
            <p>6. And from that time it stood as it were in an <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious</hi>
Death, till <hi>after</hi> the third Day, when the Love
of God press'd through the Heaven of the Partition,
and kindled the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. But being the Heart or <hi>power</hi> of the Sun could
<hi>not open</hi> the anxious Birth or qualitie of fiercenesse
and wrath, and <hi>temper</hi> the same, especially aloft
in that height above <hi>Jupiter,</hi> thereupon that whole
circumferen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e or sphere, stood in a <hi>Horrible</hi> anxietie
just as a woman in travel, and yet could not awaken
or raise the Heat, because of the horrible coldnesse
and astringency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="611" facs="tcp:61095:320"/>
8. But being the <hi>mobilitie</hi> neverthelesse was risen
up through the power of the <hi>hidden</hi> Heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nature could <hi>not rest,</hi> but was in anguish to the
Birth, and generated out of or from the Spirit of
sharpnesse, an astringent, cold and austere Sun or
Starre which is <hi>Saturne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. For the Spirit of Heat, could not kindle it selfe,
from whence the <hi>Light</hi> existeth, and out of or from
the Light through the water, the <hi>Love</hi> and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
exist, but it was a Birth or Geniture of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere
cold and severe <hi>fiercenesse,</hi> which is a dryer,
spoyler, and enemie, of meeknesse, which in the
Creatures generateth the <hi>Hard Bones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. But <hi>Saturne</hi> was <hi>not</hi> bound to its place, as the
<hi>Sun is,</hi> for it is not a Corporeal place or space in the
<hi>roome</hi> of the Deepe, but <hi>Saturne</hi> is a sonne which is
born or generated out of the Chamber of Death, out
of the kindled, hard, and cold anxietie, and is only
one of the House-hold or family in that <hi>space</hi> or
roome, in which it hath its Course and <hi>Revolution:</hi>
For it hath its corporeall proprietie to it selfe, as a
<hi>Child,</hi> when it is born or generated from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>[<q>
                  <hi>Saturne</hi> indeed was Created together with the
wheele, when the FIAT Created the wheele;
but it doth not goe forth or proceed from <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </q>]</p>
            <p>11. But, <hi>why</hi> it did rise up thus from God out of the
<hi>austere</hi> Birth, and what its <hi>Office</hi> is, I will mention
hereafter, concerning the driving about or revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Planets.</p>
            <p>12. But its height or distance cannot be <hi>exactly</hi>
known: But I am fully perswaded that it is in the
midst, in the deepe between <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the general
Sphere of the fixed Stars or constellations, for it is
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:61095:321"/>
the Heart of the <hi>Corporeity</hi> in Nature.</p>
            <p>13. For as the <hi>Sun</hi> is the Heart of Life, and a
cause of the <hi>spirits</hi> of Nature; so <hi>Saturne</hi> is the Heart
and the cause of all <hi>Bodies</hi> &amp; Imagings formings and
framings in the Earth, and upon the Earth, as also
in the whole Body of this world.</p>
            <p>14. And as in Man the <hi>Skull</hi> is a contayner or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closer
of the Brayne, wherein the <hi>Thoughts</hi> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated:
So the <hi>Saturnine</hi> power is an environer, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and contayner of all Corporeity and comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
or <hi>Palpability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. And as the Planet <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shutter,
and Generator of meeknesse, and is <hi>betweene</hi>
the fierce <hi>Mars</hi> and the austere <hi>Saturne,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
the Meeknesse and wisdom in the Creatures,
so the Life and the Senses of all Creatures, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
<hi>between</hi> these two <hi>qualities,</hi> especially the

               <p>16. <hi>Venus</hi> that gracious amiable and blessed Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
or the kindler of <hi>Love</hi> in Nature, hath its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and descent or proceeding from the Springing up
of the <hi>Sun</hi> also, but its condition, qualitie, being, and
proceeding or descent, is <hi>thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here observe this rightly and exactly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. When the <hi>Love of God</hi> kindled the place of
the <hi>Sun,</hi> or the SUN, then there sprung up first out
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:61095:321"/>
of the anxietie, out of the Place of the <hi>Sun,</hi> out of the
seaven qualifying or fountain spirits of Nature; the
terrible <hi>fierce,</hi> bitter, fire-crak, whose Birth and
principal or first original is the <hi>kindled bitter wrath</hi> of
God, in the astringent qualitie, through the water.</p>
               <p>18. And that, sprung up <hi>first,</hi> in the kindling of the
<hi>Sun</hi> out of the Chamber of Death, and was an awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kener
or rouser of Death, and a beginner of life, and
climed up aloft very fiercely, and trembling, till the
Light of the <hi>Sun</hi> layd hold on it, and affected or
possessed it, and there it was caught or captivated
by the meeknesse of the Light, and <hi>stayed;</hi> from which
the <hi>Planet</hi> Mars <hi>came to be,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19. After that fire-crack, the power of the light;
which at the beginning had generated it selfe out of
the unctuositie or <hi>fatnesse</hi> of the water behind the fire
crack; instantly <hi>shot forth</hi> after it like a mighty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie
or power, and took the fierce Fire-crack cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and highly elevated it selfe aloft <hi>beyond</hi> it, as
a Prince and subduer of the fiercenesse, from whence
now existed the sensibilitie of Nature, or the
<hi>Planet</hi> Jupiter.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Gate of Love.</head>
               <p>20. But when the <hi>two</hi> spirits, of the mobilitie, and
of the Life, were risen up out of the Place of the <hi>Sun</hi>
through the kindling of the water; then the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as a <hi>seed</hi> of the water, pressed downward in
the Chamber of Death, with the power of Light,
with a very gentle and freindly <hi>affection</hi> or influence
from whence existed the Love of Life, or the
<hi>Planet Venus.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>21. The Birth or the rising or springing up of the
seaven Planets, and of all the Stars; is <hi>no otherwise,</hi>
then <hi>as</hi> the Life, and wonderfull proportion, variety
and harmonie of the <hi>Deitie,</hi> hath generated it selfe
from <hi>Eternitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22. For when King <hi>Lucifer</hi> had caused this place
of the world to be appointed as a House of wrath
for him, &amp; supposed thus fiercely &amp; powerfully to
Rule there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n then presently the Light in Nature went
out, wherin he supposed to be the Lord; &amp; the whole
Nature was <hi>benumm'd</hi> and congealed as a Body of
Death, wherein was no mobilitie, and he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
there in <hi>darknesse</hi> as an Eternall Captive
Prisoner.</p>
               <p>23. But now the Holy God would <hi>not let</hi> this
place of his Body, understand, <hi>the space or
roome of this World,</hi> stand in eternal
<hi>darknesse</hi> and ignominie, and <hi>leave</hi> it to the Devills
for their proper own, but generated a <hi>new</hi> Regiment

was it usefull or profitable to him at all.</p>

in this Light, and therefore it is <hi>not</hi> profitable
or usefull to him.</p>
               <p>25. But being there must be a new Government
or dominion, it must needs be <hi>such</hi> a one as the Devil

               </p>
               <p>26. The Love, or <hi>word,</hi> or Heart, that is, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
or <hi>onely begotten Sonne</hi> of the Father, who is the
Light, and meeknesse, and the Love, and Joy of the
Deitie: <hi>As He hin selfe say'd, when he assumed the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie,
I am the Light of the World.
John 8. 12;</hi> He took the place of this world
by the Heart, and sate in the mid'st or center of this
space or roome, in <hi>that</hi> place, where the mighty
Prince and King <hi>Lucifer</hi> did sit before his fall, and
there he was <hi>new Borne</hi> to be, a Creature.</p>
               <p>27. And so out of this kindled place of the <hi>Sun,</hi>
there existed and were chiefly generated, <hi>six</hi> sorts of
qualities, all according to the right Law or Order of
the <hi>divine</hi> Birth or Geniture.</p>
               <p>28. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, First there arose the <hi>fire-crack,</hi> or the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the Heate, &amp; that is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Life in the Chamber of Death.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, After this secondly, the Light in the
unctuositie or <hi>fattness</hi> of the water became
shining in the Heat, and that is now the
<hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, And thirdly when now the Light of
the <hi>Sun</hi> had affected or possessed the
whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> then the power of
Life, which rose up out of the first affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or possessing, <hi>ascended</hi> as when wood is
kindled, or when fire is struck out of a
Stone.</p>
               <p>29. Then first is discerned the <hi>Glance</hi> or splendor,
and out of the splendor, the fire-crack, and after the
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:61095:323"/>
fire-crack the <hi>power</hi> of the kindled Body; and the
Light with the power of the Body, elevateth it self
instantly above the crack, and ruleth or reigneth
<hi>much higher</hi> deeper and more powerfully then the
fire-crack.</p>
               <p>30. Also the power of the kindled Body in the
outgone power without and beyond the fire, qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
mixeth or <hi>uniteth</hi> gently, pleasantly and very
sensibly: and herein rightly is understood the
<hi>Divine Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. In the same manner also is the <hi>existency</hi> of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> and of the two Planets, <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. But being the <hi>Place</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> that is, the
SUN it selfe, contained <hi>all qualities</hi> according to the
Right of the Deitie, as also all <hi>other</hi> places had;
thereupon instantly in the first kindling, <hi>all</hi> the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
went upward and downward, and generated
themselves according to the eternall beginning lesse
infinite Law, and <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>33. For the power of the Light, which did mitigate
the astringent and bitter qualitie in the place of the
Sun: and made it thinne like water or the Love of
Life, that went downwards according to the Nature
of Humilitie.</p>
               <p>34. Out of <hi>this</hi> the Planet <hi>Venus</hi> existed: for in
the House of Death it is an <hi>opner</hi> of meeknesse, or a
kindler of the water, and a soft penetrater into the
hardnesse, a kindler of the Love, in<note n="*" place="margin">Venus</note> which the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Regiment or <hi>Dominion,</hi> as the bitter Heat, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
or longing after <hi>Mars,</hi> and the heartie sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
is desirous or longing after <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>35. From whence the affections or <hi>insinuations</hi>
exist: for the power of <hi>Venus,</hi> maketh fierce <hi>Mars</hi> or
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:61095:323"/>
the fire-crack mild, and mitigateth it, and maketh
<hi>Jupiter</hi> humble, else the power of <hi>Jupiter</hi> would
break through the hard Chamber, <hi>Saturne;</hi> and in
Men and Beasts, through the Scul or Brain-pan, and so
the sensibilitie would transmute it self into high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindednesse
above the Birth-Right, or right Law or
order of the Geniture, of the Deitie, in the manner
and way of the <hi>proud</hi> Devill.</p>

               <head>Of the Planet Mercurius.</head>
               <p>36. If we would exactly and <hi>fundamentally</hi> know
how the Birth or <hi>beginning</hi> is, of the Planets and
Stars, and of the Being of all Beings, in the deepe of
this world, we must accurately consider the instant
or <hi>innate</hi> Birth or beginning of <hi>Life,</hi> in Man.</p>
               <p>37. For <hi>that</hi> taketh such a beginning and rising,
and standeth also in such an Order, as the Birth or
Geniture of <hi>the Being of all Beings</hi> in the Body of this
World, doth.</p>
               <p>38. For the instant or innate wheele of the Stars
and Planets is <hi>no</hi> otherwise, then as the Birth of the
seaventh spirit of Nature, before the time of the
world rose up, wherein were formed images and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,

according to the eternal right Law or Order of the
<hi>Deitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>39. And in that, Man is created according to the
qualifying or fountain spirits of God, and also out of
the <hi>divine</hi> Being, <hi>therefore</hi> mans Life hath such a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

<hi>in Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41. And now as the humane Life riseth up, so
hath also the Birth of the seaven Planets and Stars
risen or sprung up, and <hi>therein</hi> there is no difference

of Mans Life, in the knowledge of God? if it
be <hi>amisse,</hi> then reject it; if it be right, let it <hi>stand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>47. I here set down this <hi>description</hi> of the Birth or
Geniture of Mans Life, to the end that the original
of the Stars and Planets may be the better conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
at the description of the Creation of Man, thou
wilt find all more fundamentally and <hi>deeply,</hi> what the
beginning of Man, is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48. The <hi>Seede</hi> of Man is generated in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as the wonderfull proportion harmony or form
of Nature in its wrestling and rising up, is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Eternitie.</p>
               <p>49. For the <hi>humane</hi> Flesh, is, and resembleth, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Body of God, which is generated from
the other six qualifying or fountain spirits, wherein
the qualifying or fountain spirits, generate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
againe, and shew forth themselves <hi>infinitely,</hi>
wherein forms and images rise up, and wherein the
Heart of God, or the holy cleare Deitie in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
or central <hi>seate</hi> generateth it selfe <hi>above</hi> Nature
in that center, wherein the Light of Life, riseth up.</p>
               <p>50. But now in Mans <hi>Body</hi> in the government or
dominion of the Birth or Geniture, there are <hi>three</hi>
                  <pb n="620" facs="tcp:61095:325"/>
severall things, each of them being <hi>distinct</hi> and yet
are not divided <hi>asunder</hi> one from another, but all
three together are one only Man, after the kind and
manner of the <hi>Ternarie</hi> or Trinity in the divine Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>51. The <hi>Flesh</hi> is not the Life, but is a dead ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
being, which when the Government or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of the spirit <hi>ceaseth</hi> to qualifie or operate
therein, soone becometh a dead <hi>Carcasse,</hi> and putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and turnes to Dust or Ashes.</p>
               <p>52. But now no <hi>spirit</hi> can subsist in its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without the Body, for assoon as it departeth from
the Body, it looseth its Government or <hi>Dominion.</hi>
For the Body is the Mother of the Spirit in which
the spirit is generated, and in which it <hi>receiveth</hi> its
strength and power, it is and remaineth a spirit,
when it is seperated and departed from the Body,
but it looseth its <hi>Rule</hi> Dominion or Government.</p>
               <p>53. These three Dominions or Regiments are the
whole Man together with Flesh and Spirit, and they
have severally for their beginning and Dominion or
Government, a <hi>seavenfold</hi> forme after the kind and
manner of the seaven spirits of God or of the seaven
Planets.</p>
               <p>54. Now as the Dominion or Government of
Gods Eternall beginning lesse infinite Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is, so also is the beginning and rising or spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of the seaven Planets and the Stars, and just so
also is the rising or springing up of <hi>Mans Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>55. When thou mindest thinkest and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
what there is in this world, and what there is
without besides or distinct from this world, or what
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:61095:325"/>
the being of all Beeings, is; then thou speculatest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatest,
meditatest, in the whole Body of God,
which is the Beeing of all Beings, and that is a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninglesse
<hi>infinite</hi> Being.</p>
               <p>56. But in its own seate there is no mobilitie, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionability
or comprehensibilitie, but it is a <hi>dark</hi>
Deepe which hath neither beginning nor End.
Therein is neither thick nor thinne, opake nor trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
but is a dark Chamber of Death, where
nothing is <hi>perceived,</hi> neither cold nor warmeth, but it
is the <hi>End</hi> of all things.</p>
               <p>57. And this now is the Body of the Deepe, or
the very reall Chamber of Death.</p>
               <p>58. But now in this dark valley there are the <hi>seaven</hi>
spirits of God, which have neither Beginning nor End,
and the one is neither the first, second, third or last.</p>
               <p>59. In these <hi>seaven</hi> Dominions or Regiments, the
Regiment divideth it selfe into <hi>three</hi> distinct Beings,
where the one is not without the other, nor can they
be divided the one from the other: But those sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
spirits doe each of them generate one another,
from Eternitie to Eternitie.</p>
               <p>60. The <hi>first</hi> Dominion or Regiment standeth or
consisteth, in the Body of all things, that is, in the
whole Deepe, or Being of all Beings, which hath in
all corners and places thereof in it selfe the <hi>seaven</hi>
spirits in possession or in propriety indivisibly, or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistibly
for its proper own.</p>
               <p>61. Now if these seaven spirits in any one place
<hi>wrestle not</hi> triumphingly, then in that place there is no
mobilitie, but a deep <hi>darknesse;</hi> and although
the spirits are perfect in that place, yet that
place is a dark House, as you may perceive and
understand by a dark Cave or Roome close shut up,
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:61095:326"/>
in which the kindled spirits of the Planets and Stars
<hi>cannot</hi> kindle the Elements.</p>
               <p>62. But now the <hi>Roote</hi> of the seaven spirits is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where all over, but when there is no wrestling,
then it standeth still and quiet, and <hi>no</hi> mobilitie is
<hi>perceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>63. And such a House is the whole Deepe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
within, and above all Heavens; which house is
call'd the <hi>Eternitie:</hi> and such a House also is
the <hi>House of Flesh</hi> in Man and in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>64. And this Being, together, comprehendeth the
Eternitie, which is <hi>not called</hi> God, but the UN-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Body of Nature, wherein indeed the Deity
is immortall or not Dead, but standing hidden in the
kernel of the seaven spirits, and yet not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
or understood.</p>
               <p>65. And such a House also, the <hi>whole space</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of this world came to be; when the Deitie in
the seven spirits had <hi>hidden</hi> it selfe from the horrible
Devills.</p>
               <p>66. And had so <hi>continued,</hi> if the seaven Planets
and Stars had not risen or sprung up from Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which opened a-gaine and kindled the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Death in the dark House of this world in all
places every where, from whence existeth the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or <hi>Dominion</hi> of the Elements.</p>
               <p>67. Moreover thou art to know also, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
or Dominion of the seaven spirits of God in
the House of this world, is not thereupon exsiccated
or dried up in <hi>Death,</hi> that all must needs receive its
Life and beginning from the Planets and Stars.</p>

               <p>69. But being the Heart of the Deitie <hi>hideth</hi> it

corporeity is a dark House, and all standeth in great

               <p>71. And then the anxietie <hi>ceaseth;</hi> for when the

is a dark House, where the whole Corporeity gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
it selfe, and so is very thick, dark, anxicu, and

the anxietiegenerateth no more but <hi>ONE Seed.</hi> The

the spirit of the House of Flesh as also to the spirit of
the Astral Birth or Geniture: just as the <hi>Heart of God</hi>

The Gate of the Great mysterie.</head>
               <p>79. Out of the <hi>anguishing</hi> Chamber in the Body
of this world out of the seaven spirits of God, are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
or sprung forth the Stars, which <hi>kindle</hi> the Body
of this world, and out of or from the Body the <hi>fruit</hi>
or <hi>seede</hi> generateth it selfe, which is the Water, Fire,
Aire, and Earth.</p>
               <p>80. <hi>The Earth is the fruit of
the seaventh spirit of God, which
is Nature or Corporiety;</hi> wherein the
other six spirits generate themselves againe, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
or frame the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the seaventh spirit into
<hi>infinite sorts</hi> of formes or shapes; so that the Earth
also generateth its seed, which is the fruit of <hi>vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as is apparent to the Eye.</p>
               <p>81. Now <hi>Mans</hi> House of Flesh is also such a house
as the <hi>dark</hi> deepe of this world is, wherein the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
spirits of God generate themselves.</p>
               <p>82. But being Mans Body is its proper own, and
is a <hi>Sonne of the whole</hi> Body of God, <hi>therefore</hi> it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
also a proper seede of its own according to
the Government or Dominion of his corporeal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
or fountain spirits.</p>
               <p>83. The Body taketh its <hi>food,</hi> from the seed of
the seaven spirits of God, in the Body of the great
Deepe, which is, Fire, Aire, Water and Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="627" facs="tcp:61095:328"/>
84. Of or from the Earth it taketh the Birth of
the Earth or the Fruit, for it is much more Noble
then the Earth: <hi>It is an extracted</hi>
Masse <hi>out of the</hi> Salitter <hi>out of
the seaventh Nature spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>85. For when the Body of Nature was <hi>kindled</hi> by
the Devill, then the <hi>word</hi> or the Heart of God drew
the <hi>Masse</hi> together, before the corrupted <hi>Salitter</hi>
was press'd together, which now is called the Earth
because of the hard fiercenesse or corruption.</p>
               <p>86. But when the Earth was <hi>pressed</hi> together, then
the <hi>Masse</hi> stood in the dark Deepe in the created
Heaven <hi>betweene</hi> the anxious Birth or Geniture and
the Body of the Heart of God, till the <hi>sixth Day;</hi> and
then the Heart of God breathed the Light of Life
out of or from his Heart into the innermost or <hi>third</hi>
Birth or Geniture of the <hi>Masse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>87. Now when this was done, then in the <hi>Masse,</hi>
the seaven spirits of the qualities <hi>began</hi> to qualifie or
operate, and in the <hi>Masse,</hi> the <hi>seede</hi> of the seaven
qualifying or fountain spirits generated it selfe, as
Fire, Aire, and Water, <hi>as</hi> in the Body of the Deepe.</p>
               <p>88. <hi>Thus</hi> MAN <hi>became a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

90. Now behold! As in the Deepe of this world,
through the <hi>kindling</hi> of the Stars a <hi>seede</hi> is generated
out of the Body of the dark deepe, like the <hi>Creaturely</hi>
Body: so also in like manner in <hi>Mans</hi> House of Flesh
there is generated, a seede, according to the Eternal
Birth Right of the <hi>seaven</hi> qualifying or fountain
spirits.</p>
               <p>91. And in the <hi>seeds</hi> there are <hi>three distinct</hi> things,
whereof the one cannot fathom the other, and yet
are in that <hi>one</hi> only seed, and qualifie, mixe or unite
one with another, as one being, and is also <hi>one being,</hi>
and yet also <hi>three distinct things,</hi> according to the
kinde and manner of the <hi>Ternarie</hi> or Trinity in the
Deitie.</p>
               <p>92. <hi>First</hi> there is the whole <hi>Body</hi> of Man, which
is a dark House, and hath no mobilitie besides or
<hi>without</hi> distinct from the qualifying or operation of
the seaven spirits, but is a dark valley, as the Body of
the Deepe of this world is.</p>
               <p>93. Now in the dark Body of Man there is such
a Regiment or Dominion also as to the <hi>seaven</hi> spirits
as is in the Body of the Deepe; And when the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
spirits qualifie or operate according to the <hi>Birth-Right</hi>
of the Deitie, then out of the <hi>wrestling</hi> of the
seaven spirits a <hi>seede</hi> generateth it selfe according to
<hi>their</hi> likenesse.</p>
               <p>94. Now that seede hath first a <hi>Mother,</hi> which
is the dark <hi>Chamber</hi> of the House of Flesh. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it hath a Mother, which is the <hi>wheele</hi> of the seaven
spirits, according to the kind and manner of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Planets. Thirdly it hath a Mother which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in the Circle of the seaven spirits in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and is the <hi>Heart</hi> of the seaven spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="629" facs="tcp:61095:329"/>
95. And this now is the <hi>Mother of the soule,</hi> which
shineth thorough the seaven spirits, and maketh
them living, and in their steed the seed qualifyeth
mixeth or <hi>uniteth</hi> with the Heart of God: But it is
<hi>that seed</hi> only, in which the Light is kindled; but in
that, in which the wrath fire burneth there this
third Mother remaineth <hi>Captive</hi> in the dark Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>96. And though indeede it is the <hi>third</hi> Mother,
yet it remaineth to be but a foolish Virgin, if the
Light be <hi>not</hi> kindled in it; just as the Deepe of this
world is * a foolish Virgin before the Heart of God
in which the wheele of the seaven spirits standeth in
such anxietie, in so much <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>redemption</hi>
in heate and cold as is apparent to the Eye.</p>
               <p>97. But when the <hi>third</hi> Mother is kindled in the
<hi>Light</hi> then it standeth in the created Heaven of the <hi>holy</hi>
Life, &amp; shineth through the <hi>second</hi> Mother, the seaven
spirit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>herby the seven spirits get a friendly courtous
will, which is the <hi>Love</hi> of the Life, as you may read in
the Eighth Chapter of this Book, <hi>Concerning
the Love-Birth or Geniture of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>98. But the <hi>third</hi> Mother, they cannot constantly
or <hi>permanently</hi> shine thorough, for it standeth in the
house of darknesse, but they often cast a <hi>Glimpse</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, even as if it lightened, whereby the third Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>many times</hi> becometh very longing, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
highly, but is soone bolted up againe by the
<hi>fiercenesse of Gods wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>99. The Devill also danceth at this Gate, for it is
the Prison, wherein the <hi>new</hi> Man lyeth hidd, and
wherein the Devill lyeth Captive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="630" facs="tcp:61095:330"/>
100. But I meane, in the House of the Deepe of
this World; though indeed the House of <hi>Flesh</hi> and
the Deepe, altogether qualifie mixe or unite one with
another, as one Body, and is one Body, only they
have distinct parts or Members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Deepe in the Center.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>101. Now behold! When the <hi>seede</hi> is generated,
it standeth in the center or mid'st of the Body in the
<hi>Heart:</hi> for there the <hi>Mother</hi> catcheth the Ternarie or
Trinity.</p>
               <p>102. <hi>First</hi> the astringent spirit catcheth hold, and
that draweth together a Masse or <hi>Lump</hi> out of the
<hi>sweet</hi> water, that is, out of or from the unctuositie or
fatnesse of the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Heart, or from the Sap or
<hi>Oyle</hi> of the Heart.</p>
               <p>103. Now that Oyle hath clearly the <hi>roote</hi> of the
Ternarie or Trinity in it, viz: the <hi>whole Man,</hi> for it is
just as when kindled Tinder is cast into Straw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now it may be asked,
How commeth this to passe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>104. Here now is the true
ground of Man; observe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
for it is the Looking Glasse
of the great Mysterie, the deepe
secret of the Humanitie, about
which all the learned since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:61095:330"/>
of the World have dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and have sought after this
Doare, but have not found it.</p>
               <p>105. But I must once mention
that it is the <hi>dawning</hi> or <hi>Morning
Redness</hi> of the <hi>Day,</hi> as the Doare
keeper will have me doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Observe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>106. Just as the first <hi>Masse</hi> was, out of which
<hi>Adam</hi> became a living Man: so also in like manner
is every <hi>Masse</hi> or <hi>seede</hi> of the Ternarie or Trinity <hi>in
every</hi> Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>107. When the <hi>Salitter</hi> or Fabrick of the six qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
or fountain spirits, which is the seaventh
Nature spirit in the <hi>space</hi> or roome of this World,
was kindled, then the <hi>word</hi> or Heart of God stood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verywhere
in the center or mid'st of the Circle of the
seaven spirits, as a <hi>Heart,</hi> which replenished all at
once, <hi>viz:</hi> the whole space or roome of this World.</p>
               <p>108. But being the Deepe, that is, the <hi>whole space</hi>
of this World, was the Body of the Father, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Father of (the Heart of God) understand
the Fathers <hi>Body;</hi> and the Heart in the whole
Body did shine forth, viz: The Fathers <hi>Lustre</hi> or
Brightnesse then the corrupted <hi>salitter</hi> was
affected or possessed every where with the Light
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:61095:331"/>
&amp; the Heart of God could <hi>not flye</hi> out from it, but did
<hi>hide</hi> its Lustre and shining Light <hi>in</hi> the Body of the
whole Deep, <hi>from</hi> the horrid kindled Spirits of Devils.</p>
               <p>109. And when this was done, then the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
or fountain spirits became very fierce and <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently</hi>
strugling, and the astringent spirit, as the
strongest, in the seaventh nature-spirit, drew very
terribly together, the fabrick and effects of the other
<hi>five,</hi> from whence the bitter Earth and Stones came
to be, but were <hi>not yet</hi> driven together, but moved
in the whole Deepe.</p>
               <p>110. In this houre the <hi>Masse</hi> was drawn together;
for when the Heart of God did hide it selfe in the
<hi>Salitter,</hi> then it cast a <hi>glance</hi> againe on the whole
space or Body, and thought how it might be <hi>Remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
againe, whereby another Angelical Kingdom
might be in the Deepe of this world.</p>
               <p>111. But the Glance was the
Love-spirit in the Heart of God,
vvhich in that place of the Glance,
affected or possessed the Oyle of
the water, where before the
Light was risen up.</p>
               <p>112. Here consider <hi>Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
glance that was cast upon him
in the house of Caiphas, it is the
very same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="633" facs="tcp:61095:331"/>
113. As the Man casts a <hi>Glance</hi> on the woman,
and the woman on the Man, and so the spirit of the
Man, understand the <hi>Roote</hi> of the Love, which in
the rising up of Life out of the <hi>water,</hi> riseth up
through the <hi>Fire,</hi> as also the womans spirit doth;
and so one spirit <hi>catcheth</hi> the other in that Oyle of
the Heart, whereby presently a <hi>Masse, Seede,</hi> or
driving will, or desire, to the <hi>propagating</hi> of a Man
againe, ariseth in the <hi>Masse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>114. Just in such a way and manner, the <hi>first
Masse</hi> also came to be, for the Love-Spirit in the
Heart of God cast a Glance in the <hi>Body</hi> of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
wrathfull Father on the <hi>water of Life,</hi> whereby,
and out of which, the <hi>Love</hi> in the fire-Flash arose or
sprung up <hi>before</hi> the time of the wrath.</p>
               <p>115. In this casting of the Glance, the one spirit
caught the other, the unctuous <hi>Oyle</hi> or Water in the
wrath, <hi>conceived</hi> from the Love-Spirit in the Heart of
God, and qualified mixed or united with the same,
and the astringent spirit drew the <hi>Masse together:</hi> and
there was cleerely a Birth, or a will, or desire, to the
<hi>producing</hi> of a whole creature, just as the <hi>Seede</hi> in
Man is.</p>
               <p>116. But now, the Firmament of Heaven that is
<hi>between</hi> the Heart of God and the kindled hard
Chamber of Death, was closed or shut up; else the
<hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Masse</hi> had suddenly kindled it selfe.</p>
               <p>117. For the firmament was <hi>within</hi> in the <hi>Masse</hi>
as well as <hi>without</hi> distinct from the <hi>Masse,</hi> which is
the parting mark, or limit of <hi>separation</hi> between the
Heart of God and the fierce Devills.</p>
               <p>118. <hi>Therefore</hi> the <hi>word</hi> or Heart of God <hi>must</hi>
blow up the moving<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="634" facs="tcp:61095:332"/>
119. For if Heaven had not as a Firmament been
<hi>shut up</hi> in the <hi>Masse,</hi> between the Heart of God and the
corporeal qualifying or fountaine spirits of the
<hi>Masse,</hi> then the <hi>Masse</hi> might have <hi>kindled</hi> the <hi>Soul,</hi>
from or by its <hi>own</hi> power, as it was with the Holy
Angels.</p>
               <p>120. But it was to be <hi>feared,</hi> that it would come
to passe, as it did with that faire little Son <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
being the corporeal qualifying or fountain spirits in
the <hi>Masse,</hi> were kindled in the <hi>wrath-fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>121. Therefore Heaven <hi>must</hi> be a Firmament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the sparkle which had conceived from the
Heart of God in the <hi>first</hi> Glance, that though the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>might happen</hi> to perish, yet the <hi>holy Seed</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
which is the <hi>Soul,</hi> which qualifyeth mixeth
or uniteth with the Heart of God, out of which a <hi>new
Body,</hi> might come to be; when the whole God
should <hi>kindle againe</hi> the Deepe of this world in the
Light of the Heart of God: and just so it is come to
be with the <hi>Body: The Love of God
have mercy</hi> and <hi>take pitty on it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>122. The deare man <hi>Moses</hi> writeth <hi>that God
made Man out of a Clod of Earth,</hi>
as the Learned have rendred it. But <hi>Moses</hi> was not
present, when it was done.</p>
               <p>123. But this I must needs say, that <hi>Meses</hi> hath
written very <hi>right,</hi> but the true understanding or
meaning, out of what the Earth proceeded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
hidden to <hi>Moses</hi> and them that have come
after him in the <hi>Letter,</hi> and the spirit hath kept it
hidden to <hi>this</hi> very time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="635" facs="tcp:61095:332"/>
124. It was also hidden from <hi>Adam,</hi> while he was
yet <hi>in Paradise;</hi> but <hi>now</hi> it will <hi>fully</hi> be revealed: for
the Heart of God hath set upon or assaulted the
Chamber of Death, and will <hi>shortly</hi> breake quite
thorough.</p>
               <p>125. And therefore in these our present times,
some <hi>Beames</hi> of the Day will more and more break
thorough in the hearts of <hi>some</hi> men, and make known
the Day.</p>
               <p>126. But when the <hi>Dawning</hi>
or <hi>Morning Rednesse</hi> shall shine
from the East to the West or from
the rising to the setting, then assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,
time will be no more; but
the <hi>SUN</hi> of the Heart of God
riseth or spriugeth forth, and,
<note n="*" place="margin">Behmes Epistle 23. vers. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>RA. RA. R. P. will be pressed
in the Wine Presse without the
Cittie, and therewith to R. P.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>127. These are hidden mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
words, and are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
onely in the Language of
Nature.</p>
               <p>128. <hi>Mises</hi> writeth very <hi>right,</hi> that Man was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
out of the Earth, but at <hi>that</hi> time, when the
<hi>Masse</hi> was held by the word, then the <hi>Masse</hi> was
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:61095:333"/>
                  <hi>not</hi> Earth: But if it had <hi>not</hi> been held or kept by the
word, then at that very houre it had become <hi>Black</hi>
Earth, but the cold wrath-fire was in it already.</p>
               <p>129. For at the very <hi>houre,</hi> when <hi>Lucifer</hi> elevated
himselfe, the Father was moved to <hi>wrath</hi> in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
or fountain spirits against the <hi>Legions</hi> of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,
and the Heart of God hid it selfe in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
of Heaven, where the <hi>Salitter,</hi> effect, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
or Fabrick, of the corporeity, was <hi>burning</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
for without or distinct from the Light, is the <hi>dark</hi>
Chamber of Death.</p>
               <p>130. But the <hi>Masse</hi> was held or kept in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
of Heaven, that it might <hi>not</hi> be congealed:
for when the Heart of God <hi>Glanced</hi> on the <hi>Masse</hi>
with its hot Love, then the unctuositie or oyle in the
<hi>Masse,</hi> which rose up out of the water through the
fire, out of which the Light riseth up, and out of
which the Love-Spirit riseth up; caught hold of
<hi>the Heart of God,</hi> and was <hi>impregnated</hi>
with a <hi>young Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>131. And that was the <hi>Seed of Love;</hi> for one
Love embraced the other, the Love of the <hi>Masse</hi>
embraced and conceived from the Love out of the
<hi>Glance</hi> of the Heart of God; and was thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated:
and this is the Birth or Geniture of the
<hi>Soule;</hi> and as to <hi>this Sonne,</hi> Man is the Image of God.</p>
               <p>132. But the qualifying or Fountain spirits in the
<hi>Masse,</hi> could not presently be kindled thereby
from the Soul; for the Soul stood only in the seed in the
<hi>Masse,</hi> hidden with the Heart of God in its Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
till the Creator <hi>blew</hi> upon the <hi>Masse,</hi> and then the
qualifying or Fountain spirits kindled the <hi>Soule</hi> also,
and then both Body and Soul lived equally toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="637" facs="tcp:61095:333"/>
133. Indeed the Soul had its <hi>Life, before,</hi> the
Body, but it stood in the Heart of God, hidden in
the <hi>Masse</hi> in Heaven, and was a kind of holy Seed
qualifying mixing or uniting with God, which is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi>
incorruptible, and undestroyable, for it was
a <hi>new</hi> and pure Seed, for an Angel and Image of
God.</p>
               <p>134. But the Fabrick, effect, or product, of the
whole <hi>Masse,</hi> was an extract, or attraction of the
<hi>word</hi> of God, out of the Fabrick or effect of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
or fountain Spirits, or of the <hi>Salitter,</hi> out of
which the Earth came to be.</p>
               <p>135. This extract was <hi>not yet</hi> become Earth,
though it was the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the Earth, but was held
or kept by the <hi>word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>136. For when the Love-Spirit out of the Heart
of God Glanced on the <hi>Salitter</hi> of the <hi>Masse,</hi> then the
<hi>Salitter</hi> did catch hold of it and conceive from it, and
was <hi>impregnated</hi> in the Center of the Soul, and the
<hi>word</hi> stood in the <hi>Masse</hi> in the <hi>Sound,</hi> but the <hi>Light</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
in the Center of the <hi>Masse,</hi> in the Firmament
of Heaven, standing hidden in the unctuous oile of the
heart, and did <hi>not</hi> move it selfe forth out of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
of Heaven, in the Birth of the qualifying or
fountain Spirits.</p>
               <p>137. Else if the <hi>Light</hi> had kindled it selfe in the
Birth or Geniture of the Soul, then all the seaven
qualifying or fountain Spirits, according to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Birth-Right of the Deitie, had triumphed and
qualifyed mixed or <hi>united</hi> in &amp; with the Light, and
had been a <hi>Living</hi> Angel; but being the wrath had
cleerely already infected the Salitter, therefore that
danger was to be <hi>feared,</hi> which befell <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="638" facs="tcp:61095:334"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now it may be Asked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>138. Why were not <hi>many
Masse's</hi> Created, at this time, out
of which instantly at once, there
might have been a whole Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
hoast or Army, instead of fallen
Lucifer.</p>
               <p>139. Why should there be so
long a time of stay in the wrath.</p>
               <p>140. And why should the whole
Hoast or Army be generated out of
that one <hi>Masse,</hi> in so very long a
Time?</p>
               <p>141. Or did not the Creator
at this time see and know of the
Fall of Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>142. <hi>This now is the very Doare
of the hidden secret mystery of the
Deitie.</hi> Concerning which the Reader is to
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:61095:334"/>
conceive, that it is not in the power or capacity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man to discerne or to know it, if the <hi>Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or <hi>Morning-Rednesse,</hi> did not break forth in the
Center in the Soul.</p>
               <p>143. For they are <hi>divine</hi> mysteries, which no
Man can search into by his <hi>own</hi> Reason, and I also
esteeme my selfe most unworthy of such a gift, and
besides I shall have many scorners and mockers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me; for the <hi>corrupted</hi> Nature is horribly <hi>asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
before the Light.</p>
               <p>144. But for all that, I cannot forbeare: for when
the divine Light breaketh forth in the Circle or Birth
of Life, then the qualifying or fountain Spirits <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi>
and in the Circle of the Life, reflect or look
back into their Mother, into the <hi>Eternity,</hi> and they
also look forwards into the Eternitie.</p>
               <p>145. But it is not a constant and <hi>lafting</hi> thing or
being, clarifying or brightning, of the qualifying or
fountain Spirits, much <hi>lesse</hi> of the <hi>Bestial</hi> Body, but
it is the <hi>Ray</hi> of the breaking through of the <hi>Light</hi> of
God with a firie impulse, which riseth up through
the meek water of Life in the Loye, and remaineth
standing in <hi>its</hi> Heaven.</p>
               <p>146. Therefore I can bring it no further, then
from the <hi>Heart</hi> into the <hi>Braine</hi> before the Princely
Throne of the Senses, and there it is <hi>shut up</hi> in the
Firmament of Heauen, and goeth <hi>not back</hi> againe
through the qualifying or fountain Spirits into the
Mother of the Heart, that it might come on to
the <hi>Tongue,</hi> for if that were done, I would tell
it with my <hi>mouth,</hi> and make it known to the
<hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="640" facs="tcp:61095:335"/>
147. But for that cause I will let it stand in <hi>its
Heaven,</hi> and write according to my gifts, and
with wonder and <hi>admiration</hi> expect what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of it. For in the qualifying or fountain
Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot <hi>sufficiently</hi> comprehend or
apprehend it, because they stand in the <hi>anxious</hi>
Chamber.</p>
               <p>148. As to the <hi>Soul</hi> I see it <hi>very well,</hi> but the
Firmament of the Heaven is between, in which
the Soul <hi>hideth</hi> it selfe, and there receiveth its
<hi>Rayes</hi> from the Light of God; and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it goeth <hi>through</hi> the Firmament of Heaven
as a Tempest of <hi>Lightning,</hi> but very gently in
a most amiable and pleasant delight and Joy.</p>
               <p>149. So that I <hi>cannot</hi> in the comprehensibility
in my <hi>innate</hi> instant or present qualifying or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Spirits, or in the Circle of Life, discerne or
know it <hi>otherwise,</hi> for <hi>the Day breaketh
forth apace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>150. For that cause I will <hi>write</hi> according to this
knowledge, though the Devill should offer to
assault and storm the world, which however he
cannot doe: Yet his Houre-Glasse is showen to him
and set before him.</p>
               <p>151. Now come on you<note n="*" place="margin">That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about Election and Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Electionists and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
about the Election of Grace, you that suppose
<hi>you only</hi> are in the right, and esteeme a simple Faith to
be but a <hi>foolish</hi> thing, you have danced long enough
before this Doore, and have made your <hi>boast</hi> of the
Scriptures, that they maintaine that God hath of

152. Here make to your selves many <hi>Masse's,</hi>
out of which there may proceed other manner of
Men of other qualities, and <hi>then</hi> you may be in the
right: But out of the <hi>one</hi> only <hi>Masse</hi> you can make

the Ground, of the <hi>Heart,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>152. If you lay hold on the Heart of God, then
you have Ground <hi>enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>154. If God give me Life for a little while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
