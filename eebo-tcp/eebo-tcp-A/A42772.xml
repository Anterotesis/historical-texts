            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Iunius</hi> his opinion in his Analysis upon that place.
The reason for the unlawfulnesse of such confederacies
are brought. 1. From the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 32. and 34.
12 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 2. Yea God maketh this a principall sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
and condition upon their part, while he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Covenant with them, <hi>Exod. 34 10. 12. Iud.</hi> 2. 1,
2. and lest it should be thought that this is meant only of
these seven Nations enumerate, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. the same Law
is interpret of four other Nations, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 1, 2. so
that 'tis to be understood generally against confederacies
with Idolaters and those of a false Religion: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Law is Morall and perpetuall, <hi>viz.</hi> the danger
of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ensnaring the people of God; therefore they were
forbidden to Covenant either with their gods, or with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29940:3"/>
themselves, for a conjunction of Counsels, and familiar
conversation (which are consequents of a Covenant)
draweth in end to a fellowship in Religion. 2. From
disallowed and condemned examples, as <hi>Asa</hi> his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>Benhadad, 2. Chron.</hi> 16. to <hi>vers.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> his Covenant with the King of <hi>Assyria, 2 Kings</hi> 16.
7. 10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to 23. And if it should be objected,
these are but examples of Covenants with Idolatrous
heathens, there is not the like reason to condemne confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies
and associations with wicked men of the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<hi>I</hi> answer. 1. It holds <hi>à fortiori</hi> against confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
with such of the seed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> as had made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from true Religion, for as <hi>Grotius de jure belli &amp;
pacis</hi> lib. 2. Cap. 15. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. noteth, GOD would
have such to be more abominated then heathens, and to
be destroyed from among their people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 13. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this I adde, 2. We have in other Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emples,
which meet with that case also; for <hi>Iehosaphats</hi>
confederacy with <hi>Ahab: 2. Chron.</hi> 18. 3. with <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.
2. and after with <hi>Ahaziah, 2 Chron.</hi> 20. 35. are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which made <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> (although once relapsing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that sin) yet afterwards mend his fault, for he would
not again joine with <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> when he sought that associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
the second time, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 49. So <hi>Amaziah</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
associate himself in an expedition with the <hi>Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lites,</hi>
when God was not with them, did upon the Prophets
admonition disjoyne himself from them and take his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of their anger: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7, 8, 9, 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Lavater</hi>
upon the place applying that example, noteth this as one
of the causes why the Christian Wars with the <hi>Turke</hi> had
so ill successe, why saith he, consider what Souldiers
were imployed, this is the fruit of associations with the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29940:4"/>
wicked. 3. These confederacies proceed from an evill
heart of unbelief, as is manifest by the reasons which are
brought against <hi>Ahaz</hi> his League with <hi>Benhadad, 2 Chron.</hi>
16. 7, 8, 9. and by that which is said against the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
with the King of <hi>Assyria, Isay</hi> 8. 12, 13. for as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
upon the place noteth, the unbeleevers among the
people considering their own inability for managing so
great a War, thought it necessary to have a con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now as to the Arguments which use to be brought for
the contrary opinion. First tis objected that <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a confederacy with <hi>Aner, Eschol,</hi> and <hi>Mamre, Genesis
14. 13. Abraham</hi> with <hi>Abimelech, Genesis</hi> 21. 27.
32. and <hi>Isaac</hi> with <hi>Abimelek, Gen. 26. Iacob</hi> with <hi>Laban,
Gen. 31. 44. Solomon</hi> with <hi>Hiram. 1 Kings</hi> 5. 12. Answ.
1. It cannot be proved that these confederates of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> were either idolaters or wicked:
<hi>Laban</hi> indeed was an idolater: But there are good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
who conceive that <hi>Abrahams</hi> three confederates
feared God; and that <hi>Abimelech</hi> also feared God, because
he speaketh reverently of God, and ascribeth to God
the blessing and prosperitie of those Patriarchs.</p>
            <p>'Tis presumed also that <hi>Hiram</hi> was a pious man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his Epistle to <hi>Solomon, 2 Chron.</hi> 2. 11, 12. how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

should not wrong one another, as that with <hi>Laban, Gen.</hi>
31. 52. and with <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 26. 29. which kinde of
confederacy is not controverted.</p>
            <p>'Tis objected also that the <hi>Maccabees</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

1, 2, Answ. 1. That Covenant is disallowed by many
good Writers; yea tis observed from the Story that they
had not the better, but the worse successe, nor the lesse
but the more trouble following it. 2. The Story it self,
1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 1. 12. tells us that the first motion of a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy

children of Belial in <hi>Israel.</hi> Lastly, it may be objected
that persons discontented, and of broken fortunes were
gathered to <hi>David;</hi> and that he received them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Captain unto them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 2. Answ. 1. Some

debt and discontented, and that <hi>David</hi> in receiving
them was a type of Christ who is a refuge for the afflicted,
and touched with the feeling of their infirmities. 2. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were, <hi>David</hi> took care that no prophane nor
wicked person might be in his company, <hi>Psal</hi> 101. yea,

2. 16. 18. They also who joined themselves with <hi>David</hi>

            <p>This point of the unlawfulnesse of confederacies with
men of a false Religion is strangely misapplyed by <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>
against confederacies with us, whom they call
<hi>Calvinists:</hi> So argueth <hi>Tarnovius Tract. de Foederib.</hi> But
we may make a very good use of it: for as vve ought to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29940:5"/>
pray and endeavour that all who are Christs may be made
one in him, so we ought to pray against and by all meanes
avoide fellowship, familiaritie, mariages, and militarie
confederacies with known wicked persons, and such as
are of a false or hereticall Religion. I shall branch forth
this matter in five particulars, which God forebade to his
people in reference to the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and other heathens
which also (partly by parity of reason, partly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
more strongly) will militate against confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and conjunctions with such as under the profession of
the Christian Religion do either maintain Heresies and
dangerous Errors, or live a prophane and wicked life.</p>
            <p>First, God forbade all Religious Covenants with such,
and would not have his people to tolerate the gods,
images, altars, or groves of idolaters: <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 32.
and 34. 13. <hi>Deut. 7. 5. Iud.</hi> 2. 2. And although the
letter of the Law mention this in reference to the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites,</hi>
yet the best reforming Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> applyed
and executed this Law, in taking away the growes and
high places abused by the <hi>Iewes</hi> in their superstion: And
what marvell? If such things were not to be tollerated
in the <hi>Canaanites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Socral. hist lib. 5. Cap. 10.</note> much lesse in the <hi>Iewes. Theodosius</hi>
is commended for his suppressing and punishing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</p>
            <p>2. God forbade familiar conversation with these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
that they should not dwell together with his people,
nay, nor in the land with them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 33 lest one of
them being familiar with an <hi>Israelite,</hi> might call him to
a feast, and make him eat of things sacrificed to idols,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 15. Compare this with <hi>Iud. 1. 21. Psal.</hi> 106.
35. Now the Apostle layeth much more restraint upon
us, from conversing, eting and drinking wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christian, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. then with a <hi>Pagan</hi> or unbeleever,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27. There is a conversing and companying
with wicked persons, which is our affliction, not our
fault, that is when we cannot be rid of them, do wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
we can, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. which is an argument against se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
and departing from a true Church, because of
scandalous persons in it. The Apostle gives this check
to such, go where they will, they shall finde scandalous
persons, all the world over. There is again a conversing
and companying with wicked persons, which naturall
and civile bonds, our neare relations, or our calling ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us unto, as between husband and wife, parent and
child, Pastor and people, Magistrate and those of his
charge. But wittingly and willingly to converse and
have fellowship either with hereticall or prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whether it be out of love to them and delight in
them, or for our own interest or some worldly benefit, this
is certainly sinfull and inexcusable. If we take care of
our bodily safety, by flying the company of such as
have the plague, yea if we take care of the safety of our
beasts, and would not to our knowledge suffer a scabbed
or rotten sheep to infect the rest, shall we not much more
take care of our own and neighbours souls, by avoyding
and warning others to avoide the fellowship of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
whereby spirituall infection comes. Remember
it was but a kinde visit of <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> to <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the occasion of ingageing him into a confederacy with that
wicked man. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>3. God forbade conjugall covenants or marrying
with them. <hi>Exod. 34. 16. Deut.</hi> 7. 3. The rule is the
same against matching with other wicked persons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the old world and brought on the flood, that the

but the daughter of <hi>Ahab;</hi> but 'tis marked, hee

<hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 30.</p>
            <p>4. God forbade his people to make with the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
<hi>foedus deditionis</hi> or <hi>subactionis,</hi> or (as others speak)
<hi>pactum liberatorium,</hi> he would have his people shew no

7. 2. Herein <hi>Ahab</hi> sinned, making a brotherly Covenant
of friendship with <hi>Benhadad,</hi> when God had delivered
him into his hand, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 32, 33, 34. So in all

reasons, (whereof he repented when he was dying, nor

that is, a League offensive and defensive, wherein wee
associate our selves with idolaters, infidels, hereticks
or any other known enemies of Truth or Godlinesse, so
as to have the same friends or enemies. A Covenant of
Peace or commerce with such may happen to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
in respect of some circumstances, as when Peace is
given to those Rebels, Murderers, Incendiaries in the

the prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> to be consulted, or that he would
hearken to them more then to the Prophet of the Lord <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cajah;</hi>

               </gap>aith to him, 2 <hi>Chron. 19 2 Shouldest thou
help the ungodly, or love them that hate the Lord.</hi> The
LXX, read <hi>hated of the Lord,</hi> which comes all to one
thing. And lest it should be thought a veniall or light
matter, he addeth, <hi>therefore is wrath upon thee from before
the Lord.</hi> So that from this example we learn, that
let us keep our selves unspotted of the false religion or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of those with whom we associate, let wicked men
seem never so penitent, and our relations to them be never
so near, let the common enemy be an Infidell, let the
cause be never so good, let the manner of proceeding be
never so pious, and the end also good: yet all this cannot
excuse nor justifie confederacies and associations with
wicked and ungodly men. And if God was so angry at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29940:10"/>
               <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> when there were so many things concurring as
might seem to excuse or extenuate his fault, it being also
in him a sin of infirmity only, and not without a reluctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of conscience, and a conflict of the spirit against the
flesh (which <hi>Pareus</hi> upon 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. doth well collect
from his desire of enquiring at the word of the Lord,
that he might have occasion to come off) how much more
will God be angry with such as go on with an high hand
in this trespasse, casting his word behind them, and hating
to be reformed.</p>
            <p>If it be further objected, that we are not able without
such confederacies and help to prosecute a great war alone.
This also the Holy Ghost hath before hand answered,
in the example of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his confederacy with the King of
<hi>Assyria;</hi> for he had a great War to manage, both against
the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and against the King of <hi>Israel, 2 Kings</hi> 16. 7.
also against the <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Philistins, 2 Chron.</hi> 28. 16,
17, 18. yet although he had so much to do, this could
not excuse the confederacy with the <hi>Assyrian:</hi> he should
have trusted to God, and not used unlawfull means. God
can save by few as well as by many; yea sometimes God
thinks not fit to save by many. <hi>Iud.</hi> 7. It shall not be the
strength of battell to have unlawfull confederates, but
rather to want them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 22.</p>
            <p>If it be said it is dangerous to provock and incense ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wicked men by casting them off. This is plainly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
from the example of <hi>Amaziah</hi> and the 100000.
men of <hi>Israel</hi> with him of which before. If furthermore
objection be made, that we must be gentle and patient
towards all, and in meeknesse instruct those that oppose
themselves, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25. Answ. 1. Yet he bids us
turne away from the wicked, Ibid. <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. 5. We ought in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29940:11"/>
meeknesse to instruct even him that is excommunicate,
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 15. yet we are there warned, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. to have
no company with him. 2. The Angel of the Church at
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> is at once commended, both for his patience,
and that he could not bear them which were evill.</p>
            <p>I shall adde five distinctions which will take off all
other ojections that I have yet met with. 1. Distinguish
between a confederacy which is more discretive and discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative,
and a confederacy which is more unitive. And
here is the reason why Covenants of peace and commerce
even with infidels and wicked persons are allowed, yet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
associations with such, disallowed: for the former
keeps them and us still divided as two: the latter unites
us and them, as one, and imbodieth us together with
them: for <hi>Thuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dides</hi> defines <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be such a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
as makes us and our confederates to have the same
friends aud enemies;<note place="margin">Kekerm. de Repub. Spart. disp. 4. lib. 2. Cap. 20.</note> and tis mentioned by Writers as
a further degree of Union then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Covenants of
peace. 2. Distinguish between endeavour of duty and
the perfection of the thing: which answers that exception,
<hi>O then, we must have an Army all of Saints,</hi> (it should bee
said, <hi>without any known wicked person in it;</hi>) Now even as
tis our dutie to endeavour a purging of the Church from
wicked and scandalous persons, yet when we have done
all we can, the Lords field shall not bee perfectly purged
from tares till the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. So when
we have done all that ever we can to avoid wicked persons
in an expedition, yet we cannot be rid of them all; but
we must use our utmost indeavours, that we may be able
to say, tis our affliction, not our fault. 3 Distinguish
between some particular wicked persons, here and there
mixing themselves with us; and between a wicked faction
<pb facs="tcp:29940:11"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:29940:12"/>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:29940:12"/>
and malignant party: The former should be avoided as much
as is possible: but much more a conjunction with a wicked
faction. <hi>David</hi> would by no meanes meet and consult
with the <hi>Kabal meregn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m,</hi> the Assembly of Malig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ants;
neither did he only shunne to meet and consult with <hi>vaine
persons;</hi> who openly shew and bewray themselves; but
even <hi>with dissemblers,</hi> or (as the <hi>Chaldee) with those that
hide themselves that they may do evill.</hi> Psal. 26. 4, 5. We
can know better how to do with a whole field of tares in
which is no wheat, then we can do with tares growing
here and there among the wheat. 4. Distinguish between
such a fellowship with some wicked persons, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
(which is the case of those that are Married, and
of Parents and Children) or unavoidable, which is the
case of those, whose lot is to cohabite in one Town, or
in one Family, in a case of necessity travelling or sayling
together; Distinguish, I say, between these and an
elective or voluntary fellowship with wicked men, when
love to them, or our own benefite draweth us thereunto.
We neither loose naturall bonds, nor require impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
but that we keep our selves pure by not choosing
or consenting to such fellowship. 5. Distinguish between
infidels, hereticks, wicked persons, repenting and those
who go on in their trespasse: what ever men have been,
yet as soone as the signes of repentance and new fruits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in them, we are ready to receive them into favour
and fellowship: Then indeed the Wolfe shall dwell with
the Lamb, and the Cow and the Bear shall feed, their
young ones shall lye down together, meaning such as
were Wolves, Leopards, Beares, and now begin to
change their nature: not so with the obstinate, contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and impenitent, who still remain Wolves, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now, 1. Examine our selves, whether there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29940:13"/>
be so much tendernesse of conscience in us, as to close vvith
those Scripture Truths, or whether we are still in a way
of consulting vvith flesh and blood. 2. Be humbled for
former miscarriages and failings in these particulars, and
for not vvalking accurately according to these Scripture
Rules. 3. Bevvare for the future: remember and apply
these Rules vvhen vve have to do vvith the practise of them.
And that I may drive home this naile to the head, I adde
(beside what was said before) these Reasons and Motives.
First, tis a great judgement when God <hi>mingleth a perverse
Spirit</hi> in the midst of a people, <hi>Isay</hi> 19. 14. shall we then
make that a voluntary act of our own, which the Word
mentioneth as a dreadfull judgement? With this spirituall
judgement is oftentimes joyned a temporall judgement
as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 9. and 20. 37. and 28. 20. so <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 13. 7, 8,
compared with <hi>Hos.</hi> 8. 8, 9. where their judgement,
soundeth forth their sin as by an Eccho: The <hi>Chaldee</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raprase
in the place last cited saith, <hi>The house of Israel is
delivered into the hands of the people whom they loved.</hi>
Secondly, remember what followed upon Gods peoples
mingling themselves with the heathen, <hi>Psal. 106. 35.
They were mingled among the heathen and learned their workes.
Hos. 7. 8. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hraim he hath mixed himself among the people,</hi>
that is, by making confederacies with the heathen, (as <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
expounds the place) and by seeking their help and
assistance, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 13. But what followes, <hi>Ephraim is a
cake not turned,</hi> hot and overbaken in the neither side, but
cold and raw in the upper side. This will prove the fruit
of such confederacies and associations, to make us zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for some earthly or humane thing, but remise and
cold in the things of Christ; to be too hote on our neither
side, and too raw on the upper side. Whereas not ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
our selves with the wicked: we shall through Gods
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29940:13"/>
mercy be like a cake turned, that heat and zeal which was
before downward, shall now be upward, heavenward,
Godward, let it be also remembred, how both <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Kings</hi>
16. 10 and <hi>Asa</hi> himself, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 10. (though a
good man) were drawn into other great sins upon occasion
of these associations with the enemies of God and his people:
this sin will certainly ensnare men in other sins. Tis well
said by <hi>Calvin</hi> upon <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 26. that as we are too prone of
our selves to wickednesse, so when we enter into confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
with wicked men, we are but seeking new tentations,
and as it were a bellows to blow up our own corruptions, as
wine being mixed with water loseth of its spirits, and white
being mixed with black, loseth much of its vvhitenesse: so
the people of God, if once mixed vvith vvicked enemies,
shall certainly losse of their purity and integrity. Thirdly,
as these unlavvfull confederacies dravv us both into great
judgements and great sins, so into a great security and stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
under these great plagues and sins, vvhich vvill make
the estate of such to be yet vvorse, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 9. after <hi>Ephraims</hi>
mixing himself among the people, tis added, <hi>Strangers have
devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not, yea, gray haires
are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth it not:</hi> although
his confederates have distressed him, and not strengthned
him, and although there may be observed in him diverse
signes of a decaying dying condition, yet he knowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it not,
nor takes it to heart; The same thing is insisted upon <hi>vers. 11.
Ephraim als<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> is like a silly Dove without heart; They call to
Egypt, they go up to Assyria.</hi> He is as voide of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as a silly Dove, whose nest being spoiled, and <hi>her young
ones token from her</hi> (vvhich the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphrase addeth
for explications cause) yet she still returneth to those places
vvhere, and among those people by vvhom she hath been so
spoiled; So <hi>Israel</hi> vvill still bee meddling vvith those that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29940:14"/>
have done him great hurt. Fourthly, vve finde that such
confederacie or association either vvith idolaters or knovvn
impious persons, is seldome or never recorded in the Book
of God, vvithout a reproof, or some greater marke of Gods
displeasure put upon it. If it vvere like the Polygamie of
the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>triarchs, often mentioned and not reproved, it vvere
the lesse marvell to hear it so much debated. But novv vvhen
God hath purposely set so many Beacons upon those rockes,
and Shelves that we may beware of them, O why shall we
be so mad, as still to run upon them. It was reproved in
the time of the Judges, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. It was reproved
in the time of the Kings; <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Asa's</hi> Covenant with <hi>Benhadad, Ahaz</hi> his confederacy with

with <hi>Ahaziab: Amaziahs</hi> association with those 100000.
men of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when God was not with them, all those
are plainly dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Ier. 2. 18. And now, what hast thou to do in the way
of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? Or what hast thou to
do in the way of</hi> Assyria, <hi>to drink the waters of the river?</hi>
the Chaldee hath thus; <hi>what have yee to do to associate with</hi>
Pharaoh <hi>King of Egypt—And what have ye to do to make
a Covenant with the</hi> Assyrian? Again after the captivity,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 9. the <hi>Iewes</hi> mingling of themselves with the heathen
is lamented. Fifthly, the great and precious promises of
God, may encourage us so, as we shall never say to the
wicked, a <hi>confederacy:</hi> for upon condition of our avoiding
all such confederacies and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unctions, God promiseth
never to break his Covenant with us, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 1, 2. and to
receive us as his Sons and Daughters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14 16, 17,
18. Sixthly, tis one of Gods great mercies which he hath
Covenanted and promised, <hi>I will purge out from among you
the Rebels and them that transgresse against me, Ezek.</hi> 20. 38.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29940:14"/>
Why should we then forsake our own mercy, and despise
the counsell of God against our own soules? Seventhly,
as it was in <hi>Asa</hi> his experience, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 8. so it hath
been in our own, God hath done his greatest works for us,
when we were most unmixed with such men.</p>
            <p>There is another Objection, which at the writing hereof
I have met with: 'Tis <hi>Davids</hi> confederacy and association
both with <hi>Abn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his conscience, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 3. 9. 18. Answ. 1. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting

follow these two examples, not being allowed or commended
in Scripture? or should we not rather avoid such consedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,

in the Word of GOD? 2. Whatsoever may be conceived to be
allowable or excusable in these examples of <hi>David</hi> yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

in holding out against him, hoping for no mercy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is content to make <hi>Amasa</hi> Generall of his Army, upon
condition that he would cause the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> to bring him
back to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which <hi>Amasa</hi> moves the men of <hi>Iudah</hi>
to do; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 14. for it was done by his authoritie, as
<hi>Iosephus</hi> also writeth,<note place="margin">Antiq. Jud. lib. 7. Cap. 10.</note> nor could it be done without his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
for <hi>Absolom</hi> and <hi>Ahitophel</hi> being dead, <hi>Amasa</hi> had the
whole power and sole headship of that Army and of all that
faction that had followed <hi>Absolom.</hi> Now then let them that
will plead for the lawfulnesse of confederacies with wicked
presons from these examples of <hi>David,</hi> first make the case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
that is, that the wicked one have power of an Army, and
of a great part of the body of a Kingdome, to make them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
continue in Rebellion and enmity or to come in and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
Next let it be remembred that both <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amasa</hi>
did a great service, (which was most meritorious at the hands
of men) for the good, peace, and safety of King and Kingdom,
and they did it at that time also when <hi>David</hi> was but weak, and
they had power enough to have continued a War against him.
Which is a very rare case, &amp; far different from the case of such
as have done &amp; are doing all that they can to pervert and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
many thousands of the people of God, instead of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
many thousands to obedience, as <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amasa</hi>
did. 3. There are some other answers proper to the one
case and the other. There is nothing in the Text to prove, that
<hi>David</hi> made such a Covenant with <hi>Abner,</hi> as the Grecians
call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or that the Covenanted to make him General of
his Army, (as afterwards he Covenanted with <hi>Amasa</hi>) for
at that time he could have no colour of reason for casting <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:29940:15"/>
out of his place, as afterwards he had; Therefore I
understand with <hi>Sanctus</hi> that the League which <hi>Abner</hi> sought
from <hi>David</hi> was <hi>Foedus pacis,</hi> a Covenant of peace, <hi>Hyerome</hi>
readeth, <hi>fac mecum amicitias,</hi> make friendship with me, for
before, they had been enemies, So that this League is not of
that kind which is chiefly controverted. As for <hi>Amasa,</hi> I shall
not go about (as some have done) to excuse or extenuate his
fault in joining with <hi>Absolom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tostatus in 2 Reg. 17. Quaest. 24.</note> as not being from any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
or wicked intention against <hi>David</hi> his Uncle; But there
is some probability that <hi>Amasa</hi> was a penitent and hopefull
man. Sure <hi>David</hi> had better hopes of him, then of <hi>Ioab:</hi>
And if it be true which <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth that before <hi>David</hi>
sent <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> to the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> and to <hi>Amasa,</hi>
frequent messages came from them to the King,<note place="margin">Antiq. lib 7. Cap. 10</note> desireing
to be received into his favour; however <hi>Amasa</hi> being so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and ready to do so much for <hi>David,</hi> when hee might
have done so much against him, <hi>David</hi> as he could not do
his busines without him, so he had some ground to hope well
of him; considering withall that <hi>Amasa</hi> was not set upon
this businesse by any offence or displeasure at the other party,
as <hi>Abner</hi> was. 4. Even as this example, so far as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the laying aside and casting off of <hi>Ioab,</hi> and not prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

26, 27, 28, 29. that Covenants made before true Religion did

may be said for such Covenants, yet confederacies with

are altogether unexcusable.</p>
            <p>Peradventur some have yet another Objection: this is an
hard saying (say diverse malignants) we are looked upon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29940:16"/>
as enemies, if we come not in and take the Covenant, yet
when we are come in and have taken the Covenant, we are
still esteemed enemies to the Cause of God, and to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
<hi>Answer,</hi> This is just as if those traitors, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breakers,
and other scandalous persons, from which
the Apostle bids us turne away, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. had objected,
if we have no forme of Godlinesse, we are looked upon
as aliens, and such as are not to be numbred among Gods
people, yet now when we have taken on a forme of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
we are in no better esteem with <hi>Paul,</hi> but still he
will have Christians to turne away from us: Yea, tis as if
workers of iniquity living in the true Church, should object
against Christ himself, if we pray not, if we hear not the
Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are not accepted, but rejected for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
of necessary duties, yet when we have prayed, heard,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are told for all that, <hi>Depart from me ye warkers of
iniquity, I never knew you.</hi> Men must be iudged according
to their fruits, according to their words and works, and
course of living; and if any who have taken the Covenant
shew themselves in their words and actions to be still wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
enemies, our eyes must not be put out with their hand
at the Covenant.</p>
            <p>If any disaffected shall still insist and say; But why then
are we received both to the Covenant and to the Sacrament,
nay, why are we forced and compelled into the Covenant.
Answ. 1. If any known malignaut or complier with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
or with any enemy of this Cause hath been received
either to the Covenant or Sacrament, without signes of
Repentance for the former malignancy, and scandale (such
signes of Repentance I mean, as men in Charity ought to
be satisfied with) 'tis more then Ministers and Elderships
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, or to the Acts and constitutions of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29940:17"/>
this Nationall Church. I trust all faithfull and conscientious
Ministers have laboured to keep themselves pure in such
things. Yea the Generall Assembly h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th ordained that
known compliers with the rebels, and such as did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
protections from the enemy, or keep correspondence
and intelligence with him, shall be suspended from the Lords
Supper, till they manifest their Repentance before the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
Now if any after signes and declaration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
have turned again to their old wayes of malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
their iniquity be upon themselves, not upon us. 2.
Men are no otherwise drawn or forced into the Covenant,
then into other necessary duties. Nay it ought notto be called
a forceing or compelling. Are men forced to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pare their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
life, because murthet is severly punished? or are men
compelled to be loyall, because traitors are exemplarily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
There may and must be a willingnesse and freenesse
in the doing of the contrary duty; although great sins must
not go away unpunished. Men are not compelled to vertue,
because vice is punished, else vertue were not vertue. Those
that refuse the Covenant reproach it, or rail against it,
ought to be looked upon as enemies to it, and dealt with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:
yet if any man were known to take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
against his will, he were not to be received. 3. These
two may well stand together, to censure the contempt or
neglect of a duty, and withall to censure wickednesse in the
person that hath taken up the practise of the duty. If any
<hi>Israelite</hi> would not worship the true God, he was to be put
to death, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 13. but withall, if, worshipping the
true God, he was found to be a murtherer, an adulterer,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for this also he was to be put to death. The Generall
Assembly of this Church hath appointed that such as after
admonition continue in an usuall neglect of Prayer, and the
Worship of God in their Families, shall be suspended from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29940:17"/>
the Lords Supper, till they amend. Yet if any man shall be
found to make Familie Worship a cloak to his swearing, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
adultery or the like, must these scandalous sinnes
be uncensured, because he hath taken upon him a forme of
godlinesse? God forbid. 'Tis just so here, ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>sers of the
Covenant and railers against it, are justly censured? but
withall if wickednesse and malignancy be found in any that
have taken the Covenant, their offence and censure is not to
be extenuated, but to be aggravated.</p>
            <p>I had been but very short in the handling of this Question
if new objections coming to my eares had not drawn mee
forth to this length. And now I find one objection more.
Some say, the arguments before brought from Scripture
prove not the unlawfulnesse of confederacies and associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with Idolaters. Hereticks or prophane persons of the
same Kingdom, but only with those of another Kingdome.
Answ. 1. Then by the concession of those that make the
objection, 'tis at least unlawfull to associate ourselves with
any of another Kingdome, who are of a false religion or
wicked life. 2. If familiar fellowship even with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of the same kingdom be unlawfull, then is a military
association with them unlawfull; for it cannot be without
cousulting, conferring, conversing frequently together. It
were a prophane abusing and mocknig of Scripture to say,
that we are forbidden to converse familiarly with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
of another kingdom, but not with the ungodly of the
same kingdome, or that we are forbidden to marry with the
ungodly of another kingdome, but not with the ungodly
of the same kingdome; for what is this but to open a wide
gate upon the one hand, while we seem to shut a narrow gate
upon the other hand? 3. Were not those military associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 2. and 25. 7, 8. condemned upon this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29940:18"/>
reason, because the associats were ungodly, haters of the
Lord, and because God was not with them. Now then <hi>à



quatenus ad omne.</hi> The reason holds equally against associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
with any of whom it can be truly said, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
haters of the Lord, and God is not with them. 4.
God would have the Camp of <hi>Israel</hi> altogether holy and

               </gap>: That complyance with any who have beene

of the malignant Party, a wounding of the hearts of the Godly; a in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
wronging of those who from their affection to the Covenant and Cause of
GOD, have taken their life in their hand; A great scandall to our Brethren
of <hi>England,</hi> who as they have been strengthened and encouraged by the hearing
of the zeal and integrity of the well affected in this Kingdome, and how they
opposed the late Engagement: So they would be as much scandalized to hear of
a complyance with malignants now. Yea, all that hear of it might justly stand

That it were not only a horrible backsliding, but a backsliding into that very
sin which was specially pointed at, and punished by the prevalencie of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

in as Friends, without any reall evidence or fruits of Repentance. Alas, shall we
split twise upon the same Rock, yea, run upon it, when GOD hath set a Beacon
on it; Shall we be so demented as to fall back into the same sin, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
with great letters in our late judgement; Yea, I may say, shall wee
thus out-face and out-dare the Almighty by protecting his and our enemies, when
he is persecuring them, by making Peace and friendship with them when the anger
of the LORD is burning against them, by setting them on their feet, when
GOD hath cast them down; Oh shall neither Judgements nor Deliverances
make us wise; I must here apply to our present condition, the words of <hi>Ezra.
And after all this is come upon us for our evill deels, and for our great trespasse, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

given us such deliverance as this: Should we again break thy Commandements and joyne

            <p>This Testimony of a dying Man, (who expects to stand shortly before the
Tribunall of Christ) I leave with you my Reverend Brethren, being confident
of You through the LORD, that ye will be no otherwise minded but that as
Men of GOD, moved with the zeal of GOD, You will freely discharge Your
consciences against every thing which You see listing up it self against the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the LORD JESUS: This shall be Your Peace and Comfort in Your
latter end; Now the GOD of all Grace establish You, and direct You, and
preserve You all blamelesse to the end, and bring others out of the snare that
hanker after that complyance. So prayeth,</p>

is very near, altho I have in my latter Wil
declared my minde of publick affaires, yet I
have thought good to adde this further Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
that I esteem the malignant Party in
these Kingdomes, the seed of the Serpent, enemies to Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and Presbyteriall Government, (pretend what they
will to the contrary) a generation that have not set GOD
before them. With the malignants are to be joyned the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
and scandalous, from all which, as also from heresies
and errors, the Lord I trust is about to purge his Churches.
I have often comforted my self (and still do) with the hopes
of the Lords purging this poluted Land, surely the Lord
hath begun and will cary on that great Work of mercy, and
will purge out the Rebels: I know their will be alwayes a
mixture of Hypocrites, but that cannot excuse the conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at grosse and scandalous sinners. This pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which the Lord is about, very many have directly opposed
and said by their deeds, we will not be purged nor resined,
but we will be joyning and mixing our selves with these whom
the Ministers preach against as malignant enemies to God

and his Cause. But let him that is filthy, be filthy still,
and let Wisdome be justifyed of her Children. I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to them that fear God, sadly and seriously to consider
that the holy Scripture doth plainly hold forth. 1. That the
helping of the enemies of God, or joyning and mingling
with wicked men, is a sin highly displeasing. 2. That this
sin hath ordinaryly ensnared Gods People into diverse other
sins. 3. That it hath been punished of God with grievous
judgements. 4. That utter destruction is to be feared, when
a people after great mercies and judgements relapse into this
sin,<note place="margin">This far did the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor write with His own hand, two dayes before, his death but finding his weaknesse encrease, that he was able to writ no more, he dyted that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</note>

of Jesus Christ, exhorting, and obtesting all that fear God and
make conscience of their wayes, to be very tender and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
to Watch and Pray that they be not ensnared in that great
dangerous sin of conjunction or complyncae with malignant

men will do, and trust God in his own way, they shall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in expectation of my last change,
I have thought good by this my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Will
under my hand to declare first
of all that the expectation of death which
appeareth not to be far off doth not shake
me from the Faith and Truth of Christ
which I have pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>essed and preached; neither do I doubt but
this so much opposed Covenant and Reformation of the
three Kingdomes is of God and will have a happy conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It hath pleased God who chooseth the foolish things
of this world to confound the wise, and the things that are not
to confound the things that are to imploy me (the unfittest
and unworthiest among many thousands) in the advanceing
and promoting of that glorious work; and now I repent no
forwardnesse or zeal that ever I had therein, and dare promise
to as many as wil befaithful and zealous in the Cause of God,
it shall be no grief of heart to them afterward, but matter of
joy and peace; as this day I find it, through Gods mercypas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by my many and great infirmities, &amp; approving my poor
endevours in his cause. But if there be a falling back to the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29940:21"/>
sinne of complyance with malignant ungodly men, then I
look for the breaking out of the wrath of the Lord till
there be no remedy. O that there were such a spirit at least
in such of our Nobility as stand for the Trueth that they
may take more of Gods counsell, and leane lesse to their
owne reason and understanding. As from dangers on the
other hand from Sectaries, I have been and am of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that they are to be prevented and avoided by all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
means; but that the dangers from malignants are nearest
and greatest in this Kingdome.</p>
