            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Strong is the dinn, when from within</l>
            <l>Bag-pipe lungs he plays-on.</l>
            <l>Strong is his Lip, whose Muscles skip</l>

            <l>Which tear and beat like Puss in seat,</l>
            <l>Before his words do start.</l>

            <p>THis matchless piece of Poetry falling into my hands, whether
directed by Providence or by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, I shall not distinguish; but conceiving
it to be of so much importance, in regard of the times, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to those
famous Western women, whose piety and valour deserve to be recorded amongst the
worthiest of their Sex in this declining age, and may well serve as Presidents
to others. And fearing lest some malignant spirits should have injured the
Author, in exposing an imperfect copy, by reason the sundry transcriptions
which this elaborate Poem hath much suffered in, the Author in this is rendered
according to the Original. And whereas many obscure places would have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a double construction different from the Authors true meaning, you shall find
the literal sense of those places explain'd by one that had a great insight
into the Authors fancy. And for the better encouragement for a further
progress, many Wits have presumed to lend their willing fancies, as servants to
usher into the world these elaborate Poems; and though they appear to the eye
but small lights to thy Sun, yet the reflexion from thee may in time make them
worthy to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thy Schollers; what literal errata's thou meetest with
in the printing, let thy candid disposition pass by, and let not any fault
lessen the worth of the Author, and him that is most ambitious how he may be
accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yours in all service,</p>

  you, being conscious of mine own unworthiness to deserve your knowledge: but
  returning to the shop the next morning, the Book-Seller was pleased to shew me
  the incomparable Poem, which assured me that sage out-side had a lining
  suitable; then was I enflamed with an affection too strong to be supprest,
  which hath now broke out in this address, humbly begging the happiness of your

  oblige the world by making it publick: truly Sir, the little needle of my soul
  wrought so strongly after the great Load stone of yours, that I had designed
  the same gallant subject to my thoughts long since, and intended what you have
  beyond imitation performed, in so sweet a chyme of words and sense, so rare a

            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <l>GEntlemen, (in the Authors phrase) I come to chatter</l>
            <l>My mind unto you, and think not I should flatter</l>
            <l>At all our Penman; for, believe me, he</l>
            <l>Will hardly read or hear me, willingly:</l>
            <l>But some there be, I know, will ask why here</l>
            <l>In Satans name a Prologue should appear?</l>
            <l>Since they Drammatike Ushers still were known,</l>
            <l>And this the world will for an Epic own.</l>
            <l>I answer, sure our Author meant to raise</l>
            <l>The first best instituted form of plays,</l>
            <l>To its prime height: were one Narration took</l>
            <l>The fore-top, and the toe of the whole Book.</l>
            <l>One more Objection there will be, which is,</l>
            <l>Why to so scarrifi'd a piece as this,</l>
            <l>A merry Prologue, and a laughing name,</l>
            <l>Are tender'd? Ye, fine Coxcombs, fye for shame,</l>
            <l>Know ye not yet t' what sage Mimnermus stood?</l>
            <l>That but what pleasant was nothing was good.</l>
            <l>Our Authors of his mind and no man grieves</l>
            <l>So far, but that he may laugh in his sleeves.</l>
            <l>Think then you hear him now, and think anon,</l>
            <l>How that you hear the swelling Lycophron</l>
            <l>Chaunt, how the Trojan women stirr'd their bones,</l>
            <l>To tumble down their walls huge massie stones;</l>
            <l>For ours did so, yet wiser far then those,</l>
            <l>These to repel, those to let in their foes,</l>
            <l>Oh would himself now but his face make shine,</l>
            <l>With daubing plaister, and the Lees of wine!</l>

            <l>Because his hair is short, his ears are long.</l>
            <l>Because Don <hi>Phoebus</hi> robes do loosly float,</l>

            <l>Is dropt this wonder; Sirs, pray hold your noses,</l>
            <l>Or hold some of my friends wits here for poses:</l>
