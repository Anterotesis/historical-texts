         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable
Charles Montague, Esq;. One of the Lords of the
Treasury, Chancellor of
the Exchequer; and one
of His Majesties most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Privy Council.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS soon as I had resolv'd to make
this Address to you, that the
Present might not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unworthy of you, I took care
to obtain the Consent of my Friends
to publish some Letters, which they
had writ as Answers to mine.</p>
            <p>When I look upon my self, I find
I have reason to beg pardon for my
<pb facs="tcp:59473:3"/>
Presumption: But when I consider
those Gentlemen, I am encourag'd
to hope that you will not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to find your self at the Head of
no Vulgar Company, a Company,
whose Names and Desert are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
known, a Company rais'd
far above the level of Mankind by
their own extraordinary Merit, and
yet proud to do Homage to yours.
They are Gentlemen, 'tis true, who
are divided in their Interests, and
who differ in their Politick Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but they agree in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Things, which all the
World admires, and they always
consent when they speak of you.</p>
            <p>In presenting this little <hi>Book</hi> to you,
I only design'd to shew my Zeal and
my Gratitude; but they assure me
unanimously, that I have likewise
shewn my Judgment. Tho indeed,
Sir, the number of the Great, who
<pb facs="tcp:59473:3"/>
cast a favourable Eye upon Human
Learning, is not so considerable, but
that a Man who would Address
any thing of this nature to one of
them, may soon determine his choice.
Proficients in other Arts are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by Profit, which is their main
Design, but he who bestows all his
time upon Human Studies is incited
by Glory alone, and the World takes
care that he should have no more
than he seeks for. The Enthusiast,
the Quack, the Pettifogger, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for Torturing, and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
Men; but Humanity has met
with very barbarous Usage, only for
pleasing, and for instructing them.
The very Court, which draws most
of its Ornament from it, has but too
often neglected it; there Learning
in general has been disregarded: For
none but great Souls are capable of
great Designs, and few Courtiers
<pb facs="tcp:59473:4"/>
have had Greatness of Mind enough
to procure the Promotion of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which is the Exaltation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature, and the Enlargement
of the Empire of Reason. Our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of State have formerly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themselves with so much indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
as if it would have lessen'd
them to have taken any care of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
They have shewn themselves as
perfectly unconcern'd, as if not one
had discover'd, that at a time when
our Neighbors are grown so know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Publick Safety depends on
the Progress of Learning, and that
to Patronize Science, is to take care
of the State. Besides, too many of
our States-men have been engag'd
in unjust Designs. Most of our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians
have done their endeavour
to encroach on the Crown, or to
attempt on the People. Few have
had Capacity and Integrity enough
<pb facs="tcp:59473:4"/>
to keep the Balance so steady, as to
maintain Prerogative at once, and
assert Privilege; to serve the King
Zealously, and their Country Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
to possess at the same time the
Favour of the one, and the Hearts
of the other, to such a degree as to
be courted by the People to serve as
their Representative, at the very time
that they are employ'd by the King
in Matters of the highest Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Instead of that, most of them
have had reason to be afraid of the
King or the Commons; and Men
who have been sollicitous for their
own Safety have seldom appear'd
concern'd for the good of others.
Few then have been and are in a
Condition to be Protectors of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and therefore those happy few
deserve all the Honours which we
are able to pay them. Of those, <hi>Sir,</hi>
you appear in the foremost Rank,
<pb facs="tcp:59473:5"/>
and are to the Common-wealth of
Learning what you are to the State,
a great Defence and a shining Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
You have warmly encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
all sorts of Studies, but have
been justly and nobly partial to
those, for which the State has made
no Provision: Which is enough
to gain you the Esteem of all who
have any regard for Learning, and
to win the very Souls of all who, <hi>like
me,</hi> are charm'd with the softer Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Humanity. For which your
Zeal has been so diffusive, that it
has extended it self even to me, tho'
a bare Inclination to cultivate Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and Poetry, was the only
thing which could recommend me
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ou<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Yet even this has been encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd
by the promise of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and by the Humanity of your
receiving me. The access which I
have had to you, has been the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb facs="tcp:59473:5"/>
Obligation that you could lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Man who has still valu'd Merit
above all the World, and who has
sought his Improvement more than
he has his Advancement. When I
have at any time approach'd you,
I have found in you none of those
forbidding Qualities, of which they
accuse the Great. Instead of those,
I have found an attractive and a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Greatness, the generous Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Man of Honour join'd
with the Grace and Complaisance of
the Courtier, and a Deportment no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
without Pride, and Modest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
descending. Nature has made
me something averse from making
my Court to <hi>Fortune.</hi> But I am proud
to attend upon real Greatness, and
to wait upon you since first you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
me, has been at once my
Duty and my Ambition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59473:6"/>The Permission which you gave
me to approach you, was so great an
Incitement to me, that I believe it
might have brought me to write
well if I had not a very just reason to
resolve to attempt it no more. You
had given me one great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before I had the Honour to see
you, and that was, by leaving off
Writing your self. For Vanity is a
greater Incitement to Poets than Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and even Want depresses the
Spirits less than the thought of being
surpassed. Therefore while Mr. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi>
Sung, he Sung alone. We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
indeed our Conquering Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
but we admir'd in silence. We
rever'd the Greatness of your Genius,
and neglected our Talents. Indeed
the strength and sweetness of your
Voice was fit to charm us alone, and
we who followed, were only fit for
the <hi>Chorus.</hi> But you have left a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
<pb facs="tcp:59473:6"/>
which you have made your
own, to the Adminstration of those
who are under you, and are gone
on in your victorious Progress to the
Acquisition of new Glory. From
which I am sensible that I detract
by detaining you. For your Actions
are your best Encomiums, and the
loud consent of the Nation your
best Panegyrick. It was a glorious
one that was spoken to you by the
People of <hi>Westminster</hi> in the request
that they made to you to serve as
their Member in the present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
at a time when they were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balling
all over the Kingdom, and
Gentlemen were depriving Peasants
of their little Reason, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Voices, Mr. <hi>Montague</hi>'s
Merit, while he was silent, sollicited
for him so importunately, that it
prevail'd upon a number of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Inhabitants of the Politer
<pb facs="tcp:59473:7"/>
parts of the Town, to come and
make it their humble Request to
you, to Honour them by Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, which puts me in mind
of a Saying of <hi>De la Bruiere, That the
People are then at their height of
Happiness, when their King makes
Choice for his Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>idents, and for his
Ministers, of the very same Persons that
the People would have chosen, if the
Choice had been in their power.</hi> This,
at present, is our own Case; for
doubtless the same People, who,
without any Brigue or the least Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
came voluntarily to entreat
you to suffer them to place you in
the Great Council of the Kingdom,
would, if the Choice had been in
their power, have plac'd you in the
Privy-Council; and they who frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offer'd to trust you with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of the Mony which is in their
Houses, would have trusted you,
<pb facs="tcp:59473:7"/>
had it been in their power, with
the Intendency of that in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury.
So that the Peoples proffer
to Chuse you, seems to me to be a
loud Approbation of the Choice,
which the King had made before
of you, and of your Ministration
upon that Choice. But I injure the
Publick while I detain you. Yet give
me leave to end with my Zealous
Wishes for you, that the Happiness
may be multiplied on you, which
you so nobly seek to communicate,
that you may encrease in Riches
and Honours faster than you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
in Years, till you arrive at
that height of Prosperity which
may be answerable to your high
Desert, and till Fortune may be
said to pour down her Gifts upon
you, in Emulation of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
Yet Envy after all shall be forced
to declare, that Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> sprung
<pb facs="tcp:59473:8"/>
from an Illustrious Stock, and
loaded with Plenty and Honours,
is yet nobler by Desert, than he is
by Descent, and greater by Virtue
than he is by Fortune;</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Once resolved to have a long <hi>Preface</hi> before this little
<hi>Book;</hi> but the Impression has been so long retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Fault of those who had the care of it, that
<hi>I</hi> have now neither Time nor Humour to execute what
I intended. I shall therefore only give a Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Account of what I proposed to have treated of
more at large. I designed in the first place to have
said something of the Nature and of the end of a
Letter, and thought to have prov'd that the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it was to supply Conversation, and not to
imitate it, for that nothing but the Dialogue was
capable of doing that; from whence I had drawn
this Conclusion, that the Style of a Letter was neither
to come quite up to that of Conversation, nor yet
to keep at too great a distance from it. After that,
I determined to shew that all Conversation is not
familiar; that it may be Ceremonious, that it may be
Grave, nay, that it may be Sublime, or that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
must be allow'd to be out of Nature: That if
the Sublime were easy and unconstrain'd, it might be
as consistent with the Epistolary Style, as it was with
the Didactique, that <hi>Voiture</hi> had admirably joyn'd it
with one of them, and <hi>Longinus</hi> with both. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, I resolv'd to have said something of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se
who had most succeeded in Letters amongst the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
and Moderns, and to have treated of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
and their Defects: To have spoken more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> amongst the Ancients,
and amongst the Moderns of <hi>Balzac</hi> and <hi>Voiture;</hi>
to have sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>wn that <hi>Cicero</hi> is too simple, and too dry,
and that <hi>Pliny</hi> is too affected, and too refined,
that one of them has too much of Art in him,
and that both of them have too little of Nature.
That the Elevation of <hi>Balzac</hi> was frequently forced
<pb facs="tcp:59473:9"/>
and his Sublime affected; that his Thoughts were
often above his Subject, and his Expression almost
always above his Thoughts; and that whatsoever
his Subjects were, his Style was seldom alter'd; that
<hi>Voiture</hi> was easiy and unconstrain'd, and natural
when he was most exalted, that he seldom endeavoured
to be witty at the expence of right Reason: But that
as his Thoughts were for the most part true and just,
his Expression was often defective, and that his Style
was too little diversifyed. That for my own part,
as I came infinitely short of the extraordinary Qualities
of these great Men, I thought my self obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the rather to avoid their Faults; and that
consequently I had taken all the care that I could, not
to think out of Nature and good Sense, and neither to
force nor neglect my Expression; and that I had always
taken care to suit my Style to my Subject, whether
it was Familiar or Sublime, or Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ctique; and
and that I had more or less varied it in every Letter.
All this and more I designed to have said at large;
which I have only hinted now in a hurry. I have
nothing to add but to desire the <hi>Reader</hi> to excuse my
bad Performance, upon the account of my good En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
and for striving to do well in a manner of
Writing, which is at all times useful, and at this
Time necessary; a manner in which the <hi>English</hi>
would surpass both the Ancients and Moderns, if they
would but cultivate it, for the very same Reasons that
they have surpassed them in Comedy. But methinks,
I have a Title to the <hi>Readers</hi> Favour, for I have
more than made amends for the defects of my own
Letters, by entertaining him with those of my
Friends.</p>

The Members are at present in a Grave De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

That there will be a Poll is strongly asserted,
in which every Man is to pay according to
his respective condition. To morrow it
will be known to how much each Man's
<hi>Quota</hi> amounts. As for Example; How
much a Poet is to Pay, how much a Wit,
how much a Politician, and how much a
Critick. A Critick did I say? I beg your
pardon. They have voted <hi>Nemine Contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>

dicente,</hi> that they will cess no Critick till
Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> returns.</p>
                  <p>I have given them my Sentiments upon
the fore-mentioned Poll, which were, That
it was something hard to make a Man pay
for being call'd, Wit, Poet, or Critick;
That they saw by Experience lately in the
State, that Poor Dogs grumbled to pay for
their Titles. How then could they think
that People would be contented to be Tax'd
for their Nick-Names? That in setling this
Tax they were to take a quite contrary
Method, to that which was taken upon
Setling a Tax in the State. That in the
State, sometimes a Man paid for what he
really had; As for Example, when a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Squire paid for his Land or his Money;
and sometimes for what he really had not,
as when a Cit that is twice dub'd, Knight
by the King, and Cuckold by his Wife, pays
for his Honour, and for his Children. The
first of which is but as it were his, for it
is really the Kings; and the Second of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>hich are but as it were his, for they are
really the Courtiers who help'd him to his
Title. In the State too a Man is made to
pay for something which he does, or for
something which he does not. As a <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi>
pays so much for Swearing when he's
Drunk, and so much more for not Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59473:11"/>
when he's Sober. But that in our case,
if we would be exactly Just, we should
make People pay neither for what they
have, nor for what they have not; nor for
what they do, nor for what they do not;
But should oblige them to Pay only for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to have what they really have not,
or for offering to do, what they are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incapable of doing. That thus the Tax
would certainly fall upon the most Solvent
Part of the Body. For how ridiculous
would it be to Tax a Man for having Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry
and Wit, when they are almost always
signs, that he has not a Farthing to Pay?
On the other side how absurd would it be
to Tax him for a bare want of those Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities?
since when a Man is Dull without
pretending, 'tis ten to one but he is Poor,
for Riches make Men Vain, and Vanity
makes them Affected. But he who is not
much at his Ease, is hardly at leisure for
Affectation, and I have often seen, that
when Vanity has thrown a Fop out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
necessity has brought him back again:
But a Rich Rogue will be sure to be always
pretending. Fortune takes pleasure in
making those Vain, whom Nature before
made Impotent, and both of them often
conspire to finish a Coxcomb. Thus I
would have none Pay, but they who put
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59473:12"/>
Gravity upon us for Wisdom, Visions for
Politicks, and Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ibbles for Wit; and I
would have no Man at any Expence for
being call'd a Poet, a Wit, or a Critick, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> be by himself. It would be equally
hard to lay a Tax upon any one, for his Ill
Fortune, or for his Ill Nature, since they are
things of which no Man is Master. But
what? A Sot cannot help his Vanity. Agreed.
But then it makes him so much happier
than he deserves to be, that he may well
be contented to Pay for it.</p>

                     </gap>ing to you
I may assume some Spirit, I shall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
only consider you as the Humble Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
at <hi>Cleve;</hi> Humble even in the full Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all those extraordinary Qualities, the
knowledge of which has made me Proud.
I must confess, that I have no great Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that which Men generally call Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
Humility in most Men is want of
Heat; 'tis Phlegm, 'tis Impotence, 'tis a
Wretched Necessity, of which, they who
lye under it, vainly endeavour to make a
Virtue. But in a Man of Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi>'s
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59473:13"/>
make, 'tis Choice, 'tis Force of Mind, 'tis
a Good, 'tis a Generous Condescension.
And what Force of Mind is there not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to bend back a Soul by perpetual
Reflection, which would be always Rising,
and eternally Aspiring by virtue of its in-born
Fire? Yet yours, notwithstanding all
its Power, cannot wholly depress its self,
nor descend in every part of it. At the
time that your Will vouchsafes to stoop,
your Understanding soars, your Writings
are as bold as your Converastion is Modest,
(though those are bold, as this is Modest
with Judgment) and he who would do
you Justice, must needs confess that you are
a very Ambitious Writer, though a very
Humble Man. Yet your very Ambition
has oblig'd Mankind: It has exalted Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, in raising your own by its most
noble Efforts; and that without boasting
Preheminence. And surely it must be for
this very reason that we feel a Secret Pride,
when we but read the Discoveries which
you have made. Thus I cannot say that
you are without Vanity, for never was
Man exempt from it; but I can say, that
you have made use even of Vanity to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you by way of Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>lection, and that
you have avoided that dangerous Effect of
it, Vain-Glory, the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>k upon which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>several
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59473:13"/>
great Wits before you have been
seen to split. For you have always wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considered, that Vain-Glory in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
may be Supportable, nay may be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting;
but that in great Men it must be
Intollerable. That whereas in the First
'tis want of Discernment, 'tis Folly, 'tis the
Extravagant Blindness of Self-Love; in
the Last, 'tis Crime, 'tis Malice, 'tis a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and Proud Design to Mortifie and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
over the rest of Men, over whom they
have so much advantage; That it is for
this very reason, that we so deeply resent
and so severely revenge the Mortal Affronts
we receive from it. Great Wits were by
Heaven predestin'd to rule, to rule the
Minds of others, the Noblest Empire;
but when they grow outwardly Vain they
grow Tyrants, and then their discontented
Subjects rebell, and then they depose those
Kings as Usurpers, whom before they O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd
as their Lawful Monarchs. But a
Moderate, a Good, and a Gracious Prince,
like you, commands their Hearts as well
as their Understandings, and under one
whom they love so well, they grow as
Proud, as they are pleas'd to Obey. Our
violent Inclinations make us belong to you,
and therefore 'tis the Interest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ven of our
Pride, that you should long continue in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59473:14"/>
place which your extraordinary desert has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
Did we nothing but esteem you as
much as we do, we should certainly envy you;
if we did not hate you; for bare esteem is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
forc'd upon us, whereas Inclination is
much<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> more Voluntary; Besides, as a Judicious
Frenchman observes, Esteem is Foreign, and
comes from Abroad, and is therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with Grumbling; but Inclination
is our own and born in our Breasts, and is
therefore Caress'd and Cherish'd. I might
add, that upon this account, it is hard to
wish well to those whom we very much
esteem, if they have not likewise the Skill
to make themselves be belov'd; because
barely to esteem depresses the Spirits, as
much as to love very much exalts them,
it brings the Soul to a Languid Temper,
and gives it at once too horrid Views of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
Excellencies, and of its own Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
but Affection gives it Agitation and
Warmth; and in the View of a Friend's d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
it takes too much pleasure, and too
much pride to consider its own Defects.
'Tis true, that you are esteemed at this
high rate, you owe to your Wit and your
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>enetration; but that you are esteem'd
without Envy, that you are with Joy and
Gladness esteem'd, you owe to this, that
while the force of your Fancy and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59473:14"/>
makes all the World admire you, you
remain your self unmovd by it; that while
your Excellence fills all mouths but yours,
you alone appear to be unacquainted with
it. Thus while by the Merit of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>alities, you are known to
surpass all others, it plainly appears that
you have beyond all this a Greatness of
Soul, from whence you look down on your
own Merit. An infallible s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>gn that the
Talents which we admire in you are no Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
but real things, things that were
born with you, and have been improv'd
by you, and which you have not acquir'd:
For Men are found to be Vainer, upon the
account of those Qualities which they
fondly believe they have, than of those
which they really have; and Hereditary
Greatness gives Men leave to be humble,
whereas Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>erment occasions Pride. None
but such real Greatness as yours can Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate
a Man to be truly humble; for the
Soul which by Nature is not seated High,
can hardly be said to Descend. If I have
insisted too long on this shining Subject, a
Subject which is so conspicuous in you; if
you look upon this tedious Letter, as one
of those various Persecutions which every
eminent Virtue provokes; I desire you to
consider, that I have so many obligations
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59473:15"/>
to this very Humility, that I look'd upon
my self as oblig'd by gratitude to say as
much as I have done. For to that I owe

more Humble in the Clear Air on your

                  <p>YOU have found a way to make me

me the greater Mark of yours by your kind
Letter, which I had miss'd if I had been
nearer to you: So that I, who receive no
Rents here, yet must own if I did, I cou'd
not receive greater Satisfaction than I had
from yours, worth even a Letter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
or Letters Pattents; For I value
your Friendship more than Money, and
am Prouder of your Approbation than I
should be of Titles; For the having the
good opinion of one who knows mankind
so well, argues some merit in me, upon
which every man ought to consider himself
more, than upon the goods of Fortune.

seems the Railery of a witty Man, than the
Sincerity of a Friend; and rather proves the
Copiousness of your own Invention, than
justifies the Fertility of mine. But I fear I

                  <p>NOT long after I writ my last to you,
I was hurried up to Town by a kind
of a Cholick, which has ended in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluction
upon one of my Feet. You know
Sir, a Defluction is a general name which
some pleasant Frenchmen have given an
infant Gout, too young to be yet Baptiz'd. But
thÃ´ the distemper rag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d in each hand, I
would in spight of it, answer your admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Letter, a Letter which I had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to be yours, thÃ´ it had been sent
me without a name, nay and transcrib'd by
a Chancery Cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>k in his own hideous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Copying. But I must confess I was
surpriz'd to hear you say in it, that you took
the sincerity of a man who so much esteems
you for Railery, yet thÃ´ you declare it, you
can never believe it. I am willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ve
you exceeding humble; but you
can never be humble to that Degree, unless
your Mind which resembles your Eye, in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59473:18"/>
its Clearness, its Liveliness, and in its pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Views, should be also like it in this,
that plainly discerning all things else, it
wants a sight of it self; but in this it does
not resemble it: For it beholds it self by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
and like a lovely Maid at her
Glass, is Charm'd with the sight of its own
Beauty. This is a sight in which you take
Pride as well as Pleasure; but yours I must
confess is a guiltless Pride, it being nothing
but first motion, which it is impossible for
Man to avoid. You have both the Force to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
it immediately, and the Art and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Conceal it from us. Thus it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears from what I have said, that you
do not believe I had any design to rally you.
I am confident that through all my Letter
there appears an Air of Sincerity. But
that is a Virtue which has been so long and
so peculiarly yours, that you may perhaps
be jealous of it in your Friends, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
some Virtues which they commend
in you only to Monopolise that. You had
given me, at least an occasion to think
so, if the Railery in yours had not been so
very apparent, that even I had Eyes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that you have been to blame in it, thÃ´
I am doubly blinded with Love of you and
my self. Yet if you writ it with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to Mortifie me, assure your self that I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59473:18"/>
shall fortifie my Vanity with that very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
with which you have begun to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
it. If Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi> rallies, me it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that I have my defects; but it is full
as certain, that he would never condescend
to abuse me at such a distance if he wholly
despis'd me. Thus, Sir, you see I am as
reasonable with my Friend<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as a <hi>Russian</hi>
spouse is with her Husband, and take his
very Railery for a mark of Esteem, as she
does a Beating for a proof of Affection. The
very worst of your Qualities gain our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
Even your Jealousie is very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging,
which it could never be unless it
were very groundless. But since your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Suspicion is obliging, what influence
must your kindness have on our Souls?
The wish that I were with you in some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,
is engaging to that degree, that
I almost repent that I so eagerly desir'd
your Conversation before. For if it were
possible I would augment that desire as a
grateful return to yours. To be with you
in Solitude would make me perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
ThÃ´ it were in the Orcades, I would
not wish my self remov'd to any happier
Climate; no, not even to that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
my absent Mistress; all that I could
do for her on that occasion, would be to
wish her with me. In that Retiremen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> enjoy? Where I should be
admirably instructed without trouble, and
infinitely delighted without Vice, where
I should be glorious at once with Envy and
Quiet. For what could be more glorious,
than to be the Companion of your retreat;
My very Ambition instructs me to love such
Solitude. ThÃ´ properly speaking, there
can be no Solitude where you reside. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Company still attends you, and the
Virtues, the Graces, and the Charming Nine
who love the Groves, and are fond of you,
follow you to remotest Retirements. The
comick Muse is more particularly yours;
and it is your peculiar praise to allure the
most ravishing of all the Sisters after you
into Retirement. To make that Goddess
forsake the crowd with you, who loves it
most of the Nine. You have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
her Darling, her best belov'd.
Thus in Retirement with her and you, I
should have the Conversation of Mankind;
I should enjoy it with all its Advantages,
without its least inconveniencies. In the
Philosophy of your Actions and Words, I
should see the Wise, the Good, and the
truly Great; in your observations, and in
your rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it. In the Postscript to my last, I made
an Apology for usurping a Style so Foreign
from this way of writing. I have once
more run into the same fault in this, but
the very thought of Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi> spreads
a generous warmth through me, and raises
my Soul to rapture. And when a Man
writes, his Soul and his Style of necessity
rise together. In my next I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with which I must trouble you, that
will require another manner of writing.</p>

Nature was kind in not failing to supply

amongst People with whom I have small

                  <p>I Have received yours of the 20th of
<hi>November,</hi> and am glad to find by it,
that however your Friends are losers by
your Absence from the Town, you are a
Gainer by it; of your Health, which every
one you have left behind you, (but <hi>Ch</hi>â€”)
may be thought a Friend to; and the
more each Man is your Friend, the more
he is satisfy'd with your Absence, which
thÃ´ it makes us Ill for want of you, makes
you well for want of us: your taking no
leave of me (which you would excuse) I
take to be one of the greatest Kindnesses
you ever shew'd me; for I could no more
see a Departing Friend from the Town,
than a Departing Friend from this Life; and
sure 'tis as much kindness and good breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to steal from our Friend's Society un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to 'em, (when we must leave 'em
to their Trouble) as it is to steal out of a
Room, after a Ceremonious Visit, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
trouble to him, whom we would
Oblige and Respect; so that your last Fault
(as you call it) is like the rest of your
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59473:21"/>
Faults, rather an Obligation than an Offence,
thÃ´ the greatest Injury indeed you can do
your Friends, is to leave 'em against their
Will, which you must needs do. You tell
me you converse with me in my Writings<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
I must confess then you suffer a great deal
for me in my Absence, which (thÃ´ I would
have you love me) I would not have you
do; but for your truer Diversion, pray
change my <hi>Country-Wife</hi> for a better of
your own in the Country, and exercise
your own Plain-Dealing there, then you
will make your Country Squire better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and your Parson more sincere in
in your Company than his Pulpit, or in
his Cups: But when you talk of Store of
Delights you find in my <hi>Plain-Dealer,</hi> you
cease to be one; and when you commend
my <hi>Country-Wife,</hi> you never were more a
Courtier; and I doubt not but you will like
your next Neighbour's Country Wife bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than you do mine, that you may pass
your time, better than you can do with my
<hi>Country-Wife;</hi> and like her Innocence more
than her Wit, since Innocence is the better
Bawd to Love; but enjoy my Wife and
welcome in my Absence, I shall take it as
civilly as a City Cuckold; I was sorry to
find by you that your head ak'd whilst you
writ me your Letter. Since I fear 'twas
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59473:22"/>
from reading my Works (as you call them)
not from your own Writing, which never
gave you Pain, thÃ´ it would to others to
imitate it, I've given your Service to your
Friends at the <hi>Rose,</hi> who since your absence
own they ought not to go for the Witty
Club, nor is <hi>Wills</hi> the Wits Coffee-House
any more, since you left it, whose
Society for want of yours is grown as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly,

                  <p>THE sight of your Letter reviv'd me.
It appear'd like the Rays of the New
Sun, to one who has Winter'd under the
Pole, and brought with it Light, Warmth,
and Spirit. The Raillery in it was very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging;
for the Lust of Praise is as Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
with Men, as the Itch of Enjoyment is
with Women; and it is as hard for us to
think that our Friends ridicule us when
they commend our Wit, as it is for them
to believe that their Gallants abuse them
when they extol their Beauty. Yet gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in both cases, whatever is said, is said
for the satisfaction of him that speaks it.
But then, as he delights in Deceiving, the
Person to whom he speaks is deceiv'd with
Pleasure, and both Parties are satisfied.
But Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi> is to be excepted from
this general Rule, who commends his Friend
for his Friend's sake. You never are Witty
to please your self, to whom Wit has so
long been habitual, that you are often
hardly mov'd your self when you say those
admirable things with which we are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59473:23"/>
Not that I am so far betray'd by
Vanity, as to take your Compliments at
the Foot of the Letter, or to suppose that
you believ'd all that you said; but I am
willing for your sake to believe that you
meant something of it, and that not being
without kindness for me, (which is only
owing to the Sweetness of your Nature,
that is to your Merit, and not to mine;)
your Reason, as the Duke <hi>De la Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut</hi>
says, has been bubbled by your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And here, Sir, I have much the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of you; for when I declare that I
have the greatest Opinion in the World of
you, none will mistrust my Sincerity, and
all will applaud my Discernment; but
you cannot express your Zeal at so high a
Rate for any Friend, but it must conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
lessen the World's Opinion of your
Judgment. But it is Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi>'s pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Praise, never to have shewn want
of Judgment in any thing, unless in that
only thing in which Error is Honourable.
How few are they who are capable of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at your Rate!</p>

                  <p>I Have had yours of the 31st of <hi>March,</hi>
to which I should sooner have returned
an Answer, had I not been forced to take
a little turn out of Town; but your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to me, brought me not more satisfaction
than your last to Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> gave me disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
for you. Since by that I find how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
you are. Yet know my Friend from
one sufficiently experienced in love disast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that Love is often a kind of losing
Loadam, in which the loser is most often
the gainer. If you have been deprived of
a Mistress, consider you have lost a Wife,
and thÃ´ you are disappointed of a short sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
you have likewise escaped a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
vexation, which Matrimony infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
comes to be, one way or another; so
that your Misfortune is an accident which
your true Friends should rather Felicitate
than Commiserate. You told me in your
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59473:25"/>
last, that you were no more Master of your
self. Then how should I help rejoycing
at the restoration of your Liberty? A Man
might as reasonably be sorry for his Friend's
recovery from Madness, as for his recovery
from Love, (thÃ´ for the time a pleasant
Frenzy;) so that, your Mistress's Father,
has rather been your Doctor than your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
And you should not be angry with him,
if he cures you of your love distemper, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by a means a little too violent, for next to
his Daughters cure of love, his may prove
the best; well, pray be not angry, that I
can be pleas'd with any thing that can so
much displease you. I own my Friendship
for you has a little Selfishness in it, for now
you cannot be so happy as you wou'd in the
Countrey, I hope you will make us as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

Town, where a great many Doctors have
engaged to compleat your Cure. Your Friends
will do any thing to root out the remains
of your Passion. The witty Club will grow
grave to instruct you, and the grave Club

gave me the hopes of receiving a Letter from
you, as soon as you arriv'd at <hi>Cleve.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
since that, I have been a month in
<hi>Northamptonshire.</hi> But the Inclination which
I have to converse with Mr. <hi>Wycherly,</hi> is too
violent to receive any check from Punctil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's.
But, alas, I was restrain'd by too just
an Impediment. For ever since I saw you,
I have been so rackt by a cruel Passion,
that I have had no power to do any thing
but to complain. And your portion of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
is not so small, that you have
need to be troubled with another Man's
Spleen. I would be sure to communicate
my happiness to my Friend, nay I could be
but half happy if I did not communicate it.
As in love I never could be pleas'd to a
height with my own pleasure, if I did not
find that it added to that of my Mistress.
But I should impart my ill humour to my
Friend, if I found that it were not in his
power to ease me, and that it were much
in his inclination, with as much Regret, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59473:26"/>
I should acquaint him with his own ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
if I were clearly convinc'd that it
were not in my power to assist him. You
would not advise me to stifle this passion.
You are too well acquainted with Love and
me to do that. You know that that would
be to perswade me to a thing which you
are already sensible, that I am very willing
and very unable to do. I blush while I
show this weakness, but sure there is some
force of Mind requir'd to shew some sorts
of weakness. You remember the Maxim
of the wise Duke; <hi>La memÃª fermetÃ© qui

                  <p>I Lately received from you so kind, and
so witty a Reproach for my not writing
to you, that I can hardly repent me of my
fault, since it has been the occasion of my
receiving so much satisfaction: But you have
had a reasonable excuse for your silence,
since you say I promis'd to write to you
first, which is very true; and I had kept
my promise, but for my Conjecture that
you could not stay so long out of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonshire;</hi>
nor was I it seems, mistaken in
that. But be assur'd, Dear <hi>Sir,</hi> I
think there can be no better End, or Design
of my writing, than in its procuring me
the satisfaction of receiving something of
yours; especially, since I have no other
way left me now of conversing with you.
But it seems, you forbear to relieve me out
of Charity, since you say your trouble was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59473:27"/>
so great, that you were unwilling to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
it to me to mine. I see your Wit
can do any thing, make an omission of a
kindness a greater obligation, and if you
complain but to your Mistress, as wittily
as you do to your Friend, I wonder not at
her Cruelty, nor that she should take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to hear you complain so long. But,
my Friend have a care of complaining to
her, with so much true Sense, lest it should
disparage your true Love; and indeed, that
I fear is the only cause you are suffer'd to
complain so long, without the success which
is due to your Merit, Love, and Wit, from
one who; you say has her self so much,
which with your Pardon, I shall hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
thÃ´ you are her Voucher, if she does
not do what you wou'd have her, that is,
do you and her self Reason as fast as she can;
since she must need believe you a warm and
sincere Lover, as much as I believe you a Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and a true Friend. And <hi>I</hi> am so well
acquainted with Love and you, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no body is able to alter your Love, or
advise your Reason; the one being as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
as the other infallible, and you
(for ought I know) are the only Man, who
at once can Love and be Wise. And to
the Wise, you know, a word is enough, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since you gave me a caution against
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59473:28"/>
opposing your passion; because it would be
in vain. If Love be in you as in other Men,
a violent Passion, it is therefore a short
Frenzy, and should be cur'd like other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
of that kind, by your Friend's
humouring it, rather than opposing it.
Yet pardon me, if I prescribe the common
remedy of curing one Love with another.
But whether you will let me be your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
or no, I must at least wish you well,

                  <p>A Man who has the Vanity of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to write, must certainly love
you extreamly well, if he does not hate
you after he has received from you such a
Letter as yours: And he must undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew a great deal of Friendship, when
he assures you he does not envy you the
very Lines by which you commend him.
A Man had need be very well acquainted
with the goodness of your Nature, to be
satisfied that you do not praise with a
Wicked Design to mortifie. There are few
Writers so humble, whom Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi>'s
Commendation would not render vain;
but then there are few Writers so Proud,
whom the Wit that Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi> shews in
commending them would not humble. So
that a Man who did not know you, wou'd
be apt to believe that whenever you write
to Praise, you do but like a Wrestler who
lifts People up on purpose to throw them
down, and the Higher he raises them,
makes their fall the Greater. Your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
is to a Modest Man, what the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59473:29"/>
Second Bottle is to a Sober Man; it raises
his Vigour while he is swallowing it; but
the Wit is as sure to make the one Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
upon mature Reflection, as the Wine
is certain to leave the other Spiritless after
the third Concoction: But our Infirmity
cannot be your fault; to whom we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
for your generous Intentions, which
give you such a peculiar Distinction from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Men of Wit. Indeed, by a Just,
and a Noble Confidence, which you may
repose in your self, you may always very
safely commend; because you may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
sure to surpass. 'Tis Prudent and
Noble at once in a Conqueror to extol the
Conquered. To praise the Excellence
which he o'ercomes, is but to commend
himself. Besides, it wins the very Heart
and Soul of him that is overcome, if he
has but Virtue enough to be so subdued;
and makes him willing to leave his last
Retrenchment. It would long since have
had that Effect upon me, if the rest of your
good Qualities had not prevented it; which
have so Closely and so Entirely tied me to
you, that whenever I receive a Letter from
you, my Vanity is sure to gain on the one
side, what it is certain to lose on the other:
For if I am mortified as to my own Wit, I
do not fail to value my self upon yours.</p>

inâ€”; at which, some who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

For that a Man of Wit is not qualified for
Business so well as a Block-head: I have
since had some Thoughts concerning that
matter which I here send you, and of
which I desire your Opinion.</p>
                  <p>Upon Reflection I have found out the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Reasons, why Block-heads are
thought to be fittest for Business, and why
they really succeed in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> As their Brains are a great deal
colder, than those are of Men of Wit, they
must have but very strait Imaginations,

Thoughts, those few which they have, are
determin'd by their Necessities, their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
and their Desires, to what they call
their Fortunes and their Establishments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is not very hard to conceive,
that since a Block-head has but a few
Thoughts, and perhaps but one all his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
which is his Interest, he should have
it more perfect, and better digested, then
Men of Wit have the same thought, who
perhaps have a thousand every hour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is easie to comprehend, that
since such a one has but a few thoughts, or
perhaps but one, which by often revolving
in his Mind, he has digested, and brought
to Perfection, he should readily pass from
Thought to Action. For he must grow
weary of thinking so often of one and the
same thing; and since the Nature of the
Soul requires Agitation, as soon as his little
Speculation ceases, he must of necessity
act to divert himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It will be certainly found, that
as a little Thought often makes a Man active
in Business, so a little Judgment often makes
him Diligent; for he may well be eager in
the Pursui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> of those things, on which, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by Passion and Vulgar Opinion, he
sets an exorbitant Value; and concerning
whose Natures and Incertainty he is not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59473:30"/>
very capable of making solid Reflections.
For thÃ´ Prudence may oblige a Man to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Competency, yet never was any one
by right Reason induced to seek Superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Penury of thought supposes
Littleness of Soul, which is often requisite
for the Succeeding in Business: For a Block-head
is Sordid enough to descend to Trick
and Artifice, which in Business are often
necessary to procure Success, unless they
are more than supplied, by a Prudence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from a Consummate Experience, or
from a great Capacity.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I endeavour'd to give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why a Fool succeeds better in Business
than a Man of Wit, who has a Multitude
of thoughts, and which fly at the Noblest
Objects; and who finds that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of pleasing, and so noble, in thinking
rightly, and more especially in the sublime
Speculations of exalted Reason, that he
finds it intollerably irksome to descend to
Action, and abhors the very thought of
being diligent in things, for which he has
an extream Contempt.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see, that in some measure a
Fool may be said to be better fitted out for
Business, than a Man of Wit. But it is
high time to distinguish. For first, when
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59473:31"/>
I say that a Block-head is fitted for Business,
I mean only for little Business: For to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that he is qualified for Affairs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Extent of Capacity, would be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in Terms. Secondly, when I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that a Man of Wit is less capacitated
for Business, I mean that he is less so, as
long as he keeps in his Natural Temper, and
remains in a State of Tranquility. But if
once he comes to be thrown out of that by
the Force of a Violent Passion, and fir'd
with Zeal for his Country's Service, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
by Ambition, and Business can be
made subservient to the gratifying of those
Passions, then I dare boldly affirm, that one
Man of Wit will go further than a Thousand
of those who want it. Of which it would
be easie to give more than one Instance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
our present Ministers. But I will
be contented with putting you in mind that
none of the <hi>Romans</hi> had more Wit than
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and none of the <hi>French</hi> than <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I must give you a
Caution: Which is, that by the Word
Blockhead, I do not mean one that is stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
but that I apply that word according
to the Language of you Men of Wit, to
one who thinks but a little: And that on
the other side, by a Man of Wit, I do not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59473:31"/>
mean every Coxcomb whose Imagination
has got the Ascendant of his little Reason;
but a Man like you, Sir, or our most Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Friend, in whom Fancy and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are like a well-match'd Pair; the first
like an extraordinary Wife, that appears
always Beautiful, and always Charming,
yet is at all times Decent, and at all times
Chast; the Second like a Prudent and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Husband, whose very Sway shews his
Complaisance, and whose very Indulgence
shews his Authority.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>THÃ´ no Man writes to his Friends with
greater Ease, or with more Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than my self; and thÃ´ I have lately had
the Presumption to place you at the Head
of that small Party, nevertheless I have
experienc'd with Grief, that in writing to
you I have not found my old Facility.</p>
                  <p>Since I came to this place I have taken
up my Pen several times in order to write
to you, but have constantly at the very
Beginning found my self Damp'd and Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
upon which I have been apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that extraordinary Esteem may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make the Mind as Impotent as a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Love does the Body, and that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
Desire we have to exert it, extremely
decays our Ability. I have heard of more
than one lusty Gallant, who, thÃ´ he could
at any time with Readiness and Vigour<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
possess the Woman whom he lov'd but
moderately, yet when he has been about to
give his darling Mistress, whom he has ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
and long desir'd, the first last
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59473:32"/>
Proof of his Passion, has found on a sudden
that his Body has Jaded and grown resty
under his Soul, and gone backward the
faster, the more he has spurr'd it forward.
Esteem has wrought a like effect upon my
Mind. My extraordinary inclination to
shew that I honour you at an extraordinary
rate, and to shew it in words that might
not be altogether unworthy Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s
Perusal, incapacitates me to perform the
very action to which it incites me, and
Nature sinks in me under the fierce Effort:
But I hope you will have the Goodness to
pardon a Weakness that proceds from a
Cause like this, and to consider that I had
pleas'd you more if I had honour'd you less.
Who knows but that yet I may please you,
if you encourage me to mend my Fault?
to which if you knew but the Place I am
in, Charity would engage you, thÃ´ Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
could not oblige you. For I am here
in a Desart, depriv'd of Company, and
depriv'd of News; in a Place where I can
hear nothing at all of the Publick, and
what proves it ten times more a Desart,
nothing at all of you: For all who are
at present concern'd for their Countrey's
Honour, hearken more after your Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
than those for the next Campaigne.
These last may possibly turn to our Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59473:33"/>
so uncertain are the Events of War;
but we know that whatever you undertake
must prove Glorious to <hi>England,</hi> and thÃ´
the French may meet with Success in the
Field, by you we are sure to Conquer them.
In War there are a thousand unlook'd for
accidents which happen every day, and
Fortune appears no where more like her
self; but in a Combat of Wit, the more
Humane Contention, and the more Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Quarrel, Merit will be always sure to
prevail: And therefore, thÃ´ I can but hope
that the Confederate Forces will give chase
to <hi>De Lorges</hi> and <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> I am very
confident that <hi>Boileau</hi> and <hi>Racine</hi> will be
forced to submit to you. Judge therefore
if I, who very much love my Country,
and who so much esteem you, must not
with a great deal of Impatience expect to
hear from you.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU may see already by this Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
greeting, that Encouragement
gives as much Assurance to Friendship, as
it imparts to Love. You may see too, that
a Friend may sometimes proceed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Affection, by the very same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
by which a Lover declares his Passion.
This last-at first confesses Esteem, yet owns
no Passion but Admiration. But as soon
as he is Animated by one kind Expression,
his Look, his Style, and his very Soul are
altered, But as Sovereign Beauties know
very well, that he who confesses he Esteems
and Admires them, implies that he Loves
them, or is inclin'd to Love them; a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Exalted Genius, can
discern very well, that when we esteem him
highly, 'tis Respect restrains us if we say
no more. For where great Esteem is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Affection. 'tis often attended with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
if not with Hate; which Passions De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
even when they Commend, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is their hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>est Panegyric. 'Tis indeed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59473:34"/>
impossible, that I should refuse to Love a
Man, who has so often gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>en me all the pleasure
that the most Insatiable Mind can desire;
when at any time I have been Dejected by
Disapointments, or Tormented by cruel
Passions, the recourse to your Verses has
Calm'd my Soul, or rais'd it to Transports
which made it contemn Tranquillity. But
thÃ´ you have so often given me all the
pleasure I was able to bear, I have reason
to complain of you on this account, that
you have confin'd my Delight to a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
compass. <hi>Suckling, Cowley</hi> and <hi>Denham,</hi>
who formerly Ravish'd me in ev'ry part
of them, now appear tastless to me in
most, and <hi>Waller</hi> himself, with all his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
and all that Admirable Art of his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>urns, appears three quarters Prose to me.
Thus 'tis plain that your Muse has done me
an injury; but she has made me amends for
it. For she is like those Extraordinary
Women, who, besides the Regularity of
their Charming Features, besides their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
Wit, have Secret, Unaccountable,
Enchanting Graces, which thÃ´ they have
been long and often Enjoy'd, make them
always new and always desirable. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
you my hearty thanks for your most
obliging Letter. I had been very unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
if I had Repin'd that the Favour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59473:34"/>
no sooner. 'Tis allowable to grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the delaying a payment, but to murmur
at the deferring a Benefit, is to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ungrateful beforehand. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
which you give me, exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sooth my Vanity. For you with a breath
can bestow or confirm Reputation; a whole
Numberless People Proclaims the praise
which you give, and the Judgments of
three mighty Kingdoms appear to depend
upon yours. The People gave me some
little applause before, but to whom, when
they are in humour will they not give it,
and to whom when they are froward will
they not refuse it? Reputation with them
depends upon Chance, unless they are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by those above them. They are but
the keepers as it were of the Lottery which
Fortune sets up for Renown; upon which
Fame is bound to attend with her Trumpet,
and Sound when Men draw the Prizes.
Thus I had rather have your Approbation
than the applause of Fame. Her commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
argues good luck, but Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s
implies desert. Whatever low opinion I
have hitherto had of my self, I have so great
a value for your Judgment, that, for the
sake of that, I shall be willing hence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to believe that I am not wholly desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
but that you may find me still more
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59473:35"/>
Supportable, I shall endeavour to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate
whatever I want in those glittering
Qualities, by which the World is dazled,
with Truth, with Faith, and with Zeal to
serve you; qualities which for their rarity,
might be objects of wonder, but that Men
dare not appear to admire them, because
their Admiration would manifestly declare
their want of them. Thus Sir, let me as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you, that thÃ´ you are acquainted with
several Gentlemen, whose Eloquence and
Wit may capacitate them to offer their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
with more Address to you, yet no one
can declare himself, with greater Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or with greater<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Fidelity, or with

                  </opener>
                  <p>WHen I read a Letter so full of my
Commendations as your last, I
cannot but consider you as the Master of a
vast Treasure, who having more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for your self, are forc'd to ebb out
upon your Friends. You have indeed the
best right to give them, since you have
them in Propriety; but they are no more
mine when I receive them, than the Light
of the Moon can be allowed to be her
own, who shines but by the Reflexion of
her Brother. Your own Poetry is a more
Powerful Example, to prove that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Writers may enter into comparison
with the Ancients, than any which <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault</hi>
could produce in <hi>France;</hi> yet neither
he, nor you who are a better Critick, can
persuade me that there is any room left for
a Solid Commendation at this time of day,
at least for me. If I undertake the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of <hi>Virgil,</hi> the little which I can
perform will shew at least, that no Man is
fit to write after him, in a barbarous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59473:36"/>
Tongue. Neither will his Machines
be of any service to a Christian Poet. We
see how ineffectually they have been try'd
by <hi>Tasso,</hi> and by <hi>Ariosto.</hi> 'Tis using them
too dully if we only make Devils of his
Gods: As if, for Example, I would raise
a Storm, and make use of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> with this
only difference of calling him Prince of the
Air. What invention of mine would there
be in this; or who would not see <hi>Virgil</hi>
thorough me; only the same trick play'd
over again by a Bungling Juggler? <hi>Boileau</hi>
has well observed, that it is an easie matter
in a Christian Poem, for God to bring the
Devil to reason. I think I have given a
better hint for New Machines in my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to <hi>Iuvenal;</hi> where I have particularly
recommended two Subjects, one of King
<hi>Arthur</hi>'s Conquest of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the
other of the <hi>Black Prince</hi> in his Conquest of
<hi>Spain.</hi> But the Guardian Angels of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchys and
Kingdoms, are not to be touch'd
by every hand. A Man must be deeply
conversant in the Platonick Philosophy to
deal with them: And therefore I may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
expect that no Poet of our Age
will presume to handle those Machines, for
fear of discovering his own Ignorance; or
if he should, he might perhaps be Ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enough not to own me for his Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59473:36"/>
After I have confess'd thus much of
our Modern Heroick Poetry, I cannot but
conclude with Mr. <hi>Rym</hi>â€”that our English
Comedy is far beyond any thing of the
Ancients. And notwithstanding our irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities,
so is our Tragedy. <hi>Shakespear</hi>
had a Genius for it; and we know, in spite
of Mr. <hi>R</hi>â€”that Genius alone is a greater
Virtue (if I may so call it) than all other
Qualifications put together. You see what
success this Learned Critick has found in
the World, after his Blaspheming <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spear.</hi>
Almost all the Faults which he has
discover'd are truly there; yet who will
read Mr. <hi>Rym</hi>â€”or not read <hi>Shakespear?</hi>
For my own part I reverence Mr. <hi>Rym</hi>â€”s
Learning, but I detest his Ill Nature and
his Arrogance. I indeed, and such as I,
have reason to be afraid of him, but <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spear</hi>
has not. There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

'tis that which we call Pindarique; intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
but not perfected by our Famous
Mr. <hi>Cowley:</hi> and of this, Sir, you are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
one of the greatest Masters. You
have the Sublimity of Sense as well as

reduce it either to the same Measures which
<hi>Pinder</hi> us'd, or give new Measures of your

follow the Dictates of your Reason, as I
in mine do those of my Conscience. If I
thought my self in an Error I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
it; I am sure that I suffer for them;
and <hi>Milton</hi> makes even the Devil say,

That no Creature is in love with Pain.
For my Morals, betwixt Man and Man, I
am not to be my own Judge. I appeal to
the World if I have Deceiv'd or Defrauded
any Man: And for my private Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they who see me every day can be the
best Witnesses, whether or no it be Blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Inoffensive. Hitherto I have no
reason to complain that Men of either
Party shun my Company. I have never
been an Impudent Beggar at the Doors of
Noblemen: My Visits have indeed been
too rare to be unacceptable; and but just
enough to testifie my Gratitude for their
Bounty, which I have frequently received,
but always unask'd, as themselves will
Witness. I have written more than I need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you on this Subject: for I dare say
you justifie me to your self. As for that
which I first intended for the Principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this Letter, which is my Friend's
Passion and his Design of Marriage, on
better consideration I have chang'd my
Mind: For having had the Honour to see
my Dear Friend <hi>Wycherly</hi>'s Letter to him on
that occasion, I find nothing to be added
or amended. But as well as I love Mr. <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly,</hi>
I confess I love my self so well, that
I will not shew how much I am inferiour to
him in Wit and Judgment; by undertaking
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59473:38"/>
any thing after him. There is <hi>Moses</hi> and
the Prophets in his Counsel. <hi>Iupiter</hi> and
<hi>Iuno,</hi> as the Poets tell us, made <hi>Tiresias</hi>
their Umpire, in a certain Merry Dispute,
which fell out in Heav'n betwixt them.
<hi>Tiresias</hi> you know had been of both Sexes,
and therefore was a Proper Judge; our
Friend Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi> is full as competent an
Arbitrator. He has been a Batchelor, and
Marry'd Man, and is now a Widower.
<hi>Virgil</hi> says of <hi>Ceneus,</hi>

Copy of Verses on her Beauty.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Cousin,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Received yours with the Verses inclos'd,
and here return you my hearty thanks,
for the Face, the Shape, the Meen, which
you have so generously bestow'd upon me.
From looking upon your Verses I went to
my Glass. But, Jesu! The difference! ThÃ´
I bought it to Flatter me, yet Compar'd
to you, I found it a Plain-Dealer. It show'd
me immediately that I have been a great
deal more beholding to you, than I have
been to Nature. For she only form'd me
not Frightful, but you have made me Divine.
But as you have been a great dealkinder than
Nature has been to me, I think my self o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
in Requital, to be a good deal more
Liberal than Heav'n has been to you, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59473:39"/>
to allow you as large a Stock of Wit as you
have giv'n me of Beauty. Since so Honest
a Gentleman as your self, has Stretcht his
Conscience to commend my Person, I am
bound in Gratitude to do Violence to my
Reason, to Extol your Verses. When I left
the Town, I desir'd you to furnish me
with the News of the Place, and the
first thing I have receiv'd from you, is
a Copy of Verses on my Beauty. By which you
Dext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rously infer, that the most extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
piece of News you can send me, is
to tell me that I am Hansome. By which
ingenious Inference, you had Infallibly
brought the Scandal of a Wit upon you,
if your Verses had not stood up in your
Justification. But tell me truly Cousin,
could you think that I should prove so easy
a Creature as to believe all that you have
said of me? How could you find in your
heart to make such a Fool of me, and such
a Cheat of your self? To Intoxicate me
with Flattery, and draw me in to Truck
my little Stock of Wit and Judgment, for
a meer Imagination of Beauty; when the
Real thing too, falls so infinitely short of
what you would make me exchange for the
very Fancy of it. For, Cousin, there
is this considerable Difference between
the Merit of Wit and Beauty; that Men
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59473:39"/>
are never Violently Influenc'd by Beauty,
unless it has weaken'd their Reason. And
never feel half the force of Wit, unless their
Judgments are Sound. The principal time
in which those of your Sex admire Beauty
in ours, is between Seventeen and Thirty,
that is, after they are past their Innocence,
and before they are come to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And now Cousin, have not you
been Commending a pretty Quality in me,
to Admire which, as I have just shewn you,
supposes not only a Corrupted Will, but a
raw Understanding. Besides, how Frail,
how Transitory is it! Nature deprives us
of it at Thirty, if Diseases spare it till then.
By which constant proceeding, she seems
to Imply, that she gives it us as a <hi>Gugaw</hi> to
please us in the Childhood of our Reasons;
and takes it from us as a thing below us,
when we come to years of Discretion. Thus
Cousin, have you been commending a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in me, which has nothing of true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in it, and of which I have no greater
a share, than to keep me from being scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.
So that all I could have got by
your kindness, if I had parted with my
Judgment, in order to reap the benefit of
it, had been nothing but wretched Conceit,
and ridiculous Affectation. If I thought
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59473:40"/>
you had enough of the Gallant Man in you,
to take what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>say in good part, I would
advise you to engage no further in Poetry.
Be rul'd by a Woman for once, and mind
your <hi>Cook upon Littleton.</hi> Rather Pettifog
than Flatter. For if you are resolved to
be a Cheat, you will show at least some
Conscience, in resolving rather to chouse
People of their Money, than to Bubbl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
them of their Understandings. Besides,
Cousin, you have not a Genius which
will make a great Poet, and be pleased to
consider, that a small Poet is a scandalous
Wight, that indifferent Verses are very
bad ones, and that an Insipid Panegyric
upon another is a severe Libel upon your
self. Besides, there will start up a Satyr
one day, and then woe be to Cold Rimers.
Old <hi>England</hi> is not yet so Barren, but there
will arise some generous Spirit, who, besides
a Stock of Wit and good Sense, which
are no very common Qualities, will not
only be furnished with a sound Judgment,
which is an Extraordinary Talent; but
with a true tast for Eloquence and Wit,
which is scarce any where to be found,
and which Comprehends not only a just
Discernment, but a fine Penetration, and
a delicate Criticism. Such a Satyrist as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59473:40"/>
this, Cousin, must arise, and therefore you
had best take care, by a Judicious Silence,
that whenever he appears, he may be sure
to divert you, and not afflict you.</p>

                  <p>I Received your Panegyrick upon Pun's<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
which I<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> so approve of, that I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to get it Printed, and bound up with
<hi>Erasmus</hi> his praise of Folly. Yet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
a Truth, I was something dissatisfied to
see Quibbling commended with so much
Wit. For nothing can be writ with more
Wit, than your Letter to the Reserve of the
Quibbles; which I suppose you inserted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
so many things which are so finely
said, lest these should have render'd you
too Vain, or too much have Mortify'd me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
But pray, after this Panegyrick upon Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
give me leave to ask you the same
Question that the Lacedemonians ask'd the
Sophister, who harangu'd in the Praise of
<hi>Hercules.</hi> By the way, did you ever expect
to hear a Quibble compar'd to <hi>Hercules?</hi>
There's a Simile for you. I think, as <hi>Novel</hi>
says, that's New. You, who are cry'd up
for so great a Wit, tell me, without Envy,
could you ever have thought upon that?
But to return to my Question. Here you
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59473:41"/>
have spent a great deal of time in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Quibbles. Who said a Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them? The Devil a Syllable did I
mention of them in mine. It is true, I cited
honest Mr. <hi>Sw</hi>â€”but it is a hard Case, if
the Quoting an Author must be construed
the Condemning his Works. I have a great
Respect and Kindness for Mr. <hi>Sw</hi>â€”as I
have for all who have any Excellence. And
truly, I think that for the Management of
Quibbles and Dice, there is no Man alive
comes near him. And let me tell you, Sir,
for all your new Emulation, he is a better
Quibbler than you. But it is high time to
give over Rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>lery: For if you were my
Father a Thousand times, let me die if I
would not rigorously examine that part of
your Letter which pretends to defend Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
You say that I am too Nice, and
that my Aversion has something it in, that is
very like Affectation: But here you must
give me leave to turn your own Simile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you. Can a Man be justly accus'd of
Niceness or Affectation, because he appears
offended at a Stink? When I tell you that
Quibbling is extreamly Foolish; You know
it is Foolish enough, you reply; but it is
a Foolish thing that diverts. And do you
think this knowledge of it will excuse the
Folly? Give me leave to resume the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59473:42"/>
Simile. Suppose a Fellow who
breaks Wind, should say to the Company,
while they are cajoling their offended Noses
with Snuff, Look you Gentlemen, I know

Nasty, but Begad it is very Diverting<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

out of thy own Mouth, thou shalt not be
Judged: For if a Quibble is not Wit, it is
nothing. But it is at as great a Distance
from Wit, as an Idol is from the Deity;
and I will no more believe nauseous Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocals
to be Wit, because some Sots have
admir'd them, than I will believe Garlick
to be God, because the Aegyptians ador'd
it. Nay, it is a more Damnable sign of
Stupidity in an Englishman, to make Wit
of a Quibble, than it was in the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
to make a God of their Garlick. But
to return from whence I digressed; I have
never appear'd so much a Stoick, but that
I have been as much for Diversion as any of
you. But then am I for the Diversion of
Reasonable Men and of Gentlemen. If
there be any Diversion in Quibbling, it is
a Diversion of which a Fool and a Porter
is as capable as is the best of you. And
therefore <hi>Ben. Iohnson,</hi> who writ every
thing with Judgment, and who knew the
Scum of the People, whenever he brings
in a Porter or Tankard-Bearer, is sure to
introduce him Quibbling. But if Punning
be a Diversion, it is a very strange one.
There is as much difference between the
silly Satisfaction which we have from a
Quibble, and the ravishing Pleasure which
we receive from a Beautiful Thought, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59473:43"/>
there is betwixt a Faint Salute and Fruition.
But what would you have us do, you cry.
Men of the greatest Parts are no more to be
found with Wit always about them, than
rich Rogues with always the Ready.
Why, look you, Sir, as the first Step to
Wisdom is to be freed from Folly, so the
first Approach to Wit is a Contempt of
Quibbling. If it happens at any time
that you have not your Wit about you, we
will either have Patience such time as you
have, or take good sense in the lieu of it;
If you are not in a Condition to Delight us,
we will be contented to be instructed; we
will make your Instruction nourish our
Vanity, so turn even that to Delight. Nay
there is something Noble in right Reason,
and consequently something Delightful.
Truth is so divinely Beautiful, that it must
please Eternally; but falshood is base, and
must shock all generous Minds, and every
Equivocal is but ambiguous Falshood,
that is the Pittiful'st, the Bafest of Falshoods.</p>

However, before they were come to Blows<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

You remember the terrible News
that we heard at <hi>P</hi>â€”which, as it sprung
from a ridiculous Occasion, that is, my
Lady Mayoresses Gossipping, has had a
Comical Consequence. For the Common-Council
have made an Order, by which
my Lady Mayoress is dispens'd during the
Wars, from seeing those Children born in
the City, which are got in the Suburbs;
that is from being present at one of their
Wive's Labours. But 'tis time to return
to the Fair. Last Night I took a turn in
the Cloisters, where I was entertain'd with
a great many Dialogues between Vizour
and Vallancy Wig, upon which I leave
you to be Judge, whether my Eyes or my
Ears were the better Entertain'd of the
two. For I heard a great deal of Unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
Language, address'd to a great many
Invisible Faces. As if because the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had resolv'd not to be Seen, the
Men had determin'd not to be Understood;
and had in revenge Eclips'd the Light of
their Understanding by Fustian, as the
others had obscur'd the Lustre of their Eyes
by Velvet. Formerly the Ladies made
use of White and Red to atract, but
within these Thirty Years black has suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
and the Devil is found more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59473:45"/>
tempting in his proper Colour. I have
neither time nor place for any more. You
shall have the rest by the first Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have now read over the Fox, in which thÃ´
I admire the strength of <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi>'s
Judgment, yet I did not find it so accurate
as I expected. For first the very thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the whole Plot turns, and that is
the Discovery which <hi>Mosca</hi> makes to <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio;</hi>
seems to me, to be very unreasonable.
For <hi>I</hi> can see no Reason, why he should
make that Discovery which introduces <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norio</hi>
into his Masters House. For the
Reason which the Poet makes <hi>Mosca</hi> give
in the Ninth Scene of the third Act, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be a very Absurd one. Secondly,
<hi>Corbaccio</hi> the Father of <hi>Bonario</hi> is expos'd
for his Deafness, a Personal defect; which
is contrary to the end of Comedy Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For Personal Defects cannot be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the exposing such, can never
Divert any but half-witted Men. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail to bring a thinking Man to reflect
upon the Misery of Human Nature; and
into what he may fall himself without any
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59473:46"/>
fault of his own. Thirdly, the play has two
Characters, which have nothing to do with
the design of it, which are to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as Excrescencies. Lastly, the Character
of <hi>Volpone</hi> is Inconsistent with it self. <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone</hi>
is like <hi>Catiline, alieni appetens, sui pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusus;</hi>
but that is only a double in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not an Inconsistence. The Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of the Character appears in this,
that <hi>Volpone</hi> in the fifth Act behaves himself
like a Giddy Coxcombe, in the Conduct of
that very Affair which he manag'd so Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
in the first four. In which the Poet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
first against that Fam'd rule which
<hi>Horace</hi> gives for the Characters.</p>
                  <l>Servetur ad imum,</l>
                  <l>Qualis ab incepto processerit, et sibi constet.</l>
                  <p>And Secondly, against Nature, upon
which, all the rules are grounded. For so
strange an Alteration, in so little a time, is
not in Nature, unless it happens by the
Accident of some violent passion; which
is not the case here. <hi>Volpone</hi> on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
behaves himself without common Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
in the Conduct of that very Affair
which he had manag'd with so much Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
for the space of three Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For why does he disguise himself?
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59473:46"/>
or why does he repose the last Confidence in
<hi>Mosca?</hi> Why does he cause it to be given
out that he's Dead? Why, only to Plague
his Bubbles. To Plague them, for what?
Why only for having been his Bubbles.
So that here is the greatest alteration in the
World, in the space of twenty-four hours,
without any apparent cause. The design
of <hi>Volpone</hi> is to Cheat, he has carried on
a Cheat for three years together, with Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and with Success. And yet he on a
sudden in cold blood does a thing, which
he cannot but know must Endanger the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining
all.</p>

                  <p>I will not augment the Trouble which I
give you by making an Apology for
not giving it you sooner. ThÃ´ I am hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
sorry that I kept such a trifle as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd,
and a trifle writ Extempore, long
enough to make you expect a labour'd Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But because in the Inclos'd, I have
spoken particularly of <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi>'s Fox,
I desire to say three or four words of some
of his Plays more generally. The Plots of
the Fox, the silent Woman, the Alchimist, are
all of them very Artful. But the Intrigues of the
Fox, and the Alchimist, seem to me to be
more dexterously perplexed, than to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
disentangled. But the Gordian knot
in the Silent Woman is untyed with so
much Felicity, that that alone, may Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to show <hi>Ben Iohnson</hi> no ordinary Heroe.
But, then perhaps, the Silent Woman may
want the very Foundation of a good Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which the other two cannot be said
to want. For it seems to me, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59473:47"/>
a Moral. Upon which Absurdity, <hi>Ben
Iohnson</hi> was driven by the Singularity of
<hi>Moroses</hi> Character, which is too extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
for Instruction, and fit, in my opinion,
only for Farce. For this seems to me, to
Constitute the most Essential Difference,
betwixt Farce and Comedy, that the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
which are expos'd in Farce are Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and those are particular, which are
expos'd in Comedy. These last are those,
with which some part of an Audience may
be suppos'd Infected, and to which all may
be suppos'd Obnoxious. But the first are
so very odd, that by Reason of their Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Extravagance, they cannot be thought
to concern an Audience; and cannot be
supposed to instruct them. For the rest of
the Characters in these Plays, they are for
the most part true, and Most of the Humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Characters Master-pieces. For <hi>Ben
Iohnson</hi>'s Fools, seem to shew his Wit a
great deal more then his Men of Sense.
I Admire his Fops, and but barely Esteem his
Gentlemen. <hi>Ben</hi> seems to draw Deformity
more to the Life than Beauty. He is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ten
so eager to pursue Folly, that he forgets to
take Wit along with him. For the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
it seems to want very often that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that Grace, and that Noble Railery,
which are to be found in more Modern Plays,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59473:48"/>
and which are Virtues that ought to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
from a finish'd Comedy. But
there seems to be one thing more wanting
than all the rest, and that is Passion, I mean
that fine and that delicate Passion, by which
the Soul shows its Politeness, ev'n in the midst
of its trouble. Now to touch a Passion is
the surest way to Delight. For nothing agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
like it. Agitation is the Health and
Joy of the Soul, of which it is so entirely
fond, that even then, when we imagine we
seek Repose, we only seek Agitation. You
know what a Famous Modern Critick has
said of Comedy.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU write to me, that you have En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
your self two or three days,
with reading several Comedies, of several
Authors; and your Observation is, that
there is more of <hi>Humour</hi> in our English
Writers, than in any of the other Comick
Poets, Ancient or Modern. You desire to
know my Opinion, and at the same time
my Thought; of that which is generally
call'd <hi>Humour</hi> in Comedy.</p>
                  <p>I agree with you, in an Impartial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of our English Writers, in that
Particular. But if I tell you my Thoughts
of <hi>Humour,</hi> I must at the same time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that what I take for true <hi>Humour,</hi> has
not been so often written even by them, as
is generally believed: And some who have
valued themselves, and have been esteem'd by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59473:49"/>
others, for that kind of Writing, have seldom
touch'd upon it. To make this appear to
the World, would require a long and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
Discourse, and such as I neither am
able nor willing to undertake. But such
little Remarks, as may be continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Compass of a Letter, and such unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated
Thoughts, as may be Communicated
between Friend and Friend, without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Censure of the World, or setting
up for a <hi>Dictator,</hi> you shall have from me,
since you have enjoyn'd it.</p>
                  <p>To Define <hi>Humour,</hi> perhaps, were as
difficult, as to Define <hi>Wit;</hi> for like that,
it is of infinite variety. To Enumerate the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Humours</hi> of Men, were a Work as
endless, as to sum up their several Opinions.
And in my mind the <hi>Quot homines tot Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae,</hi>
might have been more properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
of <hi>Humour;</hi> since there are many
Men, of the same Opinion in many things,
who are yet quite different in Humours.
But thÃ´ we cannot certainly tell what <hi>Wit</hi>
is, or, what <hi>Humour,</hi> is yet we may go
near to shew something, which is not <hi>Wit</hi>
or not <hi>Humour;</hi> and yet often mistaken for
both. And since I have mentioned <hi>Wit</hi> and
<hi>Humour</hi> together, let me make the first
Distinction between them, and observe to
you that <hi>Wit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> often mistaken for Humour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59473:50"/>I have observed, that when a few things
have been Wittily and Pleasantly spoken
by any Character in a Comedy; it has
been very usual for those, who make their
Remarks on a Play, while it is acting, to say,
<hi>Such a thing is very Humorously spoken:
There is a great Deal of Humour in that
Part.</hi> Thus the Character of the Person
speaking, may be, Surprizingly and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly,
is mistaken for a Character of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;</hi>
which indeed is a Character of <hi>Wit.</hi>
But there is a great Difference between a
Comedy, wherein there are many things
<hi>Humorously,</hi> as they call it, which is <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly</hi>
spoken; and one, where there are
several Characters of <hi>Humour,</hi> distinguish'd
by the Particular and Different Humours,
appropriated to the several Persons repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
and which naturally arise, from
the different Constitutions, Complexions,
and Dispositions of Men. The saying of
Humorous Things, does not distinguish
Characters; For every Person in a Comedy
may be allow'd to speak them. From a
Witty Man they are expected; and even a
<hi>Fool</hi> may be permitted to stumble on 'em
by chance. ThÃ´ I make a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Humour;</hi> yet I do not think
that Humorous Characters exclude Wit:
No, but the Manner of <hi>Wit</hi> should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59473:50"/>
to the <hi>Humour.</hi> As for Instance,
a Character of a Splenetick and Peevish
<hi>Humour,</hi> should have a Satyrical Wit. A
Jolly and Sanguine <hi>Humour,</hi> should have a
Facetious Wit. The Former should speak
Positively; the Latter, Carelesly: For the
former Observes, and shews things as they
are; the latter, rather overlooks Nature,
and speaks things as he would have them;
and his <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Humour</hi> have both of them
a less Alloy of Judgment than the others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As</hi> Wit, <hi>so, its opposite,</hi> Folly, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
mistaken for Humour.</p>
                  <p>When a Poet brings a <hi>Character</hi> on the
Stage, committing a thousand Absurdities,
and talking Impertinencies, roaring Aloud,
and Laughing immoderately, on every, or
rather upon no occasion; this is a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of Humour.</p>
                  <p>Is any thing more common, than to
have a pretended Comedy, stuff'd with such
Grotesques, Figures, and Farce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ools?
Things, that either are not in Nature, or
if they are, are Monsters, and Births of
Mischance; and consequently as such, should
be stifled, and huddled out of the way,
like <hi>Sooterkins;</hi> that Mankind may not be
shock'd wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>h an appearing Possibility of
the Degeneration of a God-like <hi>Species<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi>
For my part, I am as willing to Laugh<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59473:51"/>
any body, and as easily diverted with an
Object truly ridiculous: but at the same
time, I can never care for seeing things,
that force me to entertain low thoughts of
my Nature. I dont know how it is with
others, but I confess freely to you, I could
never look long upon a Monkey, without
very Mortifying Reflections; thÃ´ I never
heard any thing to the Contrary, why that
Creature is not Originally of a Distinct <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
As I dont think <hi>Humour</hi> exclusive of
<hi>Wit,</hi> neither do I think it inconsistent
with <hi>Folly;</hi> but I think the Follies should
be only such, as Mens Humours may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
'em to; and not Follies intirely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
from both Humour and Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sometimes,</hi> Personal Defects are misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
for Humours.</p>
                  <p>I mean, sometimes Characters are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously
exposed on the Stage, ridiculing
Natural Deformities, Casual Defects in the
Senses, and Infirmities of Age. Sure the Poet
must both be very Ill-natur'd himself, and
think his Audience so, when he proposes
by shewing a Man Deform'd, or Deaf, or
Blind, to give them an agreeable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment;
and hopes to raise their Mirth,
by what is truly an object of Compassion.
But much need not be said upon this Head
to any body, especially to you, who in one
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59473:51"/>
of your Letters to me concerning Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s
<hi>Fox,</hi> have justly excepted against
this Immoral part of <hi>Ridicule</hi> in <hi>Corbaccio</hi>'s
Character; and there I must agree with
you to blame him, whom otherwise I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enough admire, for his great Mastery
of true Humour in Comedy.</p>
                  <p>External Habit of Body is often mistaken
for Humour.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>External Habit,</hi> I do not mean the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Dress or Cloathing of a Character,
thÃ´ that goes a good way in some received
Characters. (But undoubtedly a Man's
Humour may incline him to dress different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from other People) But I mean a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of Manners, Speech, and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
peculiar to all, or most of the same
Country, Trade, Profession, or Education.
I cannot think, that a <hi>Humour,</hi> which is
only a Habit, or Disposition contracted by
Use or Custom; for by a Disuse, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with other Customs, it may be
worn off, or diversify'd.</p>
                  <p>Affectation is generally mistaken for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>These are indeed so much alike, that at
a Distance, they may be mistaken one for
the other. For what is <hi>Humou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> in one, may
be <hi>Affectation</hi> in another; and nothing is more
common, than for some to affect particular
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59473:52"/>
ways of saying, and doing things, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to others, whom they admire and would
imitate. <hi>Humour</hi> is the Life, <hi>Affectation</hi>
the Picture. He that draws a Character of
<hi>Affectation,</hi> shews <hi>Humour</hi> at the Second
Hand; he at best but publishes a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and his Pictures are but Copies.</p>
                  <p>But as these two last distinctions are the
Nicest, so it may be most proper to Explain

                        </gap>e</hi> in the <hi>Silent
Woman,</hi> I take to be a Character of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
And I choose to Instance this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59473:52"/>
to you, from many others of the
same Author, because I know it has been
Condemn'd by many as Unnatural and
Farce: And you have your self hinted some
dislike of it, for the same Reason, in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to me, concerning some of <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s
Plays.</p>
                  <p>Let us suppose <hi>Morose</hi> to be a Man Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Splenetick and Melancholly; is there
any thing more offensive to one of such a
Disposition, than Noise and Clamour? Let
any Man that has the Spleen (and there are
enough in <hi>England)</hi> be Judge. We see
common Examples of this Humour in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
every day. 'Tis ten to one, but three
parts in four of the Company that you
dine with, are Discompos'd and Startled
at the Cutting of a Cork, or Scratching a
Plate with a Knife: It is a Proportion of
the same Humour, that makes such or any
other Noise offensive to the Person that hears
it; for there are others who will not be
disturb'd at all by it. Well; But <hi>Morose</hi>
you will say, is so Extravagant, he cannot
bear any Discourse or Conversation, above
a Whisper. Why, It is his excess of this
Humour, that makes him become Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and qualifies his Character for Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
If the Poet had given him, but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
proportion of that Humour, 'tis odds
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59473:53"/>
but half the Audience, would have sided
with the Character, and have Condemn'd
the Author, for Exposing a Humour which
was neither Remarkable nor Ridiculous.
Besides, the distance of the Stage requires
the Figure represented, to be something
larger than the Life; and sure a Picture may
have Features larger in Proportion, and yet
be very like the Original. If this Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Quantity, were to be observed in
Wit, as some would have it in Humour;
what would become of those Characters
that are design'd for Men of Wit? I believe
if a Poet should steal a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>alogue of any
length, from the <hi>Extempo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

two Wittiest Men upon Earth, he would
find the Scene but coldly receiv'd by the
Town. But to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>The Character of Sir <hi>Iohn Daw</hi> in the
same Play, is a Character of Affectation.
He every where discovers an Affectation of
Learning; when he is not only Conscious
to himself, but the Audience also plainly
perceives that he is Ignorant. Of this kind
are the Characters of <hi>Thraso</hi> in the Eunuch
of <hi>Terence,</hi> and <hi>Py<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>

                        </gap>tus.</hi> They affect to be
thought Valiant, when both themselves and
the Audience know they are not. Now
such a boasting of Valour in Men who were
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59473:53"/>
really Valiant, would undoubtedly be a
<hi>Humour;</hi> for a Fiery Disposition might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
throw a Man into the same Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance,
which is only affected in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
I have mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The Character of <hi>Cob</hi> in <hi>Every Man in his
Humour,</hi> and most of the under Characters
in <hi>Bartholomew-Fair,</hi> discover only a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of Manners, appropriated to
the several Educations and Professions of
the Persons represented. They are not Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
but Habits contracted by Custom.
Under this Head may be ranged all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Clowns,
Sailers, Tradesmen, Jockeys,
Gamesters and such like, who make use of
<hi>Cants</hi> or peculiar <hi>Dialects</hi> in their several
Arts and Vocations. One may almost give
a Receipt for the Composition of such a
Character: For the Poet has nothing to do,
but to collect a few proper Phrases and terms
of Art, and to make the Person apply them
by ridiculous Metaphors in his Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with Characters of different Natures.
Some late Characters of this kind have been
very successful; but in my mind they may
be Painted without much Art or Labour;
since they require little more, than a good
Memory and Superficial Observation. But
true <hi>Humour</hi> cannot be shewn, without a
Dissection of Nature, and a Narrow Search,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59473:54"/>
to discover the first Seeds, from whenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
it has its Root and growth.</p>
                  <p>If I were to write to the World, I should
be obliged to dwell longer, upon each of
these Distinctions and Examples; for I
know that they would not be plain enough
to all Readers. But a bare hint is sufficient
to inform you of the Notions which I have
on this Subject: And I hope by this time you
are of my Opinion, that Humour is neither
Wit, nor Folly, nor Personal defect; nor Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,
nor Habit; and yet, that each,
and all of these, have been both writte
and received for Humour.</p>
                  <p>I should be unwilling to venture even
on a bare Description of Humour, much
more, to make a Definition of it, but now
my hand is in, Ile tell you what serves me
instead of either. I take it to be, <hi>A singular
and unavoidable manner of doing, or saying
any thing, Peculiar and Natural to one Man
only; by which his Speech and Actions are
distinguish'd from those of other Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Humour</hi> has relation to us, and to
what proceeds from us, as the Accidents
have to a Substance; it is a Colour, Taste,
and Smell, Diffused through all; thÃ´ our
Actions are never so many, and different
in Form, they are all Splinters of the same
Wood, and have Naturally one Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59473:54"/>
which thÃ´ it may be disguised by Art,
yet cannot be wholly changed: We may
Paint it with other Colours, but we cannot
change the Grain. So the Natural sound
of an Instrument will be distinguish'd, thÃ´
the Notes expressed by it, are never so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and the Divisions never so many.
Dissimulation, may by Degrees, become
more easy to our practice; but it can never
absolutely Transubstantiate us into what
we would seem: It will always be in some
proportion a Violence upon Nature.</p>
                  <p>A Man may change his Opinion, but
I believe he will find it a Difficulty, to part
with his <hi>Humour,</hi> and there is nothing more
provoking, than the being made sensible
of that difficulty. Sometimes, one shall
meet with those, who perhaps, Innocently
enough, but at the same time imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
will ask the Question; <hi>Why are you
not Merry? Why are you not Gay, Pleasant,
and Cheerful?</hi> then instead of answering,
could I ask such one; <hi>Why are you not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some?
Why have you not Black Eyes, and a
better Complexion?</hi> Nature abhors to be
forced.</p>
                  <p>The two Famous Philosophers of <hi>Ephesus</hi>
and <hi>Abdera,</hi> have their different Sects at
this day. Some Weep, and others Laugh
at one and the same thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59473:55"/>I dont doubt, but you have observed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

more or less in one than t'other; but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is the <hi>Humour</hi> of the Man that is Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant,
and urges him to express it in that
manner. Demonstrations of pleasure are
as Various; one Man has a Humour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
from all Company, when any thing
has happen'd to please him beyond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation;
he hugs himself alone, and think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>

                     </gap>cret.
Another is upon Thorns till he has
made Proclamation of it; and must make
other people sensible of his happiness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can be so himself. So it is in Grief<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and other Passions. Demonstrations of Lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
and the Effects of that Passion upon several
Humours, are infinitely different; but here
the Ladies who abound in Servants are the
best Judges. Talking of the Ladies, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
something should be observed of the
Humour of the Fair Sex; since they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so kind as to furnish out a Character for
Comedy. But I must confess I have never
made any observation of what I Apprehend
to be true Humour in Women. Perhaps
Passions are too powerful in that Sex, to let
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59473:55"/>
Humour have its Course; or may be by
Reason of their Natural Coldness, Humour
cannot Exert it self to that extravagant
Degree, which it often does in the Male Sex.
For if ever any thing does appear Comical
or Ridiculous in a Woman, I think it is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more than an acquir'd Folly, or an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.
We may call them the weaker
Sex, but I think the true Reason is, because
our Follies are Sronger, and our Faults are
more prevailing.</p>
                  <p>One might think that the Diversity of
Humour, which must be allowed to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
throughout Mankind, might afford
endless matter, for the support of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
But when we come closely to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that point, and nicely to distinguish the
Difference of Humours, I believe we shall
find the contrary. For thÃ´ we allow eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man something of his own, and a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Humour; yet every Man has it not in
quantity, to become Remarkable by it:
Or, if many do become Remarkable by
their Humours; yet all those Humours may
not be Diverting. Nor is it only requisite
to distinguish what Humour will be diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but also how much of it, what part
of it to shew in Light, and what to cast in
Shades; how to set it off by preparatory
Scenes, and by opposing other humours to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59473:56"/>
it in the same Scene. ThrÃ´ a wrong Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
sometimes, Mens Humours may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
when there is really no specific Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them; only a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the same, in one than t'other;
occasion'd by his having more Flegm, or
Choller, or whatever the Constitution is,
from, whence their Humours derive their
Source.</p>
                  <p>There is infinitely more to be said on this
Subject; thÃ´ perhaps I have already said
to much; but I have said it to a Friend, who
I am sure will not expose it, if he does not
approve of it. I believe the Subject is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
new, and was never touch'd upon
before; and if I would have any one to see
this private Essay, it should be some one,
who might be provoked by my Errors in it,
to Publish a more Judicious Treatise on the
Subject. Indeed I wish it were done, that
the World being a little acquainted with the
scarcity of true Humour, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of finding and shewing it, might look
a little more favourably on the Labours of
them, who endeavour to search into Nature
for it, and lay it open to the Publick View.</p>
                  <p>I dont say but that very entertaining and
useful Characters, and proper for Comedy,
may be drawn from Affectations, and those
other Qualities, which I have endeavoured to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59473:56"/>
distinguish from Humour: but I would not
have such imposed on the World, for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
nor esteem'd of Equal value with
it. It were perhaps, the Work of a long
Life to make one Comedy true in all its
Parts, and to give every Character in it a
True and Distinct Humour. Therefore,
every Poet must be beholding to other helps,
to make out his Number of ridiculous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.
But I think such a One deserves
to be broke, who makes all false Musters;
who does not shew one true Humour in a
Comedy, but entertains his Audience to the
end of the Play with every thing out of
Nature.</p>
                  <p>I will make but one Observation to you
more, and have done; and that is grounded
upon an Observation of your own, and
which I mention'd at the beginning of my
Letter, <hi>viz,</hi> That there is more of Humour
in our English Comick Writers than in any
others. I do not at all wonder at it, for I
look upon Humour to be almost of English
Growth; at least, it does not seem to have
found such Encrease on any other Soil.
And what appears to me to be the reason
of it, is the great Freedom, Privilege, and
Liberty which the Common People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
enjoy. Any Man that has a Humour,
is under no restraint, or fear of giving it
Vent; they have a Proverb among them,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59473:57"/>
which, may be, will shew the Bent and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of the People, as well as a longer
Discourse: <hi>He that will have a May-pole,
shall have a May-pole.</hi> This is a Maxim
with them, and their Practice is agreeable
to it. I believe something Considerable
too may be ascribed to their feeding so
much on Flesh, and the Grossness of their
Diet in general. But I have done, let the
Physicians agree that. Thus you have my
Thoughts of <hi>Humour,</hi> to my Power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
them in so little Time and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass.
You will be kind to shew me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I have Err'd; and as you are very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of giving me Instruction, so, I think
I have a very Just title to demand it from
you; being without Reserve,</p>

own my self obliged to you, and I look

you to some new Acquaintance that I have

But here's the Comfort of the Change; I

I know there are now and then, some Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls

'Tis now the time, when the Sun breeds In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects;

Thus, Madam, you have your <hi>Revenge</hi> in

                  <p>I Received yours, which was the more
Welcome, because it came without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation.
I take it very kindly that you
would write to me, more kindly than if
you had made me a Present: For we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
shew most Kindness for any one, in
that which we do for him contrary to the
Bent of our Natural Tempers. Now I
have observed that you have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
less inclin'd to shew your Parts than
your Generosity. At the very time that you
have been Prodigal of Pelf, you have been
a Niggard of Wit. By a Greatness of
Mind you have squander'd the first, as a
very worthless thing; and by a just Discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
been thrifty of the last, as a very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
Treasure. But your Letter has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me some hopes, that you begin to take
the Advice which I have so often given
you; and that is, that for the Conveniency
of Life, you would grow a little more fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59473:69"/>
of Gold, and a little more free of your
Sense. And I begin to imagine that you
have till now been covetous of the Latter,
only because you were laying in a Stock,
that for the time to come you may be never
without the Ready. I was sorry to hear
my Friendâ€”Quibble, thÃ´, to give the
Devil his Due, it was not the worst that
ever I heard. But I was in hopes that
Quibbles and Puns, might have been cry'd
down with the White Farthings. And I
have been credibly inform'd that <hi>Will Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>

for <hi>Vsquebaugh</hi> any longer; thÃ´ one would

plain English, for you, if I am not mistaken,
pretend to no other Language. But then,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59473:70"/>
as you have writ for the Witty Club, the
Witty Club may understand for you. I look
upon your last to be the Act and Deed of
them all. And you shall henceforward be
Secretary to them, as <hi>Iulian</hi> was to their
Mistresses. ThÃ´ I must tell you by the way,
that the Affection which some of them

as the <hi>Morocco</hi> Ambassador would
have thought himself engaged to return the
University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> if in the midst of
their extream civility, they had offered to
make him <hi>D. D.</hi> But to speak to that part
of your Letter which concerns your self.
I do not wonder, that you go to the Play-house
only for the sake of your Mistress;
but methinks, at the Musick-meeting the
Italians Voice might have Charms for you.
But as you go thither too, you say, only
for the sake of your Mistress, I will believe
to oblige you, that she does not go for the
Eunuch's. Now I go to your Comedy here,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59473:70"/>
purely for the Comedy sake, which is a
politick Country Club; and partly for the
Musick sake I go to our Musick-meeting,
which is a pack of Shrill mouth'd Beagles
for Treebles, and a pack of deep mouth'd
Bumkins for Bases. And whenever our
Consort begins, half the Men in <hi>Bucks,</hi> in
spight of their Souls, are our Audience.
Once more I salute the Witty Club. Tell
them, that they little deserve that name,
if they have not more Wit, than to take
any thing ill <hi>I</hi> have said. Assure them, that
I know how to respect their Good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and that I shall endeavour to set of
their Bad, which is a Friends part.</p>

you. For there has just been a Play
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59473:72"/>
Acted, called <hi>The Mock-Marriage,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of which, whose name I have forgot,
asserts Dogmatically in his Preface, that he
who writes by rule shall only have his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for his Pains. I know not what this
Author can mean by this. For, whom
does he pretend to perswade by this fine
assertion? Not Mr. <hi>Moyle,</hi> and me at least.
We know indeed very well, that a Man
may write regularly, and yet fail of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
and that a Poet may please in a play
that is not regular. But this is Eternally
true, that he who writes regularly <hi>cete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> paribus,</hi>
must always please more, than he
who transgresses the rules. Nothing can
please in a Play but Nature, no not in a
Play which is written against the Rules,
and the more there is of Nature in any
Play, the more that Play must Deligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Now the Rules are nothing but an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Nature. For Nature is Rule and
Order it self. There is not one of the Rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
but what might be us'd to evince this. But
But I shall be contented with showing some
instances of it, even in the Mechanical
Rules of the Unities. And first for that of
place; it is certain that it is in Nature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
for a Man who is in the Squa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>o see the things, that at
the same time are transacted at <hi>Westm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>nst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59473:72"/>
And then for that of Time, a Reasonable
Man may delude himself so far, as to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that he sits for the space of twelve
hours, without removing, Eating or Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but he must be a Devil that can Fancy
he does it for a Week. What I have said
may evince a necessity of observing the
Unities of Time and of Place, if a Poet
would throughly write up to Nature. And
then the Unity of Action follows on course.
For, that two Actions that are Entire, and
Independent, should happen in the same
short space of time, in the same little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of Place, begin together, go on toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and end together, without Obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Confounding one another, this indeed
may be done upon the Stage, but in Nature
it is highly improbabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> Well then, since
the Rules are nothing but Nature it self, and
and nothing but Nature can please, and
and since the more that any Play has of
Nature, the more that Play must Delight,
it follows, that a Play which is regularly
Written, <hi>ceteris Paribus,</hi> must please more
than a Play which is written against the
Rules, which is a Demonstration. Rule
may be said to be a Play; what Symme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>y
of parts is known to be to a Face? The Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
may be Regular, and yet a Great or a
Delicate air may be wanting. And there
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59473:73"/>
may be a Commanding or Engaging air, in
a Face whose Features are not Regular.
But this all the World must allow of, that
there can never be seen any Soveraign
Beauty, where air and Regularity of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not United. Thus is Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there has not been so great a Solemnity as
the Consecration of <hi>Iohn Abassus.</hi> In all
the Pagan Ritual, I never met with the
Form of Poetical Orders; but I believe
the Ceremony of Consecrating a Man to

                  <p>I Can't but think, that a Letter from me
in <hi>London,</hi> to you in <hi>C</hi>â€”is like
some ancient Correspondence between an
Inhabitant of <hi>Rome</hi> and a <hi>Cimmerian.</hi> May
be, my way of Writing may not be so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
compared with <hi>Roman</hi> Epistles;
but the resemblance of the Place will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the other part of the Parallel. The
Subterraneous Habitations of the Miners,
and the Proximity of the <hi>Bajae</hi> help a little
and while you are at <hi>B</hi>-let <hi>B</hi>-be <hi>Cumae,</hi> and
do you supply the Place of <hi>Sybilla.</hi> You may
look on this as raillery, but I can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you, nothing less than Oracles are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from you, in the next Parliment,
if you succeed in your Election, as we are
pretty well assured you will. You wish
your self, with us at <hi>Wills Coffee-house;</hi> and
all here wish for you, from the president
of the Grave Club, to the most puny
Member of the Rabble; they who can
<pb facs="tcp:59473:75"/>
think, think of you, and the rest talk of
you. There is no such Monster in this
<hi>Africa,</hi> that is not sensible of your absence,
even the worst natured People, and those
of least Wit lament it, I mean, Half Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Quiblers. To tell you all that
want you, I should name all the Creatures
of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> wich like those of <hi>Eden-garden</hi>
would want some <hi>Adam</hi> to be a
Godfather and give them Names. I can't
tell whether I may justly compare our
<hi>Covent-garden,</hi> to that of <hi>Eden,</hi> or no;
for tho' I believe we may have variety of
Strange Animals equal to <hi>Paradise,</hi> yet
I fear we have not amongst us, the <hi>Tree</hi>
of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> It had been much to the
disadvantage of <hi>Pliny,</hi> had the <hi>Coffee-house</hi>
been in his days; for sure he would have
described some who frequent it; which
would have given him, the reputation of
a more fabulous Writer then he has now.
But being in our age it does him a Service,
for we who know it, can give faith to all
his Monsters. You who took care to go
down into the Country unlike a Poet, I hope
will take care not to come up again like
a Politician; for then, you will add a new
Monster to the <hi>Coffee-house,</hi> that was never
seen there before. So you may come
back again, in your Souldiers Coat, for
<pb facs="tcp:59473:76"/>
in that you will no more be suspected for
a Polititian, than a Poet. Pray come upon
any terms, for you are wished for by every

send you some concerning our Friend: In
doing which, I comply both with his desire
and yours. He has been sick almost ever
since he came hither, tho, excepting once,
he has liv'd with exact Regularity. He says,
he believes the Devil restrain'd his Surfeit
from breaking out till he was reconcil'd to
Sobriety, to render it odious, and set them
afresh at varience. I remember when I was
at <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

Circumstances in some measure resembled

he has been once Drunk since he came to

Sot ever since. Our Friend, I suppose,
rallies. But one thing is certain; that
Wine is as sure to exalt Wit, as Paint is to
heighten Beauty, but then as the Devil will

                  <p>WHen thy last was written, thou hadst
put on the Lyons Skin, and<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
mad'st a wonderful Comical Figure in it.
But I did not think to incense thee, nor
the rest of the Rabble, quite contrary I
thought to divert you. You say, you
take it ill, that I should upbraid you with
Understanding no Language but <hi>English.</hi>
Why, what a Pagan Apprehension hast
thou <hi>Gabriel?</hi> The Devil a jot did I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
thee. Quite contrary, I commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee for being willing to understand no
Language but plain <hi>English.</hi> And that as
I take it, has quite a different meaning.
With what unreasonable Wights have
I had to do? Who are offended at my
endeavour to please them, and take my
Commendations for Injuries. I am accus'd,
you say, of ill Breeding for that Letter.
Why, Prethee, <hi>Gabriel,</hi> every Man has
not had the Breeding that thou hast. I
wish you had sent me the Names of the
Sparks who would reconcile Punctilio to
Satyr. It has been a damn'd inveterate
Quarrel, and requires wise Mediators.
<pb facs="tcp:59473:78"/>
But now I talk of Satyr, that you say is
the Disease of some Peoples Minds. Alas,
poor Devil, thou doest not know that it is
a Maxim in Physick, that some Diseases
shew the Health and Strength, and Vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the Party affected. If we believe
<hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> Hunger is a Disease; nay
reason tells us the same thing. For like
other Distempers, it shews a defect in
Nature. But where it shews a defect it
shews a force too, and when that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
is pretty acute, the Patient is sure to
do well, I will let the Application alone.
For in writing to one of thy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
Spirit, a Man is sure to write to
some body who can understand. But this
I will say, that if Satyr be a Disease, the
acuter it is, the better. But why do I
talk of Diseases to thee? For indeed <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi>
(without Satyr) thou art no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian.</p>

                  <p>MY Business and my Thanks for your
Kindness, you will find in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd,
which I had sent by the last Post,
had not an Accident hinder'd it. All the
Return that I can make you at present is,
to acquaint you with such News as we
have. Our Friend, Mr.â€”went last
Friday to the <hi>Bath.</hi> He promis'd to write
to me from that place, but it would be
unreasonable indeed to expect it. For
<hi>W</hi>â€”takes up his Afternoons, and his
Mornings, I suppose, are spent in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
at the <hi>Cross Bath.</hi> Most of your
Friends of the <hi>Coffee-House</hi> are disper'd;
Some are retreated into the Country in
hopes of some Favours, which they expect
from the <hi>Muses:</hi> Two or Three of them
are retir'd in Town to ruminate on some
Favours, which they have receiv'd from
their Mistresses.</p>
                  <p>So that the <hi>Coffee-House</hi> is like to grow
into Reputation again. For if any one
gives it the scandalous Denomination of
<pb facs="tcp:59473:79"/>
the <hi>Wits Coffee-House,</hi> he must call it so
by Antiphrasis, because there comes no
Wit there. Here are two or three indeed,
who set up for Wits at home, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to pass for wise at the Coffee-House.
For they hold their Tongues there. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Coffee-House is generally the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for Wit, where the Merchants
meet without bringing the Commodity
with them, which they leave at home in
their Ware-houses, alias their Closets,
while they go abroad to take a prudent
care for the vending it. But you are of
the number of those happy few, who so
abound in Hereditary Possessions and in
rich returns from <hi>Greece</hi> and from <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi>
that you always carry some of it about
you to be liberal to your Friends of that
which you sell to Strangers. Mr.â€”bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
eternally according to his old rate, and
as extravagantly as if he talk'd to himself,
which he certainly does, if no body minds
him any more than I do. He has been just
now enquiring of me, what sort of Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
the Spleen is; an infallible sign that he
is the only Man in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> who does
not know he is an Ass. To make him
sensible what the Spleen is, I could find
in my heart to shew him himself and give
it him. If any thing restrains me from
<pb facs="tcp:59473:79"/>
being reveng'd of his Impertinence this
way, 'tis the Consideration that it will
make him wiser. This Coxcomb natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
puts me in mind of the Stage, where
they have lately acted some new Plays;
but had there been more of them, I
would not scruple to affirm, that the
Stage is at present a Desart and a barren
place, as some part of <hi>Africa</hi> is said to
be, though it abounds in Monsters. And
yet those prodigious Things have met
with Success. For a Fool is naturally
fond of a Monster, because he is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of knowing a Man. While you drink
Steel for your Spleen at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the benefit of the Course. For
the gaiety of your Letters relieves me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably.
Then what must your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
do? Come up and make the
Experiment; and impart that Vigour to
me which <hi>Tunbridge</hi> has restor'd to you.</p>

I have often heard him say in his life time,
that Wit, wherever it grows in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's

Evening, and went to <hi>La Barre,</hi> where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>du Vigean</hi> was to give a Collation to
the Princess. In our way thither we found
nothing worth our Observation; but only
that at <hi>Ormesson,</hi> an English Mastiff came
up to the Boot of the Coach, to make his
Compliment to me. Be pleased to take this
along with you, My Lord, that as often as
I express my self in the Plural Number, as
for Example, We went, we found, or We
beheld, 'tis always to be Understood, that
I speak in the Quality of a Cardinal. From
thence we happily arriv'd at <hi>La Barre;</hi> and
enter'd a Hall, where we trod upon nothing
but <hi>Roses</hi> and <hi>Orange</hi>-Flowers. Madam the
Princess, after she had sufficiently admir'd
this Magnificence, had a mind to see the
Walks before Supper: The Sun was then
just setting in a Cloud of Gold and Azure,
and gave us no larger a share of his Beams,
than to supply a Soft and Pleasing Light.
The Air was not disturb'd either with Wind

                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>
Vigean,</hi> in her Treating the Fairest Princess
upon Earth. After she had passed through
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59473:86"/>
a great Parterre, and Gardens full of <hi>Orange</hi>-Trees,
she arrived at the Entrance of an
Enchanted Wood, so thick and shady, that
Authors conclude the Sun, since the Day of
his Birth, never enter'd it, till now that he
waited on her Highness thither. At the
end of an Alley, which carried the sight
out of distance, we found a Fountain, which
alone cast up a greater <hi>Quantity</hi> of Water,
than all those of <hi>Tivoli</hi> together. About
it were plac'd four and twenty Violins,
which had much ado to make themselves
be heard, for the rumbling of the Streams
in falling. When we were got near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
we discover'd in a certain Nich,
within a Pallisade, a <hi>Diana,</hi> of about Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or Twelve Years of Age, and fairer
than the Forests of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Thessaly</hi> had
ever seen. She bore her Bow and Arrows
in her Eyes, and was encompass'd with all
the Glories of her Brother. In another
Nich, not far distant, was another Nymph,
Fair and Gentile enough to pass for one of
her Train: Those who are not given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Fables, took them for Mademoiselles
<hi>de Bourbon</hi> and <hi>la Priande;</hi> and to confess
the Truth, they resembled them exactly.
All the Company was in a profound Silence<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
admiring so many different Objects, which
at once astonish'd their Eyes and Eares,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59473:86"/>
when on a Sudden the Goddess leapt down
from her Nich; and with a Grace, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be describ'd, began a Ball, which
lasted for some time about the Fountain.
'Twas somewhat strange, My Lord, that
in the midst of so many pleasures, which
were<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> sufficient to ingage the whole atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Spirits, who enjoy'd them,
yet we could not forbear to think of you;
and it was generally concluded, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was wanting to our Happiness, since
neither you, nor Madam <hi>de Rambouillet</hi>
were present. Then I took up a Harp and
Sung this Spanish Stanza;
<q>
                           <l>Pues quiso mi suerte dura,</l>
                           <l>Que faltando mi sennor</l>

                        </q>
And continued the rest of the Song so very
Melodiously<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and with such an Air of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that there was not one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
but the Tears came into their Eyes,
and they wept abundantly. Their sorrow
had endur'd much longer, had not the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
struck up a Sarabrand, with great speed
and presence of Mind<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Upon which the
Company got upon their Feet, with as
much Gayety<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as if nothing in the World
had happen'd, and fell into the Dance;
thus Leaping, Capring, turning Round,
and Hopping, we returned to the House,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59473:87"/>
where we found a Table already Spread,
and serv'd as if it had been serv'd by

                        </gap>ess the Truth,
a better Treat could not have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.
Amongst other things, there were
twelve Dishes, besides other Eatables in
disguise, which were never seen before on
any Humane Table: and whose very names
have never been so much as mention'd in
any History. This Circumstance, My Lord,
by some disastrous accident, has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to Madam <hi>La Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>eschalle</hi>â€”And
though immediately upon it, she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ook

Dose; yet she has never been able to
close her Eyes, from that fatal Moment.
During the first Course, there was not so
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59473:87"/>
much as one single Cup went round to
your Health; the Company was so intent
upon the present Affair; and at the Deser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,
we quite forgot it. I beg your permission<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
My Lord, to relate all things as they pass'd,
like a Faithful Historian as I am, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Flattery: For I would no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> for the
World, that Posterity should mistake one
thing for another; and that at the end of
two thousand years hence, or thereabouts,
Posterity should imagine your Health was
drunk, when really there was no such thing
in Nature. Yet I must give this testimony
to Truth, that it was not for want of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
For, during all Supper time, you
were often mention'd. All the Ladies
wish'd you there, and some of them
very heartily, or I am much mistaken<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> As
we rose from Table, the Sound of the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
summon'd us up Stairs, where we found
a Chamber so gloriously lighted up, that
it look'd as if the Day, which was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Earth, had retired hither, and was
assembled in one body of Light. Here the
Ball began again, in better order and with
more grace, than it had been danc'd about
the Fountain. And the most Magnificent
Part of it, my Lord, was, that I footed it
there in Person. Mademoiselle <hi>de Bourbon,</hi>
I must confess, was of opinion, that I
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59473:88"/>
Danc'd aukwardly; but she concluded, to my
advantage, that I must be allowed to Fenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
well; because, that at the end of every
Cadence, I put my self upon my Guard.
The Ball continued with much Pleasure till
all of a sudden a great Noise which was
heard without Doors, caused the Company
to look out at the Windows. Where from
a great Wood, which was about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Paces from the House, we beheld so vas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
a Number of Fire-Works issuing out, that
we verily believ'd all the Branches and
Trunks of the Trees had been Metamo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd
into Guns. That all the Stars were
falling from the Firmament, and that the
Element of Fire, was descending into the
Middle Region of the Air. Here, My Lord,
are three Hyperboles tack'd together, which
being valued at a moderate Price, are worth
three dozen of Fusees at the least. After we
were recover'd out of this great fit of Extasie,
into which so many Miracles had plung'd
us, we resolved on our Departure; and
took the way to <hi>Paris</hi> by the Light of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Flambeaux. We pass'd through all the
<hi>Ormessonnois,</hi> and the wide Plains of <hi>Espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi>
without resistance, and went through
the middle of St. <hi>Dennis.</hi> Being plac'd in
the Coach by the side of Madamâ€”I
said a whole <hi>Miserere</hi> to her, on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59473:88"/>
to which she replied, with much
Gallantry, and no less Civility. We sung
in our Journey a World of Songs, Roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,
Roundelays, Lampoons, and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads;
and were now half a League beyond
St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> it being two a Clock in the
Morning precisely; the Fatigue of the
Journey, Watching, Walking, and the
painful Exercise of the Ball, having made
me somewhat heavy, when there happen'd
an Accident, which I verily believ'd wou'd
have been my total Ruine<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
little Village, situate, say the Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
betwixt <hi>Paris</hi> and St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and
Vulgarly called, <hi>La Valette:</hi> At our going
out of this Place, we overtook three Coaches,
in which were those Numerical Violins
which had been Playing to us<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Hereupon, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
entring into the Spirit of Mademoiselle,
she commanded them to follow us, and to
give Serenades all Night long to the Poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
People of <hi>Paris</hi> who were asleep and
dreamt not of her Malice. This Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Proposition, made my Hair rise an end
upon my Head: Yet all the Company pass'd
a Vote in Favour of it; and the word was
just ready to be given, but by a Signal
Providence, they had left their Violins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them at <hi>la Barre;</hi> for which the Lord
reward them. From hence, my Lord, you
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59473:89"/>
may reasonably conclude, that Mademo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is a dangerous Person in the Night, if
ever there was any in the World: and
that I had great reason at Madamâ€”<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
House to say, that the Violins ought to be
turn'd out of doors, when that Pestilent
Lady was in Company. Well, we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
our way happily enough, but only that
as we enter'd the <hi>Fauxbourgh,</hi> we met six
Lusty Fellows, as Naked as ever they were
Born, who passed directly by the Coach,
to the terror of the Ladies. In fine, we
arrived at <hi>Paris;</hi> and what I am now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to relate, is indeed Prodigious. Cou'd
you imagine it, My Lord? the Obscurity
was so great, that it cover'd all that Vast
City. And instead of what we left it, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and with a Crowd of Men, Women, Horses,

Solitude, dispeoled Streets, not meeting
with any Mortal Man; but only certain
Animals, who fled from the Lustre of our

no less Consplation than that which I

your Letter, as a Pardon which Heav'n

me to return to this Place, and I can assure

be ill-becoming of me: For methinks he

who is happy enough to obtain yours. This

me, Sir, in what I am saying, I speak but
my real Sentiments; when my Curiosity,
as you say, had oblig'd me to pass the
Bounds of the Ancient World, to find out
Rare and Surprising Objects, your Works
were the wonderfullest things that I saw,

All this, which was capable of producing
Envy in any Man's Soul but mine, fill'd
mine with so much Esteem and Affection,
that you then took the place there, which

be very glad to find that it is as you would
have me believe. Amongst the rest
of the Advantages, which I expect to

will bring our Stature into some Credit,
and that it is ours which henceforward will
be accounted the Noblest; and that by you,
we shall be Exalted above those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
themselves higher that we. As we

smallest Bottles, Nature infuseth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinest
Souls into the smallest Bodies, and
mixes more or less of matter with them, as
they have more or less in them of their
Almighty Original. She seems to place the
most Shining Souls, as Jewelers set the most
Sparkling Stones, who make use of as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Gold as they can with them, and no
more than just suffices to bind them. By
you the World will be undeceiv'd of that

were sufficient to make you lose it. You
had need to have a high opinion of my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to believe that I can Love a Man who
enjoys my Right, and who has obtain'd
the Confiscation of my most valued Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
But yet I am so just, that even this
shall be no Impediment, and I believe
you to have so much Justice on your side,
that I do not Despair but that we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
ev'n this matter between us.
They may very well have given you my
place without your putting me out of it,
and my room in their hearts was but very
small, if it cannot contain us both. As for
my part, I shall do my utmost, that I may
not incommode you there; and shall take
care to to take up my Station so that we
may not clash; since so powerful an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
cannot make me cease to be yours,

worst of Accidents, I shall be Eternally</p>

Passion, as that which I have for

so much as heard of you. And yet, I
Gad, I am desperately in Love with you<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and it is now a whole Day, since I have
Sigh'd and look'd Silly, and Languish'd, and
Dy'd, and all that for you. Without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ever seen your Face, I am taken with
its Beauty; and am charm'd with your Wit,
thÃ´ I never have heard one Syllable of it.
I am ravish'd with your every Action, and
I fancy in you a kind of I know not what,
that makes me passionately in Love with I
know not whom. Sometimes I fancy you
Fair, and at other times Black. Now you
appear Tall to me, by and by Short; Now
with a Nose of the Roman Shape, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
with a Nose turn'd up. But in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59473:96"/>
form I describe you, you appear the
Loveliest of Creatures to me; and though
I am ignorant what sort of Beauty yours
is, I am ready to pawn my Soul, that it
is the most Bewitching of all of them. If
it be your Luck to know me as little, and to
Love me as much, then thanks be to Love,
and the Stars. But lest you should a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
impose upon your self, in fancying me
a Tall Fair Fellow, and so be surpriz'd at the
Sight of me, I care not for once, if I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to send you my Picture. My Stature
is three Inches below the Middle one; My
Head appears tolerable enough, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
set off with a large Grey Head of
Hair: Then with Eyes that languish a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
yet are something Hagard, I have a
sort of a Cudden cast of a Face. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
one of your Friends will tell you, that
I am the honestest Fellow in the World, and
that for Loving Faithfully in five or six
Places at a time, there is no Man alive
comes near me. If you think that all this
will accommodate you, it shall be at your
Service as soon as I see you. Till that long
long'd for time I shall think of you; that is,
of I know not whom. But if any one should
chance to ask me for whom I sigh, don't be
afraid, I warrant I keep the Secret; I would
fain see any one catch me at naming you to
him.</p>

to purchase them with all my Health<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I

you who are Conscious to so much of my

certain than that I have hitherto beheld the
Spanish Beauties with as much Indifference,
as I did the Flemish at <hi>Brussels;</hi> and I hope
to grow a Convert in the very Place of the
World in which the Tempter is strongest,
and where the Devil resumes as glorious
Shapes as what he put off when he fell. The
Reformation is so great in me, that I have but
one Scruple remaining, which is, that I think
too often of you; and that I desire to see you
again with a little too much Impatience. I
who have moderated the rest of my Passions,
have been unable to reduce that which I
have for you, to the Measure with which we
are permitted to love our Neighbours; that
is to say, as much as we do our selves; and I
fear you have a larger share in my Soul, than
I ought to allow a Creature. Look out I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech

if you have done him this Honour, 'tis not
so much upon the account of his having been

However, we here find cause to admire the

But here, Madam, I beg leave to assure you,
that I could not but be surpriz'd to see how
Fantastick your Favours are, I could not but
think it strange, that you, who without
Compassion could see a Thousand Lovers
expire, should not have the Heart to see a
Syllable die. If you had but had half the
Care of me, which you have shewn of <hi>For,</hi>
I should then have been happy in spight of
ill Fortune: Then Poverty, Exile, and
Grief, would scarce have had force to come
near me. If you had not deliver'd me from
these Evils themselves, you had freed me
at least from the Sense of them. But at a
Time that I expected to receive consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from yours, I found that your kindness
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59473:101"/>

troubled you more than ours. I must
confess, Madam, it is but just, you should
undertake his Defence; but you ought to
have taken some care of me too, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

your Friends for a Word. You make
no Answer at all to that which I writ about;
You take not the least Notice of that which
so much concerns me: In three or four
Pages you scarce remember me once, and

take the Moon by the Teeth, if you did
but once attempt it. Nothing can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to you; I am only uneasie about
what I shall say to your Highness on this
occasion, and am thinking by what extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
terms I may bring you to reach
my Conceptions of you. Indeed, my Lord,
in that Height of Glory, to which you have
now attain'd, the Honour of your Favour
is a singular Happiness, but it is a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
thing to us Writers, who are obliged
to Congratulate you upon every good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
to be perpetually upon the Hunt for
words whose Force may answer your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and to be ev'ry day inventing of new
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59473:102"/>
Panegyricks. If you would but have the
Goodness to suffer your self to be beat some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
or to rise from before some Town,
the variety of the matter might help to
support us, and we should find out some
fine thing or other to say to you, upon the
inconstancy of Fortune, and the Glory that
is gotten by bearing her Malice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bravely.
But having, from the very first of your Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
Rank'd you Equal with Alexander,
and finding you rising upon us continually;
upon my word, my Lord, we are at a loss
what to do, either with you or our selves.
Nothing that we can say, can come up to
that which you do, and the very Flights of
our Fancy flag Below you. Eloquence,
which Magnifies smallest things, cannot
reach the height of those which you do,
no, not by its boldest Figures. And that
which is call'd Hyperbole on other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is but a cold way of speaking when
it comes to be applyed to you. Indeed it
is different to Comprehend, how your
Highness each Summer has still found out
meanes to Augment that Glory, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Winter seem'd at its full Perfection;
and that having begun so greatly, and gone
on more greatly, still your last Actions
should Crown the rest, and be found the
most Amazing. For my own part, my
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59473:103"/>
Lord, I congratulate your Success, as I am
in Duty oblig'd, but I plainly foresee, the
very thing that Augments your Reputation
with us, may prejudice that which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from after Ages; and that so many
Great and Important Actions, done in so
short a space, may render your life Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
to future times, and make your Hist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
be thought a Romance by Posterity.
Be pleas'd then, my Lord, to set some
Bounds to your Victories, if it be only to
accommodate your self to the Capacity of
Human Reason, and not to go further than
Common Belief can follow you. Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be quiet and secure, at least for
a time, and suffer <hi>France</hi> which is Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alarm'd for your safety, to enjoy Serene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for a few Months, the Glory which you
have acquir'd for her. In the mean time,
I Beseech you to believe, that among so
many Millions of Men who Admire you,
and who continually pray for you, there
is not one who does it, with so much Joy,
with so much Zeal and Veneration, as I,

you. But now, my Lord, laying the
Man of Conscience aside, and Resuming
the Man of State, I Felicitate your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the Victory I hear you have gain'd,
the most Compleat, and the most Important,
which has happen'd in our Age. <hi>France,</hi>
which you have shelter'd from all the
Storms that it Dreaded, is amaz'd to see
that you have begun your Life with an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with which <hi>Caesar</hi> would gladly have
Crown'd his own, and which alone, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
more Luster upon the Kings your
Progenitors, than all theirs have transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to you. Well, my Lord, you have
Verified what has been formerly said, that
Virtue comes to the <hi>Caesars</hi> preventing
Time. For you who are a true <hi>Caesar</hi> both
in Wit and in Knowledge; <hi>Caesar</hi> in Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and in Vigilance; in Courage <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and <hi>per omnes Casus Caesar;</hi> you have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
the hopes, and surpass'd the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men; you have clearly shewn that
Experience is necessary to none but Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Souls, that the Virtue of Heroes comes
by a more Compendious way, and that
the Works of Heaven are finish'd when but
begun. After this I leave you to Judge,
how you are like to be Receiv'd and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress'd
by the Lords of the Court, and with
what pleasure the Ladies heard, that he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59473:105"/>
whom they had seen Triumphant in Balls,
had been Victorious in Armies; and that
the finest Head of all <hi>France,</hi> was likewise
the Best and the Strongest. There is not
a Man, ev'n to Monsieur <hi>Beaumont,</hi> who
does not Declaim in your Praise. They
who had revolted against you, are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and they who complain'd that you

now in good earnest; and ev'ry one's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid

Rank, which you tell me I have held
in your Memory. Methinks you have
shewn but an indifferent concern for my
Satisfaction, in delaying so long to impart
the pleasing News to me, and in suffering
me so long to be the Happiest of Men,
without Dreaming I was so. But perhaps
you were of opinion that this very good
Fortune, was so infinitely above any thing
that I could in reason hope for, that it was
necessary you should take time to invent
Arguments, which might render it credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that you had an occasion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59473:106"/>
all the power of Rhetorick to perswade
me, that you had not forgot me. And
thus far at least I must needs confess, that
you have been very just, that resolving to
let me have nothing but words for all the
Affection you owe me, the Choice which
you have made of them, has been so Rich,
and so Beautiful, that let me die if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the thing they assure me of would be of
greater value. This at least I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m sure of, that
they would suffice to Counterballance any
Friendship but mine. I am only Discontented
at one thing, and that is, that so much Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and so much Eloquence, should not
be able to Disguise the Truth from me, and
that in this, I should resemble your own
Shephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>desses, who are too silly to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
by a Man of Wit. But indeed, you
must excuse me if I am something inclin'd
to suspect an Art, which could invent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
for a Quartan-Ague, and an
Art which you have at more Command
than ever Man had before you. All those
Graces, and that Air of the Court, which
I so much admire in yours, Convince me
rather of the Excellence of your Wit, then
of the goodness of your Will. And from
all the fine things which you have said in
my Favours, all that I can conclude, ev'n
when I am inclin'd to flatter my self, is,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59473:106"/>
that Fortune has been pleas'd to give me a
place in your Dreams. Nay, I know not
if the very Extravagancies of a Soul so
Exalted as yours, are not too Serious, and
too Reasonable, to Descend so low as to me.
And I shall esteem my self too obligingly
us'd by you, if you have but so much as
Dreamt that you Love me. For to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that you have reserv'd a place for me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
those Sublime thoughts, which are
at present employed, in recompensing the
Virtues of all the World, and distributing
Shares of Glory to Mankind, to imagine
this would be extream presumption in me.
I have too great an opinion of your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to believe that you could be Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any thing that is so much below you,
and I should be unwilling, that your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
should have that to object to you.
I am perfectly satisfied, that the only Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which you can have justly for any
one, is that which you owe to your self;
and that Precept of Studying ones self,
which is a Lesson of Humility to all besides
you, ought to have a contrary Effect in
Relation to you, and oblige you to Contemn,
whatever you find without you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here let me swear to you, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pretending to any share in your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59473:107"/>
I should have been very well satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
if you had preserv'd with never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
care, the Friendship which I have vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Eternally to have for you, and to have placed
it if not amongst the things which you va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
at least amongst those which you are
not forward to lose. But in leaving me
here with that lovely Rival, of whom you
made mention of in yours, you have shewn,
let me tell you, too little Jealousie, and
you have suffer'd her to gain so much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of you, that I have Reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that you have Conspir'd with her, to
do me a mischie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>. And therefore I have
more Reason than you to Complain, that
she has enrich'd your self by your Losses,
and that you have suffer'd her to get into
her power, that which I thought to have
secur'd from her Tyranny, by entrusting
it in your hands. If you had been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have made never so little defence,
the better part of my self, had yet been
our own, but you by your negligence have
suffer'd her to surprise it, and to Advance
her Conquests at such a rate over me, that
thÃ´ I shou'd surrender to you, all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of me, you would not have so much
as one half of that which you have lost.
Nevertheless, let me assure you, that you
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59473:107"/>
have gain'd in my Esteem, as much as you
have lost in my Affection, and that at the
very time that I was beginning to Love
you less, I was forced to Honour you more.
I have seen nothing of yours since your
Departure, which does not go beyond all
that you had done before. And by your
last works, you have the Honour of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him who surpass'd all others, It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
therefore but appear strange, that when
you have so much Reason to be contented,
you should yet be complaining, and that
you your self, should be the only great
Man who remains dissatisfied with you.
At present all <hi>France</hi> is listening to you, and
yuo are indifferent to no Man who has but
Learnt to Read. All who are concern'd
for the Honour of their Countrey, are not
more inquisitive, after what the Mareschal
<hi>de Crequi</hi> is doing, than they are after what
is doing by you. And you are the Person
who can make more Noise in your Solitude,
than the most Happy and most Renown'd
of our Generals, at the Head of Forty
Thousand Men. Can you wonder then,
that with so much Glory, you should be
Obnoxious to Envy, and that the very same
Judges with whom <hi>Scipi</hi> was Criminal,
and who Condemn'd <hi>Aristides</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:59473:108"/>
should not unanimously do Justice to your
Desert. The People can plead Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Hating the very Qualities which
they Admire in any one. Every thing which
Transcends 'em, they think Affronts 'em; and
they can better bear with a Common Vice,
than an Extraordinary Virtue. So that if
that Law was in Force amongst us, of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the most powerful for Authority
or Reputation, I make no doubt, but that
you would stand the Mark of the Publick
Envy, and I believe e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would not run greater hazard. But, for
God sake, have a care of calling that your
Misfortune, which is but that of the Age.
And complain no more of the Injustice of
Men, since all who have worth, are of your
side, and that amongst them, you have
found a Friend, whom yet perhaps, you may
lose once more<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> At least, I shall do my
utmost to put you into a condition of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so. For every Man's Darling Vanity,
at present, is to be accounted yours. For
my own part, I have always in so Publick
a manner profess'd my self so, that if
through ill Fortune I should not be able to
Love you so much as I have done, yet here
let me Swear to you, that you shall be the
only Man to whom I will dare to declare
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59473:108"/>
it, and that I will always own my self to
the rest of the World, to be as much as

                     <p>THE Man would be to blame, or I
have been very much mis-inform'd,
who should upbraid you with having had
the Mules to keep, at your Camp of <hi>Thion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi>
The Devil a Mule have you kept there
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59473:109"/>
Sir. They tell me, that upon the weighty
Consideration, that several Armies have been
formerly lost by their Baggage; you have
made all possible haste to be disencumber'd
of yours. And that having often read in the
Roman Histories, (this it is to be such a
Man of Reading, look you) that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Exploits that were done by their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
were done on Foot, after having vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
dismounted in the Extreamity of
the most doubtful Battels, you took a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to dispatch away all your Horses,
and have manag'd matters so swimmingly,
that you have not so much as one left.
And now, <hi>the Important Person stands on
his own Legs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Perhaps, you may receive some small In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
from this. But let me die, if
it be not much for your honour, that you
as well as <hi>Bias,</hi> honest Old <hi>Bias,</hi> I warrant
you know him so wondrous well, should
be able to say, that you carry all that is
yours about you. No great Quantity I
must confess of Foppish Accoutrements,
nor a long Train of Led-Horses, nor abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of that which they call the Ready;
but Probity, Generosity, Magnanimity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
in Dangers, Obstinacy in Disputes,
a Contempt of all Foreign Languages, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of False Dice, and a surprising
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59473:110"/>
Tranquillity upon the Loss of Transitory
Things. Qualities, Sir, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and Essentially yours; and of which
neither Time nor Fortune can ever deprive
you. Now as <hi>Euripides,</hi> who was, as you
know, or as you know not, one of the
Gravest Authors of <hi>Greece,</hi> writes in one
of his Tragedies, that Money was one of
the Evils, and one of the most pernicious
ones, that flew from <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
as a Divine quality in you; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatibility
which you shew for it, and
look upon it to be a distinguishing Mark,
of a Great and Extraordinary Soul, that
you are uneasie till you are rid of this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter
of Reason, this Pois'ner of Souls,
this Author of so much Disorder, of so
much Injustice, and of so many Violences.
Yet, I could heartily wish, that your Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
were not arriv'd at such an extraordi-Pitch,
and that you could be brought to
some accomodation with this Enemy of
Humane kind, and that you might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
to make Peace with it, as we do
with the Great Turk, for Politick Reasons,
and the Advantage of Commerce. Now
upon Consideration, that it is a Difficult
matter to be much at one's ease without it,
and fancying that as I play'd for you at <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi>
you threw for me at <hi>Thionville;</hi> and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59473:110"/>
that it is perhaps in my Name, that you
have pack'd off your Baggage; I here send
you a Hundred Pistols at present in part
of Payment; and that these may not meet
with the same Fate which befell their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors,
I desire you not to defile your
Hands with them, but to deliver them to
the French Gentlemen who are with you,
for whose sake I chiefly remit them.</p>

                     <salute>Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THÃ´ your last was extreamly Obliging,
yet the Praises which you so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
gave me, did not so much prove my
Merit, as shew your own. Your praise of
my imaginary Virtues declar'd but my want
of real ones. For the Politeness of your
Letter made me so sensible of the Defects of
mine; that at the same time that it loaded
me with Praise, it cover'd me with Shame.
And therefore, <hi>Madam,</hi> let me tell you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that in what I said of you, I was not
Generous but Just: And here you have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me upon a tender Point, <hi>viz.</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating
from my own Praises, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
from that Action which you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59473:111"/>
to me as an extraordinary Virtue.
But I hope you will be convinced, that the
Air of the Court has not yet blasted my
Native sincerity, nor giv'n me Gallantry at
the Expence of Truth, since I have the
Rudeness to contradict you. The Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your invitation, more than makes
amends for the Coldness of my Brothers:
But at the same time that it obliges it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
me to think that I cannot accept of it.
I passionately love the Country; but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly come thither, thÃ´ both the
Spring and your self invite me. Methinks
the Vilest Insect which Nature has lodg'd
in the Fields, is in a more desirable State
than we are, whom our Employment chains
to the Town. The very Serpent still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in that Paradise out of which it has
cast us: For if it had not been for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the First Serpent, there had been
neither Soldier nor City. Thus you see,
Madam, to what a Condition my Unhappy
Circumstances reduce me; <hi>viz.</hi> of envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Creature which Humane Nature ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors:
For that about this time can leave
its Hole, to lye basking on Sunny and
Flowry Banks, and throwing off its Old one
can assume a Coat as fresh and gay as the
Season. But I must despair of getting o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

am sensible I<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> have err'd in indulging
