            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Reader, comparing Cabinet with Cabinet, the Kings with the Lords <hi>Digby</hi>'s, will easily observe how the unnatural Enemies to this their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (imitating their General, The grand Enemy to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde) have gone about seeking how they may devour it, by their restlesse Endeavours to bring in Forraign Ayds from <hi>Holland, Curland, Denmark, Portugal, Ireland, France,</hi> and from <hi>Rome</hi> it self, of Shipping, Arms, Ammunition, Men, Moneys, Horse and Foot, and that in no small proportions; 4000. Foot and 1000. Horse expected from <hi>France,</hi> 10000. Men from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and 10000. more from <hi>Lorrain</hi>; A strange Conjuncture, to concur in the ends pretended! The King and Pope to defend the Protestant Religion, <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> to maintain Laws and Lioerties, Bloody Rebels in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to uphold the Priviledges of Parliament in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: But blessed be God, who hath discovered the Counsels of the Enemy, and thereby hath in a great part opened the eyes, and undeceived not onely multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of their principal Adherents at home; but also Forraign Princes and States abroad, and hath withal defeated their Forces and Expectations both abroad and at home. This is Gods work, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>

INTRODVCTION:
OR
OBSERVATIONS
concerning the Letters taken at Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
in Yorkshire, about the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
October, 1645.</head>
            <p>VVAr is carried on as well by Policy as by
Power, by Councels as by Forces; and
therefore the goodness of God appears as well
when he discloses the Councels, as when he
discomfits the Forces of an Enemy; when
both mercies are obta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned, both must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged;
for a thankful heart, with external exaltations
of joy (the issues of it) are Gods due, and mans debt for both.
The great and most memorable Victory at <hi>Nazeby,</hi> was an
instance of both on Gods part, and the setting then apart a
Solemn day of Thanksgiving, with the publishing the Kings
Cabinet Letters then taken (the more to manifest Gods mercy)
were the endeavoured returns of a thankful heart on the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
part. God hath again used the same method in his
mercies at the Battel near <hi>Sherborn</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> defeating
the Forces, and delivering up to the Parliament the Cabinet
and Councels of the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> principal Secretary to the
King, and a pestilent Traytor to the Kingdom: When God
repeats over the same method in his mercies, he cals (as it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113509:3"/>
were) for the same method in thankfulnesse; in answer to
which call, a day was devoted for a publick Thanksgiving,
and an Order made not long after for publishing the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Letters and Papers; Orders are sooner made then exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
a throng of intervening occasions with some unhappy
neglects retarded that till now; but now at last they appear
many of them, with an imperfect sense, especially of those
written with Cyphers; and more especially these of D. <hi>Goffs</hi>
Negotiation; the cyphered Letters were uncyphered when
taken, all except two, and the cyphers and uncypherings blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out in many places, why? <hi>Digby</hi> (who in all likelihood
did it) can best tell; others may guesse it to be done, that all
the mystery of iniquity might not be known to all, all are not
equally his Confidents. Where there were Duplicates, use is
made of the most perfect copy. The Reader need no warning
to observe in what a forlorn condition they were in before
<hi>Sherborn</hi> fight (even themselves being Iudges) its too too
often repeated over to escape time; for the present, their
drooping hopes were (for so in sence they expresse it) to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themselves under the Mantle of the approaching Winter
(a season not sutable to Action) and thereby faintly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
a reprival till the next Spring, and then to be piec'd
up again by Forrain Forces; but God the God of all seasons
and of all successes, hath given the Parliament Forces Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
successes even in this last Winter season, and therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool'd
their hopes, as almost all the considerable Encounters
since <hi>Sherborn</hi> fight do aver: As also the late great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
in <hi>Wales</hi> near <hi>Cardiff;</hi> and each Garrison and Town
taken in since by the Parliament Forces bears witnesse, as
<hi>Lankford</hi> Garrison, <hi>Tiverton, Carmarthen, Monmouth,
Shelford, Worton, Bolton, Beeston</hi>-Castle, <hi>Hereford,
Skipton</hi>-Castle, <hi>Dartmouth, Belvoir</hi>-Castle, <hi>Chester,</hi>
and <hi>Corf</hi>-Castle, <hi>Launceston, Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
Cherk</hi>-Castle, and <hi>St. Maws,</hi> most of these of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113509:3"/>
during which time the Enemy hath taken none, or
none worth the naming. Besides these, the Parliament Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
hath reduced many other Forts in the West. And the
16 of <hi>February</hi> last, God (the God of Hosts) gave a fresh
Victory at <hi>Torrington</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon</hi> to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Army under the Command of their General Sir
<hi>Tho: Fairfax;</hi> the gallantry and unwearied Activity, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Discipline, fidelity and successe of which Army, puts
this Age to their admiration, and may put the next past their
belief. By this great successe at <hi>Torrington,</hi> and others of
later date, the tottering Remnant of their fugitive Army was
coop'd up into <hi>Cornwal</hi> (a Corner of the Kingdom) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Corner of that Corner; and is since, by Gods goodnesse,
totally reduc'd, and with it, the very hearts of the Countrey
too, who now own the Parliament Forces as their Friends,
and pursue the others as Enemies. Besides, the Gallant ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Colonel <hi>Morgan</hi> at <hi>Stow</hi> in the <hi>Wold</hi> in <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire,</hi>
in totally Routing of the Army Sir <hi>Jacob
Ashley</hi> gathered up in <hi>Wales</hi> to joyn with <hi>Oxford</hi> Forces,
to make a new Army against the Parliament; where Sir <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
and most of his Officers in Commission, and One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
six hundred Horse and Foot were taken Prisoners, with
Two thousand Arms, and all their Bag and Baggage.</p>
            <p>They who confess'd their desperate condition even before
the Victory near <hi>Sherborn,</hi> what may be thought of them
now, after all these subsequent Successes and Victories?
Certainly, God hath fill'd up even to the brim their cup of
Trembling. What's then their next work? They'll tell you,
'tis to implore Forraign Ayds, and to let in Forraign Forces
into the Kingdom; and of what destructive consequence
that is, let Him tell whom they hold themselves most bound to
believe, even the King Himself, for <hi>Habemus confiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
reum.</hi> He in His Printed Declaration Dated at
<hi>Newark</hi> 9 of <hi>March, 1641.</hi> speaking to the Parliament, says,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113509:4"/>
               <hi>Whatsoever You are advertised from</hi> Rome, Venice, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
<hi>of the Popes Nuncio solieiting</hi> France, Spain, &amp;c.
<hi>for Forraign Ayds, We are confident no sober ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man in Our Kingdom</hi> (so He calls it, <hi>but</hi> Advertè
Rem publicam non esse tuam sed se Reipublicae)<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
               <hi>can believe
that We are so desperate or so senslesse to entertain
such Designs, as would not only bury this Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (Our Kingdom again) <hi>in sudden Destruction and
Ruine, but Our Name and Posterity in perpetual
scorn and infamy.</hi> If it should be now ask'd, What's
became of <hi>Our Kingdom, Our Name, Our Posterity?</hi>
Let the Kings foregoing words, and these following Letters,
with those taken at <hi>Nazeby</hi> make Answer; for strong En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
were and are yet on foot, not onely for raising For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Force for <hi>England,</hi> but whole Forraign States and
Kingdoms are prest upon to Declare, and to make an Offensive
and Defensive War against the Parliament; and not onely
those of the same Religion (to it with the Parliament) but
the very Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> himself is Treated with to come
over and Conduct his Army in Person, consisting of Ten
thousand men: And where can a more desperate and Iesuited
Prince, or a more declared Enemy to Protestants be found out?
<hi>France</hi> is also Courted, though it's hop'd without successe;
onely there is a clandestine Collection of Moneys going on
amongst the rabble of their Popish Clergy to supply the King
withall; and to make up the Messe, the Popish Irish Rebels,
with their Commander in chief, the very Romish Antichrist
himself is solicited and sought into. And now let the World
judge, what precious Defenders of the Faith, the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
of the Faith hath found out, and what Faith is likely
to be Defended. No more needs to be said, let the Letters
speak out the rest.</p>

               <p>COncerning the Tin, Sir <hi>William Boswel</hi>
and I must both proceed together for
many Reasons, and the course which is
as yet thought best, is to put the whole
quantity into <hi>Websters</hi> hands and <hi>Bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haqs</hi>
contracting, That it may be sold at
the highest rate, at the price currant of seventy two
gilders <hi>per Cent.</hi> and in the mean time to advance such
sums upon it from time to time as her Majesty shal have
use of, paying the interest until the Tin be sold to pay
that sum borrowed, be it a week, or a Moneth, or more.
I proposed to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> the immunity
from the Customes, who was very willing to give
order in it to <hi>Greffier Muys,</hi> who hath since told me he
will do his best; he is a very serious servant of her
Majesties here, and ought to be gratified whatsoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of other businesse. And because I know your
intentions in that kind before, I did believe this business
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113509:5"/>
would not be unacceptable to him, and a good expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to finde some part of a present for him; he hath
undertaken also to bring <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Hasdouck</hi> saf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> but hath for the present ordered me to write
to them to go forth, if they can, within these Ten days,
there being no <hi>Holland</hi> ship there to trouble them in that
time or more: If there were so much wit and duty in
those that govern about <hi>Falmouth</hi> and <hi>Truro,</hi> they should
do well to keep any Tin from coming out untill this
be sold, if they be but as mischievous to others as to the

for his ships through the Zound; and a letter of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Queens own hand to Monsier <hi>Vicford,</hi> who
from time to time may do the K good service by it with
him. But the thing which gives sir <hi>W: Boswel</hi> &amp; me most
pain in this place, is the fear of the next interest day
for the Iewels, May 16. on which it is necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

the acquitting our selves of the multiplyed promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambassador, which yet hath not bin done.
I shall obey your order in sending Saint <hi>Ibals</hi> Iewels by

if that design be pursued, as it must be, unlesse peace can
be made, you will as easily send them back, and more

the orders from <hi>France</hi> for preparing the ships in the

               <head>Dr. Goff to the Lord Iermin. April 17.</head>
               <p>THe Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was very inquisitive this week
after my Letters from <hi>Paris,</hi> hoping to be resolved
precisely concerning the sum of the Portion, as I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his discourse; for that point, I gave him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that the Portion alone could not be of that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
as to conclude the Mariage unlesse it were able
to give the King such succours as might probably
restore his affairs, which the sum demanded could not
do; and that therefore I was ordered to assure him,
that if the other Articles were accorded, the Treaty
should not break off upon the sum of the Portion: from
thence we came off of the other particulars, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
was this, that the affairs of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
was to be pursued with all vigour, and for that end ships
should be sent from hence to meet at the time perfixt,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113509:6"/>
that when the Ambassadors are returned, all endeavours
shall be used to induce the States to a League defensive
and offensive; and that Mr. <hi>D'estrade</hi> shall return home
fully instructed in these particulars, that is, to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the impossibility (as they call it) of the passage for
<hi>Holland,</hi> and to facilitate the other to and from <hi>Deipe;</hi>
And for the second, to persawde the sending of an
Ambassadour from <hi>France</hi> hither to that purpose;
which yet notwithstanding the prince of <hi>Orange</hi> thinks
wil be very difficult, by reason of the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi>
war, to which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are violently carried; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the rumours, all endeavours are and shal be used to
bring them to our desires, for which end I proposed
that in the mean time we might at least have Justice
from them, and such acts of amity, as by their past
Alliance they were bound unto such as are, First, the
liberty of their Ports to our men of war, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of them now detained. 2. The liberty to sell our
Prizes here as we may do in <hi>Flanders,</hi> at least that both
sides may sell in their Ports. 3. The di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

exported for the King both from hence and from <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
with the denyal of the same to the Rebels. 5. An
open and Publique Declaration of the dislike of the
Rebells late Propositions sent to the King, according as
in conscience they are bound to declare, thereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this People from the guilt of approving the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
in <hi>England;</hi> that in so doing they should declare no
war against the Parliament, and it would be a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for the work in hand: this the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
seemed very much to approve of, and hath ordered
me to prepare my papers in this kind against the time
that their Ambassadors come from <hi>England;</hi> &amp; began
to ask me concerning the design, and whether I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113509:7"/>
any Orders about it, for that I told him I should
be particularly instructed by the next Post, he likes
this very well, and <hi>D'estrade</hi> shall be instructed
about it; this was all that past since the receipt of yours,
besides that for conclusion the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would
know whether if the Duke should fail us, our Treaty
were at an end: I answered, No, for if the states would
be brought to declare for the King, and with shipping,
and in other particulars, as should be presented to them,
I did not doubt but the King would quickly subdue the
Rebels, which was the end we pursued in this affair; to
which when he replyed with more cheerfulnesse then
has been usual of late, That all indeavors should be used,
I took my leave of him, and do of your—Theres no danger in discoursing, as you find, concerning
the Portion; for the conditions for the Princesse must be
proportionable to it; and if other things be accorded,
they will be solicitous themselvs to inlarge the portion;
for that end the Princesse of <hi>Orange</hi> is very civill to me,
and desires much the businesse should go on. I should
be instructed what to say concerning the condition and
habitation of the Princesse before her going into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <head>Dr. Goff to the Lord Iermin. April 24.</head>
               <p>I Will not doubt but that all my Letters of last week are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and if so, your Lordship doth perceive the whole
Negotiation here, depends upon full instructions how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the particular Treaty of the Marriage; wherein the
several circumstances being understood and agreed, it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear what the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is at, and willing to do
with the States for the Kings assistance, without the actual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113509:7"/>
whereof, it is to be declared, that the private Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
shall not be signed. For this purpose, if the Copies of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Treaties cannot be had, it were necessary to set down par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
what Houses and what Dowry the Queen will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
for the Princesse; and for the Portion, the lowest sum that
must be admitted of, with the times of payment. Yet herein it
cannot be prejudicial to leave much unto Debate here, it being
resolved, That nothing shall be concluded till the States do
fully declare in defence of the King, whilest their hands are
bufie against <hi>Denmark</hi> (whither they are now sending sixty men
of War, and Six thousand foot) it cannot be expected that they
should be induced to supply the King with any forces presently,
but yet these things following will be in their power, and may
be expected from the Pr: of <hi>Oranges</hi> Negotiation with them, as
soon as their Ambassadors return: 1. To enter into a League
offensive, and defensive with the King, against all Enemies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
And though the effect hereof cannot be the present
preparing and sending of Forces by Sea and Land, yet they will
be brought by it, 2. To publish a Declaration of dislike of the
Rebels <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ater Propositions sent to the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> together with the
ill usage of their Ambassadors. 3. To set at liberty those Ships
of ours which are now detained, and to offer the liberty of
their Ports hereafter. 4. To permit the selling of our prizes
in their Ports and for that end, such officers for the King as
shall be necessary. 5. To cause Arms and Powder to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
for the King, with denying the same to the Rebels.
6. To give Letters of reprisal to such of their own people as
have been injured by the Parliament. 7. To permit the King
to hire or buy men of War in these Countreys, to set to Sea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Rebels. 8. To admit of no Agents from <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland</hi> that are not sent by the King, and to dismisse them that
pretend from the Parliament of either: And in pursuance of
these points, if His Majesty pleaseth to put out of His Protection
all such of His Subjects which dwell or Trade here, as have assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Rebellion, in <hi>England,</hi> the States may proceed to such
Confiscations and Penalties as they shall think fit, whereby the
King may finde a considerable profit, and they be invited to a
more vigorous conjunction with him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and if this be done for
the present (<hi>France</hi> concurring in the same particulars) it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113509:8"/>
by Gods blessing, that the King must needs overcome the
Rebels, if he can but keep his Person and the Princes out of
their hands, till his friends that are joyned in League with him
can send more powerful assistance.</p>
               <p>Though the Portion with the Princesse were as much as was
demanded, and paid by several parts, as the prince of Orange
should be able, it were not possible by that to serve the King to
any effect, unlesse these things mentioned were together ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
whereby <hi>London</hi> might be impoverished, which is and will
be the fountain of all this mischief: And on the other side, let
the Portion be never so small and ill paid, yet if these things be
done, and the King by vertue of this Marriage enabled to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Money, or by any means to appear stronger at Sea then
they, and at Land with the same power he hath formerly done,
by Gods blessing, he will be quickly restored, which will give
all the world full satisfaction concerning this Treaty, and make
the conditions Honorable beyond all question. Upon these
considerations, I believe your Lordship may approve what I
wrote by Mr. <hi>D'estrade,</hi> and send some Orders accordingly for
proceeding in the Treaty of the Marriage apart from other things.</p>
               <p>And for them, besides what I am instructed to do already
with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> it will be very necessary to write to
Sir <hi>Will: Boswel,</hi> that upon the coming of the Holland Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
from <hi>England,</hi> he according to his Office be instant with
the States, to perform the duties of their former Alliances with
the King: and that he make such other Propositions to them as
he shall judge fit: But when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> shall finde
matters succeed well, it will be necessary that your Lordship in
the quality of an Ambassador appear here, to make a firm and
quick conclusion.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, it is the opinion of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
that the businesse of shipping is without question the sole thing
which ought to be intended by the Queen, and may probably
restore the Kings Affairs again, though the Duke of <hi>Lorrains</hi>
Voyage, and the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> endeavours should fail.
When I wrote from <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> I was not clearly satisfied in the
advantages on the Kings part, and since that the sicknesse of
<hi>Dorp</hi> (who is now perfectly recovered again; and fixedly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as he was) kept me from the particular pursuit of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113509:8"/>
wherein your Lordship had just cause to be little encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
with what I wrote before; if it be possible to provide mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
it will prove an excellent Design, for the whole execution is
to be disposed of by the King as absolutely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as if they were Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

for which purpose <hi>Dorp</hi> desires to have large and particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions;
also some person of trust and courage to be a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
with him by whom he might correspond with the Queen:
and that his Majesty would appoint some Ports to which all
prizes might be brought, and there judged, which he desires
should be principally 1.—and there Officers of trust to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
which proceed from his Majesty, as they do here for
the States, or at <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> all which shall be particularly
set down under his own hand, and before conclusion of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be made, be considered by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> who talkes of
this particular with pleasure: The condition for himself is very
short, but very great to prescribe nothing, but trust the King and
Queen in that point: but for his Officers, he expects liberall pay
and reward, as it shall be deserved: so that in all respects, this is
to be esteemed his Majesties royall execution; but that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
and Masters are strangers, and ships hired. And it is
here pronounced by all that have knowledge of their Majesties
affaires, and any thoughts and endeavours for their restitution,
that this is so necessary to be done, that without it all other
good successes will but serve to protract the war, and not at all
to procure peace: for till <hi>London</hi> be humbled, the Rebell can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be reduced to reason; but I know arguments in this kinde
are not so needfull as prayers, that God would send some means
to provide the money.</p>
               <p>For the Garter which is designed for the yong Prince it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
earnestly desired by them all, and shall be constantly worne
by the Prince in that manner as in <hi>England:</hi> The Pr. of <hi>Orange</hi>
desires that the King would write himself to him concerning it,
as also to the States, and that it may be conferred after the same
manner as it was to the P. <hi>Elector</hi> in the field, if it might, before
the beleaguering of any Town begin; but of these things both
Sir <hi>William Boswell</hi> who hopes to be imployed in it, and Master

wherein they have begun their Report, and behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so well, that His Majesty cannot wish it better: That the
King may receive fruit of their Report, it hath been proposed to
the States, to establish a Committee to hear and examine the
particulars, and to resolve what ought to be done: The States
of <hi>Holland</hi> do not absolutely refuse to have any such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
but require the whole Narration to be made in publike:

to attempt something which shall be very high and bold with
the States: to that end, in the discourse he will make instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
I shall be able to send the Copy thereof, not onely to your
Lordship, but to all the world. It is not possible any creature
can be more industrious then <hi>Hemflet</hi> is now. Before this time
I believe your Lordship hath received Letters from the Queen,
<hi>the</hi> honour of a Baron for his Son by the Lady <hi>Stanhop;
Charls Henry de Kirkeouz</hi> that he be created Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> and called by
that name: This is represented to your Lordship, as the thing in
the world most desired by them both, that so in the issue of the
eldest Daughter, the name and family of Lord <hi>Wotton</hi> may be
continued; for which they have already taken care to provide
an honorable subsistence: Within a few dayes the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>

you to stay till the next week for Her resolution: She is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered

from the want She spake of induced by the stop; the credit that
would have been raised by the return of the ship, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

She might have sent, and yet that did not necessarily keep Her
from wanting; in the mean time She was reduced to pawn some

               <p>SInce the receipt of yours, I am confirmed in that I wrote last

probable any treaty has been begun upon them, <hi>How that reserve may have slackned
the adventures for this of the Prince of Wales.</hi>
For as soon as I had given in the Extract of my Letters (which
was most greedily called for) the conclusion was, that to gain
time, Mr. <hi>de Zulecum</hi> should draw the project of a Treaty of
Articles of both sides according to the particulars wherein I
shall be instructed within seven dayes, as your Lordships Letter
to him and to me doth promise, and is expected; that before the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his going from hence (which is like to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
few dayes) an assurance may be given him that the Treaty will
proceed well; and the effecting their desires depend only upon
the effects of the publick, without which, the King and they will
have small comfort of the businesse. There is now or never
something to be done upon this State, by means of the excellent
and clear relations which their Ambassadors do make both in
private and publick in the Kings behalf: I have hitherto found
as good succes of this as can be wished, besides that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
written of the marriage. I have to let your Lordship know
that there shall be a Committee of the States presently setled for
the English affaires; that according to what shall be related to
them by their Ambassadours, resolutions may be taken what to
do; that these Ambassadours are so extremly set to bring the

some means must be used—which is no where

them out of <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> to grant Letters of reprizill to those <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>

and defensive as we desire: I suppose it will be seasonable for

the conditions whereof will be very honourable what ever

their Ambassadours (who perhaps will have some credit with
their Masters) will open a way to more possibility of drawing
them to a Declaration, then hath yet appeared,—
for though things have little answered what was expected; we
ought to have a little more patience, especially there being some
hope of getting money: If you remember when the Duke
<hi>Despernon</hi> lent the King the money in <hi>England,</hi> the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> was to put that same into the Contoir of <hi>Holland;</hi> for
the Duke to engage the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> unto this, the Queen
did secure him by jewels she left in his hands. Some hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is, by the industry of Sir <hi>W. Godolphin</hi> who merits infinitely of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113509:13"/>
the King, that this money may be again lent by the Duke; if
that be brought about, the Duke releasing the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
who is his security, the Iewels will return to the Queen, and
will I hope finde the 20000 Pistols, which would be a thing of
infinite consequence. The Affairs of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> I
fear will fail: Next week undoubtedly we shall have the last
Resolution, if it do, we must endeavour to get here the money
that expedition would have cost them, or part of it, which is

Paris, May 15.</head>
               <p>VVHen Her Majesty shall be well enough to speak of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
I hope your Lordship will finde means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
me more particularly concerning the private Treaty by the
return from <hi>England,</hi> which I do most humbly beseech Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to do, for now is the time if ever to operate strongly upon
this country, not only because the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is taking the
field, where the things useful to us cannot be effected: but for
that the Ambassadors do so plentifully declare the Iustice of the
Kings cause, and necessity of the States concernment in it, That
if the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> lose this opportunity for want of words,
or will, there is no reason to bestow more time upon any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
from hence; and I assure you, that since your two last
Dispatches, there is a new vigour towards the Kings affairs, both
in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and Princesse, which I could never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
before, she not dissembling that till now, it did not clearly
appear, Whether the Proposition of the Marriage were real or
not. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath appointed Wednesday and
Thursday of this week for the form of the private Treaty, to be
drawn and agreed on, which could not be if there were any
other in hand; however, they may be willing to allow that of
<hi>Brandinburgh</hi> as a reserve, and for the Publique it is a very good
way, though the Committee of States mentioned in my last be
not yet obtained, the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> pretending that it was
unusual to grant any to their own Ambassadors, however they
have done it upon the demand of strangers here: upon Friday
last they continued their Report before the States General <hi>(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

corps)</hi> and after in the like manner before them of <hi>Holland</hi> for
three hours space in such a method, and with such clearnesse for
the Kings advantage, that no Subject of his could plead it better;
the effect of this hath been the satisfaction of most of them, and
the silencing of them that were most opposite. <hi>Burral</hi> is since
gone to his Town <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> there to repeat what he hath
done; and on Thursday next return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in which it seems to me by the manner of their proceedings, they
intend to perish themselves, or His Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Secretary is as industrious as can be desired; but I fear he
may think it long ere he finde some fruit of his labours; in all
events, that person is to be retained: for whether we obtain the
League or not, it is apparent that ships will be alwayes needful,

for that which concerns themselves most; there are the
same desire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what is now to be done, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
must do somewhat before he go into the field, that some course
must be taken to bring the businesse to a Committee of States,
that Sir <hi>William Bosw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to receive denials, that it were unfit to use him; that an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Ambassador from the King Ought to appear, but not yet,
till the businesse be better prepared, that she will advise both with
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and all others best affected to the King;
that if I have any Proposition to make, I should bring it to her:
This was the sum of yesterdayes discourse; yet after all this I
must not conceal, That the Ambassadors complain that the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> is much colder then they expected, as Mr. Hemflet
sayes (if he be a good Author). This is all I have to say of our
condition here this week, which indeed is nothing positive, but
that very shortly it will appear what is to be expected from hence,
and that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and Princesse do now (as it seems
to me) apply themselves very seriously to that end.</p>

               <head>An Extract of Dr. Goffs Letter to the
Lord JERMIN. May 1.</head>
               <p>I Have discovered this last week, a thing which hath perhaps
given me all the impediments I have met with, and is without
doubt the cause of that sudden and positive demand, which <hi>Hugh</hi>

four weeks, by an Expresse from the Marquesse, returned last
Wednesday in all haste, with Order to bring the Marquesse of
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> to <hi>Cleve</hi> or thereabouts, by the end of this moneth
of <hi>May;</hi> for which purpose, he said he would ride day and
night. This is that you may be assured of, The party himself ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
discovered the whole businesse of Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ieur Hemflet, who
with much passion for the Kings interest told me what he had

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound; and afterwards as it was concerted between us, made
the same relation to the Princesse of <hi>Orange,</hi> and said, that he
had it from me; she was extremely amazed (as he sayes) how I
could get knowledge thereof; but in conclusion confessed the
thing. How far the businesse hath proceeded, appears not yet,
but by what the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> discovered<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> last night with
me: I am confident that nothing is done to the prejudice of the
Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> pretentions, nor shall be, if our demands can be
performed by them with ease, I say with ease; for I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

                  </gap>rd of ruine to effect it; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this, I do hope upon particular Instructions, to give a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
account of the businesse; however it shall cleerly appear,
that there was perfect integrity on Her Majesties part, and that
the frustration did wholly owe it self to them, not so much for
want of desire (for that is not to be doubted of) but that they
did not endeavour to effect those things which were most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
for the King to demand, and perhaps not impossible for
them to do, in the opinion of all that shall come hereafter to
examine what hath passed. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with many
testimonies of his great desire of the honour of it, fell to speak
of the Garter, and in sum, professeth how glorious an addition
it will be to him, and his son; and if it may be sent the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Campagne, that his son who hath the honour to be
allied to the King, will think himself as long as he lives, much
honoured in wearing that Order, after the manner that it is worn
in <hi>England;</hi> wherein he was very particular in describing the
several marks used, and gave me an account of his own electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that Order, which was managed with so much insolency
by the Ambassador Carlson, that it is easie to collect, that was the
cause of his not wearing it at first, and because not at first, never
since; he added likewise, That <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth wore it always;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113509:15"/>
he adviseth, that a Letter should be written from the King after
the usual manner under the Signer to the States, wherein His
Majesty may be pleased to expresse the honour he hath done his
Son in law: Such a Letter was written concerning Prince
<hi>Maurice</hi> and himself, and is to be kept by the States. This
ought to be presented by Sir <hi>Will. Boswel,</hi> if no Ambassador be
here. And after that, either an Herald with the Robes, and the
Order, should be sent with Sir <hi>W. Boswel</hi> into the field, where
it may be done with more triumph (as he sayes) or in sending to
Sir <hi>W. Boswel,</hi> an excuse may be made for deferring the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and the Order worn presently. I told the Prince, that I
hoped after the return of the Dutch Ambassadors, our Affairs
here would be in so good a condition, that it would be necessary
for the Lord <hi>Iermine</hi> to appear here as Ambassador, not onely to
present that, but to conclude all other Affairs, which he said he
hoped, and that now in short time we should see what was to
be expected from hence; with which after many kinde promises
he ended.</p>
               <p>Since my writing this Letter, I have been with the Princesse of
<hi>Orange,</hi> where I finde such froideurs and objections (now, that
the portion is like to be accorded) against the whole businesse,
publike and private; that I beleeve, what I write hath taken
place, and our businesse at an end.</p>

                  <p>I Wrote to you yesterday by Colonel <hi>Fitz-Williams,</hi> I conceive
you will finde cause to take the businesse that concerned him
into consideration: I have sent you now a Copy of Dr. <hi>Gaffe</hi>'s
dispatch out of <hi>Holland,</hi> by which you will see the state of that
businesse reduced to this onely hope, that the return of the
Ambassadors out of <hi>England,</hi> may not onely give Prince <hi>Orange</hi>
a disposition to set on foot that which before he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
enough of his own strength to attempt, but also afford
him some hopes of effecting it; of this we shall see a sudden
issue: the other advantages we expect from thence, as the Ships
for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Supplies of money by the marriage,
are in an estate not much to be relied on; for the businesse of the
Duke, I much fear will fall away: the money of the marriage
will not be considerable enough to conclude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it may be we may single that advantage from the rest, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the consideration of the marriage: so that we have no more
to do, but to attend the issue of the hopes of the Declaration,
and according to that, proceed or let fall the whole businesse,
and look after—as a thing to be managed according to the
means we shall finde here, to go through with it. We shall
know next week what to depend upon for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
which failing, we shall presume our pretensions here for moneys
in place of that which that expedition would have cost them
here: The Clergy Assembles next, week with whom we shall set

He is also a suitor to the Queen for Her Recommendation to the
King, to be a Collector of the Customes in the West, in which
he had formerly a promise. Pray advise me in your next, how far
the Queen may reasonably enterpose in that particular. For the
proposition concerning the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s going into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
the Queen bids me tell you, that She cannot yet, for any reason
She can discern, approve of it. The businesse of Her Majesties
Jewels is so pressing upon Her, that unlesse in the future She be
as fortunate as She hath been hitherto, She will undergo great
trouble and inconvenience: That you may perceive this, I send
you a short Note of the parcels engaged in <hi>Holland,</hi> for which
there must be Use duly paid every six moneths, or the Jewels
must be lost: For these sums for which they are pawned for, is
very inferior to their value. For this Reason it is most necessary
to continue the Tin in the Queens hands, least She should fail of
those other means, that hitherto She hath had for the discharge
of these Instructions; if otherwise She findes means to do it,
then all the profits of the Tin will be duly accounted for to the
King. Just now your Letter of <hi>April</hi> the 11, and the Kings of

               <head>Dr. Goffe to the Lord Iermine
the 29. of May.</head>
               <p>NOw that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is gone into the Field,
your Lordship will have reason to expect some certaine
and good conclusion of all the Propositions which have been
offered hitherto, and in summe it is, That the affaires of the
King are now put into a way of consideration. Here I sent
you a Copy of those Articles presented to the Princesse of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>
and Master <hi>Borrell,</hi> a fortnight since, out of them the
Ambassadours have this last weeke given in a Paper of their
owne, believing it impossible to procure the acceptance of
them all at one time. The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with more
warmth and chearfulnesse then ever before, told me upon my
returne from <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> that he did not doubt but a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
would be made for my purpose; Hee had given Sir
<hi>William Roswell</hi> his taske, to propose the liberty of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and hiving of Ships, and the Ambassadours theirs to
urge the necessity of granting of Letters of Reprizall to the
many complaints received in <hi>England</hi> from their owne Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and then he added; Believe me, by this means they shall
be engaged insensible in a warre, <hi>Croyes moy, par ce moy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

have been done<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> only the Ambassadours (as you may see by
this inclosed memoriall which <hi>Reynswood</hi> gave me) have
thought fit to insist upon the whole businesse, pretending out of
their recredentialls, that his Majesty requires answer to these
particulars. It has been thought a more probable way of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
upon this jealous people, to permit the Propositions to
proceed the ordinary way, which is by sending Copies of
them to their principalls in the severall Provinces and Towns,
then, to make a Close Committee for the English affaires, but
this will prove a very slow remedy for our evills, for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
must be had from the severall places, and a new Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the States, (who separate this Whitsontide) before any
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113509:18"/>
conclusion can be made, this is all that could bee effected,
though they were awakened by a very seasonable intelligence,
that the Houses of Parliament at <hi>Westminster</hi> intended to send
not only a Remonstrance against the two Ambassadours, but
also severall envoyes to their respective Provinces to Treat
with them apart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thereby in ending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nent the quarrell which
hath been already begun amongst them in that point, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of this, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> told me they had resolved
two things; First, that Letters should be dispatched to the
particular Provinces to declare the danger of admitting any
such Agents, and then an order to <hi>Ioachim at London,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that all such Envoyes should be rejected, and for their
Remonstrance, it is a thing much longed fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by these Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
who are prepared to repay them in that kind with libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
interest. But it falls out very il, that whilest these things are
in agitation here, <hi>Sabran</hi> hath written hither, not concealing
his great dislike of the matter, that <hi>France</hi> hath layed aside their
intentions about Reprizalls, and are contented with the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
promises of the Houses that reparation shall be made, which
by these Ambassadours are presented to the States as things to
be despised, forasmuch as they have been told plainly, that it
was not in their power to performe them, and were advised
by the Lords themselves, to take from them of <hi>London</hi> and
others of their Association five times as much as they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by which their pious protecting government, hath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
how much they consider any particular mans safety and
interest that lives amongst them, it is uncertaine what were the
best remedy for this, for if your Lordship should complaine
of this, before that reprizall were granted here perhaps in stead
of finding amendment in <hi>France,</hi> some means might be used
under-hand to divert these here from good intentions, if there
were not feare of this, it would be of great advantage to the
proceedings here, if <hi>Sabran</hi> were commanded presently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
performance of the promises, or else after a fit time to
resume their purpose of reprizalls, this businesse alone, if it be
obtained, will set ships to Sea against the Rebells before this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113509:18"/>
Summer be ended, as the Ambassadours say, but the Princesse
of <hi>Orange</hi> told me that she feared <hi>France</hi> would deceive us,
and the Ambassadours imputed all the timerousnesse of the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to private discouragements the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> receives from <hi>France,</hi> and doe therefore counsell, that
the Queen should now endeavour to get something done by the
Queene Regent, and Cardinall <hi>Mazerine</hi> at this time, which
might give assurance to the States here of their future concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with them, as for example, The publick and certaine
rejection of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or at the same time that out of your Letters I declare to
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> what hopes the Queene hath in that
kind, he tells me, the Letters that he received form <hi>Paris</hi> are
very silent in the businesse; your Lordship will by this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in what state our affaires are, and will by the next I hope
give me order how to dispose of my selfe, for after I have fully
informed my selfe of the state of her Majesties debts here,
and have settled the businesse of this present Time, and seene
the Ship under sayle fully instructed for <hi>England,</hi> I cannot
imagine what I can doe in this place, separate from the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> for whatsoever is to be pursued here, will be as

of <hi>Orange,</hi> as soone as the Instructions come for the private
Treaty of the Marriage, I shall quickly dispatch that businesse,
and leave the matter in this condition, that her Majesty hath
proceeded with most cleare intentions, and that it is their own
imbecillity, or unwillingnesse (which might admit of a worse
name) that frustrates so great and important a Proposition,
both for themselves and us. I have now received your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
full Instructions concerning the dispatch for <hi>England,</hi>
wherein the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath complyed as well as could
be desired. <hi>Coulster</hi> is judged the fittest man, both for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite

will be at <hi>Callice</hi> by Gods assistance, about the last of <hi>May</hi>

time enough to prevent him, if my last hath not done it already,
since Sir <hi>William Coulster</hi> is imployed, you may be confident of
a speedy return and dexterous mannagement of that businesse,
for by his last he hath gotten great experience about the Tynn,
so that if I durst venture upon it, I would charge Mr. <hi>Carteret</hi>
with a journey to <hi>England</hi> to the King to whom it is necessary
by this ship to make a large and various dispatch, and from the
King to receive againe answers to many particulars, as the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification

Jewell businesse, and the good successe of that which is to be
done hereafter; A Commission under the broad Seale to receive
the Ruby Collar with a blanke for what name the Queen will

hath promised to give me within six dayes. The Copy of the
Ducth Commission for ships of war, that <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> his

to the certaine ruine of the trade of <hi>London.</hi> Letters from his
Majesty to the States concerning the Order of the Garter for
Prince <hi>William,</hi> if they be not already obtained; Besides, that
it were fit that I should give an account to the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:113509:19"/>
all the proceedings here since the returne of the Ambassadours,
and in what state the other businesse is, For all these uses I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Carteret</hi> might better imploy his time with the King,
then at <hi>Truro,</hi> since without doubt Sir <hi>Nicholas Crispe,</hi> and Sir
<hi>William Coulster</hi> can perfectly doe all that is there to be done,
and especially since her Majesty ought as soone as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
it may be, to perfect the grant of the Tynn pre-empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to have a Pattent for it under the broad Seale, without
which perhaps Merchants will make scruple to contract about
it, and for her Majestie to buy all the Tynn with her
owne money, it is thought will prove a thing impossible
for her, and if possible, it would not bee the way of quickest
and greatest gaine. Wherefore all these things being so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be dispatched to the King, if upon <hi>Carterets</hi> arriving
hither it appears unfit to imploy him, Sir <hi>William Boswell</hi> is
of opinion, some other person ought of purpose to be sent,
which shall be done aswell and thristily as can be contrived.
Sir <hi>William Boswell</hi> doth desire your Lordship to persue this
inclosed Copy of the Kings Letter to him concerning the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherein the best way (as he thinkes) is prescribed, that it
be done without the pompe of an Herauld; which way soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it be done, it will cost money, and there is nothing more
certaine then that Sir <hi>William Boswell</hi> is one of the poorest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

worthiest, and most contented servant that the King hath, he
hath a long time lived here upon borrowing, and his thrifty
Lady and he make a little goe farre; For his last imployment
in this kind for the Prince Elector, the King allowed him one
hundred pounds in consideration of the journey hee tooke,
which now is like to be every way as expencefull, the Prince

the King, and to bring her backe an account of his health,
and of the state of his affaires, her resolution of sending
<hi>Cockeram</hi> into <hi>Denmarke,</hi> is without doubt very oportune;
for upon the conclusion of the peace with the <hi>Sweedes</hi> cannot
but be in condition to help us, and if as it shall be in the first
place demanded, he could be prevailed with to give us such an
Army, as might Land in any place, where the King hath no

Forces, without fearing who they mett, their descent at <hi>Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berough</hi>

is a felicity I dare not hope. That which with more assurance
I looke upon, which in the second place shall be sollicited,
would be of infinite use, That is, a small number of men with
some money Armes and Ammunition, and all to goe to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

some of them be horsemen five hundred at least, and these

miraculous: But in the meane estate he is, for want of Horse
(for of that he complaines in his Letter to me) and of Armes

of supplyes of money from <hi>Rome,</hi> but concludes nothing,
the Irish troubling all our solas, untill the Peace be made with
them, I feare all Catholique helpe will be drawne that way:
Upon this purpose I must tell you with what amazement the
delayes of the peace in <hi>Ireland</hi> is considered here, and you leave
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113509:21"/>
us so ignorant of the condition of the treaty, that we know
not what to say of it. Pray by the returne of this bearer, or
the first likely passage, send me the state of it, their demand, the
King of <hi>England</hi> his offers, and what you know of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
If yet it be not concluded, it is not like that ever it will
be, by those that mannage it now, And therefore it seemes to
me for satisfaction of those that so much presse it, of the Irish
and to satisfy this state, who are much of that opinion, and to
secure our hopes at <hi>Rome</hi> and lastly to put that businesse into a
possibility of being concluded, that the proposition long since
made to the King, of having the treaty made here by the
Queene and Queene Regent, were not unfitly resumed. For
I am confident the King by this meanes, might have the peace
upon better tearmes, and might limit the Queene by the same
instructions that those that now treate are bound by, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, one of these fruits would follow, that either—should have the peace, or the exorbitancy of their demands
would be so apparent to the Queene Regent, that we should
have great advantage by that; The only thing I feare is, that
the King his party in <hi>Ireland</hi> might possibly not acquiesse, in
such a peace, as would be fit for the King to make, and then
he would have the scandall of it (for it will be a scandalous
one, that is unavoidable) without the benefit of an assistance
from <hi>Ireland:</hi> to conclude if nothing be done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I
think it most necessary that the offers of treating be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
from thence, and that the Queene may be trusted to
Treate and conclude with the Queene Regent here, with such as
the Catholiques from <hi>Ireland</hi> shall appoint. This I write to
you to consider of it, by the returne of Sir D: <hi>Wyit</hi> you

<hi>Fitz-Willams,</hi> with her owne hand, it is the first

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113509:22"/>
which now God be thanked is totally gone, she refers the King
to me for severall things, I shall begin with that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
this bearer, who is a brave man, and hath served in the
wars of this Country with great reputation, he doth perswade
himselfe, that if the Peace be made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he shall be
able to raise there for the King, and bring into <hi>England</hi> ten or
twelve thousand men, upon the conditions that you will find
here enclosed, signed by the Queen, which he desired his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
should Signe for this end, that the King might see it was
her opinion that the King upon this designe of his, should
signe some others to him, to the same effect, so that you are to
keep the Paper Signed by the Queen, and to propose to the
King the signing of something to the same effect, if he approve
of the businesse, which the Queen believes the King will find
cause to doe, being by the opinion of many others, knowing
in the affaires of <hi>Ireland</hi> induced to believe so, more then by
the confidence of his undertakings, which yet may passe for
someground, he having upon severall occasions already, both
for the raising and recruiting of those Troopes with which he
hath served this State, found himselfe very willingly followed
by his Conutry-men; You will observe part of his demands
to consist of a considerable body of Horse that must meet at
the place agreed on for his landing, Marquesse <hi>Newcastle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here, and acquainted with this Proposition, and foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the landing can only be towards the North in <hi>Lancashire,</hi>
hath believed he might not be an improper person for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of this body of Horse to this conjunction, and believes
further, that the stage for it being among his friends he may
serve usefull in it, how reasonably this is imagined cannot be
determined here, for it must rest upon the disposition that the
Kings Troopes in generall will be in, when the resolution for
this particular shall be taken to determine whether M. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,</hi>
or any other may be fit for the charge of Conducting a
body of Horse to this conjunction with the Collonel, in case
the King thinke fit to set forward the businesse, and that he be
so fortunate as to goe through with it, the Queen doth approve
of, but not as a thing to be much relied on, for it is a great
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113509:23"/>
thing that will remaine to be done on the Collonels part, if
the King should be able on his to comply with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
which the Queen besieves his Majesty in no estate for,
neither doth she thinke they are demanded so much in hopes
of having them performed, as that the promise should give
him meanes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the better to bring about underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
but rather, as that which when it shall faile, if it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
no other enterprise of the same kind more like to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the effects aimed at in this, which she hopes you will have
a care of, can be of no inconvenience, and therefore adviseth
you to consider it very seriously, and in what resolution soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shall be taken, that there be a speciall care had of giving
the person of the Collonel all sorts of satisfaction, as a man
fully deserving it, and zealously affected to the Kings service,
if M. <hi>New.</hi> should be thought fit to have the charge of any
Troopes appointed to joyne with those he shall bring, he is
well contented all should fall under his command, and he to
command under him, if any other hee must bee chosen, as
that the Collonel may command him as Generall, this is as
much as need be said to you of this matter. Pray doe me the
favour to let the Collonel know I have recommended him to
you, and use him very kindly; I have this night received se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall

within few dayes, for we grow very neere concluding
of all our expectation there, what will be the issue though as
neere as we are, no man can tell, and the knowledge of it is no
more of moment in that point, which heretofore was to be
considered in it, how much influence it was to have in the
swaying towards an accommodation, or to the continuance
of the Warre, for it seemes the Lott is cast as to that matter,
and if we save not our selves with our swords, there is little
other hope of doing it, the knowledge of it would be of use in
another respect, for if the issue were to be a Declaration of the
States, to which would follow that of <hi>France<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> there would be
in that such a reserve of helpe, and so solid foundation of
strength to carry through with this Warre, as there would be
lesse necessity of exposing the fortune of it to frequent hazards,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:113509:23"/>
the game might be more securely played, whereas if now we
saw our selves totally without hopes of this support, may be
that would demand more sudden and lesse seeure tryalls then
else we should have cause to attempt; For this cause it is a
great affliction to me, that I cannot so soone as I would give
you that which might be some guide to your Counsells, pray
believe it is not my fault, since I am not without the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the use you might make of it, as you see, and that
upon my word, I am not negligent in it, which I desire you
to represent to the King. The businesse of the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi>
is not in the same state which the rest are, our hopes of money
here, or breake with the Duke; The passing over of them, if
it be obtained, will be of so great expence here, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

penaltyes to be taken off, with such other poynts, as are already
condescended unto, That the Marquesse of <hi>Ormond</hi> is resolved
never to condescend to the demands of the Irish, and by the
Irish, that they are resolved to have them or perish. I proposed
to the Marquesse of <hi>Ormond</hi> the condition the King was in,
and how necessary it was for him to have from the Irish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continant
army from hence, and how the absolute ruine and
destruction of the Irish depended on the least losse the King
should sustayne in <hi>England</hi> for want of army; I said as much
to the Irish, Both have promised me a breife of the obstacles, on
perusall of which I shall quickly discover whether the Irish
have, or not, a just pretence to except against such offers as hath
beene made by the Marquesse of <hi>Ormond,</hi> on the behalfe of the
King, and if found satisfactory, I am very confident you will
speedily have what you expect, and the Character the King
the Queene, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gave of me will render him to you very ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable

               <p>IT is a great comfort to us to heare by this expresse, that her
Majesty preserves her health, notwithstanding that trouble
of mind which our misfortunes must needs have given her,
and that in stead of despairing, her Majesty and you doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
improve your diligence to procure us aydes, God send
that your hopes may succeed, for my part, I thinke there is
more probability in that of <hi>Denmarke</hi> for man, now the peace
is concluded with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and for money, from <hi>Roome,</hi>
then any other way, the busines of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath hung long
in suspence, although the King hath long since given my
Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> power to conclude Peace there, upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
utmost concession that can possibly be yeilded unto, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
causing a revolt, not only of all his party here, but also
such a one of his Army, and all his Protestant subjects there,
as would make it impossible for the Irish to afford us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
aydes, they would have so much to doe within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against those that would not submit to Peace, upon such
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113509:26"/>
tearmes, the truth of it is, the Irish have proceeded hitherto, as if
they had no good intention; having not been contented with the
offers of more, then their Agents did prosesse to expect, and insisted
upon those demands, the granting of which they could not. but see
would be absolutely destructive to his Majesty, that is the granting
unto them the Protestant Churches in such parishes, where the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Catholicks was greater, that is in effect all through <hi>Ireland.</hi>
And whereas you write, that perhaps my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> is not
the fit person to conclude that businesse, but that the mannagement
of it should be remitted to the Queen, I am much afeard, that the
expectation of that in the Irish, hath much retarded the hoped for
issue of the Treaty, but God be thanked wee received men; Now
the certaine newes that the Peace there is concluded, and that an
Expresse from my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> is upon his way from <hi>Chester,</hi>
with all the particulars, the utmost extent of my Lord of <hi>Ormonds</hi>
power to grant was, the suspention of <hi>Poy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ings</hi> act, as to the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of such Bills as should be first agreed on; The repeale of the
penall Lawes, and the allowing the Papists some Chappels in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
places for the exercise of their Religion, but you may not take
notice that he had so large a power, for happily he may have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Peace upon a better bargaine, thus much for that businesse;
his Majesty approves very well of the course proposed by you for
such aydes as may be obtained from <hi>Denmarke,</hi> but above all things,
let the matter of money be laboured in, for without some competent
stock of that against the next Spring, it will be impossible for us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to have a resourse againe. My former Letters will have acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you with our progresse since our retreate from <hi>Wales,</hi> and the
reasons of it, and I make no doubt but you will be satisfied, that the
Kings businesse hath been as well conducted in that retreate from
<hi>Wales</hi> and since, as the desperateness of our condition could admit
of, and that in fine, we are likely to have gained the only thing wee
could hope for, which was to preserve his Majesties person safe, till
the season of the yeare should secure him in any of his principall
Garrisons from the danger of a Siege; 'Tis true, I could have wisht
that the Rebells had given us some leisure, either in the North, or at
<hi>Huntington,</hi> where we have done them some mischiefe, and gained
some reputation, and not obliged us to goe to <hi>Oxford</hi> yet this fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
but pressing us as they have done, and doe, it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113509:27"/>
but I hope it is not possible, that they can any wayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
<hi>Oxford</hi> before the Winter relieve it; You write to me to
tell you freely our condition without flattering you or my selfe, you
will find in my Letters of late, especially by <hi>Porter,</hi> that I have not
been guilty of that fault, nor shall I now, but the freedome which I
shall at this time use in stating to you the greatest misterie of our
misfortunes, I desire may be received by you, as the breathings out
of my soule unto my dearest friend by way of prediction. It is most
true, that as desperate as our condition seems, I have no apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but that having got thus farre in the yeare, we shall bee safe till
the next, from any further great mischiefes, and that probably by
helpes from <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and moneys from you, our
quarters being well mannaged for the preservation and recruite of
our remaining Forces, we may possibly have a fresh and hopefull
resourse the next Spring; these hopes I am confident the condition
of our businesse it selfe will beare, would the humours of our owne
party beare the patience; But alas, my Lord, we must not expect it,
there is such an universall wearinesse of the warre, dispaire of a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
for the King to recover, and so much of private Interests
growne from these upon every body, that I protest to God, I do not
know foure persons living besides my selfe and you, that have not
already given cleare demonstrations, that they will purchase their
own &amp; (as they flatter themselves) the kingdoms quiet at any price,
to the King, to the Church, to the faithfullest of his party, &amp; to deale
freely with you, I doe not thinke it will be in the Kings power to
hinder himselfe from being forced to accept such Conditions as the
Rebells will give him, and that the next newes you will heare, after
we have been one Moneth at <hi>Oxford</hi> will be, that I and those few
others, who may be thought by our Councells to fortifie the King
in firmnesse to his principalls, shall be forced, or torne from him; and
you will find the prime Instruments, to impose the necessity upon the
King of submitting to what they &amp; most of the Kings party at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
shall thinke fit. Truly I have great confidence in the Kings ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
&amp; steddines, &amp; I am much improved in it by this enclosed Letter
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he wrote in his great distress in <hi>Wales,</hi> upon occasion of declaring
unto him there was nothing left for him to do but to seek conditions,
I protest to God I knew nothing either of the letter or the occasion
til a good while after it was sent, but having then gained a sight of it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113509:27"/>
I got leave to communicate a coppy of it only to the Queene, and to
your selfe. My deare Lord, I shall adde no more at this time but only
to conjure you, first to beleive that if I have any truth or honour in me,
I have not the least unfriendly thought in the world towards any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
or poynted at in this Letter more then purely in relation to the
Kings service, and in the next place that though I stand single against
all the world, I shall not vary a tittle from those foundations of justice
and right to the honour and interest of my gracious Master and Mistris
which I have professed my selfe built upon, and that I will in spight of
the world carry to my grave the honour of a servant entirely faithfull
and unbiast, and of being worthy that happy relation to you of your

               <p>VVE have received nothing this week from you, but find by

they must make with their Enemies at this time, if they fall into
their hands by any way whatsoever. I am now most confident if
wee hold out till next Spring, between this and that we shall find
powerfull Forain succours. The design of—of which I have
often written to you, may now in my judgement be reckoned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

as good advance as was possible; since wee got the money,
there is good reason to expect that within tow Moneths (they are
promised sooner) we shall have—. This in it self may
prove a great thing, but it is considered how it lookes upon the
condition of our Affaires, that are very unlike to <hi>receive</hi> but by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Forain assistance, which reasonably is not to bee helped without
securing their passage, nothing sure can appeare so necessary for
us: therefore pray take great care that there bee no delay in the
dispatch of all things belonging to it, when there shall be recourse
to you in that behalf. I omit to tell you more particulars of this
businesse, both in what estate it is, and how it hath been retarded;
but weekly now you shall be advertised. I heare there is some stop

is to be attended untill the end of their <hi>Campagne;</hi> for I confesse I
am so far abused in the businesse, as to beleeve it is equally hard to
say we shall obtain no such thing, as to assure it now; for without
doubt there is no desire here to see the Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
into another Government, and there is as little doubt that
there are strong inclinations for the persons of the King and
Queen, and desire to contribute to their re-establishment; the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> the beating them during the war, or
making a glorious peace, I confesse are passions that prevail more,
and it is no wonder, in the meane time we receive great curtesies.

things in a VVagon; I thank God I lost none of mine; it
will certainly be fit for your Majestie to consider, and to give your
advise how we should behave our selves now, as to the avowing of
those Forain Treaties, which can be no longer a secret, especially
that of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in case our late disaster hath not
cooled his affection to the alliance; it will also be necessary the true
Copies of all those Letters which have past between the King and
your Majesty, be transmitted hither with all possible speed, for
it will be impossible to answer and allay those scandalls which
they will raise from them without that help, but with it, if the
King hath writ nothing but what I have had the honour to bee
trusted with, I am confident there is nothing in them but will heare
a very faire construction.</p>
               <p>I am commanded by the King to repeat unto your Majesty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I writ it formerly at large unto my Lord <hi>Iermin,</hi> that in
what concerned Sir <hi>Io. Greenvills</hi> being made of the Princes Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
the King would not have let the Prince have his will in
it, although the young Man be the most meriting in <hi>England,</hi> had
not the Princes engagements been so publike, as that it could not
have been refused him without such an affront to his Highnesse in
that place, as must needs have drawn great dishonour upon him,
and great inconvenience to his Majesties service. I must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
without humbly acknowledging your Majesties great Justice
in your contempt of those scandalls which his Majesties enemies
have endeavoured to cast upon me; unto which I shall onely say
thus much more, that I have been so pure a Virgin in point of my
integrity to His and your Majestie, that I thanke God, no body
yet ever durst ask me a question as to my own Interests. And as for
any private negotiation, you may be sure I shall never proceed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but with your Majesties preceding approbation, be it upon terms
never so just, nor shall I though with your consent, ever vary from

those principles which you have by you in a paper drawne by me,

persons in the highest trust of the Kings and your service; this
confidence I beg of you as to the publike, and another in what
concernes matter of advantages and favours of my Master, that as
for my selfe and nearest friends, I will never accept of any but by

it shall not be in such as these to work his ruine, which will bee

In my last, I did intimate somewhat concerning Irish; I
did it not out of any ill wil, God knows, I bear to them, but out of
my zeal to his Majesty: I wish it may not be true, for indeed I feare
it. A strong Argument is but lately suggested unto my reason, the
Rebells have granted 2000 then to the assistance of <hi>Spaine</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
all the world may see that by this action they must needs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
both the <hi>French, Portugalls, Holland</hi> States; into which fires
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113509:31"/>
they would not thrust themselves you may bee certain, had
they not strong assurances of some present benefit, greater
in consequence to their affaires in hand, then all the other
can be prejudiciall to it; and seeing the lownesse of the Spanish
condition, and the symptom of ruine on all sides attending chat
Crown, it is easily resolved what they build upon. And that
<hi>Spain</hi> doth assure them for this assistance they will take of the Irish
from his Majesty in this time of exigence, which tis possible they
may effect, considering the present Pope is Spanish, and hath an
Ambassador in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who beares the greatest stroke in those
affaires; and who, if you will doe any thing effectuall, there
must chiefly be wrought upon. I wonder at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

And I will tell you, there is not a more sincere, honourable
and fast friend, or one more easily oblieged. In fine, I have erred
much in that conversation which formerly I have had with him,
if there be three in Europe greater Masters of the Art of War, and

want. In my last, I signified what constructions was already made
here of your going to the North to your Lordships disadvantage;
the report of going into <hi>Ireland</hi> was never plyed so as now; your
voyage into <hi>Scotland</hi> is breathed out by the Lord <hi>Portland,</hi> who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day exalts his malice to a higher key; it was his brother, who;
together with <hi>P. R.</hi> gave birth to the first; and himself who gives
life and authority to both. In good earnest, if some timely course
be not taken, you will find him a dangerous man, his absence is no
lesse necessary, then those that are in <hi>France</hi> already; this any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
commanded seriously to recommend unto you, that person
when he hath brought the Faction here to a maturity, is resolved
to goe to the West, what the consequence of that will bee, I need
not intimate; his brother deserves strict observation and notice,
for he gives continuall notice of what happens at Court, worthy
the knowledge of the Junto here; and is as it were the Spy upon
you there. Here hath been a solemne expectation of P. <hi>R.</hi> these 3
days, and great jollity God knows amongst the Cumberlanders;
but why they expect still, I know not. Something is lamenting here
concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> and P. <hi>R.</hi> but what it is, I dare not yet affirm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have hold only of the skirts of it, &amp; have not made a ful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
it is I think either about his going, or at least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ending some
body to comply with them. The Junto had a meeting last night,
where it was resolved good use might bee made now against you
with the Irish, upon occasion of your late Letter, if it be well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and the best use made of it, and that P. R. may upon that

though I much distrust it, but there is no remedy. I had
almost forgot to tell your Lordship that the men here have resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
lately to get into Mr. <hi>Ashburnhams</hi> bosome by one means or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for the Junto holds him a very necessary person for their
ends, and therefore must be laid hold of; but one of them affirmes
him to be a slippery piec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we are in so good state, that I am confident the Rebels (though all
