            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For with the hart man beleeueth vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, and with the mouth man confesseth vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi> Therefore was it, that one being desirous to obtayne saluation, asked of the Apostles, <hi>What must I do, that I may be saued?</hi> Who answered: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue</hi>

Therfore as the Passion of Christ serueth to none, but such as do beleeue: so neyther doth Fayth (as it is only a bare qualitie or action in mans minde) it selfe iustefie, vnles it be directed to the body of Christ crucified, as to her obiect, of whom she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth all her vertue. And therefore these two
<pb facs="tcp:6317:4"/>
must alwayes ioyntly concurre and holde togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Fayth, &amp; Christ Iesus, crucified. This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise following (gentle Reader) teacheth the vse, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and vertue of Fayth, in such abundant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner, as it were all one for me to cast a drop of water into the Sea, as to take vpon me to enlarge any matter therevpon: And yf I should, or could; I can but reiterate or repeate that which already hath been set downe. For the Booke doth so set foorth it selfe (as in my poore vnderstanding) needeth lytle helpe: sauing that some few wordes that were wrong placed, I haue amended, &amp; some others I haue added, for the better explanation of the Authour: And I haue els folowed the former Coppie, with a briefe collection or exposition of a summe of <hi>S. Paules</hi> doctrine deliuered vpon the same, set foorth before (but lying hid as it were) in a great volume: which I haue also thought meete &amp; very necessary, were put into a smaller volume, to the intent to be caried about with vs (as a flower or hearbe in our bosome) for our oftener remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce &amp; instruction. This Hearbe being once knowen, it is sayd by the Authour, you haue the pith of al Diuinitie: written and set foorth by that learned, godly, and zelous Martire, M. <hi>Patericke Hamelton,</hi> being a Scottishman borne, and of the kings blood: who (as is set foorth in the booke of Martyrs) taught, and earnestly preached the trueth to the people, and refelled their abuses, constantly &amp; stoutly susteining the quarrell of Gods Gospell, in the time of ignorance and blindnesse: Through
<pb facs="tcp:6317:4"/>
which occasion (as is also there set foorth) he was cited to appeare before the Archbyshyp of <hi>Sainct Andrew,</hi> named <hi>Iames Beton,</hi> and his Colledge of Priestes, the first day of March <hi>Ann.</hi> 1527. And the same day at after dinner in all haste, was had away to the fyer, and burned; the king then being but a childe, which made the Archbyshoppe more bolde. The which Treatise (gentle Reader) as I cannot commende vnto you in that measure, as it deserueth or requireth: So do I confesse in my selfe such want of habilitie, knowledge, and skill, as most vnworthy of al others, to set foorth so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a matter, of so high a nature or mysterie. But it pleaseth Almightie God by troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to bring his chyldren to the exercise of many of those vertues, that do belong to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man; And in tribulation, Fayth is chiefly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, in considering the cause of Gods exercising of vs: and in beleeuing most assuredly the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses he hath made for our delyuerance. In which consideration, I hauing passed somtyme in my greeuous and sorrowfull troubles of aduersaries, I spent that time chiefly, in vnderstanding and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting this Treatise folowing; which is able so to instruct, teach, and geue such heauenly lyght and comfort vnto vs (yf we be desirous and willing to seeke thereaster) as may vndoubtedly redounde to our euerlasting lyfe and saluation; as our sauiour Christ him selfe teacheth vs: <hi>This is lyfe eternall, that they know thee to be the only true God, and whom</hi>

               <p>THis litle Treatise of M. <hi>Patericks Places,</hi> albeit in quantitie it be but short, yet in effect it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth matter able to fill large volumes, declaring to vs the true doctrine of the Law, of the Gospel, of Fayth, and of Workes, with the nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and also the difference of the same: which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is thus to be vnderstanded. That in the cause <note place="margin">The Law and the Gospell how they are to be ioyned, and how to be seperated.</note> of Saluation, and in the office of Iustefiyng, these are to be remoued and seperated a sunder, the Law from the Gospell, and Fayth from Workes; otherwyse in the person that is iustefied, and also in order of doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, they ought commonly to go necessarily togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Therefore, whersoeuer any question or doubt ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of Saluation, or our iustefying before God, there the Law, and all good workes, must be vtterly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and stande a part, that Grace may appeare free, <note place="margin">Grace free, Promise sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Fayth alone.</note> the Promise simple, and that Fayth may stand alone: which Fayth alone (without Law or workes) worketh to euery man particularly his saluation, through meere promise, and the free grace of God. This word (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly) I adde, for the particular certefiyng of euery <note place="margin">Particularly.</note> mans hart priuatly and peculiarly, that beleeueth in Christ. For as the body of Christ is the cause efficient of the redemption of the whole worlde in generall, so is Fayth the instrumentall cause, by which euery man applyeth the sayd body of Christ crucified, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to his owne saluation: So that in the action and office of iustefication, both Law and workes here be vtterly secluded and exempted, as thinges ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nothing to do in this behalfe. The reason is
<pb facs="tcp:6317:17"/>
this; for, seeing that all our Redemption vniuersally, springeth onely from the body of the Sonne of God crucified, there is nothing that can stand vs in stead, but that onely, wherewith this body of Christ is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. Now forasmuch as neither the Law, nor Workes, but Fayth onely, is the thing which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the body and death of Christ; therefore Fayth only is that matter which iustefieth euery soule <note place="margin">Fayth is the onely instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cause of euery mans parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular saluetio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> The body of Christ the obiect of our fayth.</note> before God, through the strength of that obiect which it doth apprehende: For the obiect only of our Fayth, is the body of Christ; lyke as the brason Serpent was the obiect of the Israelites looking, and not of their hands working: by the strength of which obiect, through the promise of God, immediatly proceeded health to the beholders: So the body of Christ being the obiect of our Fayth, yeeldeth or striketh righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes to our soules; not through working, but in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing onely.</p>
               <p>Thus you see how Fayth, being the onely eye of our soule, standeth alone with her obiect, in case of <note place="margin">Fayth is only the eye of the soule which looketh to Christ.</note> iustefying: But yet neuertheles in the body she stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not alone; for besides the eye, there be also hands to worke, feete to walke, eares to heare, and other members moe, euery one conuenient for the seruice of the body; and yet there is none of them all that can see, but the eye: So in a Christian mans lyfe, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of doctrine, there is the Law, there is Repentance, there is Hope, Charitie, and deedes of Charitie; all which in life and in doctrine are ioyned, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily do concurre togeather: And yet in the action of iustefying, there is nothing els in man, that hath any part or place, but only Fayth, apprehending the obiect, which is, the body of Christ Iesus for vs cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: In whom consisteth all the worthines and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, of our saluation, by Fayth; that is, by our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending

               <head>In the doctrine of the Law, three <hi>thinges to be noted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>In the Law therefore, three thinges are to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. First, what is the true vigor and strength of the <note place="margin">The first poynt.</note> Law: which is, to require full and perfect obedience of the whole man, not onely to restraine his outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but also his inwarde motions and inclinations of will and affection, from the appetite of sinne: And therefore sayth <hi>S. Paule, <hi>The Law is spirituall, but I</hi>
                  </hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>am carnall. &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  </hi> 7. Whereupon riseth this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition (that is) That it is not in our nature or power to <note place="margin">The strength of the Law.</note> fulfill the Law. Item, the Law commandeth that which is to vs vnpossible, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The seconde thing to be noted in the doctrine of the Law, is to consider the time and place of the Law, what <note place="margin">The seconde poynt.</note> they be, and how farre they extende. For as the surging Seas haue their bankes and barres to keepe them in: so the Law hath his times and limits, which it ought not to passe. If Christ had not come and suffered, the time and dominion of the Law had been euerlasting: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. The death of Christ is the death of the Law: that is, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law.</note> but now, seeing Christ hath come, and hath dyed in his righteous flesh, the power of the Law against our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flesh doth cease: for, <hi>the ende of the Law is Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  </hi> 10. (that is) The death of Christes body is the death of the Law, to all that beleeue in him. So that whosoeuer repenteth their sinnes, and flie to the death
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6317:19"/>
and passion of Christ, the condemnation and time of the Law to them is expired. Wherefore this is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode as a perpetuall rule in the Scripture, that the Law, with all his sentences and iudgements whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they are written, eyther in the olde Testament or in the new, do euer include a priuie exception of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and beliefe in Christ, to the which alwayes it <note place="margin">The time of the Law, how long it last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Galla.</hi> 3.</note> geueth place, hauing there his ende, and can proceede no further, according as <hi>S. Paule</hi> doth say, <hi>The Law is our Scholemaister vntill Christ, that we might be iustified by Fayth. <hi>Galla.</hi>
                  </hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as the Law hath his time how long to reigne: so also it hath his proper place where to reigne. By the reigne of the Law, here is meant the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Law. For as the time of the Law ceasseth, <note place="margin">The time of the Law ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, when fayth begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</note> when the fayth of Christ in a true repenting hart begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: so hath the Law no place in such as be good and faythfull (that is) in sinners repenting and amending, but onely in them which be euyll and wicked. Euyll men here I call all such, which walking in sinful flesh, are not yet driuen by earnest repentance to flie to Christ for succoure. And therefore sayth <hi>S. Paule, <hi>To the</hi>
                  </hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>iust man there is no Law set, but to the vniust and disobedient. &amp;c. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi>
                  </hi> 1. By the iust man here is meant, not he which neuer had disease, but he who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing his disease, seeketh out the phisition: and being cured, keepeth him selfe in health, as much as he may from any moe surfettes: Notwithstanding he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so keepe him selfe, but that his health (that is, his new obedience) shal alwayes remayne frayle and vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and shall continually neede the Phisition. Where, <note place="margin">1. The disease 2. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the disease. 3. The Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> by the way, these three thinges are to be noted: First, the sicknes it selfe. Second, the knowing of the sicknes. Thirde, the Phisition. The sicknes, is sinne. The knowing of the sicknes, is repentance, which the Law
<pb facs="tcp:6317:20"/>
worketh. The Phisitian is Christ. And therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in remission of our sinnes, Repentance is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Fayth, yet it is not the dignitie or worthines <note place="margin">Repentance is ioyned with fayth, yet it is no cause of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> of repentance that causeth remission of sinnes, but only the worthines of Christ, whom Fayth onely apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, no more then the feeling of the disease is the cause of health, but onely the Phisition: for els, when a man is cast &amp; condempned by the Law, it is not repentance that can saue or deserue lyfe: but if his pardon come, then is it the grace of the Prince, and not his repentance that saueth him.</p>
               <p>The thirde poynt to be considered in the doctrine of the Law, is this, That we marke well the ende and <note place="margin">The thirde poynt.</note> purpose why the Law is geuen: which is, not to bring vs to saluation, not to worke Gods fauoure, nor to make vs good, but rather to declare and conuince our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and to make vs feele the danger thereof: to this ende and purpose, that we seeing our condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being in our selues confounded, may be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thereby to haue our refuge in Christ the sonne of God, and to submit our selues to him, in whom onely is to be found our remedie, and in none other. And this ende of the Law discreetely ought to be pondered of all Christians: otherwyse they that consider not this ende and purpose of the Law, fall into manifolde errours and inconueniences.

               <p>FIrst, that we through the misunderstanding of the <note place="margin">The syrst Caution.</note> Scriptures, do not take the Law for the Gospel, nor the Gospel for the Law: but skilfully discerne &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct the voyce of the one from the other. Many there be which reading the booke of the new Testament, doe take and vnderstande, whatsoeuer they see contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the sayd booke, to be onely and meerely the voyce
<pb facs="tcp:6317:22"/>
of the Gospel. And contrariwise, whatsoeuer is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the compasse of the old Testament (that is) within the Law, Stories, Psalmes, &amp; Prophets, to be only and meerely the worde and voyce of the Law; wherein many are deceaued: For the preaching of the Law and of the Gospel are mixed togeather in both the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, as well the olde as the new: Neither is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of these two doctrines to be distincted by Bookes and leaues, but by the diuersitie of Gods spirite, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto vs. For sometimes in the olde Testament God doth comfort: as he comforted <hi>Adam,</hi> with the voyce of the Gospel. Sometimes also in the new Testament, he doth threaten and terrifie: as when Christ threatned the <hi>Pharises.</hi> In some places againe, <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets play the Euangelistes: in so much that <hi>Ierome</hi> doubteth whether he shoulde call <hi>Esay</hi> a Prophet or an Euangelist. In some places likewise, Christ and the Apostles supply the part of <hi>Moses.</hi> And as Christ him selfe vntill his death, was vnder the Law (which Law he came not to breake, but to fulfill:) So his Sermons made to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for the most part, runne all vpon the perfect doctrine and workes of the Law: Shewing and teaching what we ought to do by the right law of Iustice, and what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger insueth in not performing the same: All which places, though they be contayned in the booke of the new Testament, yet are they to be referred to the doctrine of the Law, euer hauing in them included a priuie exception of repentance and fayth in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: as in example, where Christ thus preached.</p>

               <p>Briefly, to know when the Law speaketh, and when <note place="margin">When the Law speaketh and when the Gospel spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</note> the Gospel speaketh, and to discerne the voyce of the one from the voyce of the other, this may serue for a note: that when there is any mortall worke comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done, either for eschewing of punishment, or vpon promise of any rewarde temporall or eternall: ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther els when any promise is made with condition of any worke commaunded in the Law, there is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded the voyce of the Law. Contrarily where the <note place="margin">The promise of the Gospel is without condition.</note> promise of lyfe and saluation is offered vnto vs freely without all our merites, and simply without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition annexed of any Law either naturall, ceremonial, or morall: all these places, whether they be reade in the olde Testament, or in the new, are to be referred to the voyce &amp; doctrine of the Gospel. And this promise of God freely made to vs by the merites of Iesus Christ, so long before prophecied to vs in the olde Testament, and afterwardes exhibited in the new Testament, and now requiring nothing but our fayth in the sonne of God, is called properly the voyce of the Gospel, and
<pb facs="tcp:6317:23"/>
disscreth from the voyce of the Law in this, that it hath no condition adioyned of our meriting, but only respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the merites of Christ the sonne of God: By whose fayth only, we are promised of God to be saued, &amp; iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, according as we reade <hi>Rom. 3. <hi>The righteousnes of God commeth by Fayth of Iesus Christ, in all, and</hi>

                  <hi>vpon all that do beleeue. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The seconde Caution or danger to be auoyded is, <note place="margin">The seconde Caution.</note> that we now knowing how to discerne rightly betweene the Law &amp; the Gospel, and hauing intelligence, not to mistake the one from the other, we must take heede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that we breake not the order betweene these two, taking &amp; applying the Law, where the Gospel is to be applyed, either to our selues, or towardes others: For albeit the Law and the Gospel many times are to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togeather in order of doctrine, yet case may fal some times, that the Law must be utterly sequestred from the Gospel: as when any person or persons do feele them <note place="margin">The Gospel to whom it belongeth.</note> selues with the maiestie of the Law, and iudgement of God, so terrified and oppressed, and with the burden of their sinnes ouerwayed and throwen downe into vtter discomfort, and almost euen to the pit of hell; as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth many times to soft &amp; timerous consciences, euen to Gods good seruants: when such mortified harres do heare either in preaching or in reading, any such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or place of the Scripture, which pertayneth to the law, let them thinke the same nothing to belong to them, no more then a mourning weede belongeth to a mariage <note place="margin">A mourning weede in a mariage feast</note> feast: And therfore remouing vtterly out of their mindes all cogitation of the Law, of feare, of iudgemeut, and condemnation, let them onely set before their eyes the Gospel, the sweete comfort of Gods promises, free for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of sinnes in Christ, grace, redemption, liberty, reioycing, Psalmes, thankes, singing, and a paradice of spiritual iocunditie, &amp; nothing els: thinking thus with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6317:23"/>
them selues, that the law hath done his office in them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, &amp; now must needes geue rome to Christ the sonne <note place="margin">Christ the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filler and the finisher of the Law. Rom. 10</note> of God, who is the Lord &amp; maister, the fulfiller &amp; also the finisher of the law: for, <hi>the ende of the law is Christ. Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third danger to be auoyded is, that we do not use or apply on the contrary side, the Gospel in steade of the <note place="margin">The thirde Caution.</note> Law: For as the other before was euen as much as to put on a mourning gowne in the feast of a mariage: so is this but euen to cast Pearles before Swine, wherein is a great abuse among many. For commonly it is seene, that these worldly Epicures, and secure Momanistes, to whom the doctrine of the Law doth properly appertaine, doe receaue &amp; apply to them selues most principally the sweete promises of the Gospel: and contrariwise, the other contrite &amp; brused hartes, to whom belongeth only the ioyfull tydinges of the Gospel, and not the Law, for the most part receaue &amp; retaine to them selues the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voyce &amp; sentences of the law: wherby it commeth to passe, that many do reioyce where they should mourne: And on the other side, many do feare and mourne, where they neede not. Wherefore to conclude, in priuate use of life, let euery person discreetly discerne betweene the Law and the Gospel, and apply aptly to him selfe, that which he seeth conuenient.</p>
               <p>And againe, in publique order of doctrine, let euery discreete Preacher put a difference betweene the broken <note place="margin">How to ioyne both the Law and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</note> harts of the mourning sinners, &amp; the unrepentant world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges: and so conioyne both the Law with the Gospel, and the Gospel with the Law, that in throwing downe the wicked, euer he spare the weake harted: and againe, so spare the weake, that he do not encorage the ungodly. And thus much concerning the coniunction &amp; difference betweene the Law and the Gospel, upon the occasion of M. Patericks Places.</p>

Qui credunt in ipso. &amp;c. Omnes qui credunt in eo. &amp;c. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes illo in eum credentes illi, in nomen eius.

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then thou seest, as the Passion of Christ is only <note place="margin">The personal cause of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> the efficient or personall cause immediate, of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so is Fayth onely the instrumentall or meane cause, that maketh the merites of Christ to vs auayle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <note place="margin">The instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cause.</note> For as the Passion of Christ serueth to none, but such as do beleeue: so neither doth Fayth (as it is only a bare qualitie or action in mans minde) it selfe iustifie, <note place="margin">How Fayth iustifieth.</note> vnlesse it be directed to the body of Christ crucified, as to his obiect, of whom it receaueth all his vertue. And therefore these two must alwayes ioyntly concurre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, Fayth, and Christ Iesus crucified.</p>
            <p>As for example, When the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were <note place="margin">Example of the brasen Serpent.</note> bid of <hi>Moses,</hi> to looke vp to the Brasen Serpent: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde the Serpent haue helped them, except they

had looked vp: nor yet their looking vpward haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited <note place="margin">Num. 21.</note> them, vnlesse they had directed their eyes vpon the sayd Serpent, as the onely obiect set vp to the same purpose for them to beholde. So our Fayth in lyke case, directed to the body of Iesus our Sauiour, is onely the meanes whereby Christes merites are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto vs, and we now iustified before God: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> who in expresse wordes defining to vs what this Fayth is, and how it iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, <note place="margin">What Fayth is by S. Paule <hi>Rom. 10.</hi>
               </note> sayth: <hi>If thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and beleeue with thy hart, that God raised him from death thou shalt be saued. &amp;c. <hi>Rom. 10.</hi>
               </hi> Besides this, what action or qualitie soeuer is in man, either Hope, Charitie, or any other kinde of Fayth and beleeuing, be it neuer so true, except it apprehende this obiect (which is) the body of Christ the Sonne of God, it serueth not to iustification: And that is the cause why we adde this particle (onely) to Fayth, and say, That Fayth onely in Christ iustifyeth vs, to exclude all other actions, qualities, gyftes, or workes of man, from <note place="margin">Fayth onely.</note> the cause of iustifying: forsomuch as there is no other knowledge nor gyft geuen of God to man, be it neuer so excellent, that can stande before the iudgement of God to iustifycation, or whereunto any promyse of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is annexed, but onely this Fayth, looking vp to the brasen Serpent (that is) to the body of Christ Iesus for vs crucifyed.</p>
            <p>As for example: When the <hi>Turke</hi> sayth, <hi>That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in one lyuing God, that made heauen &amp; earth:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Turkes Fayth.</note> his beliefe therein is true, yet it iustifieth him not, because it lacketh the right obiect: which is Christ. So when the <hi>Iew</hi> sayth, <hi>That he beleeueth in one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Iewes Fayth.</note> 
               <hi>God, maker of heauen and earth:</hi> and beleeueth also, <hi>the same God to be omnipotent, mercifull, iust, and true of promyse, and that he hath elected the seede of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6317:27"/>
               <hi>Abraham:</hi> True it is, that he beleeueth, and yet all this serueth him not, because Christ the sonne of God is not ioyned withall. And though the sayd <hi>Iew</hi> should be neuer so deuout in his prayers, or charitable in almes, or precise in keeping the Law, and beleeued ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so steadfastly that he is elect to be saued: yet he is neuer the nearer to saluation for all this, so long as his Fayth is not grounded vppon the head corner stone, which is the person and body of Christ Iesus, the true Sauiour. After like sort it may be sayd of the <hi>Papict,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Papistes Fayth.</note> when he sayth, <hi>That he is baptised, and beleueth in the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, three persons and one God.</hi> And also confesseth, <hi>Iesus Christ to be the Sonne of God, which dyed for our sinnes, &amp; rose agayne for our righteousnes. &amp;c.</hi> His beliefe therein is true, and in deede woulde saue him, yf he did stay his saluation in his Fayth, and vpon Christ his Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our onely, according to the promyse and grace of God, and goe no further: But that he doth not. For neyther doth he admit Christ onely to be his perfect Sauiour, without the helpe of other Patrons, Heades, Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and Mediatours: nor yet permitteth his Fayth in Christ onely, to be the meanes of his iustifycation, but setteth vp other by meanes, as Hope, Charitie, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse, Coufession, Pennance, Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Merites and Pardons, supposing therby to worke his iustification before God, contrary to the worde of promise, to the Gospel of grace, and to the doctrine of <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>Also <hi>Sainct Paule</hi> in the. 9. to the <hi>Romans</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this righteousnesse which commeth of Fayth, <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> calleth it the righteousnesse of God, in these wordes, <hi>Whom God,</hi> sayth he, <hi>hath set vp for a propitiation by Fayth in his blood, whereby to make manifest</hi>

               <hi>the righteousnes which is of him selfe, in tollerating

our sinnes. &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</hi> By the which righteousnes, it is euident that <hi>Sainct Paule</hi> meaneth the righteousnes of Fayth, which almightie God now reuealeth and maketh manifest by preaching of the Gospel. Wilt <note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of Fayth, why it is called Gods righteousnes.</note> thou see yet more playnely this righteousnes of God, how it is taken in <hi>S. Paule,</hi> for the righteousnes of Fayth: and therfore is called the righteousnes of God, because it is imputed of God onely to Fayth, and not deserued of man. In the same Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the. 3. chapt. aforesaid, his wordes be manifest, <hi>The righteousns of God</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is by fayth of Iesus</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And thus much of the true causes of our iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, <note place="margin">The causes of our saluation distincted.</note> after the doctrine of <hi>Sainct Paule:</hi> concernyng which causes this distinction furthermore by the way is to be added, that as touching the originall causes of our saluation, which be diuers and sundry: some are externall and without vs, some are internall and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs. Of the externall causes which are without vs, the fyrst and principall is the Mercie and grace of God: <note place="margin">Grace and mercy.</note> Of this foloweth Predestination and Election, then commeth Uocation. The last and next cause to vs, is <note place="margin">Election. Vocation. Christes pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> the Death and Bloodshed of Christ, whereby we are redeemed: and all these be externall causes, because they are without vs. Of internall causes that be in man through the gyft of God, there is but one, and no moe in Scripture appoynted (That is) our Fayth <note place="margin">Fayth in Christ.</note> in Christ: which is the gyft of God in vs. Besides this, there is no gyft of God geuen to man, no vertue, worke, merite, nor any thing els, that is any part or cause of our saluation, but onely this gyft of Fayth, to beleeue in Christ Iesus. And this is the cause why <note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; cause why fayth only iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> we holde, that Fayth onely iustifyeth: meanyng, that amongst all the workes, deedes, actions, labours, and opperations whatsoeuer man doth, or can doe, there is
<pb facs="tcp:6317:28"/>
nothing in man that worketh saluation, but onely his Fayth, geuen to him of God, to beleeue in Christ his sonne: folowing therein the trade of <hi>Sainct Paules</hi> teaching, who in precise wordes so ascribeth iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Fayth, that he excludeth all other actions of man, and workes of the Law: And therefore in the fame Epistle to the <hi>Romans, Sainct Paule</hi> reasonyng of the glory of Iustifying, asketh this question, How <note place="margin">Al workes of man exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the glory of iustifying.</note> this glory is excluded, whether by the Law, or workes: and concludeth no: ascribing only the glory thereof to the law of Fayth. And consequently vpon the same he inferreth, <hi>We holde that a man is iustified by Fayth, without the deedes of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how then can that be accompted for any part of our iustifycation, which <hi>Sainct Paule</hi> vtterly debarreth and excludeth in that behalfe. Of which like exclusiues and negatiues, the whole course of <hi>Sainct Paules</hi> doctrine is full, where he still concludeth, <hi>Sine operibus, absque operibus legis, non ex operibus dei donum est, non ex operibus, sed secundum miserecordiam ne quis glorietur.</hi>

els meane, but vtterly to seclude all kinde of mans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and workes of the Law, from the office and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of iustifying. And although he expresseth not the worde (onely) yet vpon his exclusiues and negatiues, this exceptiue must needes be inferred. For in all lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique, the consequent is necessarie and formall: as, one man is suffered to come into the house, and no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son els is suffered to enter but one: <hi>Ergo,</hi> one man only, is suffered to enter into the house. And thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Fayth in Christ, proued to be the onely meane, or instrumentall, or conditionall cause of our Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; no other besides the same alone, by the doctrine of <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sainct Paule</hi> after he hath thus established vs in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of our Saluation, through Fayth in Christ, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs vehemently and with all instance, to good workes, shewing the true vse and ende of good workes: (which is) First to shew our obedience and duetifull <note place="margin">The true vse and ende of good workes.</note> seruice (as we may) vnto God, who hath done so great thinges for vs. Secondly, to relieue our neighbours with our charitie and kindnes, as God hath been kinde to vs his enemies. Thirdly, to stirre vp others by our example, to prayse God, to imbrace the same Religion, and to do the like: For requisite it is, that as God hath beene so mercifull vnto vs, and gracious in eternall gyftes, we should be mercifull likewyse to other in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall commodities. And seeing it hath pleased him of his fatherly goodnes (of our partes so little deserued) to call vs to so high a vocation, to giue the blood of his Sonne for vs, to forgiue vs al our sinnes, to delyuer vs from this present wicked worlde, to make vs citizens of heauen; yea, his children, more then seruants: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ytle then can we doe, and well may he thinke those benefices yll bestowed, if we forgiue not our neighbours, and shew some thing agayne worthy that holy callyng, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="tcp:6317:29"/>
he hath called vs, in mortifying our fleshly lustes here, and studying after heauenly thinges. And finally, if we being prouoked with such loue and kindnes, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not againe some loue for loue, some kindnes for kindnes, seeking how to walke in seruing him (so much as we may) in holinesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of our lyfe. And though our obedience shall alwayes be imperfect, do the best we can: yet reason would, that some obedience we should shew, as louing children, to such a louing father.</p>
            <p>And this is the cause why <hi>Sainct Paule</hi> is so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Good workes iustifie not, but folow the iustified.</note> and vrgent, to call vpon good workes, not that workes should iustifie: but that we being iustified so mercifully and tenderly through his grace, should not abuse his grace in vayne, but endeuour our selues to our vtmost, to render our seruice agayne to him in such conuersation of lyfe, as may most make to his glory, and profite of our neighboure. And though the wordes of our Sauiour seeme in some places, to attribute to our obedience &amp; charitie here in earth, great rewardes in heauen: That is, of his owne free grace &amp; goodnes, so to impute small matters, for great desartes: And not for vs to clayme any meede thereby, or thanke at his hand, as by any worthynes of our doinges, no more then the Seruant when he commeth from the Plough, and seruing the Cattle in the stelde, serueth first his Maister at home, and wayteth vpon his table: the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is not bound (sayth Christ) to thanke his Seruant therefore, and did him sit downe: <hi>So you</hi> (sayth he) <note place="margin">Luk. 17.</note> 
               <hi>when you haue done that is commaunded you, say ye are vnprofitable Seruantes,</hi> ye haue done but what your bounden duetie was to doe. <hi>Luk. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agayne, here also is to be vnderstoode, that where such rewardes be ascribed vnto mens deedes, it is not for the worthynes of the deede it selfe, but for the Fayth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6317:29"/>
of the doer; which Fayth, maketh the worke to be good in Gods sight: For els, yf an Infidel should do the same worke that the Christian doth, it were nothing but meere sinne before God. In that therefore the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mans worke is accepted, be it neuer so small (as to giue a cup of colde water) the same is onely for his Faythes sake that doth it, and not for the worke which is done. Whereby againe we may learne, how Fayth onely doth iustifie a man, &amp; that three maner of wayes. First, it iustifieth the person in making him accepted, <note place="margin">Fayth iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth three maner of wayes.</note> and the childe of God by regeneration, before he begin to do any good worke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it iustifieth a man from sinne, in procuring remission and forgiuenes for the same.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it iustifieth the good deedes and workes of man, not onely in brynging foorth good fruites, but also in making the same workes to be good and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the sight of God <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>The office therefore of Fayth and Workes, is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and must not be confounded.
