            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen several Nations and differing Religions have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any famous mutual intercourse agreed upon some common rites and forms of Religion; because one common effect cannot descend from chance, it is certain they come to them by reason, or tradition from their common Parents, or by imitation; something that hath a common influence. If <hi>Reason</hi> be the principle, then it is more regular and lasting, and admits of no other variety, than as some men grow unreasonable, or that the reason ceases. If <hi>Tradition</hi> be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the fountain, then it is not only universal, and increases as the world is peopled, but remains also so long as we retain reverence to our Parents, or that we do not think our selves wiser than our forefathers. But these two have produced Customs and Laws of the highest obligation: for whatsoever we commonly call <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> it is either a custom of all the world, derived from <hi>Noah</hi> or <hi>Adam;</hi> or else it is therefore done, because natural reason teaches us to do it in the order to the preservation of our selves and the publick.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>imitation</hi> of the customs of a wise Nation, is something less, and yet it hath produced great consent in external rites and offices of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And since there is in Ceremonies so great indifferency, there being no antecedent Law to determine their practice, nothing in their nature to make them originally necessary, they grow into a <hi>Custom</hi> or a <hi>Law,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are capable. For if a wise Prince, or Governour, or a Nation, or a famous family, hath chosen rites of common Religion, such as were consonant to the Analogy of his duty, expressive of his sence, decent in the expression, grave in the form, or full of ornament in their representment; such a thing is capable of no greater reason, and needs no greater authority, but hath been, and may reasonably enough be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated upon the reputation of their wisdom, and disinterested choice,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40276:3"/>
who being known wise persons, or nations, took them first into their religious offices.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Jews and the Gentiles used <note n="a" place="margin">Valer. Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im. l. 1. c. 1.</note> white garments in their holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> offices, and the Christians thought it reasonable enough from so united example to do so too.

The Gentile-Priests used Ring and Staffe and Mitre (saith <hi>Philostratus:)</hi> the Primitive Bishops did so too; and in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> detestation of their follies thought they might wisely enough imitate their innocent customs and Priestly ornaments, and hoped they might better reconcile their minds to the Christian Religion by compliance in ceremonials, than exasperate them by rejecting their ancient and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ceremonies: for so the Apostles invited and inticed Judaism into Christianity.</p>

His Priests marry but once; he hath his virgins, and his abstemious and continent followers: that what Christians love and the world commends in them, being adopted into the rituals of Idolatry, may allure some with the beauty and fair imagery, and abuse others with colour and phantastick faces.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus also all wise men that intended to perswade others to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> religion, did it by retaining as much as they innocently could of the other, that the change might not be too violent, and the persons be more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared by common rites and the relation and charity of likeness and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Thus did the Church and the Synagogue; thus did the Gentiles both to the Jews and to the Christians; and all wise men did so.</p>

                     <p>But when all wise people, nay when absolutely all the world have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented upon a Rite, it cannot derive from a fountain lower than the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> but it must either be a Command which God hath given to all the world: (and so <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Xenophon, Quod ab omnibus gentibus observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 4. de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis &amp; dict. Socr.</note>

law descending from our common parents, or a reason derived from the nature of things; there cannot in the world be any thing great enough to take away such a rite, except an express divine commandment: and a man by the same reason may marry his nearest relative, as he may deny to worship God by the recitation of his praises and excellencies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause reason and a very common tradition have made almost all the world consent in these two things, that we must abstain from the mixtures of our nearest kindred, and that we must worship God by recounting and declaring excellent things concerning him.</p>
                     <p>I have instanced in two things in which I am sure to find the fewest adversaries, (I said, the fewest; for there are some men which have lost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> all humanity:) but these two great Instances are not attested with so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal a tradition and practice of the world, as this that is now in question. For in some nations they have married their sisters, so did the <hi>Magi</hi> among the <hi>Persians:</hi>

But there was never any people but had their Priests and Presidents of religious rites, and kept holy things within a mure, that the people might not approach to handle the mysteries: and therefore besides that it is a recession from the customs of mankind, and charges us with the dis-respect of all the world (which is an incurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness next to infinite) it is also a doing against that which all the reason of all the wise men of the world have chosen antecedently, or <hi>ex pòst facto,</hi> and he must have a strange understanding, who is not perswaded by that which hath determined all the world.</p>
                     <p>For religion cannot be at all in communities of men without some to guide, to minister, to preserve and to prescribe the offices and ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: what can profane holy things but that which makes them common? and what can make them common more than when common persons handle them, when there is no distinction of Persons in their ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For, although places are good accessories to religion, yet in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions they were so accidental to it, that a sacrifice might hallow the place, but the place (unless it were naturally impure) could not dese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the sacrifice: and therefore <hi>Iacob</hi> worshipped upon a stone, offered upon a turf; and the Ark rested in <hi>Obed-Edom</hi>'s house, and was holy in <hi>Dagon</hi>'s Temple; and hills and groves, fields and orchards, according to the several customs of the Nations, were the places of address: But a common person ministring, was so near a circumstance, and was so ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the action, that since that material part and exterior actions of Religion could be acted and personated by any man, there was scarce any thing left to make it religious, but the attrectation of the rites by a holy person; A <hi>Holy place</hi> is something, <hi>a separate time</hi> is something, <hi>a prescript form of words</hi> is more, and <hi>separate and solemn actions</hi> are more yet; but all these are made common by a common person, and therefore without a distinction of persons have not a natural and reasonable distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of solemnity and exterior religion.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it were a great disreputation to religion, that all great and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> publick things, and every artifice or profitable science should in all the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of men be distinguished by professors, artists, and proper ministers; and only religion should lie in common, apt to be bruised by the hard hand of mechanicks, and sullied by the ruder touch of undiscerning and undistinguished persons; for although the light of it shines to all, and so far every mans interest is concerned in religion, yet it were not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40276:4"/>
handsome that every man should take the taper in his hand; and religion is no more to be handled by all men, than the laws are to be dispensed by all, by whom they are to be obeyed; though both in religion and the laws, all men have a common interest.</p>
                     <p>For since all means must have some equality or proportion towards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> their end, that they may of their own being or by institution be symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, it is but reasonable that by elevated and sublimed instruments we should be promoted towards an end supernatural and divine; now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that of all the instruments of distinction, the Person is the most principal and apt for the honour of Religion (and to make our Religion honourable is part of the Religion it self) it is also apt for the uses of it, such as are, preserving the rights, ordering, decent ministration, dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the laws of Religion, judging causes, ceremonies and accidents; and he that appoints not offices to minister his Religion, cares not how it is performed; and he that cares so little, will find a great contempt pass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and a cheapness meaner than of the meanest civil offices; and he that is content with that, cares not how little honour God receives, when he presents to him a cheap, a common, and a dishonourable Religion.</p>
                     <p>But the very natural design of Religion forces us to a distinction of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> persons, in order to the ministration; for besides that every man is not fit to approach to God with all his <hi>sordes,</hi> and adherent indispositions; an assignment in reason must be made of certain persons, whose calling must be holy, and their persons taught to be holy, by such a solemn and religious assignment; that those persons being made higher than the people by their Calling and Religion, and yet our brethren in Nature, may be intermedial between God and the people, and present to God the peoples needs, and be instrumental to the reconveying Gods blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those whose fiduciaries they are. This last depends upon Gods own act and designation, and therefore must afterwards be proved by testimonies of his own, that he hath accepted such persons to such purposes; but the former part we our selves are taught by natural reason, by the rules of proportion, by the honour we owe unto Religion, by the hopes of our own advantages, and by the distance between God and us towards which we should thrust up persons as high as they are capable. And that all the world hath done prudently in this, we are confirmed by Gods own act, who knowing it was most agreeable, not only to the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion, and of our addresses to God, but to our meer necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties also, did in his glorious wisdom send his Son, and made him apt to become a mediator between himself and us, by cloathing him with our nature, and decking him with great participation of his own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, that He might do our work, the work of his own humane nature, and by his great sanctity and wisdom approach near to Gods mercy-seat, whither our imperfections and sins could not have near ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
                     <p>And this consideration is not only good Reason but true Divinity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> and was a consideration in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and affixed to the head of a prayer as the reason of their addresses to God in designing ministers in Religion. <hi>O Lord God, who</hi>

                     <p>NOW if Christian Religion should do otherwise than all the world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hath done, either it must be because the rites of Christianity are of no mystery and secret dispensation, but common actions of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary address, and cheap devotion; or else, because we undervalue all Religion, that is, because indeed we have nothing of it: <hi>The first,</hi> is dishonourable to Christianity, and false as its greatest enemy: <hi>The second,</hi> is shame to us: and <hi>both</hi> so unreasonable and unnatural, that if we separate not certain persons for the ministeries of Christianity, we must consess we have the worst Religion, or that we are the worst of men.</p>
                     <p>But let us consider it upon its proper grounds. When Christ had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to himself twelve Apostles, and was drawing now to the last scene of his life, he furnished them with commissions and abilities to constitute and erect a Church, and to transmit such powers as were apt for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation and perpetuity. And therefore to the Apostles in the capacity of Church-officers, he made a promise, <hi>That he would be with them to the end of the world;</hi> they might personally be with him until the end of the world, but he could not be here with them, who after a short course run, was to go hence, <hi>and be no more seen:</hi> and therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40276:6"/>
for the verification of the promise, it is necessary that since the promise was made for the benefit of the Church, and to them as the ministers of the benefit, so long as the benefit was to be dispensed, so long they were to be succeded to, and therefore assisted by the Holy Jesus according to the glorious promise: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <q>Not only to the Apostles, but absolutely and indefinitely to all Christs disciples, their successors, he promised to abide for ever, even to the consummation of the world, to the whole succession of the Clergy: so <hi>Theophylact</hi> upon this place.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if we consider what were the power and graces Jesus committed to the dispensation of the Apostles, such as were not temporary, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> lasting, successive, and perpetual, we must also conclude the ministery to be perpetual. I instance first in the power of <hi>binding and loosing, remitting and retaining sins,</hi> which Christ gave them together with his breathing on them the holy Spirit, and a legation, and a special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as appears in S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> which power, what sence soever it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits <note place="margin">John 20. 21.</note> of, could not expire with the persons of the Apostles, unless the succeeding ages of the Church had no discipline, or government, no scandals to be removed, no weak persons offended, no corrupt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to be cut off, no hereticks rejected, no sins, or no pardon; and that were a more heresie, than that of the <hi>Novatians;</hi> for they only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied this ministery in some cases; not in all: saying, Priestly absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not fit to be dispensed to them, who in time of persecution had sacrificed to Idols. <gap reason="foreign">

But however, so long as that distinction remains, <hi>of sins unto death,</hi> and <hi>sins not unto death;</hi> there are a certain sort of sins which are remediable, and cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noscible, and judicable, and a power was dispensed to a distinct sort of persons, to remit or retain those sins; which therefore must remain with the Apostles for ever, that is, with their persons first, and then with the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>In execution of this power and pursuance of this commission, for which the power was given; the Apostles went forth, and all they upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whom this signature passed, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, executed this power in appropriation and distinct ministery: it was <hi>the sword of their proper ministery;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> does almost exhibite his Commission and reads the words, when he puts it in execution, and does highly verifie the parts and the consequence of this argument; <hi>God hath reconciled us to himself by Christ Iesus, and hath given to us the ministery of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">James 5.</note> 
                        <hi>reconciliation;</hi> and it follows, <hi>now then we are Embassadors for Christ.</hi> The ministery of reconciliation, is an appropriate ministery; <hi>It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us; we are Embassadors,</hi> it is appropriate by vertue of Christs mission, and legation. <hi>He hath given to us,</hi> he hath made and deputed certain Embassadors whom he hath sent upon the message, and ministry of reconcilement; which is a plain exposition of the words of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, before recorded, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21.</p>

                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40276:6"/>
And that this also descended lower, we have the testimony of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> who advises the sick person <hi>to send for the Elders of the Church, that</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                        <hi>they may pray over him;</hi> that they may anoint him, that in that society there may be <hi>confession of sins</hi> by the clinick or sick person, and that after these preparatives, and in this ministery, his sins may be forgiven him. Now that this power fell into succession, this instance proves; for the Elders were such who had not the commission immediately from Christ, but were <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, they were fathers of the people, but sons of the Apostles, and therefore it is certain the power was not personal, and meerly Apostolical, but derived upon others by such a communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as gives evidence the power was to be succeeded in; And when went it out? when the anointing and miraculous healing ceased? There is no reason for that. For forgiveness of sins was not a thing visible, and therefore could not be of the nature of miracles to confirm the faith and christianity first, and after its work was done return to God that gave it; neither could it be only of present use to the Church, but as eternal and lasting as sin is: and therefore there could be nothing in the nature of the thing to make it so much as suspicious, it was presently to expire.</p>
                     <p>To which also I add this consideration, that the Holy Ghost which was to enable the Apostles in the precise office Apostolical, as it was an office extraordinary, circumstantionate, definite, and to expire, <hi>all that,</hi> was promised should descend upon them after Christs ascension, and was verified in <hi>Pentecost;</hi> for to that purpose to bring all things to their mind, all of Christs Doctrine and all that was necessary of his life and miracles, and a power from above to enable them to speak boldly and learnedly, and with tongues, all that, besides the other parts of ordinary power, was given them ten days after the Ascension. And therefore the breathing the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles in the octaves of the Resurrection, and this mission with such a power, was <hi>their ordinary mission,</hi> a sending them as ordinary Pastors and Curates of Souls, with a power to govern (binding and loosing can mean no less: and they were the words of the promise) with a power to minister reconciliation: (for so Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expounds remitting and retaining) which two were the great hinges of the Gospel, the one to invite and collect a Church, the other to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it; the one to dispense the greatest blessing in the world, the other to keep them in capacities of enjoying it. For since the holy Ghost was now actually given to these purposes here expressed, and yet in order to all their extraordinaries and temporary needs was promised to descend after this, there is no collection from hence more reasonable, than to conclude all this to be part of their commission of ordinary Apostleship, to which the ministers of religion were in all Ages to succeed.

                     <p>THe second power I instance in, is preaching the Gospel: for which work he not only at first designed Apostles, but others also were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> appointed for the same work for ever, to all generations of the Church. This Commission was signed immediately before Christ's Ascension; <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth, Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

                        <hi>you, and lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</hi> First, Christ declared his own commission, <hi>[all power</hi> is given him into his hand] he was now made King of all the Creatures, and Prince of the Catholick Church; and therefore as it concerned his care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to look to his cure, and flock, so he had power to make deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions accordingly <hi>[Go ye therefore,]</hi> implying that the sending them to this purpose was an issue of his power, either because the authorizing certain persons was an act of power, or else because the making them Doctors of the Church and teachers of the Nations, was a placing them in an eminency above their scholars, and converts, and so also was an emanation of that power, which, derived upon Christ from his Father, from him descended upon the Apostles. And the wiser persons of the world have always understood, that a power of teaching was a <hi>Presiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> for since all dominion is naturally founded in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; although civil government accidentally, and by inevitable publick necessity relies upon other titles, yet where the greatest under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and power of teaching is, there is a natural preheminence and superiority <hi>eatenus,</hi> that is, according to the proportion of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and therefore in the instance of S. <hi>Paul</hi> we are taught the style of the Court, and <hi>Disciples sit at the feet</hi> of their Masters, as he did at the feet of his Tutor <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> which implies duty, submission, and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and indeed it is the highest of any kind, not only because it is founded upon nature, but because it is a submission of the most imperious faculty we have, even of that faculty which when we are removed from our Tutors, is submitted to none but God; for no man hath power over the understanding faculty; and therefore so long as we are under Tutors and Instructors, we give to them that duty, in the succession of which claim, none can succeed but God himself, because none else can satisfie the understanding but he.</p>
                     <p>Now then because the Apostles were created Doctors of all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> world, <hi>hoc ipso</hi> they had power given them over the understandings of their disciples, and they were therefore fitted with an infallible spirit, and grew to be so authentick that their determination was the last ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of all inquiries in questions of Christianity: and although they were not absolute Lords of their faith and understandings, as <hi>their Lord</hi> was, yet they had, under God, a supreme care, and presidency, to order, to guide, to instruct, and to satisfie their understandings; and those whom they sent out upon the same errand, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and excellency of their spirit, had also a degree of superiority and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40276:7"/>
eminency; and therefore they who were <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters that were Presidents and Rulers of the Church; and this eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is for ever to be retained according as the unskilfulness of the Disciple retains him in the form of <hi>Catechumens;</hi> or as the excellency of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor still keeps the distance; or else, as the office of teaching being orderly and regularly assigned makes a legal, political, and positive au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to which all those persons are for orders sake to submit, who possibly in respect of their personal abilities might be exempt from that authority.</p>
                     <p>Upon this ground it is, that learning amongst wise persons is esteemed a title of nobility and secular eminency: <hi>Ego enim quid aliud munificen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae</hi>

This discourse was occasioned by our blessed Saviour's illative; <hi>All power is given me, go ye therefore and teach;</hi> and it concludes, that the <hi>authority of Preaching</hi> is more than <hi>the faculty,</hi> that it includes <hi>power</hi> and <hi>presidency,</hi> that therefore a separation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is <hi>ex abundanti</hi> inferred, unless order and authority be also casual, and that all men also may be <hi>Governours</hi> as well as <hi>Preachers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that here was a plain separation of some persons for this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, I shall not need to prove by any other argument besides the words of the Commission; save only that this may be added, that here was <hi>more</hi> necessary, than a commission; great abilities, special assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, extraordinary and divine knowledge, and understanding the mysteries of the kingdom; so that these abilities were separations enough of the persons, and designation of the officers; But this may possibly become the difficulty of the question; For, when the Apostles had filled the world with the Sermons of the Gospel, and that the holy Ghost descended in a plentiful manner, then was the prophesie of <hi>Ioel</hi> fulfilled, <hi>old men dreamed dreams, and young men saw visions, and sons and daughters did prophesie:</hi> Now the case was altered; and the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples themselves start up Doctors, and women prayed and prophesied, and <hi>Priscilla</hi> sate in the Chair with her husband <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> sate at their feet; and now all was common again: and therefore although
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40276:8"/>
the commission went out first to the Apostles; yet, when by miracle God dispensed great gifts to the Laity, and to women, he gave probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he intended that all should prophesie and preach, lest those gifts should be to no purpose. This must be considered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. These gifts were miraculous verifications of the great Promise of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the Father, of sending the holy Ghost, and that all persons were capable of that blessing in their several proportions, and that Christianity did descend from God were <hi>ex abundanti</hi> proved by those extraregular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations: so that here is purpose enough signified, although they be not used to infer an indistinction of Officers in this ministery.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. These gifts were given extra-regularly: but yet with some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of persons: for all did not prophesie, nor all interpret, nor all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> speak with tongues: they were but a few that did all this: we find but the daughters of one man only, and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> among all the nations of the Jews that ever did prophesie, of the women: and of Lay-men I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not one, but <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Agabus:</hi> and these will be but too straight an argument to blend a whole Order of men in a popular and vulgar indiscrimination.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. These extraordinary gifts were no authority to those who had them, and no other commission, to speak in publick. And therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> S. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids the women to speak in the Church, and yet it was not denied but some of them might have the spirit of prophesie. <hi>Speaking in the Church</hi> was part of an ordinary power, to which not only <hi>ability</hi> but <hi>authority</hi> also and <hi>commission</hi> are required. That was clearly one separation; women were not capable of a clerical imployment, no not so much as of this ministery of preaching.

                     <p>And <hi>as for the men</hi> who had gifts extraordinary of the Spirit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> they were permitted at first in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church (before there was a Bishop, or a fixed Colledge of Clergy) to utter the inspired dictates of the Spirit, yet whether they were Lay or Clergy is not there expressed; and it is more agreeable to the usual dispensation that the prophets of ordinary ministery, though now extraordinarily assisted, should prophesie in publick; but however, when these extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries did cease, if they were common persons, they had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to invade the Chair (nor, that we find, ever did:) for an ordinary ability to speak was never any warrant to disturb an order; unless they can say the words of S. <hi>Paul [Whereunto I am ordained a Preacher,]</hi> they might not invade the office. To be able to perform an office, though it may be a fair disposition to make the person capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it <hi>orderly,</hi> yet it does not actually invest him; every wise man is not a Counsellor of State, nor every good Lawyer a Judge. And I doubt not but in the Jewish religion there were many persons as able to pray as their Priests, who yet were wiser than to refuse the Priests advocation <hi>apud Deum,</hi> and reciting offices in behalf of the people: <hi>Orabit pro eo sacerdos</hi> was the order of Gods appointing, though himself were a devout person and of an excellent spirit. And it had need be something extraordinary that must warrant an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry person to rise higher than his own evenness; and <hi>ability</hi> or <hi>skill</hi> is but a possibility; and must be reduced to act by something that transmits authority, or does establish order, or distinguish persons, and separate professions. And it is very remarkable, that when <hi>Iudas</hi> had miscarried and lost his Apostolate, it was said, that it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for some body to be chosen to be a witness of Christs Resurrection. Two were named, of ability sufficient, but that was not all: they must chuse one, to make up the number of the twelve, a distinct separate person; which shews that it was not only a work (for that, any of them might have done) but an office of ordinary ministery. The abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of doing which work although all they that lived with <hi>Iesus,</hi> might either have had, or received at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> yet the authority and grace was more: the first they had upon experience, but this only by divine election: which is a demonstration that every person that can do offices clerical is not permitted to do them; and that, besides the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>artificial abilities,</hi> a divine qualification is necessary.</p>

And therefore God complains by the Prophet, <hi>I have not sent them, and yet they run;</hi> and the Apostle leaves it as an established rule, <hi>How shall</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
                        <hi>they preach except they be sent?</hi> Which two places, I shall grant to be meant concerning a distinct and a new message; Prophets must not offer any doctrine to the people, or pretend a doctrine for which they had not a commission from God. But which way soever they be expounded, they will conclude right in this particular. For if they signifie an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mission, then there is an ordinary mission of preachers, which no man must usurp unless he can prove his title certainly and clearly, derivative from God; which when any man of the Laity can do, we must <hi>give him the right hand of fellowship,</hi> and <hi>wish him good speed.</hi> But if these words signifie an extraordinary case, and that no message must be pretended by Prophets, but what they have commission for, then must not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary persons pretend an extraordinary mission to an ordinary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: for, besides, that God does never do things unreasonable, nor will endure that order be interrupted to no purpose, he will never give an extraordinary Commission unless it be to a proportionable end; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever pretends to a licence of preaching by reason of an extraordinary calling, must look that he be furnished with an extraordinary mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, lest his Commission be ridiculous; and when he comes, he must be sure to shew his authority by an argument proportionable; that is, by such a probation without which no wise man can reasonably believe him; which cannot be less than miraculous and divine. In all other cases he comes under the curse of the <hi>non missi,</hi> those whom God sent not; they go on their own errand, and must pay themselves their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                     <p>But, besides that the Apostles were therefore to have an immediate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> mission, because they were to receive new inctructions: these inctructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were such as were by an ordinary, and yet by a distinct ministery to be conveyed, for ever after; and therefore did design an ordinary, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive, and lasting power and authority. Nay our blessed Lord went one step further in this provision, even to remark the very first successors and partakers of this power, to be taken <hi>into the lot of this ministery,</hi> and they were the Seventy-two whom Christ had sent (as probationers of their future preaching) upon a short errand into the Cities of <hi>Iudah:</hi> But by this assignation of more persons than those to whom he gave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Commission, he did declare that the office of preaching was to be dispensed by a separate and peculiar sort of men, distinct from the people, and yet by others than those who had the commission extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; that is, by such who were to be called to it by an ordinary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>As Christ constituted the office and named the persons, both extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> and ordinary, present and successive; so he provided gifts for them too, that the whole dispensation might be his, and might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. And therefore Christ <hi>when he ascended up on high gave gifts to men,</hi> to this very purpose; and these gifts coming from the same Spirit made separation of distinct ministeries under the same Lord. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> testifies expresly; <hi>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit,</hi>

that is a miraculous <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>vocation</hi> and <hi>designation</hi> by the holy Ghost; but an ordinary gift cannot sublime an ordinary person to a supernatural imployment; and from this discourse of the differing gifts of the Spirit, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> without any further artifice, concludes that the Spirit intended a distinction of Church-officers for the work of the ministery; for the conclusion of the discourse is, that <hi>God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers;</hi> and, lest all God's people should usurp these offices, which <note place="margin">Verse 28.</note> God by his Spirit hath made separate and distinguished, he adds, <hi>Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> If so, then were all the body one member, quite contrary to nature, and to God's Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</p>
                     <p>And that this designation of distinct <hi>Church-officers</hi> is for ever, S. <hi>Paul</hi> also affirms as expresly as this question shall need; <hi>He gave some Apostles,</hi>

                     <p n="1">1.

For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no man needs their help; or, if they did, they are very unable to help. I am sure they are, if they be unlearned persons; and if they be learned, they well enough know, that to teach the people, is not a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of speaking, but is also an act of jurisdiction and authority, and in which, order is, at least, concerned in an eminent degree: <hi>Learned men</hi> are not so forward; and those are most confident who have least reason.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Although as Homilies to the people are now used according to the smallest rate, many men more preach than should, yet besides that to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> preach <hi>prudently, gravely, piously,</hi> and <hi>with truth,</hi> requires more abilities than are discernable by the people, such as make even a plain work reasonable to wise men, and useful to their hearers, and acceptable to God; besides this, I say, the office of teaching is of larger extent than making Homilies, or speaking prettily enough to please the common and undiscerning auditors. They that are appointed to teach the people must <hi>Respondere de jure, Give account of their faith</hi> in defiance of the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous armies of Hereticks; they must watch for their flock, and use ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent arts to arm them against all their weaknesses from within, and hostilities from without; they must strengthen the weak, confirm the strong, compose the scrupulous, satisfie the doubtful, and be ready to answer cases of Conscience; and I believe there are not so little as 5000 cases already started up among the Casuists; and for ought I know; there may be 5000 times 5000.

The Preachers were always Messengers between God and men, being <hi>Mediators</hi> by their sacrifices, and they were interested in their counsels, and greater causes; And if religion can have influences into counsels of Princes, and publick interest of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and that there can be any difficulty, latent sences, intricacy of question, or mysteriousness in Divinity, it will be found that there are other parts of the Preachers office, besides making Homilies: and that when so great skill is required, it will not be easie to make pretences to invade it; unless a man cannot be an excellent Lawyer without twenty years skill and practice, besides excellency of natural indowments, and yet can be an excellent Teacher and Guide in all cases of Conscience, meerly with opening his mouth, and rubbing his forehead hard. But God hath taken order that those whom he hath appointed teachers of the people, should make it the work and business of their lives, that they should diligently attend to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine, that they may <hi>watch over their flock, over whom the holy Ghost hath made them overseers.</hi> The inconvenience that this discourse is like to meet withall is, that it concerns those men who are sure not to understand it: for they that have not the wisdom of Prophets and wise men, cannot easily be brought to know the degrees of distance between the others wisdom and their own ignorance. To know that there is great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond us, is a great part of learning: but they that have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the midst of their deepest ignorance to teach others, want both modesty and understanding too, either to perceive or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their own wants: they never kissed the lips of the wife, and therefore think all the world breathes a breath as fenny and moorish as themselves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Besides, the consideration of the ability that a separate number of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> men should be the teachers, and it be not permitted promiscuously to every person of a confident language and bold fancy, is highly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in the point of <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> too. Of Prudence, because there can be no security against all the evil doctrines of the world in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous unchosen company of Preachers. For if he be allowed the pretence of <hi>an extraordinary,</hi> he shall belie the holy Spirit, to couzen you, when he hath a mind to it: If you allow him nothing but an <hi>ordinary spirit,</hi> that is, abilities of art and nature; there cannot in such discourses be any compensation for the disorder, or the danger, or the schisms, and innumerable Churches, when <hi>one head</hi> and <hi>two members</hi> shall make a distinct body, and all shall pretend to Christ, without any other common term of union. And this which is <hi>disorder</hi> in the thing, is also <hi>dishonourable</hi> to this part of religion; and the divine messages shall be conveyed to the people by common <hi>Curriers</hi> or rather <hi>messengers by chance,</hi> and <hi>as they go by;</hi> whereas God sent at first <hi>Embassadors extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,</hi> and then left his <hi>Leigers</hi> in his Church for ever. But there is also a duty too to be secured; for they that have the guiding of souls must remember that they must be <gap reason="foreign">

be unwilling to be charged with a cure of souls.

Christ hath made a better provision, and after he had with the greatest earnestness committed to S. <hi>Peter</hi> the care of feeding his lambs and sheep, S. <hi>Peter</hi> did it carefully, and though it part of the same duty to provide other shepherds, who should also <hi>feed the flocks</hi> by a continual provision and attendance; <hi>The Presbyters which are among you, I who also am a Presbyter exhort, feed the flock of God which is among you,</hi>

separate nature, requires the solemnity of a distinct order of persons for its ministration: yet if the laity may be admitted to the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so sacred and solemn rites, there is nothing in the calling of the Clergy that can distinguish them from the rest of Gods people, but they shall be holy enough, to dispense holy offices without the charges of paying honour and maintenance to others to do what they can do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>In opposition to which, I first consider, that the ordinary minister of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Baptism is a person consecrated; the Apostles and their successors in the office Apostolical, and all those that partake of that power; and it needs no other proof, but the plain production of the Commission; they who are teachers by ordinary power, and authority, they also had command to baptize all Nations: and baptism being the solemn rite of initiating disciples, and making the first publick profession of the Institution, it is in reason and analogy of the mystery to be ministred by those who were appointed to collect the Church, and make Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. It is as plain and decretory a Commission, as any other mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christianity; and hath been accepted so for ever as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christianity, as may appear in <note n="a" place="margin">Epist. ad Hieron.</note>

For since absolutely, all the Church affixes the ordinary ministery of Baptism to the Clergy; if others do baptize, do they sin, or do they not sin?

                        <hi>Heron</hi> the Deacon; and S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> with the same words denies a <hi>jus baptizandi, to women</hi> and <hi>to Deacons, and both of them</hi> affirm it to be proper to Bishops.

Presbyters to do it without Episcopal dispensation. Now if Presbyters and Deacons have this power only by leave and in certain cases, then it is more than the women have: only that they are fitter persons to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the deputation; a less necessity will devolve it upon Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters than upon Deacons, and upon <hi>Deacons</hi> than <hi>Lay-men;</hi> and a less yet will cast it upon <hi>Lay-men</hi> than <hi>women:</hi> and this difference is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of humane order and positive constitution, but in the nature of the thing according to this doctrine all persons are equally receptive of it: And therefore to baptize is no part of the Grace of Orders, no fruit of the holy Ghost, but a work which may be done by all, and at some times must: and if baptism may, then it will be hard to keep all the other rites from the common inrodes, and then the whole office will perish.</p>
                     <p>But if Lay-persons baptizing, though in case of necessity, <hi>do sin,</hi> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> seems to say they do, then it is certain, Christ never gave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> them leave so much as by insinuation; and then neither can the Church give leave; for she can give leave for no man to sin: and, besides such a deputation were to no purpose; Because no person shall dare to do it, for evil is not to be done, though for the obtaining the greatest good: and it will be hard to state the question, so that either the child shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, or some other must perish for it; for he that positively ventures upon a sin for a good end, worships God with a sin, and therefore shall be thank'd with a damnation, if he dies before repentance; but if the child shall not perish in such case of not being baptized, then why should any man break the rule of institution, and if he shall perish without being baptized, then God hath affixed the salvation of the child upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of another mans sin.</p>

If a Deacon can do no supernatural act which were void and null, if done by him that is not a Deacon, he hath no character, no spiritual inherent power: and that he is made the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minister of it, is for order sake: but he that can do the same thing, hath the same power and ability. By this ground a Lay-person and a Deacon are not distinguished by any inherent character, and therefore they who understand the spiritual powers and effects of ordination in the sence and expression of an inherent and indelible character, will find some difficulty in allowing the effect of a lay-baptism.</p>
                     <p>But I consider that the instances of Scripture brought for the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of lay-administration, if they had no particular exceptation, yet are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> impertinent to this question; for it is not with us pretended in any case to be lawful, but in extreme necessity: And therefore, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the brethren who came with him to <hi>Cornelius</hi> to baptize his family, is nothing to our purpose, and best answers it self: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were of the Clergy, who came with them; or else lay-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may baptize by the right of an ordinary deputation, without a case of necessity; for here was none: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> might have done it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Ananias,</hi> he was one of the Seventy two: and if that be nothing, yet he was called to that ministration about <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> was to the Apostleship, even by an immediate vocation, and mission from Christ himself. And if this answer were not sufficient (as it is most certainly) the argument would press further than is intended: for <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> tells him, he was sent to him that <hi>he might lay his hands on him that he might receive the holy Ghost:</hi> and to do that, was more than <hi>Philip</hi> could do; though he was a Deacon, and in as great a necessity, as this was: And yet besides all this, this was not a case of necessity, unless there was never a Presbyter or Deacon in all <hi>Damascus,</hi> or that God durst not trust any of them with <hi>Paul,</hi> but only <hi>Ananias,</hi> or that <hi>Paul</hi> could not stay longer without baptism, as many thousand converts did in descending ages.</p>
                     <p>And for the other conjecture it is not considerable at all: for the Apostles might take three or four days time to baptize the three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> there was no hurt done if they had stayed a week: the text insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates nothing to the contrary; <hi>The same day about three thousand were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Church;</hi> then they <hi>were added to the Church,</hi> that is, <hi>by vertue and efficacy of that Sermon,</hi> who it may be, considered some-while of S. <hi>Peters</hi> discourse, and gave up their names upon mature deliberation and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conviction. But it is not said, <hi>they were baptized the same day;</hi> and yet it was not impossible for the twelve Apostles to do it in one day, if they had thought it reasonable.</p>

For my own particular, I wish we would make no more necessities than God made, but that we leave the administration of the Sacraments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> to the manner of the first institution, and the Clerical offices be kept within their cancels, that no Lay-hand may pretend a reason to usurp the sacred Ministery: and since there can be no necessity for unbaptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of years of discretion, because their desire may supply them, it were well also if our charity would find some other way also, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Gods mercy towards infants; for certainly, he is most merciful and full of pity to them also: and if there be no neglect of any of his own appointed ministeries, so as he hath appointed them, methinks it were but reasonable to trust his goodness with the infants in other cases: for it cannot but be a jealousie and a suspicion of God, a not daring to trust him, and an unreasonable proceeding beside, that we will rather ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to dispense with divine institution, than think that God will; or that we should pretend more care of children than God hath: when we will break an institution, and the rule of an ordinary Ministery of Gods appointing, rather than cast them upon God, as if God loved this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony better than he loved the child; for so it must be, if the child perished for want of it: and yet still methinks according to such doctrine, there was little or no care taken for infants; for when God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a ministery, and fixed it with certain rules and a proper deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in reason (knowing in all things else how merciful God is, and full of goodness) we should have expected that God should have given express leave to have gone besides the first circumstances of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if he had intended we might or should: and that he should have told us so too rather than by leaving them fast tyed without any express cases of exception, or marks of difference, permit men to dispute and stand unresolved between a case of Duty and a point of Charity: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God will have mercy rather than sacrifice, yet when both are commanded, God takes order they shall never cross each other, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is to be preferred before mercy, when the Sacrifice is in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and the Mercy is not: as it is in the present question. And if it were otherwise in this case, yet because God loves mercy so well, Why should we not think, that God himself will shew this mercy to this Infant, when he hath not expressed his pleasure that we should do it? We cannot be more merciful than He is.</p>

                     <p>This is expresly described in Scripture; that part concerning Christ is the Doctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who disputes largely concerning Christ's Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> affirming <hi>that Christ is a Priest for ever;</hi> he hath therefore <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Priesthood,</hi> because <hi>he continueth for ever,</hi> and <hi>he lives for ever to make intercession for us;</hi> this he does as Priest, and therefore it must be by offering a Sacrifice, <hi>[for every high Priest is ordained to offer Gifts and</hi>

                        <hi>Sacrifices]</hi> and therefore <hi>it is necessary he also have something to offer,</hi> as long as he is a Priest, that is, <hi>for ever,</hi> till the consummation of all things; since therefore he hath nothing new to offer, and something he must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually offer, it is evident, he offers himself as the medium of advocation, and the instance and argument of a prevailing intercession; and this he calls <hi>a more excellent Ministery]</hi> and by it, <hi>Iesus is a Minister of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and of the true Tabernacle,</hi> that is, He, as our high Priest officiates in Heaven, in the great office of a Mediator, in the merit and power of his Death and Resurrection. Now what Christ does alwayes in a proper and most glorious manner, the Ministers of the Gospel also do in theirs: commemorating the Sacrifice upon the Cross, <hi>giving thanks,</hi> and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a perpetual Eucharist for it, and <hi>by declaring the death of Christ,</hi> and praying to God in the vertue of it, for all the Members of the Church, and all persons capable; it is <hi>in genere orationis</hi> a Sacrifice, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of propitiation, as all holy prayers are in their several propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>And this was by a precept of Christ; <hi>Hoc facite, Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> Now this precept is but twice reported of in the new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Testament, though the institution of the Sacrament, be four times. And it is done with admirable mystery; to distinguish the several interests, and operations which concern several sorts of Christians in their distinct capacities: S. <hi>Paul</hi> thus represents it; <hi>[Take eat—This do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me]</hi> plainly referring this precept to all that are to eat and drink the Symbols: for they also do in their manner <hi>enunciate,</hi> declare, or represent the Lords death till he come. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prosecutes it with instructions particular to the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>to them that do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,</hi> as appears in the succeeding cautions against <hi>unworthy</hi>

                        <hi>manducation,</hi> and for due preparation to its reception. But S. <hi>Luke</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it plainly to another purpose, <hi>[and he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave it unto them, saying: This is my body which is given for you; Hoc facite, This] do in remembrance of me:</hi> [This] cannot but relate to <hi>accepit, gratias egit, fregit, distribuit: Hoc facite.</hi> Here was no manducation expressed, and therefore <hi>Hoc facite</hi> concerns the Apostles in the capacity of Ministers; not as <hi>receivers,</hi> but as <hi>Consecrators</hi> and <hi>givers;</hi> and if the institution had been represented in one scheme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this mysterious distinction, and provident separation of imployment, we had been eternally in a cloud, and have needed a new light to guide us; but now the Spirit of God hath done it in the very first fountains of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>And this being the great mystery of Christianity, and the only rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Express of Christ's Sacrifice on earth, it is most consonant to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Analogy of the mystery, that this commemorative Sacrifice be presented by persons as separate, and distinct in their ministery, as the Sacrifice it self is <hi>from</hi> and <hi>above</hi> the other parts of our Religion.</p>
                     <p>Thus also the Church of God hath for ever understood it without any variety of sence or doubtfulness of distinguishing opinions. It was the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> excellency and secret mystery of the Religion, to consecrate and offer the holy Symbols and Sacraments: I shall transcribe a passage out of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> giving the account of it to <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> in his Oration to him; and it will serve in stead of many; for it tells the Religion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in this mystery, and gives a full account of all the Ceremony. <gap reason="foreign">

For the Apostles in their Commentaries which they wrote, which are called the Gospels, so delivered, as Jesus commanded. For when he had given thanks and taken Bread, he said, Do this in remembrance of me; This is my body; And likewise taking the Chalice, and having given thanks, he said, [This is my blood,] and that he gave it to them alone.]</q> This one Testimony I reckon as sufficient: who please to see more, may

This is that Rite, in which the Priest intercedes for, and blesses the people; offering in their behalf, not only their prayers, but applying the Sacrifice of Christ to their prayers, and representing them with glorious advantages, and titles of acceptation, which because it was so excellent, celestial, sacred, mystical and supernatural, it raised up the persons too; that the <hi>ministeriael Priesthood</hi> in the Church, might, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of all great imployments, pass an excellency and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon the Ministers.</p>

And no man taketh upon him this honour, but he that was called of God, as was Aaron,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> For in every Priesthood, God designed and appointed the Ministery, and collates a power, or makes the person gracious: either gives him a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ability of doing something which others have not, or if he be only imployed in praying and presenting Sacrifices of Beasts for the people; yet that such a person should be admitted to a nearer address, and in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the people, must depend upon God's acceptation, and therefore upon divine constitution: for there can be no reason given in the nature of the thing, why God will accept the intermediation of one man for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or why this man, more than another, who possibly hath no natural or acquired excellency beyond many of the people, except what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self makes, after the constitution of the person.

                     <p>And this is divinely taught us by the example of the high Priest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: who, because he derived all power from his Father, and all his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> graciousness and favour, in the Office of <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Mediator,</hi> was also personally chosen and sent, and took not the <hi>honour</hi> but as it descended on him from God, that the <hi>honour</hi> and the <hi>power,</hi> the <hi>ability,</hi> and the <hi>ministery,</hi> might derive from the same fountain. <hi>Christ did not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>

our blessed High Priest said of himself: <hi>If I honour my self, my honour is nothing: it is God that honoureth me:</hi> For Christ being the Fountain of Evangelical Ministery, is the measure of our dispensations, and the Rule of Ecclesiastical Oeconomy: and therefore we must not arrogate any power from our selves, or from a less authority than our Lord and Master did: and this is true and necessary in the Gospel, rather than in any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery or Priesthood that ever was, because of the collation of so many excellent and supernatural abilities which derive from Christ upon his Ministers, in order to the work of the Gospel.</p>

                     <p>BY this ordination the persons ordained are made Ministers of the Gospel, Stewards of all its mysteries, the Light, the Salt of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> earth, the Shepherd of the flock, Curates of souls; these are their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or their appellatives (which you please:) for the Clerical ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no other but a <hi>sanctification</hi> of the person <hi>in both sences;</hi> that is, 1. A separation of him to do certain mysterious actions of religion: which is that sanctification by which <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist were sanctified from their mothers wombs. 2. It is also a sanctification of the person, by the increasing or giving respectively to the capacity of the suscipient, such graces as make the person meet to speak to God, to pray for the people, to handle the mysteries, and to have influence upon the cure.</p>
                     <p>The first sanctification of a designation of the person; which must of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> necessity be some way or other by <hi>God:</hi> because it is a nearer approach to him, a ministery of his graces, which without his appointment, a man <hi>must not, cannot</hi> any more do, than a messenger can carry pardon to a condemned person, which his Prince never sent. But this separation of the person, is not only a naming of the man, (for so far the separation of the person may be previous to the ordination: for so it was in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations of <hi>Matthias,</hi> and the seven Deacons; The Apostles <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>they appointed two,</hi> before God chose by lot; and the whole Church chose the seven Deacons before the Apostles imposed hands;) but the separation, or this first sanctification of the person, is a giving him a power to do such offices, which God hath appointed to be done <hi>to him</hi> and <hi>for the people,</hi> which we may clearly see and understand in the <note place="margin">Job 42. 8.</note> instance of <hi>Iob</hi> and his friends: For when God would be intreated in behalf of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his companions, he gave order that <hi>Iob</hi> should make the address; <hi>Go to my servant, he shall pray for you, and him will I accept;</hi> this separation of a person for the offices of advocation, is the same thing which I mean by <hi>this first sanctification;</hi> God did it, and gave him a power and authority to go to him, and put him into a place of trust and favour about him, and made him a Minister of the Sacrifice, which is a power and eminency above the persons for whom he was to sacrifice, and a power or grace from God to be in near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him. This I suppose to be the great argument for the necessity of separating a certain order of men for Ecclesiastical ministeries: And it relies upon these propositions. 1. All power of ordination descends
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40276:18"/>
from God, and he it is who sanctifies and separates the person. 2. The Priest by God is separate to be the gratious person to stand between him and the people. 3. He speaks the word of God, and returns the prayers and duty of the people, and conveys the blessings of God, by his prayer, and by his ministery. So that although every Christian must pray and may be heard, yet there is a solemn person appointed to pray in publick: and though Gods Spirit is given to all that ask it, and the promises of the Gospel are verified to all that obey the Gospel of Jesus, yet God hath appointed Sacraments and Solemnities, by which the promises and blessings are ministred more solemnly, and to greater effects. All the ordinary devotions the people may do alone; the <hi>solemn, ritual</hi> and <hi>publick,</hi> the appointed Minister only must do. And if any man shall say, because the Priest's ministery is by prayer, every man can do it, and so, no need of him; by the same reason he may say also that the Sacraments are unnecessary, because the same effect which they produce, is also in some degree the reward of a private piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. But the particulars are to be further proved and explicated as they need.</p>
                     <p>Now what for illustration of this Article I have brought from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Iob,</hi> is true in the Ministers of the Gospel, with the superaddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of many degrees of eminency. But still <hi>in the same kind,</hi> for the power God hath given is indeed <hi>mystical;</hi> but it is not like a power operating by way of natural or proper operation; it is not <hi>vis</hi> but <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> not an <hi>inherent quality</hi> that issues out actions by way of direct ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, like natural or acquired habits, but it is a grace or favour done to the person, and a qualification of him <hi>in genere politico,</hi> he receives a politick, publick, and solemn capacity, to intervene between God and the people; and although it were granted that the people could do the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal work, or the action of Church ministeries, yet they are actions to no purpose; they want the life and all the excellency, unless they be done by such persons whom God hath called to it, and by some means of his own hath expressed his purpose to accept them in such ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>And this explication will easily be verified in all the particulars of the Priests Power, because all the ministeries of the Gospel are <hi>in genere ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> (unless we except <hi>preaching,</hi> in which God speaks by his servants to the people) the Minister by his office is an <hi>Intercessor with God,</hi> and the word used in Scripture for the Priests <hi>officiating</hi> signifies his praying [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] <hi>as they were ministring or doing their Liturgy,</hi> the work of their supplications and intercession; and therefore the Apostles positively included all their whole ministery in these two: <hi>[but we will give our selves to the word of God, and to prayer;]</hi> the prayer of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, the prayer of absolution, the prayer of imposition of hands: they had nothing else to do but <hi>pray and preach.</hi> And for this reason it was, that the Apostles in a sence nearest to the letter, did verifie the precept of our Blessed Saviour; Pray <hi>continually,</hi> that is, in all the offices, acts, parts and ministeries of <hi>a daily Liturgy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is not to lessen the power, but to understand it: for the Priests ministery is certainly the instrument of conveying all the blessings of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> people, which are annexed to the ordinary administration of the Spirit. But when all the office of Christs Priesthood in Heaven is called <hi>interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for us,</hi> and himself makes the sacrifice of the Cross, effectual to the salvation and graces of his Church, by his prayer, since we are Ministers
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40276:19"/>
of the same Priesthood, can there be a greater glory than to have our ministery like to that of Jesus? not operating by vertue of a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of syllables, but by a holy, solemn, determined and religious prayer, in the several manners and instances of intercession: according to the analogy of all the religions in the world, whose most solemn mystery, was their most solemn prayer: I mean it in the matter of sacrificing; which also is true in the most mysterious solemnity of Christianity in the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which is hallowed and lifted up from the <note place="margin">Cap. ult. de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.

                     <p>And now this sanctification which is so evident in Scripture, tradition and reason, taken from proportion and analogy to Religion, is so far <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> from making the power of the holy man less than is supposed, that it shews the greatness of it by a true representment; and preserves the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credness of it so within its own cancels, that it will be the greatest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge in the world to invade it; for, whoever will boldly enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this vail, <hi>nisi qui vocatur sicut Aaron,</hi> unless he be sanctified as is the Priest, who is <gap reason="foreign">

At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Christianity, God gave gifts extraordinary, as boldness of spirit, fearless courage, freedom of discourse, excellent understanding, discerning of spirits, deep judgment, innocence and prudence of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the gift of tongues; these were so necessary at the institution of the Christian Church, that if we had not had testimony of the matter of fact, the reasonableness of the thing would prove the actual dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit; because God never fails in necessaries: But afterward, when all the extraordinary needs were served, the extraordinary stock was spent, and God retracted those issues into their fountains, and then the graces that were necessary for the well discharging the <gap reason="foreign">

the Apostles, are to be acquired by humane industry, by study and good letters, and therefore are presupposed in the person to be ordained: to which purpose the Church now examines the abilities of the man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she lays on hands: and therefore the Church does not suppose that the Spirit in Ordination descends in gifts, and in the infusion of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and perfect abilities, though then also, it is reasonable to believe that God will assist the pious and careful endeavours of holy Priests, and bless them with special aids and co-operation: because a more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ability is needful for persons so designed. But the proper and great aid which the Spirit of Ordination gives, is such instances of assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which make the person more holy.</p>

                     <p>THe Holy Ghost was the first Consecrator, that is made evident; and the persons first consecrated were the Apostles, who received <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the several parts of the Priestly order, at several times; the power of consecration of the Eucharist, at the institution of it; the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and retaining sins in the Octaves of <hi>Easter;</hi> the power of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and preaching, together with universal jurisdiction, immediately before the Ascension, when they were commanded to <hi>go into all the world preaching and baptizing.</hi> This is the whole office of the <hi>Priesthood;</hi> and nothing of this was given in Pentecost when the holy Spirit descended and rested upon all of them; the Apostles, the brethren, the women: for then they received those great assistances which enabled them who had been designed for Embassadors to the world, to do their great work: and others of a lower capacity had their proportion, as the effect of the promise of the Father, and a mighty verification of the truth of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                     <p>Now all these powers which Christ hath given to his Apostles, were by some means or other to be transmitted to succeeding persons, because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the several Ministeries were to abide for ever. All Nations were to be converted, a Church to be gathered and continued, the new Converts to be made Confessors, and consigned with Baptism, sins to be remitted, flocks to be fed and guided, and the Lords death declared, represented, exhibited, and commemorated until his second Coming. And since the powers of doing these offices, are acts of free and gracious concession, emanations of the holy Spirit, and admissions to a vicinity with God, it is not only impudence and sacriledge in the person, falsly to pretend, that is, to bely the Holy Ghost, and thrust into these Offices, but there is an impossibility in the thing, it is null in the very deed doing, to handle these mysteries without some appointment by God; unless he calls and points out the person, either by an extraordinary or by an ordinary Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Of these I must give a particular account.</p>

The extraordinary calling was first, that is, the immediate; for the first beginning of a lasting necessity, is extraordinary, and made ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in succession, and by continuation of a fixed and determined Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery. The first of every order hath another manner of constitution, than all the whole succession. The rising of the spring is of greater wonder, and of more extraordinary and latent reason, than the descent of the current; and the derivation of the powers of the Holy Ghost that make the Priestly order, are just like the Creation: the first man was made with God's own hands, and all the rest by God, co-operating with a humane act; and there is never the same necessity as at first, for <hi>God to create man.</hi> The species or kind shall never fail, but be preserved in an ordinary way: And so it is in the designation of the Ministers of Evangelical Priesthood; God breathed into the Apostles <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Grace cannot be conveyed to any man, but either by the fountain, or by the channel: by the Author, or by the Minister. God only is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fountain and Author: and he that makes himself the Minister whom God appointed not, does in effect make himself the Author: for he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to dispose of grace which he hath not received, to give God's goods upon his own authority: which he that offers at, without God's warrant, does it only upon his own. And so either he is <hi>the Author,</hi> or <hi>an Usurper,</hi> either the fountain, or a dry cloud, which in effect calls him either <hi>blasphemous,</hi> or <hi>sacrilegious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the first and immediate derivation from the fountain, that only I affirm to be miraculous, and extraordinary: as all beginnings of essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and graces of necessity must: those persons who receive the first is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues, they only are extraordinarily called: all that succeed are called or designed by an ordinary vocation, because whatsoever is in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession is but an ordinary necessity, to which God hath proportioned an ordinary Ministery; and when it may be supplied by the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, to look for an extraordinary calling, is as if a man should expect some new man to be created, as <hi>Adam</hi> was; it is to suppose God will multiply beings and operations without necessity. God called at first, and if he had not called, man could not have come to him in this nearness of a holy Ministery; he sent persons abroad, and if he had not sent, they could not have gone; but after that he had appointed by his own desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation persons who should be Fathers in Christ, he called no more, but left them to call others: He first immediately gives the <gap reason="foreign">

The purpose of this discourse is, that now no man should in these days of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <note place="margin">Hob. 5. 4. 5, 10.</note> Ministery, look for an extraordinary calling, nor pretend in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to vainer purposes any new necessities.</p>

They are fancies of a too confident opinion, and over-valuing of our selves, when we think the very being of a Church is concerned in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> mistakes; and if all the world be against us, we are not ashamed of our folly, but think truth is failed from among the children of men, and the Church is at a loss, and the current derived from the first emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is dried up, and then he that is boldest to publish his follies, is also as apt to mistake his own boldness for <hi>a call from God,</hi> as he did at first his own vain opinion for a necessary truth; and then he is called extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, and so ventures into the secrets of the Sanctuary. First, he made a necessity more than ever God made, &amp; then himself finds a remedy that God never appointed. He that thinks every shaking of the Ark is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute ruine to it, when peradventure it was but the weakness of his own eyes that made him fancy what was not, may also think he hears a call from above to support it, which indeed was nothing but a noise in his own head: And there is no cure for this, but to cure the man, and set his head right. For he that will pretend any thing that is beyond ordinary, as he that will say he hath two reasonable Souls within him, or three Wills, is not to be confuted but by Physick, or by the tying him to abjure his folly till he were able to prove it.</p>
                     <p>But God by promising that his Church should abide for ever, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
                        <hi>the gates of Hell should not prevail against it,</hi> but that himself would be <hi>with her to the end of the world;</hi> hath sufficiently confuted the vanity of those men, who that they might thrust themselves into an office, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the dissolution of the very being of the Church: For if the Church remains in her being, let her corruptions be what they will, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prophets have power to reform them; and if they do not, every man hath power to complain, so he does it with <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>modesty,</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>necessity.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. And there is no need of an extraordinary calling to amend such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> things which are certain, foreseen events; and such were heresies and corruption in doctrine and manners, for which God appointed an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ministery to take cognizance and make a remedy; for which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self when he had told us, <hi>Heresies must needs be,</hi> yet made no provisions extraordinary, but left the Church sufficiently instructed by her Rule, and guided by her Pastors.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When Christ means to give us a new Law, then he will give us a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> new Priesthood, a new Ministery: One will not be changed without the other; God now no more comes in a mighty rushing wind, but in a still voice, in the gentle Homilies of ordinary Prophets; and now that the Law, by which we are to frame our understandings and our actions, is established, we must not expect an Apostle to correct every abuse; for if they will not hear <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, if one should come from the dead, or an Angel come from Heaven, it is certain they will not be entertained, but till the wonder be over, and the curiosity of news be satisfied.</p>
                     <p>Against this, it is pretended that Christ promised <hi>to be with his Church</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
                        <hi>for ever,</hi> upon condition the Church would do their duty; but they <note place="margin">Volkell. lib. 6. cap. 18.</note> being but a company of men, have power to chuse, and they may chuse amiss; and if all should do so, Christs promises may fail us, though not fail of their intentions; and then in this case the Church failing, either there must be an extraordinary calling of single persons, or else any man may enter into the ordinary way, which is all one with an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for it is extraordinary that common persons should by necessity be drawn into an imployment, which by ordinary vocation, they are not to meddle with.</p>

                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:40276:23"/>
Against this we can (thanks be to God for it) pretend the experience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> of sixteen Ages; for hitherto it hath ever been in the Christian Churches, that God hath preserved a holy Clergy in the same proportion as he hath preserved a holy people; never yet were the Clergy all Antichristian, in the midst of Christian Churches; and we have no reason to fear it will be so now, after so long an experience to expound the promises of our Lord to the sence of a perpetual Ministery, and a perpetual Church, by the means of Ordinary ministrations.</p>
                     <p>And how shall the Church be supposed to fail, since God hath made no provisions for its restitution? For by what means should the Church be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> renewed, and Christianity restored? Not by Scripture; for we have <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 19.</note> no certainty that the Scriptures which we have this day, are the same which the Apostles delivered, and shall remain so for ever; but only 1. The reputation and testimony of all Christian Churches, (which also must transmit the same by a continual successive testimony to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or else they will be of an uncertain faith,) and 2. The confidence of the divine providence and goodness, who will not let us want what is fit for us, that without which we cannot attain the end to which in mercy he hath designed us. Now the same Arguments which we have for the continuation of Scripture, we have for the perpetuity of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Clergy, that is, besides the so long actual succession and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we have he goodness and unalterable sweetness of the Divine mercies, who will continue such Ministeries which himself hath made the ordinary means of salvation; he would not have made them the way to Heaven and of ordinary necessity, if he did not mean to preserve them. Indeed, if the ordinary way should fail, God will supply another way to them that do their duty; but then Scripture may as well fail as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary succession of the Clergy: they both were intended but as the ordinary ministeries of salvation, and if Scripture be kept for the use of the Church, it is more likely the Church will be preserved in its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary constituent parts than the Scripture; because Scripture is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the Church, it is kept that the Church might not fail. For as for the fancy, that all men being free agents may chuse amiss: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that; but then, may they not all consent to the corruption or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of Scripture? yea, but God will preserve them from that, or will over-rule the event: yea, but how do they know that? what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation have they? yet grant that too, but why then will he not also over-rule the event of the matter of universal Apostasie? for both of them are matter of choice.</p>
                     <p>But then that all the Clergy should consent to corrupt Scripture, or to lose their Faith, is a most unreasonable supposition; for supposing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> there is a natural possibility, yet it is morally impossible; and we may as well fear that all the men of the world will be vitious upon the same reason; for if all the Clergy may, then all the People may, and you may as well poison the Sea, as poison all the Springs; and it is more likely all the Ideots, and the ordinary persons in the world should be couzened out of their Religion, than that all the wise men and <hi>Antistites,</hi> the <hi>Teachers, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>publick Ministers</hi> of Religion should. And when all men turn Mariners, or Apothecaries, or that all men will live single lives, and turn Monks, and so endanger the species of mankind to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, (for there is a great fear of that too;) that is, when all the world chuse one thing (for if two men do, two thousand may do it if they will, and so may all upon this ground:) then also we may fear that all the Governours of the Church may fail, because some do, and more have,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40276:24"/>
and all may; till then, there will be no need of an extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; but the Church shall go on upon the stock of the first calling, and designation, which was extraordinary. The Spirit issued out at first miraculously, and hath continued running still in the first channels by ordinary conduct, and in the same conveyances it must run still, or it cannot without a miracle derive upon us, who stand at infinite distance from the fountain. Since then, there is now no more expectation of an extraordinary calling (and to do so were an extraordinary vanity) it remains that the derivation of the ministerial power be by an ordinary conveyance.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of God in Scripture hath drawn a line, and chalked out the path that himself meant to tread, in giving the graces of Evangelical mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> At first, after that Christ had named twelve (one whereof was lost) they, not having an express command for the manner of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, took such course as Reason and Religion taught them. They named two persons, and prayed God to chuse one, and to manifest it by Lot; which was a way less than the first designation of the other eleven; and yet had more of the extraordinary in it, than could be reasonably continued in an ordinary succession. The Apostles themselves had not as yet received skill enough how to officiate in their ordinary ministery, because the Holy Ghost was not as yet descended.</p>
                     <p>But when the Holy Ghost descended, then the work was to begin; the Apostles wanted no power necessary for the main work of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> but now also they received Commissions to dispense the Spirit to all such purposes to which He was intended. They before had the <hi>office</hi> in themselves, but it was <hi>not communicable to others,</hi> till the Spirit, <hi>the Anointing from above,</hi> ran over the Fringes of the Priest's garments; they had it but in imperfection and unactive faculties; so saith <hi>Theophylact: He breathed, not now giving to them the perfect gift of the Holy Ghost, for</hi>

                        <hi>that he intended to give at Pentecost: but he prepared them for the fuller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it.</hi> They had the gift before, but not the perfect consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, that was reserved for the great day; and because the power of Consecration is the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, the perfection of what power Christ had formerly consigned. For of all faculties, that is not perfect which produces perfect and excellent actions in a direct line, actions of a particular sort; but that which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the actions, and enables others to do so too; for then the perfection is inherent, not only <hi>formally,</hi> but <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>eminently;</hi> and that's the crown of habits and natural faculties. Now besides the reasonableness of the thing, this is also verified by a certainty that will not easily fail us; by Experience, and <hi>ex post facto:</hi> For as we do not find the Apostles had, before Pentecost, a <hi>productive power,</hi> which made them call for a Miracle, or a special providence by Lots; so we are sure that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after Pentecost they had it: for they speedily began to put it in execution; and it is remarkable, that the Apostles did not lay hands upon <hi>Matthias:</hi> he being made Apostle before the descent of the Holy Ghost, they had no power to do it, they were not yet made <hi>Ministers of the Spirit;</hi> which because afterwards presently they did, concludes fairly, that at Pentecost they were amongst other graces made <hi>the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ministers of Ordination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I say is certain, that the Holy Ghost descending at Pentecost, they instantly did officiate in their ministerial offices, they preached, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> they baptized, they confirmed and gave the holy Spirit of obsignation,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40276:24"/>
and took persons into the Lot of their Ministery, doing of it by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rite and solemn invocation: and now the extraordinary way did cease; God was the fountain of the power, but man conveyed it by an external rite: and of this Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was the only exception from the common way, takes notice; calling himself an Apostle, <hi>not of man, nor by man, but by Iesus Christ;</hi> implying that he had a special honour done, to be chosen an Apostle in an extraordinary way; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others might be Apostles, and yet not so as he was; for else his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression had been all one, as if one should say, <hi>Titus the son of a man, not begotten of an Angel, or Spirit, nor produced by the Sun or Stars, but begotten by a Man of a Woman:</hi> the discourse had been ridiculous, for no man is born otherwise; and yet also he had something of the ordinary too; for in an extraordinary manner he was sent to be ordained in an ordinary Ministery. And yet because the ordinary Ministery was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, S. <hi>Paul</hi> was called to an account for so much of it as was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and was tied to do that which every man now is bound to do, that shall pretend a calling extraordinary, <hi>viz.</hi> to give <hi>an extraordinary proof</hi> of his <hi>extraordinary calling:</hi> which when he had done in the College of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Apostles <hi>gave him the right hand of fellowship,</hi> and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his vocation; which also shews, that now the way of Ordination was fixed and declared to be by humane ministery; of which I need no other proof but the instances of Ordinations recorded in Scripture, and the <hi>no instances</hi> to the contrary, but of <hi>S.

                     <p>This is the summ of the preceding discourses. God is the Consecrator; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> man is the Minister; the separation is mysterious and wonderful; the power great and secret; the office to stand between God and the people, in the ministery of the Evangelical rites; the calling to it ordinary, and by a setled Ministery, which began after the descent of the Holy Ghost in Pentecost.</p>
                     <p>This great change was in nothing expressed greater, than that <hi>Saul</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> his Ordination changed his name, which Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> observing, <note place="margin">Homil. 28. in Acta 18.</note> affirms the same of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> I conclude, <hi>Differentiam inter ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; plebem constituit Ecclesiae authoritas &amp; honor per ordinis conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt</hi>

The authority of the whole Church of God hath made distinction between the person ordained and the people, but the honour and power of it is derived from the sanctification of God:</hi> It is derived from him, but conveyed by an ordinary Ministery of his appointing: Whosoever therefore with unsanctified, that is, with unconsecrated hands, shall dare to officiate in the ministerial office, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by God, by gifts, by graces, by publick order, by an established rite,

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Emember that it is your great Duty, and tied on you by many Obligations, that you be exemplar in your lives, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> be Patterns and Presidents to your Flocks: lest it be said unto you, <hi>Why takest thou my Law into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest to be reformed thereby?</hi> He that lives anidle life may preach with Truth and Reason, or as did the Pharisees; but not as Christ, or as one having Authority.</p>
                     <p>Every Minister in taking accounts of his life, must judge of his Duty by more strict and severer measures, than he does of his People; and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> that ties heavy burthens upon others, ought himself to carry the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est end: and many things may be lawful in them, which he must not suffer in himself.</p>
                     <p>Let every Minister endeavour to be learned in all spiritual wisdom, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> and skilful in the things of God; for he will ill teach others the way of godliness, perfectly, that is himself a babe and uninstructed. An Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Minister is an head without an eye; and an Evil Minister is salt that hath no savour.</p>
                     <p>Every Minister, above all things, must be careful that he be not a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> of Passion, whether of Anger or Desire. For he that is not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of his Passions will always be useless, and quickly will become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and cheap in the eyes of his Parish.</p>
                     <p>Let no Minister be litigious in any thing; not greedy or covetous; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> not insisting upon little things, or quarrelling for, or exacting of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute portion of his dues; but bountiful and easie; remitting of his right, when to do so may be useful to his people, or when the contrary may domischief, and cause reproach. <hi>Be not over-righteous,</hi> (saith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon)</hi> that is, not severe in demanding, or foroing every thing, though it be indeed his due.</p>
                     <p>Let not the name of the Church be made a pretence for personal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> covetousness; by saying, you are willing to remit many things, but you must not wrong the Church: for though it be true, that you
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40276:28"/>
are not to do prejudice to succession, yet many things may be forgiven upon just occasions, from which the Church shall receive no incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; but be sure that there are but few things which thou art bound to do in thy personal capacity, but the same also, and more, thou art ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to perform, as thou art a publick person.</p>
                     <p>Never exact the offerings, or customary wages, and such as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> by Law, in the ministration of the Sacraments, nor condition for them, nor secure them before-hand; but first do your office, and minister the Sacraments purely, readily, and for Christs sake; and when that is done, receive what is your due.</p>
                     <p>Avoid all Pride, as you would flee from the most frightful Apparition, or the most cruel Enemy; and remember that you can never truly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> teach Humility, or tell what it is, unless you practise it your selves.</p>
                     <p>Take no measures of Humility, but such as are material and tangible; such which consist not in humble words, and lowly gestures; but what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> is first truly radicated in your Souls, in low opinion of your selves, and in real preferring others before your selves; and in such significations, which can neither deceive your selves nor others.</p>
                     <p>Let every Curate of Souls strive to understand himself best; and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> to understand others. Let him spare himself least; but most severely judge, censure, and condemn himself. If he be learned, let him shew it by wise teaching, and humble manners. If he be not learned, let him be sure to get so much Knowledge as to know that, and so much Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as not to grow insolent, and puffed up by his Emptiness. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will pardon a good man that is less learned; but if he be proud, no man will forgive him.</p>
                     <p>Let every Minister be careful to live a life as abstracted from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the world, as his necessity will permit him; but at no hand to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> immerg'd and principally imploy'd in the Affairs of the World: What cannot be avoided, and what is of good report, and what he is oblig'd to by any personal or collateral Duty, that he may do, but no more. Ever remembring the Saying of our Blessed Lord: <hi>In the world ye shall have trouble; but in me ye shall have peace:</hi> and consider this also, which is a great Truth; That every degree of love to the world, is so much taken from the Love of God.</p>
                     <p>Be no otherwise solicitous of your Fame and Reputation, but by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Duty well and wisely; in other things refer your self to God: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> but if you meet with evil Tongues, be careful that you bear reproaches sweetly and temperately.</p>
                     <p>Remember that no Minister can govern his people well, and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> unless himself hath learn'd humbly and chearfully to obey his Superior. For every Minister should be like the good Centurion in the Gospel: himself is under authority, and he hath people under him.</p>
                     <p>Be sure in all your Words and Actions to preserve Christian simplicity and ingenuity; to do to others, as you would be done unto your self; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> and never to speak what you do not think. Trust to Truth, rather than to your Memory: for this may fail you, that will never.</p>
                     <p>Pray much and very servently, for all your Parishioners, and all men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> that belong to you, and all that belong to God; but especially for the Conversion of Souls: and be very zealous for nothing, but for Gods glory, and the salvation of the World, and particularly of your Charges: Ever remembring that you are by God appointed, as the Ministers of Prayer, and the Ministers of good things, to pray for all the World, and to heal all the World, as far as you are able.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:40276:28"/>
Every Minister must learn and practise Patience, that by bearing all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> adversity meekly, and humbly, and chearfully, and by doing all his Duty with unwearied industry, with great courage, constancy, and Christian magnanimity, he may the better assist his people in the bearing of their crosses, and overcoming of their difficulties.</p>
                     <p>He that is holy, let him be holy still, and still more holy, and never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> think he hath done his work, till all be finished by perseverance, and the measures of perfection in a holy Life, and a holy Death: but at no hand must he magnifie himself by vain separations from others, or despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them that are not so holy.</p>

                     <p>REmember that Discretion is the Mistress of all Graces; and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is the greatest of all Miracles: and without this, all Graces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> perish to a mans self; and without that, all Graces are useless unto others.</p>
                     <p>Let no Minister be governed by the opinion of his People, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> his Duty, by unreasonable compliance with their humors, lest as the Bishop of <hi>Granata</hi> told the Governours of <hi>Leria</hi> and <hi>Patti,</hi> like silly Animals they take burdens upon their backs at the pleasure of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which they neither can retain with Prudence, nor shake off with Safety.</p>
                     <p>Let not the Reverence of any man cause you to sin against God; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> in the matter of Souls, being well advis'd, be bold and confident; but abate nothing of the honour of God, or the just measures of your Duty, to satisfie the importunity of any man whatsoever, and God will bear you out.</p>
                     <p>When you teach your people any part of their duty, as in paying their debts, their tithes and offerings, in giving due reverence and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/> regards, diminish nothing of admonition in these particulars, and the like, though they object, That you speak for your selves, and in your own cases. For counsel is not the worse, but the better, if it be profitable both to him that gives, and to him that takes it. Only do it in simplicity, and principally intend the good of their souls.</p>
                     <p>In taking accounts of the good Lives of your selves or others, take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> your measures by the express words of Scripture; and next to them estimate them by their proportion and compliance with the publick measures, with the Laws of the Nation, Ecclesiastical and Civil, and by the Rules of Fame, of publick Honesty and good Report; and last of all by their observation of the Ordinances and exteriour parts of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Be not satisfied when you have done a good work, unless you have also done it well; and when you have, then be careful that vain-glory, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/> partiality, self-conceit, or any other folly or indiscretion, snatch it not out of your hand, and cheat you of the reward.</p>
                     <p>Be careful so to order your self, that you fall not into temptation and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> folly in the presence of any of your Charges; and especially that you fall not into chidings and intemperate talkings, and sudden and violent expressions: Never be a party in clamours and scoldings, lest your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling become useless, and your Person contemptible: Ever remembring that if you cheaply and lightly be engag'd in such low usages with any
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40276:29"/>
Person, that Person is likely to be lost from all possibility of receiving much good from your Ministery.</p>

                     <p>USe no violence to any man, to bring him to your opinion; but by the word of your proper Ministery, by Demonstrations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/> by rational Discourses, by excellent Examples, constrain them to come in: and for other things they are to be permitted to their own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the measures of the Laws, and the conduct of their Governours.</p>
                     <p>Suffer no quarrel in your Parish, and speedily suppress it when it is begun; and though all wise men will abstain from interposing in other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> mens affairs, and especially in matters of Interest, which men love too well; yet it is your Duty here to interpose, by perswading them to friendships, reconcilements, moderate prosecutions of their pretences; and by all means you prudently can, to bring them to peace and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindness.</p>
                     <p>Suffer no houses of Debauchery, of Drunkenness or Lust in your Parishes; but implore the assistance of Authority for the suppressing of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVII"/> such meeting-places and nurseries of Impiety: and as for places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Entertainment, take care that they observe the Rules of Christian Piety, and the allowed measures of Laws.</p>
                     <p>If there be any Papists or Sectaries in your Parishes, neglect not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVIII"/> to confer with them in the spirit of meekness, and by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of wise Discourses seeking to gain them. But stir up no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences against them; but leave them (if they be incurable) to the wise and merciful disposition of the Laws.</p>
                     <p>Receive not the people to doubtful Disputations: and let no names <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIX"/> of Sects or differing Religions be kept up amongst you, to the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the publick Peace and private Charity: and teach not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to estimate their Piety by their distance from any Opinion, but by their Faith in Christ, their Obedience to God and the Laws, and their Love to all Christian people, even though they be deceived.</p>
                     <p>Think no man considerable upon the point or pretence of a tender Conscience, unless he live a good life, and in all things endeavour to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXX"/> approve himself void of offence both towards God and Man: but if he be an humble Person, modest and inquiring, apt to learn and desirous of information; if he seeks for it in all ways reasonable and pious, and is obedient to Laws, then take care of him, use him tenderly, perswade him meekly, reprove him gently, and deal mercifully with him, till God shall reveal that also unto him, in which his unavoidable trouble and his temptation lies.</p>
                     <p>Mark them that cause Divisions among you, and avoid them: for such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXI"/> Persons are by the Scripture called <hi>Scandals</hi> in the abstract; they are <note place="margin">

But if any man have an Opinion, let him have it to himself, till he can be cur'd of his disease by time, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and gentle usages. But if he separates from the Church, or gathers a Congregation, he is proud, and is fallen from the Communion of Saints, and the Unity of the Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p>He that observes any of his people to be zealous, let him be careful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXII"/>

to conduct that zeal into such channels where there is least danger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency; let him employ it in something that is good; let it be press'd to fight against sin. For Zeal is like a Cancer in the Breast; feed it with good flesh, or it will devour the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Strive to get the love of the Congregation; but let it not degenerate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIII"/> into popularity. Cause them to love you and revere you; to love with Religion, not for your compliance; for the good you do them, not for that you please them. Get their love by doing your Duty, but not by omitting or spoiling any part of it: Ever remembring the severe words of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Wo be to you when all men speak well of you.</hi>

                     <p>Suffer not the common people to prattle about Religion and Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIV"/> but to speak little, to be swift to hear, and slow to speak; that they learn to do good works for necessary uses, that they work with their hands, that they may have wherewithal to give to them that need; that they study to be quiet, and learn to do their own business.</p>
                     <p>Let every Minister take care that he call upon his Charge, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXV"/> order themselves so, that they leave no void spaces of their time, but that every part of it be filled with useful or innocent employment. For where there is a space without business, that space is the proper time for danger and temptation; and no man is more miserable than he that knows not how to spend his time.</p>
                     <p>Fear no mans person in the doing of your Duty wisely, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws: Remembring always, that a servant of God can no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVI"/> more be hurt by all the powers of wickedness, than by the noise of a Files wing, or the chirping of a Sparrow. Brethren, do well for your selves: do well for your selves as long as you have time; you know not how soon death will come.</p>
                     <p>Entertain no Persons into your Assemblies from other Parishes, unless upon great occasion, or in the destitution of a Minister, or by contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVII"/> and seldom visits, or with leave: lest the labour of thy Brother be discouraged, and thy self be thought to preach Christ out of envy, and not of good will.</p>
                     <p>Never appeal to the judgment of the people in matters of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVIII"/> teach them obedience, not arrogancy; teach them to be humble, not crafty. For without the aid of false guides you will find some of them of themselves apt enough to be troublesome: and a question put into their heads, and a power of judging into their hands, is a putting it to their choice whether you shall be troubled by them this week or the next; for much longer you cannot escape.</p>
                     <p>Let no Minister of a Parish introduce any Ceremony, Rites or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIX"/> though with some seeming Piety and Devotion, but what are commanded by the Church, and established by Law: and let these also be wisely and usefully explicated to the people, that they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the reasons and measures of obedience; but let there be no more introduc'd, lest the people be burdened unnecessarily, and tempted or divided.</p>

                        <hi>IV.</hi> Rules and Advices concerning Preaching.</head>
                     <p>LEt every Minister be diligent in preaching the Word of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XL"/> to the ability that God gives him: Ever remembring, that to minister Gods Word unto the People is the one half of his great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Employment.</p>
                     <p>Let every Minister be careful that what he delivers be indeed the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLI"/> Word of God: that his Sermon be answerable to the Text; for this is Gods Word, the other ought to be according to it; that although in it self it be but the word of Man, yet by the purpose, truth, and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, it may in a secondary sence be the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>Do not spend your Sermons in general and indefinite things, as in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLII"/> to the people to get Christ, to be united to Christ, and things of the like unlimited signification; but tell them in every duty, what are the measures, what circumstances, what instruments, and what is the particular minute meaning of every general Advice. For Generals not explicated do but fill the peoples heads with empty notions, and their mouths with perpetual unintelligible talk: but their hearts remain em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, and themselves are not edified.</p>
                     <p>Let not the humors and inclinations of the people be the measures of your Doctrines, but let your Doctrines be the measure of their perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIII"/> Let them know from you what they ought to do; but if you learn from them what you ought to teach, you will give but a very ill account at the day of Judgment, of the souls committed to you. He that receives from the people what he shall teach them, is like a Nurse that asks of her Child what Physick she shall give him.</p>
                     <p>Every Minister in reproofs of sin and sinners, ought to concern himself <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIV"/> in the faults of them that are present, but not of the absent; nor in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of the times; for this can serve no end but of Faction and Sedition, publick Murmur and private Discontent; besides this it does nothing but amuse the people in the faults of others, teaching them to revile their Betters, and neglect the dangers of their own souls.</p>
                     <p>As it looks like flattery and design to preach nothing before Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates but the duty of their people and their own eminency; so it is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLV"/> beginning of Mutiny to preach to the people the duty of their Superiors and Supreme; it can neither come from a good Principle, nor tend to a good End. Every Minister ought to preach to his Parish, and urge their duty: S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist told the Souldiers what the Souldiers should do, but troubled not their heads with what was the duty of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the reproof of sins be as particular as you please, and spare no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLVI"/> mans sin, but meddle with no mans person; neither name any man, nor signifie him, neither reproach him, nor make him to be suspected; he that doth otherwise makes his Sermon to be a Libel, and the Ministry of Repentance an instrument of Revenge; and so doing he shall exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the man, but never amend the sinner.</p>
                     <p>Let the business of your Sermons be to preach holy Life, Obedience, Peace, Love among neighbours, hearty love, to live as the old Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLVII"/> did, and the new should; to do hurt to no man, to do good to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man: For in these things the honour of God consists, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord Jesus.</p>
                     <p>Press those Graces most that do most good, and make the least noise; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLVIII"/>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40276:30"/>
such as giving privately and forgiving publickly; and prescribe the grace of Charity by all the measures of it which are given by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. For this grace is not finished by good words, nor yet by good works, but it is a great building, and many materials go to the structure of it. It is worth your study, for it is the fulfilling of the Commandments.</p>
                     <p>Because it is impossible that Charity should live, unless the lust of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIX"/> tongue be mortified, let every Minister in his charge be frequent and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere against slanderers, detractors and backbiters; for the Crime of backbiting is the poison of Charity; and yet so common, that it is pass'd into a Proverb, <hi>[After a good dinner let us sit down and backbite our neighbours.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let every Minister be careful to observe, and vehement in reproving those faults of his Parishioners, of which the Laws cannot or do not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> take cognizance, such as are many degrees of intemperate drinkings, gluttony, riotous living, expences above their ability, pride, bragging, lying in ordinary conversation, covetousness, peevishness, and hasty anger, and such like. For the Word of God searches deeper than the Laws of men; and many things will be hard to prove by the measures of Courts, which are easie enough to be observed by the watchful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent eye and ear of the Guide of Souls.</p>
                     <p>In your Sermons to the people, often speak of the four last things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LI"/> of Death and Judgment, Heaven and Hell: of the Life and Death of Jesus Christ, of Gods Mercy to repenting sinners, and his Severity against the impenitent; of the formidable Examples of Gods anger pour'd forth upon Rebels, Sacrilegious, Oppressors of Widows and Orphans, and all persons guilty of crying Sins: These are useful, safe and profitable; but never run into Extravagancies and Curiosities, nor trouble your selves or them with mysterious Secrets; for there is more laid before you than you can understand; and the whole duty of man is, <hi>To fear God and keep his Commandments.</hi> Speak but very little of the secret and high things of God, but as much as you can of the lowness and humility of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Be not hasty in pronouncing damnation against any man or party in a matter of disputation. It is enough that you reprove an Error; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LII"/> what shall be the sentence against it at the day of Judgment, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not, and therefore pray for the erring person, and reprove him, but leave the sentence to his Judge.</p>
                     <p>Let your Sermons teach the duty of all states of men to whom you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LIII"/> speak; and particularly take care of Servants and Hirelings, Merchants and Tradesmen, that they be not unskilful, nor unadmonished in their respective duties; and in all things speak usefully and affectionately; for by this means you will provide for all mens needs, both for them that sin by reason of their little understanding, and them that sin because they have evil, dull, or depraved affections.</p>
                     <p>In your Sermons and Discourses of Religion, use primitive, known <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LIV"/> and accustomed words, and affect not new Phantastical or Schismatical terms: Let the Sunday Festival be called the Lords day; and pretend no fears from the common use of words amongst Christians. For they that make a business of the words of common use, and reform Religion by introducing a new word, intend to make a change but no amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they spend themselves in trifles, like the barren turf that sends forth no medicinable herbs, but store of Mushromes; and they give a demonstration that they are either impertinent people, or else of a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40276:31"/>
nature; and that they are ready to disturb the Church, if they could find occasion.</p>
                     <p>Let every Minister in his charge, as much as he can, endeavour to destroy all popular errors and evil principles taken up by his people, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LV"/> or others with whom they converse; especially those that directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the indispensable necessity of a holy life: let him endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand in what true and useful sence Christs active obedience is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us; let him make his people fear the deferring of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and putting it off to their death-bed; let him explicate the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Faith, so that it be an active and quickning principle of Charity; let him, as much as he may, take from them all confidences that slacken their obedience and diligence; let him teach them to impute all their sins to their own follies and evil choice, and so build them up in a most holy faith to a holy life; ever remembring that in all ages it hath been the greatest artifice of Satan to hinder the increase of Christs Kingdom, by destroying those things in which it does consist, <hi>viz.</hi> Peace and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, Holiness and Mortification.</p>
                     <p>Every Minister ought to be careful that he never expound Scriptures in publick contrary to the known sence of the Catholick Church, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LVI"/> particularly of the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor introduce any Doctrine against any of the four first General Councils; for these, as they are measures of truth, so also of necessity; that is, as they are safe, so they are sufficient; and besides what is taught by these, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of belief is necessary to salvation.</p>
                     <p>Let no Preacher bring before the people in his Sermons or Discourses, the Arguments of great and dangerous Heresies, though with a purpose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LVII"/> to confute them; for they will much easier retain the Objection than understand the Answer.</p>
                     <p>Let not the Preacher make an Article of Faith to be a matter of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LVIII"/> but teach it with plainness and simplicity, and confirm it with easie arguments and plain words of Scripture, but without objection; let them be taught to believe, but not to argue, lest if the arguments meet with a scrupulous person, it rather shake the foundation by curious inquiry, than establish it by arguments too hard.</p>
                     <p>Let the Preacher be careful that in his Sermons he use no light, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest or ridiculous expressions, but what is wise, grave, useful and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LIX"/> for edification; that when the Preacher brings truth and gravity, the people may attend with fear and reverence.</p>
                     <p>Let no Preacher envy any man that hath a greater audience, or more fame in Preaching than himself; let him not detract from him or lessen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LX"/> his reputation directly or indirectly: for he that cannot be even with his brother but by pulling him down, is but a dwarf still; and no man is the better for making his brother worse. In all things desire that Christ's Kingdom may be advanc'd; and rejoyce that he is served, whoever be the Minister; that if you cannot have the fame of a great Preacher, yet you may have the reward of being a good man; but it is hard to miss both.</p>
                     <p>Let every Preacher in his Parish take care to explicate to the people the Mysteries of the great Festivals, as of Christmas, Easter, Ascension<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXI"/> Whitsunday, Trinity Sunday, the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> because these Feasts containing in them the great Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of our Faith, will with most advantage convey the mysteries to the people, and fix them in their memories, by the solemnity and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40276:31"/>
In all your Sermons and Discourses speak nothing of God but what is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXII"/> honourable and glorious; and impute not to him such things, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of which a wise and good man will not own: never suppose him to be author of sin, or the procurer of our damnation. For <hi>God cannot be tempted, neither tempteth he any man. God is true, and every man a lyar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let no Preacher compare one Ordinance with another; as Prayer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXIII"/> with Preaching, to the disparagement of either; but use both in their proper seasons, and according to appointed Order.</p>
                     <p>Let no man preach for the praise of men; but if you meet it, instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch and stand upon your guard, and pray against your own vanity; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXIV"/> and by an express act of acknowledgment and adoration return the praise to God. Remember that <hi>Herod</hi> was for the omission of this smitten by an Angel; and do thou tremble, fearing lest the judgment of God be otherwise than the sentence of the people.</p>

                     <p>Let a Bell be tolled when the Catechising is to begin, that all who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXVI"/> desire it may be present; but let all the more ignorant and uninstructed part of the people, whether they be old or young, be requir'd to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: that no person in your Parishes be ignorant in the foundations of Religion: Ever remembring, that if in these things they be unskilful, whatever is taught besides, is like a house built upon the sand.</p>
                     <p>Let every Minister teach his people the use, practice, methods and benefits of meditation or mental prayer. Let them draw out for them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXVII"/> helps and rules for their assistance in it; and furnish them with materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, concerning the life and death of the ever blessed Jesus, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, our own meanness, the dreadful sound of the last Trumpet, the infinite event of the two last sentences at doomsday: let them be taught to consider what they have been, what they are, and what they shall be; and above all things what are the issues of eternity; glories never to cease, pains never to be ended.</p>
                     <p>Let every Minister exhort his people to a frequent confession of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXVIII"/> sins, and a declaration of the state of their Souls; to a conversation with their Minister in spiritual things, to an enquiry concerning all the parts of their duty: for by preaching, and catechising, and private enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, all the needs of Souls can best be serv'd; but by preaching alone they cannot.</p>
                     <p>Let the people be exhorted to keep Fasting days, and the Feasts of the Church; according to their respective capacities; so it be done without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXIX"/> burden to them, and without becoming a snare; that is, that upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion, and holy desires to please God, they spend some time in Religion, besides the Lords-day: but be very careful that the Lords-day be kept religiously, according to the severest measures of the Church, and the commands of Authority: ever remembring that as they give but little Testimony of Repentance and Mortification, who never fast; so they give but small evidence of their joy in God and Religion, who are unwilling solemnly to partake of the publick and Religious Joys of the Christian Church.</p>

                     <p>A Minister must not stay till he be sent for; but of his own accord and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXII"/> care to go to them, to examine them, to exhort them to perfect their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to strengthen their faith, to encourage their patience, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to resignation, to the renewing of their holy vows, to the love of God, to be reconcil'd to their neighbours, to make restitution and amends, to confess their sins, to settle their estate, to provide for their charges, to do acts of piety and charity, and above all things, that they take care they do not sin towards the end of their lives. For if repentance on our death-bed seem so very late for the sins of our life; what time shall be left to repent us of the sins we commit on our death-bed?</p>
                     <p>When you comfort the afflicted, endeavour to bring them to the true love of God; for he that serves God for Gods sake, it is almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXIII"/> he should be oppressed with sorrow.</p>
                     <p>In answering the cases of conscience of the sick or afflicted people, consider not who asks, but what he asks; and consult in your answers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXIV"/> more with the estate of his soul, than the conveniency of his estate; for no flattery is so fatal as that of the Physician or the Divine.</p>
                     <p>If the sick person enquires concerning the final estate of his soul, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXV"/> is to be reprov'd rather than answer'd; only he is to be called upon to finish his duty, to do all the good he can in that season, to pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and acceptance; but you have nothing to do to meddle with passing final sentences; neither cast him down in despair, nor raise him up to vain and unreasonable confidences. But take care that he be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly dismiss'd.</p>
                     <p>In order to these and many other good purposes, every Minister ought frequently to converse with his Parishioners; to go to their houses, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXVI"/> always publickly, with witness, and with prudence, lest what is charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intended be scandalously reported: and in all your conversation be sure to give good example, and upon all occasions to give good counsel.</p>

                     <p>Be careful in all the publick administrations of your Parish, that the poor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LXXXII"/> be provided for. Think it no shame to beg for Christs poor members; stir up the people to liberal alms by your word and your example.

                     </gap>, Words strangely Emphatical, that can't be put into <hi>English;</hi> and if they could, they would not be able to convey to our minds the Notion that they design: for it is too big for any Expressions; and, after all that can be said, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve with our Apostle, <hi>It does not yet appear what we shall be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this Distance we cannot make any likely guesses or conjectures at the glory of that future state. Men make very imperfect Descriptions of Countries or Cities, that never were there themselves, nor saw the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with their own eyes. It is not for any mortal Creature to make a Map of that <hi>Canaan</hi> that lies above: It is to all us that live here on the hither-side of Death, an unknown Countrey, and an undiscover'd Land. It may be, some Heavenly Pilgrim, that with his holy thoughts and ardent desires, is continually travelling thitherward, arrives sometimes near the Borders of the promis'd Land, and the Suburbs of the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and gets upon the top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> and there he has an imperfect Prospect of a brave Countrey, that lies afar way off; but he can't tell how to describe it, and all that he hath to say, to satisfie the curious Enquirer, is only this, If he would know the glories of it, he must go and see it. It was believ'd of old, that those places that lie under the Line, were burnt up by the continual heat of the Sun, and were not habitable, either by man or beast: But later Discoveries tell us, that there are the most pleasant Countries that the Earth can shew; insomuch that some have plac'd Paradise it self in that Climate. Sure I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40276:35"/>
am, of all the Regions of the Intellectual World, and the several Lands that are peopled either with Men or Angels, the most pleasant Countries they lie under the Line, under the direct beams of the Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, where there is an eternal Day, and an eternal Spring; where is that Tree of Life, that beareth twelve manner of Fruits, and yieldeth her Fruit every Month: Thus we may use Figures, and Metaphors, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, and tell you of fruitful Meads, and spacious Fields, and winding Rivers, and purling Brooks, and chanting Birds, and shady Groves, and pleasant Gardens, and lovely Bowers, and noble Seats, and stately Palaces, and goodly People, and excellent Laws, and sweet Societies; but, this is but to frame little comparisons to please our childish fancies: and, just such discourses as a blind man would make concerning Colours; so do we talk of those things we never saw, and disparage the state whilst we would recommend it. Indeed it requires some Saint or Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to discourse upon the Subject; and yet that would not do neither: For though they might be able to speak something of it, yet we should want ears to hear it. Neither can those things be declar'd but in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Heaven, which would be little understood by us, the poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this lower World; they are indeed things too great to be brought within the compass of words. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had been rapt up into the third Heaven, he saw <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, things unlawful, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, to be utter'd; and, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor can it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath prepared for them that love him;</hi> and, <hi>It does not yet appear what we shall be,</hi> said that beloved Disciple, that lay in the bosom of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>You will not now expect, that I should give you a relation of that which cannot be utter'd, nor so much <hi>as conceiv'd;</hi> or declare unto you what our Eagle-sighted Evangelist tells us <hi>does not yet appear.</hi> But, that you may understand, that that which sets this state of Happiness so beyond the reach of all imagination, is only its transcendent excellency; I shall tell you something of what does already appear of it, and may be known concerning it.</p>
                  <p>First of all we are assur'd that we shall then be freed from all the evils and miseries that we now labour under: Vanity and Misery, they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> two words that speak the whole of this present World; the enjoyments of it are dreams, and fancies, and shadows, and appearances; and, if any thing be, it is only Evil and Misery that is real and substantial. Vanity and folly, labour and pains, cares and fears, crosses and disappointments, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and diseases, they make up the whole of our portion here. This life it is begun in a Cry, and it ends in a Groan; and he that lives most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, his life is checker'd with black and white, and his dayes are not all Sun-shine, but some are cloudy and gloomy, and there is a Worm at the root of all his joy, that soon eats out the sap and heart of it; and the Gourd in whose shade he now so much pleases himself, by to morrow will be wither'd and gone. But Heaven is not subject to these mixtures and uncertainties; it is a region of calmness and serenity, and the Soul is there gotten above the Clouds, and is not annoyed with those storms and tempests that are here below. All tears shall then be wiped from our Eyes; and though sorrow may endure for the night of this World, yet joy will spring up in the morning of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>We are sure we shall be freed from this earthly, and cloath'd with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> heavenly and glorified Body. These bodies of ours they are the graves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and sepulchres, the prisons and dungeons of our Heaven-born Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:40276:35"/>
and though we deck and adorn them, and pride our selves in their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and comeliness; yet, when all is done, they are but sinks of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defilement: they expose us to many pains and diseases, and incline us to many lusts and passions, and the more we pamper them, the greater burden they are unto our minds; they impose upon our reasons, and by their steams and vapours cast a mist before our understandings; they clog our affections, and like a heavy weight depress us unto this earth, and keep us from soaring aloft among the winged Inhabitants of the upper Regions: But those Robes of light and glory, which we shall be cloath'd withall at the Resurrection of the Just, and those Heavenly Bodies which the Gospel hath then assur'd untous, they are not subject to any of these mischiefs and inconveniencies, but are fit and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date instruments for the Soul in its highest Exaltations. And this is an argument that the Gospel does dwell much upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Redemption of our Bodies, that <hi>He shall change our vile bodies, that they may be like unto his glorious Body;</hi> and we are taught to look upon it as one great piece of our Reward, that we shall be <hi>cloath'd upon with our house which is from Heaven;</hi> that <hi>this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal immortality:</hi> that, <hi>as we have born the image of the earthly, so we must bear the image of the heavenly Adam:</hi> who was <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>of the earth earthy.</hi> And therefore, I think, the Schools put too mean a rate upon this great Promise of the Gospel, The Resurrection of our Bodies; and, I believe, it might be demonstrated from the principles of sound Philosophy, That this Article of our Christian Faith, which the Atheist makes so much sport withall, is so far from being chargeable with any absurdity, that it is founded upon the Highest Reason: for, seeing we find by too great an experience, that the Soul has so close and necessary a dependance upon this gross and earthy Mass that we now carry about with us; it may be disputed with some probability, whether it be ever able to act indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of all matter whatsoever: at least, we are assur'd, that the state of conjunction is most connatural to her; and that, Intellectual pleasure it self is not only multiplied, but the better felt, by its redundancy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body and spirits: and if it be so, then the purer and more defecate the Body is, the better will the Soul be appointed for the exercise of its noblest Operations; and it will be no mean piece of our reward hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that that which is sown <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>We are sure, that we shall then be free from sin, and all those foolish lusts and passions that we are now enslaved unto. The life of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is a continual Warfare; and he endures many sore conflicts, and makes many sad complaints, and often bemoans himself after such a manner, as this: Wo is me, that I am forc'd to dwell in <hi>Meshech,</hi> and to have my habitation in the Tents of <hi>Kedar;</hi> that there should be so many <hi>Goliah</hi>'s within me, that defie the Host of <hi>Israel;</hi> so many sons of <hi>Anak</hi> that hinder my entrance into the <hi>Land of Promise,</hi> and the Rest of God; that I should toil and labour among the bricks, and live in bondage unto these worse than Egyptian Task-Masters. Thus does he sit down by the Rivers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and weep over those ruines and desolations that these worse than Assyrian Armies have made in the City, and House of his God. And many a time does he cry out in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Soul, <hi>Wretched creature that I am! Who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> And though, through his faith, and courage, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40276:36"/>
constancy, he be daily getting ground of his Spiritual enemies; yet it is but by inches, and every step he takes, he must fight for it; and living as he does in an Enemies Countrey, he is forc'd alwayes to be upon his Guard; and if he slumber never so little, presently he is surpriz'd by a watchful Adversary. This is our portion here, and our lot is this; but when we arrive unto those Regions of bliss and glory that are above, we shall then stand safely upon the shore, and and see all our enemies, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his Host, drown'd and destroy'd in the <hi>Rea-Sea,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliver'd from the World, and the Flesh, and the Devil, Death, and Sin, and Hell, we shall sing the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> an Epinicion, and Song of eternal Triumph, unto the God of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>We shall be sure to meet with the best company that Earth or Heaven affords: Good Company it is the great pleasure of the life of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> man; And we shall then come <hi>to the innumerable company of Angels, and the general Assembly of the Church of the First-born, and to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of just men made perfect, and to Iesus the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> The Oracle tells <hi>Amelius,</hi> enquiring what was become of <hi>Polinus</hi>'s soul, that he was gone to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and as many as had born a part in the Quire of heavenly love. And I may say to every good man, that he shall go to the Company of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob; Moses, David,</hi> and <hi>Samuel;</hi> all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, and all the holy men of God that have been in all the Ages of the World. All those brave and excellent persons that have been scattered at the greatest distance of time and place, and in their several generations have been the salt of the earth to preserve mankind from utter degeneracy and corruption; These shall be all ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and meet in one Constellation in that Firmament of Glory. <hi>O Praeclarum diem, cùm ad illud divinorum animorum concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um coetúmque proficiscar, atque ex hac turba ac colluvione discedam! O that blessed day, when we shall make our escape from this medly and confused riot, and shall arrive to that great Council and general Randevouz, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and god-like Spirits!</hi> But, which is more than all, we shall then meet our Lord Jesus Christ, the Head of our Recovery, whose story is now so delightful unto us, as reporting nothing of him, but the greatest sweetness and innocence, and meekness and patience, and mercy and tenderness, and benignity and goodness, and whatever can render any person lovely or amiable; and who, out of his dear love and deep compassion unto mankind, gave up himself unto the death for us men, and for our salvation. And if Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> made it one of his Wishes, to have seen Jesus Christ in the flesh; how much more desirable is it, to see him out of his terrestrial weeds, in his robes of Glory, with all his redeemed Ones about him! And this I cannot but look upon, as a great Advantage and priviledge of that future State; for I am not apt to swallow down that Conceit of the Schools, that we shall spend Eternity in gazing upon the naked Deity; for certainly the happiness of man consists in having all his faculties, in their due subordinations, gratified with their proper objects; and I cannot but believe, a great part of Heaven to be the blest Society that is there; Their enravishing beauty, that is to say, their inward life and perfection, flowring forth and raying it self thorow their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified bodies; The rare discourses wherewith they entertain one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The pure and chast and spotless, and yet most ardent Love,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40276:36"/>
wherewith they embrace each other; The ecstatick Devotions wherein they joyn together: and certainly every pious and devout soul will readily acknowledge with me, that it must needs be matter of unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleasure, to be taken into the Quire of Angels and Seraphims, and the glorious Company of the Apostles, and the goodly Fellowship of the Prophets, and the noble Army of Martyrs; and to joyn with them in singing Praises, and Hallelujahs, and Songs of joy, and Triumph unto our great Creator and Redeemer, the Father of Spirits, and the Lover of Souls, unto him that sits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>We are sure we shall then have our capacities fill'd, and all our desires answered, <hi>They hunger no more, neither thirst any more; for, the Lamb</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                     <hi>which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and shall lead them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to living fountains of waters.</hi> What vast degrees of perfection and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness the nature of man is capable of, we may best understand, by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the person of Christ, taken into the nearest union with Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and made God's Vicegerent in the World, and the Head and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the whole Creation. In this our narrow and contracted state we are apt to think too meanly of our selves, and do not understand the dignity of our own Natures, what we were made for, and what we are capable of: but, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> somewhere observes, We are like Children, from our birth brought up in ignorance of, and at a great distance from, our Parents and Relations; and have forgot the Nobleness of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and rank our selves and our fortunes among the lot of Beggers, and mean and ordinary persons; though we are the off-spring of a great Prince, and were born to a Kingdom. It does indeed become creatures to think modestly of themselves; yet, if we consider it aright, it will be found very hard, to set any bounds or limits to our own happiness, and say, Hitherto it shall arise, and no further. For that wherein the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Man consists, <hi>viz.</hi> Truth and Goodness, the Communication of the Divine Nature, and the Illapses of Divine Love, it does not cloy, or glut, or satiate; but every participation of them does widen and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our Souls, and fits us for further and further Receptions: the more we have, the more we are capable of; the more we are fill'd, the more room is made in our Spirits; and thus it is still and still, even till we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto such degrees as we can assign no measures unto.</p>
                  <p>We shall then be made like unto God, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; said the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> Salvation can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be accomplish'd, but by becoming God-like; <hi>It does not yet appear what we shall be,</hi> but <hi>when he shall appear we shall be like him;</hi> sayes our Evangelist; for <hi>we shall see him as he is.</hi> There is no <hi>seeing God as he is,</hi> but <hi>by becoming like unto him;</hi> nor is there any injoying of him, but by being transformed into his Image and Similitude. Men usually have very strange Notions concerning God, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him; or rather, these are words, to which there is no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent conception in their minds: but if we would understand God aright, we must look upon him as Infinite Wisdom, Righteousness, Love, Goodness, and whatever speaks any thing of Beauty and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section; and if we pretend to worship him, it must be by loving and adoring his transcendent Excellencies; and if we hope to enjoy him, it must be by conformity unto him, and participation of his Nature.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40276:37"/>
The frame and constitution of things is such, that it is impossible that Man should arrive to happiness any other way. And, if the Soveraignty of God should dispense with our obedience, the Nature of the thing would not permit us to be happy without it: If we live only the Animal Life, we may indeed be happy, as Beasts are happy; but the Happiness that belongs to a Rational and Intellectual Being, can never be attain'd but in a way of holiness and conformity unto the Divine Will: for, such a temper and disposition of mind is necessary unto Happiness, not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any arbitrarious constitution of Heaven, but, the eternal Laws of Righteousness, and immutable respects of things, do require and exact it: Yea, I may truly say, That God and Christ, without us, cannot make us happy: for we are not conscious to our selves of any thing, but only the operations of our own minds; and 'tis not the person of God and Christ, but their Life and Nature, wherein consists our formal Happiness: For, What is the happiness of God himself, but only that pleasure and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that results from a sense of his Infinite perfections? And how is it possible for a Creature to be more happy, than by partaking of that, in its measure and proportion, which is the happiness of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p>The Soul, being thus prepar'd, shall live in the Presence of God, and lie under the influences and illapses of Divine Love and Goodness; <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will that they whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory.</hi> They that fight manfully under the Banners of Heaven, and overcome their spiritual Enemies, <hi>They shall eat of the hidden Manna, and become Pillars in the Temple of God, and shall go no more out: They shall stand before the Throne of God continually, and serve him Day and Night in his Temple, and he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell amongst them.</hi> God shall put under them his everlasting Arms, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them in his Bosom, and they shall suck the full Breasts of eternal Goodness: For now there is nothing can hinder the most near and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conjunction of the Soul with God; for, things that are alike, do ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily mingle with one another: but the mixture that is betwixt Bodies, be they never so homogeneal, comes but to an External Touch; for their parts can never run up into one another. But there is no such <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or resistance, amongst spiritual Beings; and we are estranged from God (<gap reason="foreign">

This therefore is the Soul's progress from that state of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to <hi>Illumination,</hi> and so to <hi>Union.</hi> There are several faculties in the Soul of Man, that are conformed to several kinds of objects; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Life a man is awaked into, so these faculties do exert themselves: and though whilst we live barely an Animal Life, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with little more than this outward World, and the objects of our Senses; yet there are faculties within us that are receptive of God, and when we arrive once unto a due measure of Purity of Spirit, the Rayes of Heavenly Light will as certainly shine into our Minds, as the beams of the Sun, when it arises above the Horison, do illuminate the clear and pellucid air: And from this sight and illumination, the Soul proceeds to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40276:37"/>
an intimate union with God, and to a <hi>tast</hi> and <hi>touch</hi> of him. This is that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that <hi>silent touch</hi> with God, that fills the Soul with unexpressible joy and triumph: For, if the objects of this ouward world that strike upon our senses do so hugely please and delight us; What infinite pleasure then must there needs be in those Touches and Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that the Divine Love and Goodness shall make upon our Souls? But these are things that we may talk of, as we would do of a sixth Sense, or something we have no distinct Notion or Idaea of; but the perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of them belongs only to the future state of <hi>Comprehension.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, we shall have our Knowledge, and our Love, which are the most perfect and beatifying Acts of our Minds, employed about their noblest objects in their most exalted Measures; For a Man to resolve himself in some knotty Question, or answer some stubborn Argument, or find out some noble Conclusion, or solve some hard Probleme, what ineffable pleasure does it create many times to a contemplative mind?

To have the secrets of Nature disclos'd, and the mysteries of Art reveal'd; but above all, the Riddles of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence unfolded, are such Jewels as I know many searching and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Spirits would be willing to purchase at any rate. When we come to Heaven (I will not say, we shall see all things in the mirror of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, for that it may be is an Extravagancy of the Schools; nor, that any one true Proposition through the concatenation of Truth, will then multiply it self into the explicit knowledge of all Conclusions whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for I belive that a Fancy too, but) our Knowledge shall be strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarg'd, and, for ought I can determine, be for ever receiving new Additions, and fresh Accruements; The Clew of Divine Providence will then be unravell'd, and all those Difficulties which now perplex us, will be easily assoyl'd, and we shall then perceive that the Wisdom and Goodness of God, is a vast and comprehensive Thing, and moves in a far larger Sphere than we are aware of in this state of narrowness and imperfection: But there is something greater and beyond all this; and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> has a strange Expression, That we shall then see God even as he is; and God, we know, is the well-spring of Perfection and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Fountain and Original of all Beauty; he is infinitely glorious, and lovely, and excellent; and if we see him as he is, all this Glory must descend into us and become ours: for we can no otherwayes see God (as I said before) but by becoming Deiform, by being changed into the same Glory. But love, that is it, which makes us most happy, and by that we are most intimately conjoyn'd unto God, <hi>For he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him:</hi> And how pleasant beyond all imagination must it needs be, to have the Soul melted into a flame of Love, and that Fire fed and nourish'd by the enjoyment of its Beloved; To be transported into Ecstasies, and Raptures of Love; to be swallow'd up in the embraces of eternal Sweetness; to be lost in the Source and Fountain of Happiness and Bliss, like a spark in the Fire, or a beam in the Sun, or drop in the Ocean.</p>
                  <p>It may be you will tell me, I have been all this while confuting my Text, and giving you a Relation of that which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, <hi>does not yet appear what it is;</hi> But my design has been the same with the Holy
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40276:38"/>
Evangelist's; and that is, to represent unto you how transcendently great that State of Happiness must needs be; when as, by what way we are able to apprehend of it, it is infinitely the object of our desires; and yet we are assur'd by those that are best able to tell, That the best and greatest part of the Countrey is yet undiscovered, and that we cannot so much as guess at the pleasure of it, till we come to enjoy it: And indeed it is impossible it should be otherwise; for, Happiness being a matter of Sense, all the words in the World cannot convey the Notion of it unto our Minds, and it is only to be understood by them that feel it; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But though it does not yet appear what we shall be; yet so much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready appears of it, that it cannot but seem the most worthy Object of our Endeavours and Desires; and by some few Clusters that have been shewn us of this good Land, we may guess what pleasant and delightful Fruit it bears: And if we have but any reverence of our selves, and will but consider the dignity of our Natures, and the vastness of that Happiness we are capable of; me thinks we should be alwayes travelling towards that Heavenly Countrey, though our way lies through a Wilderness: and be striving for this great Prize and immortal Crown; and be clearing our eyes, and purging our sight, that we may come to this Vision of God; shaking off all fond passions, and dirty desires, and breathing forth our Souls in such Aspirations as these:</p>
                  <p>My Soul thirsteth for thee, O Lord, in a dry and barren Land, where no Water is; O that thou would'st stistil, and drop down the Dew of thy Heavenly Grace into all its secret Chinks and Pores; One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, That I may dwell in the House of the Lord all the dayes of my Life, and behold his Glory: for a day in thy Courts is better than a thousand, and I had rather be a Door-keeper in the House of the Lord, than dwell in the Tents of Wickedness. All the Kings of the Earth, they are thy Tributaries; the Kings of <hi>Tarshish,</hi> and of the Isles, bring Presents unto thee; the Kings of <hi>Sheba</hi> and <hi>Seba</hi> offer Gifts. O that we could but pay thee, that which is so due unto thee, the tribute of our Hearts! The Heathen are come into thine Inheritance; thy holy Temple have they defil'd: Help us, O God of our Salvation, and deliver us, and purge away our sins from us, for thy Name's sake! O that the Lord whom we seek, would come to his own House, and give Peace there, and fill it with his Glory! Come and cleanse thine own Temple, for we have made it a Den of Thieves, which should have been a House of Prayer! O that we might never give sleep to our eyes, nor slumber to our eye-lids, till we have prepar'd a House for the Lord, and a Tabernacle for the God of <hi>Iacob!</hi> The Curse of <hi>Cain</hi> it is fallen upon us, and we are as Vagabonds in the Earth; and wander from one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to another. O that our Souls might come at last to dwell in God, our fixed and eternal Habitation! We, like silly Doves, fly up and down the Earth, but can find no rest for the Sole of our feet; O that, after all our weariness and our wandrings, we might return into the Ark; and that God would put forth his hand and take us, and pull us in unto Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self! We have too long lived upon Vanity and Emptiness, the wind and the whirl-wind; O that we may now begin to feed upon Substance, and delight our selves in Marrow and Fatness! O that God would strike our
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40276:38"/>
rocky Hearts, that there might spring up a Fountain in the Wilderness, and Pools in the Desart; that we might drink of that Water, whereof whosoever drinks, shall never thirst more; that God would give us that Portion of Goods that falleth to us, not to waste it with riotous living, but therewith to feed our languishing Souls, left they be weary and faint by the way! We ask not the Childrens Bread, but the Crums that fall from thy Table; that our Baskets may be fill d with thy Fragments: for they will be better than Wine, and sweeter than the Honey, and the Honey-Comb, and more pleasant to us than a Feast of fat things. We have wandred too long in a barren, and howling Desart, where wild Beasts, and doleful Creatures, Owls and Bats, Satyrs and Dragons, keep their haunts; O that we might be fed in green Pastures; and led by the still Waters, that the Winter might be past, and the Rain over and gone, that the Flowers may appear on the Earth, and the time of the singing of Birds may come, and the Voice of the Turtle may be heard in our Land! We have lived too long in <hi>Sodom,</hi> which is the place that God at last will destroy: O that we might arise and be gone; and, while we are lingring, that the Angels of God would lay hold upon our hands (and be merciful unto us) and bring us forth, and set us without the City; and that we may never look back any more, but may escape unto the Mountain, and dwell safe in the Rock of Ages! Wisdom hath killed her Beasts, she hath mingled her Wine, and furnished her Table; O that we might eat of her Meat, and drink of her Wine which she hath min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled! God knocks at the doors of our Hearts; O let us open unto him those everlasting Gates, that he may Sup with us, and we with him; for he will bring his Chear along with him, and will feast us with Manna, and Angels food! O that the Sun of Righteousness might arise and melt the Iciness of our Hearts! That God would send forth his Spirit, and with his warmth and heat dissolve our frozen Souls; that God would breath into our minds, those still and gentle Gales of Divine Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that may blow up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and increase in us the flames of heavenly Love! That we may be a whole burnt-Offering, and all the substance of our Souls be consumed by fire from Heaven, and ascend up in Clouds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense? That, as so many sparks, we might be alwayes mounting upward, till we return again into our proper Elements! That, like so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Rivulets, we may be continually making toward the Sea, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rest till we lose our selves in that Ocean of Goodness, from whence we first came! That we may open our Mouths wide, that God may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them! That we may so perfectly discharge our selves of all strange Desires and Passions, that our Souls may be nothing else but a deep Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and vast Capacity to be fill'd with all the fulness of God! Let but these be the breathings of our Spirits, and this Divine Magnetism will most certainly draw down God into our Souls, and we shall have some Praelibations of that Happiness; some small glimpses, and little discoveries whereof, is all that belongs to this state of Mortality.</p>

I Have as yet done but the half of my Text: and I have another Text yet to preach upon, and a very large and copious one, The great Person, whose Obsequies we here come to celebrate: His fame is so great throughout the World, that he stands in no need of an Encomium; and yet his worth is much greater than his fame; It is impossible not to speak great things of him, and yet it is impossible to speak what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves; and the meanness of an Oration will but fully the brightness of his Excellencies: But Custom requires that something should be said, and it is a Duty and a Debt that we owe only unto his Memory: and I hope, his great Soul, if it hath any knowledge of what is done here below, will not be offended at the smallness of our Offering.</p>
                  <p>He was born at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and brought up in the Free-School there, and was ripe for the University, afore Custom would allow of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance; but by that time he was Thirteen years old, he was entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caius-</hi>Colledge; and as soon as he was Graduate, he was chosen fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Had he lived amongst the ancient Pagans he had been usher'd into the World with a Miracle, and Swans must have danc'd and sung at his Birth; and he must have been a great <hi>Hero,</hi> and no less than the Son of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the God of Wisdom and Eloquence.</p>
                  <p>He was a Man long afore he was of Age; and knew little more of the state of Childhood, than its Innocency and Pleasantness. From the University, by that time he was Master of Arts, he removed to <hi>London,</hi> and became publick Lecturer in the Church of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s; where he preached to the admiration and astonishment of his Auditory; and by his florid and youthful beauty, and sweet and pleasant air, and sublime and rais'd discourses, he made his hearers take him for some young An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, newly descended from the Visions of Glory; The fame of this new Star, that out-shone all the rest of the Firmament, quickly came to the notice of the great Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who would needs have him preach before him; which he performed not less to his wonder than satisfaction; His discourse was beyond exception, and beyond imitation: yet the wise Prelate thought him too young; but the great Youth humbly begg'd his Grace <hi>to pardon that fault,</hi> and promised, <hi>If he liv d, he would mend it.</hi> However the grand Patron of Learning and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, thought it for the advantage of the World, that such mighty Parts should be afforded better opportunities of study and Improvement, than a course of constant preaching would allow of; and to that purpose he placed him in his own Colledge of <hi>All-Souls</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> where Love and Admiration still waited upon him: which so long as there is any spark of ingenuity in the breasts of men, must needs be the inseparable Attendants of so extraordinary a worth and sweetness. He had not been long here, afore my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> bestowed upon him the Rectory of <hi>Uphing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in <hi>Rutland-shire,</hi> and soon after preferr'd him to be Chaplain to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr of blessed and immortal Memory. Thus were prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments heaped upon him, but still less than his deserts; and that not through the fault of his great Masters, but because the amplest Honours and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were poor and inconsiderable, compar'd with the greatness of his Worth and Merit.</p>
                  <p>This Great Man had no sooner launch'd into the World, but a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tempest arose, and a barbarous and unnatural War disturb'd a long and uninterrupted Peace and Tranquillity, and brought all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40276:39"/>
things into disorder and confusion; but his Religion taught him to be Loyal, and ingag'd him on his <hi>Prince</hi>'s side, whose Cause and Quarrel he alwayes own'd and maintain'd with a great courage and constancy; till at last, he and his little Fortune were shipwrackt in that great <hi>Hurricane,</hi> that overturn'd both Church and State: This fatal Storm cast him ashore in a private corner of the World, and a tender Providence shrowded him under her Wings, and the Prophet was fed in the Wilderness; and his great worthiness procur'd him friends, that supplied him with bread and necessaries. In this Solitude he began to write those excellent Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which are enough of themselves to furnish a Library, and will be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to all succeeding Generations, for their greatness of Wit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundness of Judgment, and richness of Fancy, and clearness of Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and copiousness of Invention, and general usefulness to all the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of a Christian: And by these he soon got a great Reputation among all persons of Judgment and Indifferency, and his Name will grow greater still, as the World grows better and wiser.</p>
                  <p>When he had spent some Years in this Retirement, it pleas'd God to visit his Family with Sickness, and to take to himself the dear Pledges of his Favour, three Sons of great hopes and expectations, within the space of two or three Months: And though he had learned a quiet Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the Divine Will; yet the Affliction touch'd him so sensibly, that it made him desirous to leave the Countrey; And going to <hi>London,</hi> he there met my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> a Person of great Honour and Generosity; who making him a kind Proffer, the good man embraced it, and that brought him over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and setled him at <hi>Portmore,</hi> a place made for Study and Contemplation, which he therefore dearly lov'd; and here he wrote his <hi>Cases of Conscience:</hi> A Book that is able alone to give its Author Immortality.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Wheel of Providence brought about the King's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Restauration, and there began a new World, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters, and out of a confused <hi>Chaos</hi> brought forth Beauty and Order, and all the Three Nations were inspir'd with a new Life, and became drunk with an excess of Joy: Among the rest, this Loyal Subject went over to congratulate the Prince and Peoples Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and bear a part in the Universal Triumph.</p>
                  <p>It was not long ere his Sacred Majesty began the settlement of the Church, and the great Doctor <hi>Ieremy Taylor</hi> was resolv'd upon for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Conor;</hi> and not long after, <hi>Dromore</hi> was added to it: and it was but reasonable that the King and Church should consider their Champion, and reward the pains and sufferings he under-went in the Defence of their Cause and Honour. With what care and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he discharg'd his Office, we are all his Witnesses; what good Rules and Directions he gave his Clergy, and how he taught us the practice of them by his own Example. Upon his coming over Bishop, he was made a Privy-Councellor; and the University of <hi>Dublin</hi> gave him their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by recommending him for their Vice-Chancellor: which honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Office he kept to his dying day.</p>
                  <p>During his being in this See, he wrote several excellent Discourses, particularly his <hi>Disswasive from Popery</hi> (which was receiv'd by a general approbation;) and a <hi>Vindication</hi> of it (now in the Press) from some impertinent Cavillers, that pretend to answer Books, when there is nothing towards it, more than the very <hi>Title-page.</hi> This great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40276:40"/>
improv'd his Talent with a mighty Industry, and managed his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardship rarely well; and his Master, when he call'd for his Accounts, found him busie and at his Work, and employed upon an excellent Subject, <hi>A Discourse upon the Beatitudes;</hi> which, if finisht, would have been of great use to the World, and solv'd most of the Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that occur to a Christian, in all the varieties of states and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But the All-wise God hath ordained it otherwise, and hath called home his good Servant, to give him a portion in that Blessedness that Jesus Christ hath promised to all his faithful Disciples and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
                  <p>Thus having given you a brief Account of his Life, I know you will now expect a character of his Person; but I fore-see, it will befal him, as it does all Glorious Subjects, that are but disparaged by a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; One thing I am secure of, that I shall not be thought to speak <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole's;</hi> for the Subject can hardly be reached, by any expressions: For he was none of God's ordinary works, but his Endowments were so many, and so great, as really made him a Miracle.</p>
                  <p>Nature had befriended him much in his Constitution; for he was a person of a most sweet and obliging Humour, of great Candour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity; and there was so much of Salt and fineness of Wit, and pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Address in his familiar Discourses, as made his Conversation have all the pleasantness of a Comedy, and all the usefulness of a Sermon: His Soul was made up of Harmony, and he never spake, but he charm'd his Hearer, not only with the clearness of his Reason; but all his Words, and his very Tone, and Cadencies were strangely Musical.</p>
                  <p>But, That which did most of all captivate and enravish, was, The gaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and richness of his Fancy; for he had much in him of that natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm, that inspires all great Poets and Orators; and there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ferment in his Blood and Spirits, that set his Fancy bravely a work, and made it swell, and teem, and become pregnant to such degrees of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriancy, as nothing but the greatness of his Wit and judgment, could have kept it within due bounds and measures.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it was a rare Mixture, and a single Instance, hardly to be found in an Age: for the great Tryer of Wits has told us, That there is a peculiar and several <hi>Complexion,</hi> requir'd for <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Fancy;</hi> and yet you might have found all these, in this great Personage, in their Eminency and Perfection. But that which made his Wit and Judgment so considerable, was the largeness and freedom of his Spirit, for truth is plain and easie to a mind dis-intangled from Superstition and Prejudice; He was one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a sort of brave Philosophers that <hi>Laertius</hi> speaks of, that did not addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to any particular Sect, but ingeniously sought for Truth among all the wrangling Schools; and they found her miserably torn and rent to pieces, and parcell'd into Rags, by the several contending Parties, and so disfigur'd and mishapen, that it was hard to know her; but they made a shift to gather up her scatter'd Limbs, which as soon as they came together, by a strange sympathy and connaturalness, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently united into a lovely and beautiful body. This was the Spirit of this Great Man; he weighed mens Reasons, and not their Names, and was not scared with the ugly Vizars men usually put upon Persons they hate, and Opinions they dislike; nor affrighted with the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's and Execrations of an infallible Chair, which he look'd upon only as Bug-bears to terrifie weak, and childish minds. He considered
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40276:40"/>
that it is not likely any one Party should wholly engross Truth to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; that Obedience is the only way to true Knowledge; (which is an argument that he has manag'd rarely well, in that excellent Sermon of his, which he calls, <hi>Via Intelligentiae;)</hi> that God alwayes, and only teaches docible and ingenuous minds, that are willing to hear, and ready to obey according to their Light; that it is impossible, a pure, humble, resigned, God-like Soul, should be kept out of Heaven, whatever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes it might be subject to in this state of Mortality; that the design of Heaven is not to fill mens heads, and feed their Curiosities, but to better their Hearts, and mend their Lives. Such Considerations as these, made him impartial in his Disquisitions, and give a due allowance to the Reasons of his Adversary, and contend for Truth, and not for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                  <p>And now you will easily believe that an ordinary Diligence would be able to make great Improvements upon such a Stock of Parts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; but to these advantages of Nature, and excellency of his Spirit, be added an indefatigable Industry, and God gave a plentiful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction: for, there were very few Kinds of Learning, but he was a <hi>Mystes,</hi> and a great Master in them: He was a rare Humanist, and hugely vers'd in all the polite parts of Learning; and had throughly concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the ancient Moralists, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> Poets and Orators; and was not unacquainted with the refined Wits of the later Ages, whether <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Italian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he had not only the Accomplishments of a Gentleman, but so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal were his Parts, that they were proportioned to every thing; and though his Spirit and Humour were made up of Smoothness and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness, yet he could bear with the Harshness and Roughness of the Schools; and was not unseen in their Subtilties and Spinosities; and upon occasion could make them serve his purpose; and yet, I believe, he thought many of them very near a kin to the famous Knight of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> and would make sport sometimes with the Romantick Sophistry, and phantastick Adventures of School-Errantry. His Skill was great, both in the Civil and Canon Law, and Casuistical Divinity; and he was a rare Conductor of Souls, and knew how to Counsel, and to Advise; to solve Difficulties, and determine Cases, and quiet Consciences. And he was no Novice in Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> new Science of <hi>Controversie;</hi> but could manage an Argument, and Reparties with a strange dexterity; He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood what the several Parties in Christendom have to say for themselves, and could plead their Cause to better advantage than any Advocate of their Tribe: and when he had done, he could confute them too; and shew, That better Arguments than ever they could produce for themselves, would afford no sufficient ground for their fond Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                  <p>It would be too great a Task to pursue his Accomplishments through the various Kinds of Literature: I shall content my self to add only his great Acquaintance with the Fathers and Ecclesiastical Writers, and the Doctors of the first and purest Ages both of the Greek and Latin Church; which he has made use of against the Romanists, to vindicate the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> from the Challenge of Innovation, and prove her to be truly Ancient, Catholick, and Apostolical.</p>
                  <p>But Religion and Vertue is the Crown of all other Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it was the Glory of this great man, to be thought a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and whatever you added to it, he look't upon as a term of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40276:41"/>
and yet he was a Zealous Son of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but that was because he judg'd her (and with great reason) a Church the most purely Christian of any in the World. In his younger years he met with some Assaults from Popery; and the high pretensions of their Religious Orders were very accommodate to his Devotional Temper: but he was alwayes so much Master of himself, that he would never be governed by any thing but Reason, and the evidence of Truth, which engag'd him in the study of those Controversies; and to how good purpose, the World is by this time a sufficient Witness: But the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the more he considered, the worse he lik'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Cause, and became at last to censure them with some severity; But I confess I have so great an opinion of his Judgment, and the charitableness of his Spirit, that I am afraid he did not think worse of them than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
                  <p>But Religion is not a matter of Theory and Orthodox Notions; and it is not enough to believe aright, but we must practise accordingly; and to master our passions, and to make a right use of that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and power that God has given us over our own actions, is a greater glory than all other Accomplishments that can adorn the mind of Man; and therefore I shall close my Character of this great Personage with a touch upon some of those Vertues, for which his Memory will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to all <hi>Posterity.</hi> He was a <hi>Person</hi> of great Humility; and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his stupendious Parts, and Learning, and Eminency of Place, he had nothing in him of Pride and Humour, but was Courteous and Affable, and of easie Access, and would lend a ready Ear to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, yea to the impertinencies, of the meanest persons. His Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was coupled with an Extraordinary Piety; and, I believe, he spent the greatest part of his time in Heaven; his solemn hours of <hi>Prayer</hi> took up a considerable portion of his Life; and we are not to doubt, but he had learned of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to pray continually; and that occasional Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and frequent Aspirations and Emigrations of his <hi>Soul</hi> after God, made up the best part of his Devotions. But he was not only a <hi>Good Man</hi> God-ward, but he was come to the top of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s gradation, and to all his other Vertues added a large and diffusive Charity: And, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever compares his plentiful Incomes, with the inconsiderable Estate he left at his Death, will be easily convinc'd that Charity was Steward for a great proportion of his Revenue. But the Hungry that he fed, and the Naked that he cloath'd, and the Distressed that he supply'd, and the Fatherless that he provided for; the poor Children that he put to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, and brought up at School, and maintained at the University, will now sound a Trumpet to that Charity which he dispersed with his right hand, but would not suffer his left hand to have any knowledge of it.</p>
                  <p>To sum up all in a few words; This Great Prelate he had the good Humour of a Gentleman, the Eloquence of an Orator, the Fancy of a Poet, the Acuteness of a School-man, the Profoundness of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, the Wisdom of a Counsellor, the Sagacity of a Prophet, the Reason of an Angel, and the Piety of a Saint: He had Devotion enough for a Cloyster, Learning enough for an University, and Wit enough for a Colledge of <hi>Virtuosi;</hi> and, had his <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Endowments</hi> been parcell'd out among his poor <hi>Clergy</hi> that he left behind him, it would perhaps have made one of the best Dioceses in the World. But alas! <hi>Our Father, our Father! the Horses of our Israel, and the Chariot</hi>

                     <hi>thereof;</hi> he is gone, and has carried his Mantle and his Spirit along with him up to Heaven; and the Sons of the Prophets have lost all their beauty and lustre which they enjoyed only from the reflexion of his Excellencies, which were bright and radiant enough to cast a glory upon a whole Order of Men. But the Sun of this our world after many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to break through the Crust of an earthly Body, is at last swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the great <hi>Vortex</hi> of Eternity, and there all his <hi>Maculae</hi> are scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and dissolved, and he is fixt in an Orb of Glory, and shines among his Brethren-stars, that in their several Ages gave light to the World, and turn'd many Souls unto Righteousness; and we that are left behind, though we can never reach his Perfections, must study to imitate his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that we may at last come to sit at his feet in the Mansions of Glory; which God grant for his infinite mercies in Jesus Christ: To whom, with the Father, through the Eternal Spirit, be ascribed all Honour and Glory, Worship and Thanksgiving, Love and Obedience, now and for evermore. Amen.</p>
